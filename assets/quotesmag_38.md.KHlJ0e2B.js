The band's line-up, unchanged until their breakup, consisted of Bradley Nowell (vocals and guitar), Eric Wilson (bass), and Bud Gaugh (drums). Lou Dog, Nowell's dalmatian, was the mascot of the band. Nowell died of a heroin overdose in 1996, resulting in Sublime's breakup.

Retrieved November 23, 2007. Sublime released three studio albums, one live album, five compilation albums (one of which also contains never-before released material), three EPs, and one box set. Although their first two albums‚Äî40oz. to Freedom (1992) and Robbin' the Hood (1994)‚Äîwere quite popular in the United States, Sublime did not experience major commercial success until 1996 with their self-titled third album, released two months after Nowell's death, which peaked at No. 13 on the Billboard 200, and spawned the single \\"What I Got\\", which remains the band's only No. 1 hit single (on the Billboard Alternative Songs chart) in their musical career. As of 2009, the band has sold over 17 million albums worldwide, including about 10 million in the U.S. alone. Michael \\"Miguel\\" Happoldt and Marshall Goodman \\"Ras MG\\" contributed to several Sublime songs. In 2009, the surviving members attempted to reform the band with Rome Ramirez, a young guitarist and admitted Sublime fan from California.Sublime To Reunite For Cypress Hill's Smokeout Fest . Retrieved September 1, 2009. However, not long after performing at Cypress Hill's Smokeout Festival, a Los Angeles judge banned the new lineup from using the Sublime name as they needed permission from Nowell's estate, which owns the rights to the Sublime name. This prompted the lineup of Wilson, Gaugh and Ramirez to change their name to Sublime with Rome, which has since released three albums, although Gaugh left the group shortly after the release of their 2011 debut Yours Truly. History =Early career (1988‚Äì1991)= Eric Wilson and Bud Gaugh were childhood friends. Having grown up in the same Long Beach neighborhood, Eric's father, Billy Wilson taught Gaugh how to read music and play the drums. Gaugh and Wilson together with future Sublime manager, Michael Happoldt, formed a three-piece punk band called The Juice Bros during their high school years. About this time, Bradley Nowell, who had recently dropped out of University of California, Santa Cruz, joined the band. Nowell helped introduce Gaugh and Wilson (who at the time listened exclusively to punk rock) to reggae and ska. Sublime played its first gig on the 4th of July, 1988 in a small club. Music venues were skeptical of the band's eclectic musical fusion and many refused to book the band. In response, the band created their own music label, Skunk Records, and told venues that they were \\"Skunk Records recording artists\\", which helped the band seem more accomplished and subsequently book more shows. For the next several years, the group focused primarily on playing at parties and small clubs throughout Southern California with local ska bands such as Smokestacks, No Doubt and Skeletones. The trio recorded a few songs and put forth a number of short demos. In February 1990, Nowell adopted an abused dalmatian puppy from a shelter and named him \\"Louie\\" after his grandfather. Louie Nowell, King Louie, or \\"Lou Dog\\" as he was called, became something of a mascot for the band. Lou Dog was often allowed to wander around the stage during the band's concert performances. One of Sublime's early club venues in 1990 was at a downtown club in Long Beach called Toe Jam. This Club was owned and operated by David Rice, James Walker, Jason Burch and Jeff King. A private party was held in February 1991 at Toe Jam for one of the owners. Special thanks can be found for Toe Jam and the owners on the back of the later produced album, 40oz. to Freedom. In late 1990, music student Michael \\"Miguel\\" Happoldt approached the band, offering to let the band record in the studio at the school where Happoldt was studying. The band enthusiastically agreed and trespassed into the school at night, where they recorded from midnight to seven in the morning. The recording session resulted in the popular cassette tape called Jah Won't Pay the Bills, which was released in 1991 and featured songs that would appear on the band's future albums. The tape helped the band gain a grassroots following throughout Southern California. =40oz. to Freedom and Robbin' the Hood (1992‚Äì1995)= Eventually, Sublime developed a large following in California. After concentrating on playing live shows, the band released 40oz. to Freedom in 1992 under Nowell's label, Skunk Records. The record established Sublime's blend of ska, reggae, punk, surf rock, and hip hop, and helped to further strengthen the group's growing California following. Initially being sold exclusively at their live shows, the album became widely known in the greater Los Angeles area after rock radio station KROQ began playing the song, \\"Date Rape\\". By 1996, 40oz. to Freedom had sold more than 209,000 units, beating the future self-titled album's running total of 145,000 unit sales. In 1992/1993, Sublime was briefly signed to Danny Holloway's True Sound imprint. However, the band stayed on Skunk Records and then in June 1994, they were signed to the label Gasoline Alley of MCA Records by Jon Phillips who subsequently became Sublime's manager. Sublime released their second album Robbin' the Hood in 1994, an experimental effort with its diffuse mixture of rock, rap, spoken- word nonsense and folk-leaning acoustic home recordings. Robbin' the Hood was a commercial failure. The band toured extensively throughout 1994-1995, their popularity increasing gradually beyond the West Coast as \\"Date Rape\\" began earning radio play. In 1995, the band co-headlined the inaugural nationwide Vans Warped Tour. The band was eventually asked to leave the tour for a week due to unruly behavior of Sublime guests and Lou Dog biting four different individuals. Gaugh reflected on the experience: \\"Basically, our daily regimen was wake up, drink, drink more, play, and then drink a lot more. We'd call people names. Nobody got our sense of humor. Then we brought the dog out and he bit a few skaters, and that was the last straw.\\" After the Warped Tour and the subsequent Three Ring Circus Tour, the band was pressured to begin producing new studio material as a follow-up to Robbin' the Hood. =Nowell's death, self-titled final album and breakup (1996)= In early 1996, Sublime headlined the very first SnoCore Tour. In February, they began recording what would comprise the band's self-titled third record and their major label debut album. Sublime completed it before Nowell died of a heroin overdose on May 25, 1996 at a motel in San Francisco, California, the day after their last live show in Petaluma, California (May 24, 1996), and two months prior to the release of the self-titled album. Nowell was found dead at 11:30 a.m. in a motel room after a night of partying. He was 28 years old. Some Sublime fans were not aware of Nowell's death when the self-titled album became a huge success, including the single \\"What I Got\\", which peaked at number one on the Modern Rock chart.Erlewine, Stephen Thomas. \\"X-Games, Vol. 2\\". Allmusic: 1997 The album earned the band worldwide fame, and was certified 5x platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in December 1999. In addition to \\"What I Got\\", the album included several other popular posthumous singles, including \\"Santeria\\", \\"Doin' Time\\", \\"Wrong Way\\" and \\"April 29, 1992 (Miami)\\", all of which received heavy airplay. Jason Westfall, one of Sublime's managers, was quoted as saying that \\"the surviving members of Sublime had no interest in continuing to perform and record under the 'Sublime' name. \\"Just like Nirvana, Sublime died when Brad died.\\" =Post-breakup (1997‚Äìpresent)= A number of posthumous releases followed, among them Second-Hand Smoke in 1997 and both Stand by Your Van and Sublime Acoustic: Bradley Nowell & Friends in 1998. Second-Hand Smoke, produced by Michael \\"Miguel\\" Happoldt, is described as an \\"assemblage of leftovers, remixes and rarities\\" that hints at possible musical directions Sublime may have pursued if Nowell had not died. By the release of their Greatest Hits compilation in 1999 the band had released as many albums after Nowell's death as during his lifetime.Erlewine, Stephen Thomas. [ \\"Greatest Hits\\"] (Sublime album). Allmusic: 1999. A box set of demos, rarities and live recordings, entitled Everything Under the Sun, was released on November 14, 2006.Erlewine, Stephen Thomas. [ \\"Everything Under the Sun\\"]. Allmusic: 2006 The band later released several vinyl picture discs including 40 Oz. To Freedom, Second Hand Smoke, and Stand By Your Van. On June 16, 2012, the group reunited to give a show at the D-Tox Rockfest in Montebello, Quebec (under the Sublime with Rome moniker). Nowell's widow, Troy Holmes Nowell, has negotiated with the band's record label and entertainment impresario Paul Ruffino to produce a documentary film about Sublime's successful association with Brad Nowell; the project was delayed until Mr. Nowell's estate could be settled. In October 1997, Troy and singer Courtney Love collaborated with the advocacy group Partnership for a Drug-Free America on a series of public service announcements for television intended to de- glamorize drug use and help disassociate it from the music industry. Following Sublime's dissolution, former members Eric Wilson and Bud Gaugh founded the Long Beach Dub Allstars in 1997, which also included many frequent Sublime contributors such as Michael \\"Miguel\\" Happoldt (former member of The Ziggens), Marshall Goodman \\"Ras MG\\" (former Sublime member), and Todd Forman (3rd Alley). LBDA disbanded in 2002, due to several members of the band breaking a no-drug vow they had taken. Bud Gaugh joined the short-lived Eyes Adrift, a supergroup consisting of Bud on drums, Krist Novoselic (of Nirvana) on bass and Curt Kirkwood (of the Meat Puppets) on guitar and lead vocals. On September 24, 2002, Eyes Adrift released their only album, a self-titled LP consisting of 12 songs. They released one single from the CD, entitled \\"Alaska\\". In 2005, No Doubt bassist Tony Kanal, who had performed with the group, recollected on their career, saying \\"They made a sound that somehow fused rock, reggae, punk and hip-hop in a way that was seamless and credible, bound together by the undeniable soul of Brad Nowell's voice.\\" He was joined by other members of bands that had performed with Sublime, such as Pennywise, punk progenitor Mike Watt, Philadelphia neo-bluesman G Love, California beachcomber Jack Johnson, Latin-rock eclecticists Ozomatli and progressive hip-hop figures Michael Franti and Gift of Gab on \\"Look at All the Love We Found: A Tribute to Sublime,\\" to donate money to help support artists with substance abuse problems. On June 5, 2013, it was announced that Sublime would be celebrating the 25th anniversary of their first show (which happened on July 4, 1988) with the release of their first live album/concert film. The album, titled 3 Ring Circus - Live at The Palace, features footage recorded at a 1995 show in Hollywood and was released on June 18, 2013. The deluxe version features extras including a poster, backstage pass and a separate concert film of the band's performance recorded in 1995 at the Las Palmas Theatre.\\"Sublime Celebrates 25th Anniversary In 2013 With Live CD/DVD\\" 987fm.com. 2013-06-05. Retrieved 2013-06-06. In March, 2017, for the 25th anniversary of their seminal debut album ‚Äú40oz. to Freedom.‚Äù the group announced that they teamed up with AleSmith Brewing Company to release a Mexican-style lager initially dubbed \\"40oz. to Freedom.\\". A limited edition of the batch of beer was bottled in 40-ounce containers and sold through the San Diego brewery. The entire run of 40-ounce bottles sold out in five minutes. The cans, which feature Sublime‚Äôs trademark sun design created by artist Opie Ortiz, were headed toward 19 states as of September 14, 2017. AleSmith was on pace to ship 3,400 barrels of the beer (renamed to Sublime Mexican Lager) by Dec. 31, which is 8.5% of AleSmith‚Äôs 40,000 barrels of total production for 2017. On June 25, 2019, The New York Times Magazine listed Sublime among hundreds of artists whose material was reportedly destroyed in the 2008 Universal fire. Musical style and influences Sublime was one of the most popular bands of the third wave of ska, specifically characterized as ska punk. Sublime often combined punk rock and hardcore punk with hip hop, heavy metal, dancehall, reggae, ska, funk, and (21st century) surf music. Sublime also has been described as reggae rock. Bob Marley and associated Jamaican reggae acts The Wailers, and Peter Tosh feature prominently in Sublime's songs, as do other Jamaican reggae and dancehall acts such as Born Jamericans, Toots & the Maytals, The Melodians, Wayne Smith, Tenor Saw, Frankie Paul, The Wailing Souls, Barrington Levy, Half Pint and Yellowman. The band additionally covered \\"Smoke Two Joints\\" originally by Oregon-based reggae group The Toyes. Sublime was also heavily influenced by the 1980s and 1990s hip-hop and rap scene of Los Angeles and New York City, alluding to or borrowing from such acts as N.W.A and Eazy-E (who died 14 months before Nowell), Beastie Boys, Just-Ice, Public Enemy and Flavor Flav, KRS-One, Doug E. Fresh, Too $hort, Mobb Deep, as well as the Philadelphia-based rapper Steady B and Texas hip-hop The Geto Boys. The southern California metal, surf rock and punk scene influencing Sublime includes Big Drill Car (who were thanked in the first two albums), The Ziggens, Minutemen, Descendents, Bad Religion, The Bel-Airs, Butthole Surfers, Secret Hate, as well as new wave/fusion band Fishbone. Sublime was also influenced by Washington, DC hardcore acts such as Minor Threat, Fugazi (who were also thanked in the first album) and Bad Brains. The band also referenced popular California-based rock bands and artists like Grateful Dead, The Doors, Jimi Hendrix, Red Hot Chili Peppers, sixties underground and counter-culture icon, Frank Zappa, and even Swedish pop band ABBA. A few references are made to funk, R&B;, and soul artists and bands such as James Brown, the Ohio Players, Aswad, as well as a smattering of Irish, Scottish and English bands like Boomtown Rats, the ska band The Specials, and Primal Scream. Sublime's music was highlighted by bass-driven grooves, reggae rhythms, elaborately cadenced rhyme schemes and transitions between paces and styles throughout a given song, sometimes alternating between thrash punk, ska and reggae within the same song (see \\"Seed\\"). Their music often contains psychedelic, harmonic minor-based or bluesy guitar solos, rhythmically improvised bass solos or dub- lines, turntable scratching and rolling drum transitions and heavy bass lines. They are known for being one of the first and most influential reggae fusion musicians. Impact and legacy With the mainstream success of their self- titled album, going 5x platinum and earning worldwide airplay, Sublime's impact persists to this day. Their signature sound and their songs are often associated with the beach/coastal areas of Southern California, such as San Diego, Orange County, Venice Beach and Long Beach as well as areas of Northern California like Eureka. Over two decades after Nowell's death and the band's breakup, Sublime remains immensely popular throughout North America, especially in its state of origin, California. Its songs have been featured via soundtrack in a variety of media. Los Angeles alternative rock radio station KROQ has listed Sublime at No. 3 in their annual \\"Top 106.7 biggest KROQ bands of all time\\" list for the past six years in a row, behind Red Hot Chili Peppers and Nirvana, and No. 81 at the \\"Top 166 Artists of 1980-2008\\" list. With over 17 million units sold worldwide, Sublime is one of the most successful, and 'powerfully moving' ska-punk acts of all time influencing many modern reggae and ska acts.

His scientific efforts included work on phosphorescence, fluorescence, and (tidal) gravitation. Tomaschek was a supporter of deutsche Physik, which resulted in his suspension from his university posts after World War II. From 1948 to 1954, he worked in England for the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company (AIOC). In 1954, when AIOC became BP, he went to Germany and was president of the Permanent Tidal Commission. Education From 1913 to 1918, Tomaschek studied at the Deutsche Universit√§t Prag. He earned his doctorate in the early 1920s under Philipp Lenard, at the Ruprecht-Karls-Universit√§t Heidelberg, and then became Lenard‚Äôs assistant. He completed his Habilitation under Lenard in 1924.Hentschel and Hentschel, 1996, Appendix F; see the entry for Tomaschek.Mehra and Rechenberg, Volume 5, Part 2, 455 and 456n131. Career From 1921, he conducted several aether drift experiments, repetitions of the Michelson‚ÄìMorley experiment and the Trouton‚ÄìNoble experiment, whose negative outcome further supported Albert Einstein's special relativity ‚Äì although Tomaschek was a critic of that theory. In November 1926, Tomaschek went to the Technische Hochschule M√ºnchen (today, the Technical University of Munich) and then to Philipps-Universit√§t Marburg, where he was appointed ausserordentlicher Professor (extraordinarius professor) for experimental physics, in late 1927. From 1934, Tomaschek was the director of the physics department at the Technische Hochschule Dresden (today, TU Dresden). From 1939 to 1945, Tomaschek was an ordentlicher Professor (ordinarius professor) and director of the physics department at the Technische Hochschule M√ºnchen.Mehra and Rechenberg, Volume 5, Part 2, 456n131. Tomaschek was a supporter of deutsche Physik. The deutsche Physik movement was anti-Semitic and anti- theoretical physics. As applied in the university environment, political factors took priority over the historically applied concept of scholarly ability,Beyerchen, 1997, 141-167. even though its two most prominent supporters were the Nobel Laureates in Physics Philipp Lenard Beyerchen, 1977, 79-102. and Johannes Stark.Beyerchen, 1977, 103-140. When Adolf Hitler became Chancellor of Germany on 30 January 1933, the concept and movement took on more favor and more fervor. Supporters of deutsche Physik launched vicious attacks against leading theoretical physicists, including Arnold Sommerfeld and Werner Heisenberg. It was in the summer of 1940 that Finkelnburg became an acting director of the Nationalsozialistischer Deutscher Dozentenbund (NSDDB, National Socialist German University Lecturers League) at the Technische Hochschule DarmstadtHentschel, 1996, 290 and Appendix F (see the entry for Finkelnburg). (today, Technische Universit√§t Darmstadt). As such, he organized the M√ºnchner Religionsgespr√§che, which took place on November 15, 1940. The event was an offensive against the deutsche Physik movement. Finkelnburg invited five representatives to make arguments for theoretical physics and academic decisions based on ability, rather than politics: Carl Friedrich von Weizs√§cker, Otto Scherzer, Georg Joos, Otto Heckmann, and Hans Kopfermann. Alfons B√ºhl, a supporter of deutsche Physik, invited Harald Volkmann, Bruno Th√ºring, Wilhelm M√ºller, Rudolf Tomaschek, and Ludwig Wesch. The discussion was led by Gustav Borer, with Herbert Stuart and Johannes Malsch as observers.Document 110: The Fight against Party Politics by Wolfgang Finkelnburg printed in Hentschel, 1996, 339-345. Also see Beyerchen, 1977, 176-179. While the technical outcome of the event may have been thin, it was a political victory against deutsche Physik and signaled the decline of the influence of the movement within the German Reich.Beyerchen, 1977, 176-179. In 1945, the Allied occupation authority in Germany suspended Tomaschek from his positions at the Technische Hochschule M√ºnchen; he was succeeded by Georg Joos in September 1946. From 1948 to 1954, Tomaschek was employed at the Anglo- Iranian Oil Company (AIOC)'s Kirklington Hall Research Station, near Newark, England; AIOC became British Petroleum in 1954. From 1954, he went to Breitbrunn am Chiemsee, in Bavaria, where he continued his research activities; there he was President of the Permanenten Gezeitenkommission (Permanent Tidal Commission).R.

It is in the civil parish of St Michael.  History  It is believed by historians that the area around Potters Crouch was originally a part of the Roman Britain town of Verulamium following evidence of 1st century AD Roman debris being found in the area. The name of Potters Crouch is believed to have originated in the 13th century as the home of a potter working in the area. It is speculated that this potter was Richard Le Pottere, who was succeeded by his son William Pottere in the trade. In 1344, it was referred to as Le Pottercrouch. The village was originally owned by the Earls of Verulam until 1931 when it was handed over to The Crown and managed as part of The Crown Estates. Since 1977, Potters Crouch and its surrounding area was formally designated a conservation area by St Albans City and District council. The village is served by the M1 motorway. In 2012, it was revealed that Potters Crouch had a problem with water pressure following a fire in the same year whereby the Hertfordshire Fire and Rescue Service required use of the local water supply, which led to a lower quality of water services provided to local houses.  Pub  Potters Crouch has a pub, the Holly Bush, which was constructed in the 17th century. It became a grade II listed building in 1981. The pub has been featured in the Good Pub Guide several times as well as in other pub guides, which have also promoted visiting Potters Crouch.

Early life Ziolkowski was born September 6, 1908, in Boston to Polish parents. Orphaned at the age of one when both his parents died in a boating accident, he grew up in a series of foster homes, and was raised by an Irish boxer. Although he never received any formal art training, his gifts as a sculptor began to show at an early age. After putting himself through Rindge Technical School, he became an apprentice to a Boston ship maker. He began to carve wood and by the age of 20 had become an accomplished furniture maker. His first marble sculpture, made in 1932, honored Judge Frederick Pickering Cabot, who had inspired him as a child growing up in the rough neighborhoods of Boston. Ziolkowski moved to New Britain, Connecticut, to begin life as a professional artist. He began to sell commissioned sculptures throughout New England and New York. In 1939, Ziolkowski was hired as a sculptor's assistant by Gutzon Borglum on his Mount Rushmore project. According to Lincoln Borglum, Gutzon's son, he was unhappy, having expected to be made the primary assistant. Instead, Lincoln was the primary assistant, and when Ziolkowski argued about his orders, Borglum fired him by telegram. A fistfight between Lincoln and Ziolkowski had to be broken up. His sculpture of Ignacy Jan Paderewski won first prize at the 1939 New York World's Fair. The resulting fame, as well as his familiarity with the Black Hills, prompted several Lakota Chiefs, including a Lakota elder named Henry Standing Bear, to write to him about a monument honoring Crazy Horse. Chief Henry Standing Bear of the Lakota wrote him, saying, \\"My fellow chiefs and I would like the white man to know the red man has great heroes, too.\\" Ziolkowski met with the leaders shortly afterward and began planning a monument. Over the next few years, he conducted research and began planning the sculpture. He also met Ruth Ross, a young art enthusiast, who would later become his second wife. He put the project on hold when the United States entered World War II. He volunteered for service and joined the United States Army on May 17, 1943. He was wounded in 1944 at Omaha Beach in Normandy. He was discharged as a sergeant on November 5, 1945. In 1947 Ziolkowski moved to the Black Hills and began to search for a suitable mountain for his sculpture. He thought the Wyoming Tetons would be the best choice, where the rock would be better for carving, but the Lakota wanted the memorial in the sacred Black Hills on a -high mountain. The monument was expected to be the largest sculpture in the world. When completed, it would be high by long. Crazy Horse's head would be large enough to contain all the -high heads of the Presidents at Mount Rushmore. On June 3, 1948, the first blast was made, and the memorial was dedicated to the Native American people. In 1950, Ziolkowski met Ruth Ross, 18 years his junior, who was a volunteer at the monument. She became Ziolkowski's second wife that year. Work continued slowly, since he refused to accept government grants. Instead, as he personally stated on a guest appearance on the TV show \\"To Tell the Truth\\", he raised money for the project by charging seventy-five cents admission to the monument work area. Last years and death Zi√≥≈Çkowski in the Black Hills Ziolkowski continued his work until he died of acute pancreatitis at age 74 at the monument site in 1982. He was buried in an impressive tomb that he had built, with a huge steel plate on which he cut the following words, \\"Korczak; Storyteller in Stone; May His Remains; Be Left Unknown\\" at the base of the mountain. After his death, his widow, Ruth Ziolkowski, took over the project as director of the Crazy Horse Memorial Foundation. Ruth Ziolkowski died May 21, 2014, aged 87.Ruth Ziolkowski-obitury All ten of their children and two of their grandchildren have continued the carving of the monument or are active in the Crazy Horse Memorial Foundation. The rocks that are blasted away are placed in a rock crusher and used for the roads at the complex.

He has won several awards for his reporting and was part of a team of New York Times reporters who won the 2013 Pulitzer Prize for Explanatory Reporting for a series of 10 articles about the business practices of Apple and other technology companies. Education Bradsher has a public policy master's degree in economics from Princeton University and received his bachelor's degree with highest honors in economics as a Morehead Scholar at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. He also attended Hong Kong International School for 4 years. Career Bradsher joined the Times in 1989. Before his Asian assignment, he was the newspaper's Detroit bureau chief for nearly six years, a Washington D.C. correspondent covering international trade and then the Federal Reserve for five years, and a reporter in New York covering the airline and telecommunications industries for two years. He is known for numerous articles, starting in 1997, about the consequences of crashes between sport utility vehicles (SUVs) and other vehicles - including extra damage, injuries, and deaths. He cited statistical evidence that high- riding SUVs may contribute greater force to smaller vehicles and their occupants when hit, with the extra damage being caused by the vehicles' height and design and not just their greater weight. The articles led to the development by automakers of a variety of measures, including hollow, impact- absorbing steel bars below and behind SUV bumpers that Ford Motor Company nicknamed \\"Bradsher Bars.\\" A 2011 study by the insurance industry found that the redesigns had sharply reduced the death rate in cars hit by SUVs and pickup trucks. Bradsher is also known for writing extensively in 2009 and 2010 that China was passing the West in the production of wind turbines and solar panels, and for his coverage in November and December, 2013, of the aftermath of Typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines. Awards Bradsher shared the Pulitzer Prize for Explanatory Reporting in 2013 with other New York Times reporters for their work the preceding year on Apple's business practices in a changing global economy. Bradsher won the George Polk Award for national reporting on his coverage of sport utility vehicles (SUVs) during 1997 and was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize the same year. Later, he published a book on SUVs called High and Mighty which won the New York Public Library Helen Bernstein Award. He won the Society of Publishers in Asia (SOPA) award for coverage of avian flu in the area.

However, Yadkin said in its third-quarter 2016 report that the merging of NewBridge and Yadkin systems, delayed from September, would not take place because Yadkin was purchased by FNB Corporation; Newbridge Bank locations rebranded and integrated into FNB Corporation along with existing Yadkin locations.

In terms of education, Chisungo has produced a significant number of students enrolled in tertiary institutions like UZ, MSU, GZU, and NUST. Recent developments are also witnessed in terms of rural electrification. Schools like Chisungo and Gangare primary have been electrified so that students will catch up with recent technologies. The area also has a well established clinic which has many facilities. People from nearby communities have to walk several kilometres to access health at that clinic. Food security The community is under threat from food insecurity mainly attributed to climate change. Since 2000, the area has suffered many consequences of severe drought, but that of 2015-6 (El Nino-induced) was the worst. The drought caused a loss of livestock for many households. Some rural livelihoods have been undermined like small scale gardening, fishing due to drying up of rivers and important water sources like Gute in Mudyiwa Village. Victims of the droughts received relief aid from intergovernmental organisations like Care and Plan International.

With about 30,000 student members it is one of the largest student unions in the UK, and hosts a wide array of events and offers services to all students. Executive Officers The UPSU Executive Officers or 'Sabbatical Officers' are elected in March and decide the day-to-day running of the union. The Sabbatical Team consists of six full-time officers who have recently graduated as students from the University. Each has their own remit and they also provide academic and national representation for Plymouth students. President = Alex Doyle Vice Presidents = Ben Morries; Bitty Walter Inyang; Charlotte Panchaud; Maja Smith; Tilda Fraser; Union Executive Committee (UEC) & student forums The Union Executive Committee, formerly student Parliament, is made up of 15 elected Forum Chairs and the 6 elected Executive Officers, and is also attended by the Chief Executive and staff support members. The Chair of the Accountability Board also attends these meetings, to observe and ensure that they are taking place in a fair and democratic manner. The UEC is in place to make important decisions that effect the student body and ensure that the wide diversity of the student body is fairly represented in these decisions. =Student Forums= As well as sitting on Each of the 15 elected forum chairs also runs their own forum All of the Forums are open for anyone to go along to and take part in discussions, however there are 4 \\"Liberation Forums\\", that you would need to identify as a member of that group to vote in Forum decisions. the accountability forum however is only open to elected members, its job is to hold, all members of UEC to account. List of UPSU student Forums: Environment & Sustainability; Faith & Belief Forum; Global Students; Mature Students; Postgraduate; Societies; Sports; Welfare; Partner Institutions; LGBT; Women's; Volunteering; Accountability; Facilities The student union was refurbished in summer 2014. The main union building is mostly underground; its top bar is known as burst bar serving smoothies, juices and teas adjacent to this is the 'Zig-Zag' bar . at the top of the SU is the lounge selling Costa coffee and sandwiches; below this is 'Illusion' which has a dance floor and pool tables, and is sometimes used for private events. Down from 'Illusion' is the main bar, known as 'Sub:Lime' which is where most of the union's events take place: it has a dance floor with DJ booth and projectors. In 2010 the union's bar won first place in the National Union of Students' Best Bar None competition, which assesses how bars manage student safety. Attached to the main building on the first floor is an advice centre, open weekdays between 10am and 3pm. It offers to UPSU members a range of free and confidential advice, including financial and academic advice. The union has two shops on campus, U:Shop, opposite the library, sells goods such as milk and snacks, while on the over side, by the library entrance, is Chunk the pasty outlet The student union also has an accommodation service, located inside it opposite the hive. Societies and sports clubs The union supports societies and sports clubs, which are by an elected committee from the clubs' membership. Any student can set up a society. Sports teams are supported by the union and the university and represent the university.

Telephone service for inmates allows for their rehabilitation by allowing consistent communication with their family and legal counsel while incarcerated. In the United States, prison telecom is a $1.2 billion industry, mostly controlled by two private equity-backed companies‚ÄîGlobal Tel Link (GTL) with a 50% market share as of 2015. and Securus Technologies, with 20%. The prison telecom industry has come under scrutiny due to the nature of their business model, as high commissions paid by providers as part of exclusive contracts with individual facilities are passed down to consumers through service rates significantly higher than standard phone service. While there have been attempts by the United States' telecom regulator, the FCC, to regulate the costs of inmate telephone services, the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit ruled that its policy violated the Telecommunications Act, which forbids the FCC from regulating intrastate communications. Operation In order to use an inmate telephone service, inmates must register and provide a list of names and numbers for the people they intend to communicate with. Call limitations vary depending on the prison's house rule, but calls are typically limited to 15 minutes each, and inmates must wait thirty minutes before being allowed to make another call. Calls are recorded and monitored by the prison's staff. Phone credits are typically accessed via an inmate account card. Since 2001, the Federal Bureau of Prisons has required that use be limited to 300 minutes per-month.  Providers  In the United States, the inmate telephone market is dominated by two providers, Global Tel Link (GTL) and Securus Technologies, with Global Tel-Link controlling approximately 50% of the market and Securus with 20%. The New York-based private equity firm, Veritas Capital, with assets of over five billion, acquired GTL under the tenure of Veritas' founder and CEO Robert B. McKeon. Mobile, Alabama-based GTL was a subsidiary of GTEL Holdings in 2009 and offered \\"inmate communications, investigative, facility management, visitation, payment and deposit, and content solutions\\". New York-based American Securities purchased GTL for $1 billion in 2011, and Boston-based ABRY Partners purchased Securus in 2013 for $640 million. > When the global private-equity company Castle Harlan purchased Securus Technologies from Miami-based private equity company, H.I.G. Capital in 2011, they claimed that Securus was \\"the leading provider\\" of \\"inmate telecommunications for the corrections industry\\". Richard A. Smith was CEO of Securus at the time Service rates Before the 1990s, in the United States, service rates for phone calls within jails were similar to those available to the general public through commercial providers. Since then jail phone service providers began to charge higher rates for the phone services than traditional home phone service. Illinois congressman Bobby L. Rush introduced \\"The Family Telephone Connection Protection Act of 2007\\" that began the discussion of rate regulation for inmate telephone calls.Congressman Bobby L. Rush: \\"HR 555 The Family Telephone Connection Protection Act of 2007\\", 110th Congress of the United States of America, 2007 This Bill brought about the defining of the actual costs of telephone services from jails and it was hoped would result in a standardization of rates among inmate telephone providers in 2009 or 2010. One of the reasons for the significantly higher telephone rates stems from that facilities enter into exclusive concession contracts with a specific company to provide inmate calling services for all their inmates, typically favoring the provider that can provide larger commissions to the facility via their service fees. A Congressional Research Service 2010 report cited concerns expressed by Citizens United for the Rehabilitation of Errants (CURE), that \\"telephone providers often pay prison operators a high percentage of the fees they collect for prisoners‚Äô collect calls, and then charge inmates well-above general market rates for service...with commissions on telephone service... as high as 45- 65% of gross revenues generated by the service.\\" Federal officials and States had become \\"dependent on a small group of companies\\" and the rise of a \\"prison-industrial complex\\" is \\"dependent on government funds\\" and has a \\"vested interest in the continuation or expansion of the prison system.\\" The National Sheriffs Association claim that the contractual arrangements with service providers \\"ensure security and allow them to monitor inmate phone calls\\" and that \\"changing the rules could endanger public safety\\". Bloomberg Businessweek reported in 2014, that exorbitant rates are typically meant to compensate for the high commissions paid to the facilities the provider serves. These practices have been frequently criticized by the families of inmates, who feel that these providers had exploited their personal situations in order to turn a profit. Corrections facilities and law enforcement agencies typically resisted attempts to lower these fees, arguing that they provide additional funding to support a facility's operations, such as security. On August 9, 2013, the Federal Communications Commission adopted a report on the high cost of inmate calling services, with proposed reforms. A 2013 FCC analysis, described how, in some cases, long-distance calls are charged six times the rate on the outside, or in other instances, a fifteen-minute call could cost upwards of $15. Acting Chairwoman Clyburn and Jessica RosenworcelAjit Pai dissented and issued statements about their dissent. It also reported that phone rates had \\"caused inmates and their friends and families to subsidize everything from inmate welfare to salaries and benefits, states‚Äô general revenue funds and personnel training\\". At that time the FCC proposed capping the charge for interstate inmate phone calls at $3.75 for 15 minutes. The proposal was approved in 2014; a cap was also implemented to reduce the high long-distance charges that inmates incurred to eleven cents per minute, so that a fifteen- minute call should not cost more than $4. According to the FCC, Global Tel- Link had been charging as much as $17.30 for such calls under contracts with facilities in Arkansas, Georgia and Minnesota, which resulted in \\"unreasonably high\\" phone bills for inmates' families. In retaliation for the change, service providers raised the rates on local calls. In 2015, the FCC imposed new caps of 11¬¢ to 22¬¢ on all inmate calls. The decision was criticized by the industry, who felt that the capped prices would be insufficient to cover the commissions they must pay. By March, the new caps had been stayed pending the result of a lawsuit against the FCC filed by providers, but the FCC stated that it would enforce the existing caps on intrastate calls as well. In September 2015, Human Rights Watch requested that Michael Fisch, CEO of American Securities, the private equity group that owned GTL, step down from their board of directors as \\"GTL's exploitation of the ability of prisoners to communicate with their families and children is the antithesis of upholding human dignity and advancing human rights, and is in direct conflict with Human Rights Watch‚Äôs mission.\\" Private Prison Phone Company Rates per Month. Data from: Prison Call Deals In November 2016, the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit granted a stay, requested by Securus, to block a proposed compromise by the FCC to set the rate cap to 13¬¢ to 31¬¢ per-minute on inter and intrastate calls. In the wake of the stay, Ajit Pai criticized Democrats for appealing and the courts for intervening on ICS rate regulations. The two ICS providers, GTL and CenturyLink, asked for a delay in another FCC hearing in Washington, that was set for February 6, 2017. By January 19, 2017, the D.C. Circuit still refused to pause the FCC challenge to reform inmate calling rates. Commissioners Ajit Pai, Mignon Clyburn, and Jessica Rosenworcel, who were on the August 2013 Commission when the reform report was adopted, had dissented in 2013, and were likely to find for GTL and CenturyLink. Upon the start of the Trump administration, both Rosenworcel and Pai were nominated to the FCC. In his first week as chairman, Pai began to roll back, or declare his intent to roll back, a number of pro-consumer policies implemented by the FCC during the Obama administration (such as Net neutrality). As a result, Pai instructed the FCC's lawyers to cease defending the commission's actions in court. On June 13, 2017, the Appeals Court ruled in favor of Global Tel Link, arguing that the FCC's attempt to regulate the pricing of intrastate prison calls exceeded its authority under the Telecommunications Act of 1996, which forbids the FCC from regulating intrastate communications. In June 2019, Sen. Tammy Duckworth introduced the Martha Wright-Reed Just and Reasonable Communications Act, which would once again authorize the FCC to regulate prison phones and cap the rate of calls made from state and local prisons.

Family  His parents were the late Elder and Mrs. Simuel Thomas Sr. He was the seventh of seven children. He was married to Charletta C. Thomas, and they had six children, Ted Jr., Christopher, Marc, Charles, Jonathan, and Reuben, and several grandchildren.  COGIC Clergyman  Licensed to preach in 1959, Ted Thomas Sr. served the Church of God in Christ in varying capacities as a minister of music, pastor of several COGIC churches in Virginia, a State Sunday School Superintendent, a District Superintendent, and an Administrative Assistant to Bishop David C. Love before being elevated to Jurisdictional Prelate of the Virginia First Jurisdiction in 1984. After his consecration as a bishop, Thomas was elected to be the Secretary of the Board of Bishops, COGIC; a position which he held for 20 years. In addition to heading \\"VA#1\\", Bishop Thomas served as pastor of New Community Temple COGIC1 (the headquarters church) in Portsmouth and St. Stephen's COGIC in Virginia Beach. Since Thomas became jurisdictional prelate the jurisdiction has expanded from seventeen churches in 1984 to more than 50 , extending from Manassas, VA in the north,2 to South Hampton Roads in the south,3 and Roanoke, VA in the west.4 In 2008, Bishop Thomas was appointed to the Judiciary Board of the Church of God in Christ by Bishop Charles Blake. In 2012, Bishop Thomas announced his campaign to run for the General Board of the Church of God in Christ. Bishop Thomas announces campaign for General Board He was officially elected to the General Board on November 12, 2012. He served on the General Board for 8 years until his death in 2020. Bishop Thomas died on June 24, 2020 at the age of 84.  Bishop Thomas and New Community Temple COGIC  In 1967, Elder J. L. Clifton (New Community's founder and his father-in-law) relocated to Salisbury, Maryland. Elder Ted Thomas Sr. was appointed by Bishop David C. Love to lead the fledgling congregation. The membership grew, necessitating the construction of an additional wing to the modest sanctuary. With a limited operating budget, Elder Thomas oversaw and participated in the construction. Following his appointment to the bishopric in 1984 and the designation of New Community Temple COGIC as the Jurisdictional Headquarters, another wing was added to the sanctuary; again, overseeing and participating in construction. The jurisdiction further grew under Bishop Thomas' leadership necessitating a third addition to the Jurisdictional Headquarters. By 2002, the Jurisdiction had long outgrown the New Community Temple sanctuary, and, as recourse, held its Holy Convocations in one of the nearby public school auditoriums. In 2002, Bishop Thomas began plans for a new edifice to house the Historic First Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction of Virginia which would be called New Community Temple COGIC and Christian Center. He built the Christian Center first, tore down the original church facility, and erected the Temple as it stands today in the Churchland borough of Portsmouth, Virginia. New Community Temple COGIC  Education  Bishop Thomas was a graduate of Norfolk State University, with a Bachelor of Science degree in Mathematics; Hampton University, Master of Science degree in Mathematics; and Trinity Hall College, with a Doctor of Divinity Degree. He completed further studies at Moody Bible Institute, Chicago, Illinois; Old Dominion University, Norfolk, Virginia; University of Virginia, Charlottesville, Virginia; Virginia Polytechnic University, Blacksburg, Virginia; College of William & Mary, Williamsburg, Virginia.  Secular career Thomas retired from a career with Norfolk Public Schools, where he was a mathematics teacher and eventually a school administrator. He also served on the Advisory Board of the Bank of the Commonwealth in Virginia5 and was co-proprietor of the Carver Memorial Cemetery in Suffolk, VA.

Electric parts were based on JNR 415 series, while the carbody was based on the JR 103 series cars.  Formation  The Class 1000 cars were arranged in 10-car trains. All trains use 6 motor (M) cars and 4 trailer (T) cars in a TC-M-M'-T-M-M'-T-M-M'-TC formation. Details of the car types are listed below: *10XX - Tc (trailer driving car) *12XX - M (air compressor, battery, main resistor and controller) *13XX - M' (transformer, SIV, pantograph) *18XX - T (trailer car) *14XX - M *15XX - M' *19XX - T *16XX - M *17XX - M' *11XX - Tc An M-M' car pair was numbered 12XX-13XX, 14XX-15XX, or 16XX-17XX, respectively, and there could be multiple trains with the same first 2 digits (such as two 16XX-17XX pairs). Additionally, trailer cars (such as two 19XXs instead of a 18XX/19XX pair) have been irregularly placed as well. The final formation of two trains, trains 1-60~1-61, was a TC-M-M'-M-M'-M-M'-M-M'-TC formation (four pairs of M-M' car pairs with no trailer car pairs) that allowed for a slightly faster acceleration. = Older Formations = When Seoul Subway Line 1 first opened, the Class 1000 cars were arranged in six-car trains, and were expanded to eight-car trains between 1980-1981 before being expanded to 10 cars by the 1990s. A six-car formation was as following (where YY is one integer greater than XX): *10XX - Tc (trailer driving car) *13XX - M (air compressor, battery, main resistor and controller) *16XX - M' (transformer, SIV, pantograph) *13YY - M *16YY - M' *10YY - Tc An eight-car formation was as following (where YY is one integer greater than XX, and ZZ is one integer greater than YY): *10XX or 11XX - Tc (trailer driving car) *13XX or 14XX - M (air compressor, battery, main resistor and controller) *16XX or 17XX - M' (transformer, SIV, pantograph) *13YY or 14YY - M *16YY or 17YY - M' *13ZZ or 14ZZ - M *16ZZ or 17ZZ - M' *10ZZ or 11ZZ - Tc  Models  = First Generation = First batch car 1115 preserved at the Korean Railroad Museum. Trains 1-01~1-41 were 1st generation trains and were introduced from 1974 to 1979. Their general appearance was similar to Japanese EMUs built around their time; the earliest cars were even assembled by various Japanese railcar manufacturers. All other cars were built by Korean companies including Daewoo Heavy Industries under license. All trains were assigned to Guro Depot and had the old Korean National Railroad (KNR) livery up to their retirement. The cars were nicknamed the initial rheostat cars (Ï¥àÏ†ÄÌï≠). The first generation of Seoul Metro 1000-series trains are identical to these trains, and other Seoul Metro trains had their designs derived from these trains.  Batch 1  The first batch of 1st generation trains consisted of 126 cars that were originally linked as 21 six-car trains. The cars were manufactured in 1974 under Kawasaki Heavy Industries, Kinki Sharyo, Tokyu Car Corporation (now JTEC), and Nippon Sharyo. As ridership increased on Line 1, the trains were rearranged into eight-car trains in the 1980s. As this rearrangement occurred, seven of the trains lost their four motor cars, which were given to the other 14 cars. In place, 42 motor cars were manufactured in Korea between 1980 and 1981 for the seven donor trains. Finally, the trains were extended to ten cars from 1984 to 1985 with two unpowered cars each manufactured in Korea during that time. In the 1990s, the trains received their current numbers. The 14 trains that utilized eight Japanese-made cars were numbered as trains 1-01~1-14, while the seven that lost their original motor cars were renumbered to 1-29~1-35. The train that became train 1-02 was involved in an accident at the Hankuk University of Foreign Studies station on October 2, 1984, that led to two damaged cars (a driving car and a motor car) being scrapped and the rest of the train being placed out of service. The train that became train 1-14 experienced a similar accident at Incheon station and received the driving car that survived from the 1984 accident to replace the one driving car that was heavily damaged. In turn, the two driving cars in the out-of-service train were eventually replaced by second batch driving cars, and the motor car was replaced by a new car built in 1986. The trains were replaced by the Class 311000 trains. They were retired between 1998 and 1999, except for train 1-02, which was kept in service until June 2004. After trains 1-29~1-35 were retired, their motor cars were linked with other trains until 2006, and their unpowered cars (1829-1835 and 1929-1935) were rebuilt into driving cars by Rotem in 2002 and received new front ends. They were renumbered to cars 1088-1094 and 1188-1194 and were linked with newer first generation cars. The cars were replaced with 3rd generation Class 311000 trains and taken out of service in 2006 when they finally reached their 25-year lifespans, and were stored at the Byeongjeom Car Depot until 2011, when they were finally taken off property to be scrapped or repurposed.  Batch 2  The second batch of 1st generation trains consisted of 126 cars that were originally linked as 21 six-car trains. The cars were manufactured from 1976 to 1979 under Daewoo Heavy Industries. As ridership increased on Line 1, the trains were rearranged into eight-car trains in the 1980s. As this rearrangement occurred, seven of the trains lost their four motor cars, which were given to the other 14 cars. In place, 26 motor cars were manufactured in Korea between 1980 and 1981 for four of the seven donor trains; one received only two motor cars and ran as a four-car train on the Yongsan-Seongbuk shuttle line, and the other two (four driving cars) were held out of service. From 1984 to 1986, the 18 eight-car trains were extended to ten cars, the four-car train was extended to eight cars, a new four-car train was formed, and the remaining two driving cars were donated to the train that would become train 1-02. Finally, in 1989, the two eight-car trains and the four-car train were extended to ten cars with second generation cars built then. In the 1990s, the trains received their current numbers. The 14 trains that utilized eight original cars were numbered as trains 1-15~1-28, while the remaining six that lost their original motor cars were renumbered to 1-36~1-41. The trains were replaced by the Class 311000 trains. They were gradually retired between 2000 and 2004; the last trains, trains 1-26~1-28 and 1-41, were retired in June 2004. However, due to their less advanced age, the powered cars in trains 1-36~1-41 and all unpowered cars were saved from retirement and linked with other trains until at least 2006. Many of the cars built from 1984 to 1986 were even refurbished in 2006-2007 and were not retired until September 2014, when the final unpowered cars in 2nd generation train 1-55 were retired with the rest of train 1-55, marking the end of service life of the first generation trains. = Second Generation = Noryangjin. Refurbished 2nd batch car 1182 (ex-1942) at Yeongdeungpo Station as a Yongsan-Dongincheon express train. Trains 1-42~1-73 were 2nd generation trains and were introduced from 1986 to 1992. The 2nd batch trains were introduced to supply more trains to Line 1. Several additional 2nd generation cars were built to lengthen first generation trains to ten cars. The 2nd generation featured a redesigned car body. The front end of the train was changed completely, and a train event recorder was introduced. Unlike the 1st generation trains, the 2nd generation trains were delivered with air- conditioning; thus SIV systems were introduced to power the air conditioners. All trains had the old Korean National Railroad (KNR) livery, but received the new livery following overhaul. Trains 1-42~1-63 were built from 1986 to 1989 with long, rectangular-windowed doors while trains 1-64~1-73 were built from 1991 to 1992 with short, square-windowed doors. However, many cars with rectangular-windowed doors have been refitted with 1st batch trains' doors; car 1162 was the last car with rectangular-windowed doors until its retirement in July 2016. The cars were nicknamed the middle rheostat cars (Ï§ëÏ†ÄÌï≠).  Batch 1  The first batch of 2nd generation trains consisted of train 1-42~1-63. The cars were manufactured from 1986 to 1991. As built, trains 1-42~1-49 were ten cars long, trains 1-50~1-56 were six cars long and ran on the Ansan Line, and trains 1-57~1-63 were four cars long and ran on the Yongsan-Seongbuk shuttle line. Ten additional cars were built to lengthen first generation trains 1-39~1-41 to ten cars. As ridership increased on Line 1, trains 1-50~1-53 and 1-57~1-63 were lengthened with third generation cars from 1994 to 1997. As this rearrangement occurred, trains 1-50~1-53 and 1-59~1-61 were lengthened to ten cars, and trains 1-57~1-58 and 1-62~1-63 were lengthened to six cars for Ansan Line service. In 1999, three unpowered cars (two from train 1-42 and one from train 1-43) were rebuilt into driving cars by Daewoo Heavy Industries. They were renumbered to cars 1082, 1182, and 1087 (former trailer car 1842, 1942, and 1943 respectively), and were linked with 1st generation cars. Because no car numbered 1187 was built, car 1087 ran with 3rd generation car 1186 and was retired in 2001. Meanwhile, 1082 and 1182 lasted until 2006, when they were pulled from service due to structural integrity issues, stored at the Byeongjeom Car Depot until the end of 2011, and then scrapped. All but four trains were overhauled between 2007 and 2008. Trains 1-53, 1-57, 1-63, and 1-65 were prematurely retired in 2006, because they were coupled with eight aging 1st generation cars each, so it was found to be easier to retire the trains instead of overhauling them to be fire- resistant. They were stored at the Byeongjeom and Guro train depots and taken off property before the end of 2015. On May 1, 2010, train 1-58 was wrecked in a collision with Class 311000 train 311-74 (which was known as Class 5000 train 5-75 at the time of the collision). Car 1158 suffered significant damage while other cars behind it received minor damage. The whole train was retired and most cars were scrapped shortly after.Cars 1058 and 1258, the ninth and tenth cars in the train, would be scrapped years after the incident in 2014 or 2015. Both unpowered cars of 1-39~1-40 and one car in train 1-41 were converted into unpowered cars and could be found in Class 311000 trains 311-39~311-41 until 2018, when they were replaced with other Class 311000 cars or Class 341000 cars. Meanwhile, cars 1441, 1541, 1641, and 1741 were used in 2nd batch trains after the retirement of train 1-41, but all cars were retired with train 1-58 on May 1, 2010 when the whole train was damaged in an accident. The overhauled trains were replaced by the Class 311000 trains. They were retired between 2012 and 2015. 3rd generation cars built in 1996 that were used to extend the trains were retained for use in other trains.  Batch 2  The second batch of 2nd generation trains consisted of train 1-64~1-73. The cars were manufactured from 1991 to 1992. As built, trains 1-67~1-73 were ten cars long and trains 1-64~1-66 were six cars long and ran on the Ansan Line. Additional cars were built to lengthen first generation trains to 10 cars. All but one train were overhauled between 2007 and 2008. Train 1-65 was prematurely retired in 2006, because it was coupled with eight aging 1st generation cars, so it was found to be easier to retire the train instead of overhauling it to be fire-resistant. It was stored around the system before being taken off property in 2011 or 2012. The overhauled trains were replaced by the Class 311000 trains. They were retired between 2015 and March 30, 2017, when the last train, train 1-73, made its final run. After retirement, parts of trains 1-72 and 1-73 were used on the Yeongdong Line for testing in mid-2017 before being stored out of service again. In a surprise move, cars 1673 and 1773 were brought back into service in March 2019, when they replaced two powered cars in train 1-79. The cars were retired again in mid-November 2019 when train 1-79 was retired, marking the end of service life of the second generation trains. = Third Generation = 3rd batch train 1-83 leaving Singil Station Trains 1-74~1-81 and 1-83~1-86 were third generation trains and were introduced from 1994 to 1997. They were introduced to supply more trains to Line 1. Many additional 3rd generation cars were built to lengthen second generation trains. The trains share a similar front end design with the Class 341000 and 351000 trains (as their front ends were derived from those trains' designs), but are otherwise identical to the other Class 1000 trains, especially the second generation. Therefore, they only operate with other Class 1000 cars. All trains were delivered in the old Korean National Railroad (KNR) livery but they have received new livery following overhaul. The cars were nicknamed the new rheostat cars (Ïã†Ï†ÄÌï≠).  Batch 1  The first batch of 3rd generation trains consisted of train 1-74~1-79. The cars were manufactured from 1994 to 1995 by Daewoo Heavy Industries under model \\"DEC-13\\". All new trains are ten cars long; six additional cars were built to lengthen second generation trains 1-59~1-61 from four to six cars for Ansan Line service. All of train 1-74 sans the driving cars (made excessive when 2nd generation train 1-62 was retired) and the additional cars for trains 1-59~1-61 were retired between 2015 and 2016. Two powered cars from train 1-79 were retired in March 2019 because of mechanical issues; as a result, two 2nd generation powered cars were temporarily brought back into service to replace those cars. Trains 1-75~1-79 were retired in mid-November 2019, and the driving cars in 1-74 were retired in May 2020.  Batch 2  The second batch of 3rd generation trains consisted of train 1-80, 1-81, and 1-83~1-86. The cars were manufactured from 1996 to 1997 by Hyundai Precision. Train 1-80 has always been ten cars long, trains 1-81 and 1-83 were originally eight cars long, and trains 1-85 and 1-86 utilized older trains as only two driving cars for each train were manufactured. Many additional cars were built to lengthen second generation trains 1-50~1-53 and 1-57~1-63, along with rebuilt train 1-82; trains 1-50~1-53 and 1-59~1-61 were lengthened to ten cars, while trains 1-57, 1-58, 1-62, and 1-63 were lengthened from four to six cars. Eight of the additional cars were retired in 2017 when second generation train 1-64 was retired, and eight more were retired in May 2020 when third generation train 1-74 was retired. All the other 2nd batch of third generation trains were expected to be retired in 2021, but after a derailment involving train 1-83 in April 2020,https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20200414000851320 the remaining trains were taken out of service by June 2020 due to perceived safety issues.  Refurbishments  * In 1986, the 1st batch cars' air conditioning secondary power device was upgraded from a motor generator to stationary inverters (SIV). These inverters were replaced by new IGBT inverters in 2004 for cars that were overhauled. The air conditioner itself was changed from piston-based systems to screw-motor-based systems. * In 1988, the 1st batch cars were retrofitted with air conditioning. * In 2000, station notifier systems were installed in the 2nd batch trains to allow train operators to know which stations to stop at during express train runs. * The Daegu subway fire compelled Korail to introduce flame-resistant interiors for passenger safety. As a result, from 2004, the 2nd batch trains (except 1-53, 1-57, 1-63, and 1-65) and 3rd batch trains were overhauled with fire-retardant interiors. SLS overhauled some of the 1st batch cars, most of the 2nd batch trains and a few 3rd batch cars. Meanwhile, Rowin overhauled 2nd batch trains 1-62, 1-64, and all other 3rd batch cars. The original Mylar roll film front destination signs, side destination signs, and run number indicators were replaced with LED displays (trains 1-42~1-48 received LCD run number indicators). All trains received the new Korail livery. * In 2006, trains 1-47~1-49 received newer Korail EMU doors. Additionally, trains 1-45, 1-50~1-56, 1-61, and 1-71 received 1st batch train doors. Many remaining trains are receiving 1st batch train doors as their original doors fail in operation. * In 2011, all trains from train 1-59 had their speakers rebuilt or replaced to allow for clearer announcements.  Preservation  After retirement, a handful of Class 1000 cars were either preserved or repurposed into facilities such as restaurants and pension trains. 1st batch car 1106, which was used as a local restaurant in Incheon until 2015. 2nd batch car 1065 at the old Gudun Station, now used as a training car. Preserved 1st batch cars include (though not limited to): * 1001, 1115 (pictured) and 1315, used as exhibits at the Korean Railroad Museum in Uiwang. Car 1001 is part of the first EMU (from Japan). Meanwhile, cars 1115 and 1315 are part of the first Korean EMU. When cars 1115 and 1315 were preserved, they were renumbered to 1001 and 1301, conflicting with the true 1001. * 1107 and 1011, used as karaoke room cars at Mogok Leisure Town in Hongcheon, Gangwon-do. * 1309, used as a restaurant in Buan County, Jeollabuk- do.https://blog.naver.com/digmon2001/221591645120 * 1019 and 1119, used for storage space Sangju-si, Gyeongsangbuk-do. * 1514 and 1134 (and potentially other cars), used as exhibits in the Haneol Theme Museum in Yeoju. * Rebuilt car 1091 (renumbered from 1832) at Buljeong station on the former Mungyeong Line, formerly used as a \\"pension train.\\" * Two cars with unknown numbers, used as a part of a local facility in Seongnam-si near the Galma Tunnel. Cars 1106 (pictured) and 1109, used as a part of a local restaurant in Nonhyeon- dong, Incheon, and car 1032 was used as a part of a local restaurant in Dong- gu, Daejeon. All 3 cars were sold and are now scrapped. Preserved 2nd batch cars include: * 1065 (pictured) and 1165 at the old Gudun station on the old Jungang Line alignment. * 1771 and 1171, used as training cars at Kyungbuk College in Yeongju-si, North Gyeongsang Province.

It was born from the rubble of the Whittier Narrows earthquake of October 1, 1987, which had led to the destruction of many historic buildings in Whittier, including the Lindley Building, one of Whittier's \\"Four Bricks\\", and the landmark Whittier Theater. In 1989, the Conservancy assisted the City to rezone the residential neighborhoods north of Hadley Street to protect this vital area from rampant, uncontrolled apartment construction. The Conservancy spearheaded the preservation of the historic Whittier Depot and the McGee House. Though primarily a historic preservation organization, the Conservancy is also interested in open space preservation, and is involved in the continuing movement to preserve the Whittier Hills as part of the Puente-Chino Hills Wildlife Corridor Cal-Domestic Lawsuit On May 23, 2007, the Conservancy filed suit against the City of Whittier. This was in response to the Whittier City Council overruling the Historic Resources Commission by a 3-2 vote and approving the demolition of three buildings on the California Domestic Water property, across the street from Whitwood Mall, before an environmental impact report had been filed. The Cal-Domestic Lawsuit has been a major event in recent Whittier politics, as it led to the creation of the Coalition for a Better Whittier, a political action committee founded to support the city in the lawsuit (thereby counteracting the influences of the Conservancy) and to push for further mixed-use development in the City of Whittier.

This stub is linked to the calling program, passes on the request to the IMS system, and returns the results and a status code. In any full-function IMS database, the smallest element that can be retrieved is a segment. Each segment is made up of fields, one of which, typically, will be a key field. The segments are arranged hierarchically in the database, the highest level segment type being a root segment. 255 different segment types, on up to 15 levels, are allowed in any database. A database record consists of a specific root segment and all its dependent child segments there is no limit to the number of segments in a record, or to the number of records in a database (apart from physical limitations of storage space). The structure of any database is presented to the application program as a PCB (Program Communication Block), and this is used as one of the parameters passed to the stub. Other types of PCB are used to send and receive transaction processing messages, access and write to the user‚Äôs VDU screen, and to print reports etc. When accessing a database segment the application program also uses an SSA (Segment Search Argument) as a parameter, to specify the segment or segments that it needs.

An equivalent description is that a strangelet is a small fragment of strange matter, small enough to be considered a particle. The size of an object composed of strange matter could, theoretically, range from a few femtometers across (with the mass of a light nucleus) to arbitrarily large. Once the size becomes macroscopic (on the order of metres across), such an object is usually called a strange star. The term \\"strangelet\\" originates with Edward Farhi and Robert Jaffe. Strangelets can convert matter to strange matter on contact. Strangelets have been suggested as a dark matter candidate.  Theoretical possibility  = Strange matter hypothesis = The known particles with strange quarks are unstable. Because the strange quark is heavier than the up and down quarks, it can spontaneously decay, via the weak interaction into an up quark. Consequently particles containing strange quarks, such as the Lambda particle, always lose their strangeness, by decaying into lighter particles containing only up and down quarks. But condensed states with a larger number of quarks might not suffer from this instability. That possible stability against decay is the \\"strange matter hypothesis\\" proposed separately by Arnold Bodmer and Edward Witten. According to this hypothesis, when a large enough number of quarks are concentrated together, the lowest energy state is one which has roughly equal numbers of up, down, and strange quarks, namely a strangelet. This stability would occur because of the Pauli exclusion principle; having three types of quarks, rather than two as in normal nuclear matter, allows more quarks to be placed in lower energy levels. = Relationship with nuclei = A nucleus is a collection of a large number of up and down quarks, confined into triplets (neutrons and protons). According to the strange matter hypothesis, strangelets are more stable than nuclei, so nuclei are expected to decay into strangelets. But this process may be extremely slow because there is a large energy barrier to overcome: as the weak interaction starts making a nucleus into a strangelet, the first few strange quarks form strange baryons, such as the Lambda, which are heavy. Only if many conversions occur almost simultaneously will the number of strange quarks reach the critical proportion required to achieve a lower energy state. This is very unlikely to happen, so even if the strange matter hypothesis were correct, nuclei would never be seen to decay to strangelets because their lifetime would be longer than the age of the universe. = Size = The stability of strangelets depends on their size. This is because of (a) surface tension at the interface between quark matter and vacuum (which affects small strangelets more than big ones), and (b) screening of charges, which allows small strangelets to be charged, with a neutralizing cloud of electrons/positrons around them, but requires large strangelets, like any large piece of matter, to be electrically neutral in their interior. The charge screening distance tends to be of the order of a few femtometers, so only the outer few femtometers of a strangelet can carry charge. The surface tension of strange matter is unknown. If it is smaller than a critical value (a few MeV per square femtometer) then large strangelets are unstable and will tend to fission into smaller strangelets (strange stars would still be stabilized by gravity). If it is larger than the critical value, then strangelets become more stable as they get bigger.  Natural or artificial occurrence  Although nuclei do not decay to strangelets, there are other ways to create strangelets, so if the strange matter hypothesis is correct there should be strangelets in the universe. There are at least three ways they might be created in nature: * Cosmogonically, i.e. in the early universe when the QCD confinement phase transition occurred. It is possible that strangelets were created along with the neutrons and protons that form ordinary matter. * High-energy processes. The universe is full of very high- energy particles (cosmic rays). It is possible that when these collide with each other or with neutron stars they may provide enough energy to overcome the energy barrier and create strangelets from nuclear matter. Some identified exotic cosmic ray events, like the Price's event with very low charge-to-mass ratio could have already registered strangelets. * Cosmic ray impacts. In addition to head-on collisions of cosmic rays, ultra high energy cosmic rays impacting on Earth's atmosphere may create strangelets. These scenarios offer possibilities for observing strangelets. If there are strangelets flying around the universe, then occasionally a strangelet should hit Earth, where it would appear as an exotic type of cosmic ray. If strangelets can be produced in high-energy collisions, then they might be produced by heavy-ion colliders. = Accelerator production = At heavy ion accelerators like the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC), nuclei are collided at relativistic speeds, creating strange and antistrange quarks that could conceivably lead to strangelet production. The experimental signature of a strangelet would be its very high ratio of mass to charge, which would cause its trajectory in a magnetic field to be very nearly, but not quite, straight. The STAR collaboration has searched for strangelets produced at the RHIC, but none were found. The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is even less likely to produce strangelets, CERN record. but searches are planned for the LHC ALICE detector. = Space-based detection = The Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer (AMS), an instrument that is mounted on the International Space Station, could detect strangelets. = Possible seismic detection = In May 2002, a group of researchers at Southern Methodist University reported the possibility that strangelets may have been responsible for seismic events recorded on October 22 and November 24 in 1993. The authors later retracted their claim, after finding that the clock of one of the seismic stations had a large error during the relevant period. It has been suggested that the International Monitoring System being set up to verify the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) after entry into force may be useful as a sort of \\"strangelet observatory\\" using the entire Earth as its detector. The IMS will be designed to detect anomalous seismic disturbances down to energy release or less, and could be able to track strangelets passing through Earth in real time if properly exploited. = Impacts on Solar System bodies = It has been suggested that strangelets of subplanetary i.e. heavy meteorite mass, would puncture planets and other solar system objects, leading to impact (exit) craters which show characteristic features.  Dangers  If the strange matter hypothesis is correct, and if a stable negatively-charged strangelet with a surface tension larger than the aforementioned critical value exists, then a larger strangelet would be more stable than a smaller one. One speculation that has resulted from the idea is that a strangelet coming into contact with a lump of ordinary matter could convert the ordinary matter to strange matter. This is not a concern for strangelets in cosmic rays because they are produced far from Earth and have had time to decay to their ground state, which is predicted by most models to be positively charged, so they are electrostatically repelled by nuclei, and would rarely merge with them. But high-energy collisions could produce negatively charged strangelet states which live long enough to interact with the nuclei of ordinary matter. The danger of catalyzed conversion by strangelets produced in heavy-ion colliders has received some media attention, Horizon: End Days, an episode of the BBC television series Horizon and concerns of this type were raised at the commencement of the RHIC experiment at Brookhaven, which could potentially have created strangelets. A detailed analysis concluded that the RHIC collisions were comparable to ones which naturally occur as cosmic rays traverse the solar system, so we would already have seen such a disaster if it were possible. RHIC has been operating since 2000 without incident. Similar concerns have been raised about the operation of the LHC at CERN but such fears are dismissed as far-fetched by scientists.J. Blaizot et al., \\"Study of Potentially Dangerous Events During Heavy-Ion Collisions at the LHC\\", CERN library record CERN Yellow Reports Server (PDF) In the case of a neutron star, the conversion scenario seems much more plausible. A neutron star is in a sense a giant nucleus (20 km across), held together by gravity, but it is electrically neutral and so does not electrostatically repel strangelets. If a strangelet hit a neutron star, it could convert a small region of it, and that region would grow to consume the entire star, creating a quark star.  Debate about the strange matter hypothesis  The strange matter hypothesis remains unproven. No direct search for strangelets in cosmic rays or particle accelerators has seen a strangelet (see references in earlier sections). If any of the objects such as neutron stars could be shown to have a surface made of strange matter, this would indicate that strange matter is stable at zero pressure, which would vindicate the strange matter hypothesis. However there is no strong evidence for strange matter surfaces on neutron stars (see below). Another argument against the hypothesis is that if it were true, essentially all neutron stars should be made of strange matter, and otherwise none should be. Even if there were only a few strange stars initially, violent events such as collisions would soon create many fragments of strange matter flying around the universe. Because collision with a single strangelet would convert a neutron star to strange matter, all but a few of the most recently formed neutron stars should by now have already been converted to strange matter. This argument is still debated, but if it is correct then showing that one old neutron star has a conventional nuclear matter crust would disprove the strange matter hypothesis. Because of its importance for the strange matter hypothesis, there is an ongoing effort to determine whether the surfaces of neutron stars are made of strange matter or nuclear matter. The evidence currently favors nuclear matter. This comes from the phenomenology of X-ray bursts, which is well explained in terms of a nuclear matter crust, and from measurement of seismic vibrations in magnetars.

Most routes between the UK's two largest cities, London and Birmingham, pass through this county. The county's growing industry (such as in Slough) first brought canals to the area, then railways and then motorways. Much of Buckinghamshire's transport network can be traced to two ancient roads, the Roman Akeman Street and the Celtic Watling Street. The A41 and A5 roughly follow their paths. In 1838, Buckinghamshire became one of the first counties in England to gain railways, with sections of both the West Coast Main Line and Great Western Main Line opening. These were later followed by other main lines and numerous rural branch lines, many of which closed in the 1930s. The Beeching cuts of the 1960s also closed the Great Central Main Line north of Aylesbury in 1966. The county was also one of the few counties to gain a motorway in the 1950s when the M1 motorway opened its entire section through Buckinghamshire in 1959. Air travel is the only major mode of transport not to have a presence in Buckinghamshire- although Heathrow Airport in Greater London is less than a mile from the southern border of the two counties. Rail :This section describes Buckinghamshire as it was prior to 1974. =Origins= Denbigh Hall Bridge, in Buckinghamshire, was the terminus for several months before the line was completed north to Rugby The railway boom of northern England led to the formation of the London and Birmingham Railway (L&BR;). In 1833, Robert Stephenson in 1833, planned to meet Joseph Locke's Grand Junction Railway at Birmingham, thus creating a north-south route.* Though the rail line was initially planned to go through Buckingham, where carriage works would have been built, it was altered to Wolverton due to objections from the Duke of Buckingham. A line to Buckingham would later open in 1850. Construction of the L&BR; began in November 1833 and the section from London Euston to Boxmoor in Hertfordshire opened in 1837. The line to near Bletchley was completed by the summer of 1838; from there passengers took a stagecoach shuttle to Rugby where the railway continued north. The line through what is now Milton Keynes opened several months later on 17 September 1838. Wolverton later became famous as the site of Wolverton railway works which produced rolling stock for over a century--the last new carriage was built there in 1962. The site now houses a supermarket. At the same time, another railway company, the Great Western Railway (GWR) was formed in 1833, intending to link London with the growing port of Bristol. Isambard Kingdom Brunel was appointed as engineer the same year. Construction began in the mid-1830s. The line from Paddington through Buckinghamshire was opened on 4 June 1838 terminating at Maidenhead Bridge station until Maidenhead Railway Bridge was ready. The line west into Berkshire opened 1 July 1839. The line became notable for its use of broad gauge (which was favoured by Brunel) as opposed to standard gauge, which was preferred by most other railway engineers including George and Robert Stephenson. Other railways using standard gauge later met the GWR resulting in the gauge war which the GWR eventually lost. The section through Bucks had a third rail laid on 1 October 1861 allowing both standard and broad gauge trains to run. The broad gauge was removed throughout the country in 1892. The line through Buckinghamshire was quadrupled in late 19th century. The path of the Buckinghamshire Railway, known as the Varsity Line, eventually linked Oxford and Cambridge; the section between Bedford and Cambridge opened in 1862. In 1839, a branch line opened from Cheddington on the L&BR; to Aylesbury, the county town of Buckinghamshire to transport goods, particularly the Aylesbury Duck, to London. This however required a change at Cheddington, as the line was built connecting north towards Bletchley. The Aylesbury Railway, or Cheddington to Aylesbury Line was independent but operated by the L&BR; up to 1846, when the L&BR; and two other railway companies merged to form the London and North Western Railway (LNWR). From then onwards, the line was owned by the LNWR. The next line to open was the Bedford and Bletchley Railway on 17 November 1846; it ran from Bedford railway station to the London and Birmingham Railway at Bletchley,The World's Greatest Railway Journeys, p. 84. changing Bletchley from a minor rural backwater to an important junction town. That company merged with the Buckingham and Brackley Junction Railway in 1847 to form the Buckinghamshire Railway, which opened a branch line in 1850 to Banbury. A junction was formed in 1851 at Verney Junction for another new line from there to Oxford, to form what became known as the Varsity Line between Oxford and Cambridge via Bletchley. The Buckinghamshire Railway was worked by the LNWR from July 1851 on, and it was later absorbed by the LNWR in 1879. In July 1846, the Wycombe Railway was incorporated by an Act of Parliament, allowing the construction of a branch line from Maidenhead, in Berkshire on the GWR to High Wycombe, a major furniture producing town. Construction began in 1852 and was completed two years later in 1854. Building works included a new bridge over the Thames; the Bourne End Railway Bridge was wooden when first built, but replaced by an iron truss bridge in 1895. The line was single track and used the broad-gauge. The Wycombe Railway was extended in 1862 to Thame with another branch from Princes Risborough to Aylesbury in 1863.There was no connection to the LNWR station at Aylesbury High Street railway station The line to Oxford was completed a year later in 1864. The Wycombe Railway was leased to the Great Western Railway, and was bought by the GWR in 1867. The line was converted to standard gauge in 1870. Two lines serving Windsor in Berkshire opened in 1849- both competing for traffic from the Royalty and tourists. The Windsor, Staines and South Western Railway was authorised in 1847, the Staines to Windsor Line opening its first section from Staines in Surrey to Datchet in Buckinghamshire on 22 August 1848. Due to opposition from both Windsor Castle and Eton College, the line into Windsor was delayed- the line into Windsor & Eton Riverside opened on 1 December 1849. The Windsor, Staines and South Western Railway was absorbed by the London and South Western Railway (LSWR) in 1848. In the same year, 1849, the Slough to Windsor & Eton Line opened from Slough in Buckinghamshire to Windsor & Eton Central again receiving opposition from Eton College. Originally laid as broad-gauge, dual gauge, allowing standard and broad gauge trains to run was laid in 1862. For a brief period between 1883 and 1885, the District Railway ran services between London and Windsor & Eton Central via Ealing Broadway over the GWR tracks from Slough. The Aylesbury and Buckingham Railway was formed next in August 1860 to build a line between AylesburyThe current GWR Aylesbury station, not the LNWR Aylesbury High Street and Verney Junction on the LNWR's Varsity Line. It opened in 1868 but trains never ran to Buckingham - even though Verney Junction had a connection to Banbury via Buckingham. From 1871, services to Waddesdon Road operated over the Brill Tramway began. Known initially as the Wooton Tramway, it was built primarily for the use of the Third Duke of Buckingham and extended to Brill in 1872, terminating quite a distance from the village itself. =Metroland= Map of \\"Metro-land\\", from the 1924 Metro- land booklet published by the Metropolitan Railway. The county boundary of Buckinghamshire is shown. The Metropolitan Railway had been the first underground mass-transit railway system in the world when it opened in 1863. In 1868 the Metropolitan and St John's Wood Railway opened a branch from Baker Street to Swiss Cottage, that company being taken over by the Metropolitan Railway in 1879. The line was extended several times from then onwards. The line first entered Buckinghamshire on 8 July 1889 to CheshamMetro-land' by John Betjeman, BBC Television 1973 but further extension into the Chiltern Hills took place via Amersham in 1892, turning the Chesham route into a branch line. The extension of 1892 terminated at the GWR station in Aylesbury which had opened in 1863. The Metropolitan Railway was now stretching deep into Buckinghamshire, over land termed Metroland by the Met itself in 1915. In 1891, the Metropolitan had absorbed the Aylesbury & Buckingham Railway which had run from Aylesbury to Verney Junction. On 1 January 1894, the Metropolitan Railway was extended over the A&BR; to Verney Junction meeting the LNWR owned Varsity Line which had opened in 1850. The Metropolitan Railway (popularly called the 'Met') thus ran express services from central London to Verney Junction, in the middle of rural Buckinghamshire- a testament to this being that the terminus was so rural that the station was named after the local landowner, Sir Harry Verney. The Met's final extension in Buckinghamshire was over the Brill Tramway which was absorbed on 1 December 1899, almost fifty miles out of central London. Indeed, the extent of the Metropolitan line was so great that for many years the line could not be accommodated into the London Underground Tube map. =The last main line= The next railway which was to weave its way through Buckinghamshire was the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway (MS&LR;) which had formed a network of railways in the north of England. In 1897, it changed its name to become the Great Central Railway in anticipation of its London extension. The MS&LR; had been a modest company, until Sir Edward Watkin became general manager in 1854. His ambition was to build a rail tunnel under the English Channel in which his trains would run. He was determined to build a line south to London and the South Coast- to do this he became chairman of both the South Eastern Railway which ran between London and Dover and the Metropolitan Railway. Both companies were of use to Watkin as they provided a clear route between Dover and the already existing MS&LR; near Nottingham. The London Extension was planned to European standards and had virtually no sharp corners or steep inclines. There was to be no level crossings- everything was carried above or below the railway. Work began in 1894 still under the MS&LR; name. The estimated coast was approximately ¬£3 million and would take four years to complete; the project being in two halves, the southern section running from Rugby in Warwickshire to Quainton Road which was the Metropolitan Railway's junction for Brill and Verney Junction. From there, trains would share tracks with the Met to a new terminus at Marylebone in London. The line officially opened on 9 March 1899, although the first passenger service did not run until 16 March. Road Buckinghamshire's road network is still largely composed of single carriageway roads, with a few exceptions. The M40 and M1 motorways both pass through the county on their routes from London to the north, serving High Wycombe and Milton Keynes respectively. The A41 connects Oxfordshire to London through Buckinghamshire. Between Aylesbury and London this road is a grade-separated dual carriageway, essentially a motorway but with more curves and no hard shoulder. Aylesbury is the focal point of Buckinghamshire's road network; the A413, A418, A41 and A4010 roads all converge on the town. However all enter the town as single carriageways and none has a bypass. Consequently, Aylesbury suffers from serious traffic congestion problems during peak hours. Similarly to Aylesbury, High Wycombe is a nexus of major roads in the southern part of the county. The A4010 from Aylesbury meets the A404 from Amersham as well as the M40 motorway, which passes the town to the south. The A404 continues south beyond the M40 towards Maidenhead. Unlike the other two towns, Milton Keynes, being a new town, has a pre-planned network of roads known as the Milton Keynes grid road system. It is linked to Leighton Buzzard and Aylesbury by the dual carriageway A4146 which opened in September 2007. The single carriageway A508 connects it to Northampton whilst the A421 connects it, via the M1, to Bedford. West of Milton Keynes the A421 meets the A413 in Buckingham, which is also on the A422 road to Banbury. Buckinghamshire (including Milton Keynes) is served by four motorways, although two are on its borders: * M40 motorway - cuts through the south of the county serving towns such as High Wycombe and Beaconsfield * M1 motorway - serves Milton Keynes in the north * M25 motorway - passes into Bucks but has only one junction (J16-interchange for the M40) * M4 motorway - passes through the very south of the county with only J7 in Bucks Also the A41 (former A41 (M)) comes into Buckinghamshire from the east to Aston Clinton. Four important A roads also enter the county (from north to south): * A5 - serves Milton Keynes * A41 - cuts through the centre of the county, serving Aylesbury * A40 - parallels M40 through south Bucks and continues to central London * A4 - serves Taplow in the very south Road travel east‚Äìwest is good in the county because of the commuter routes leaving London for the rest of the country. There are no major roads that run directly between the south and north of the county (e.g. between High Wycombe and Milton Keynes). Waterway The Grand Union Canal runs through the county from Milton Keynes down to Marsworth, passing in and out of Bedfordshire on the way. After this it leaves and enters Hertfordshire. At Marsworth two branches separated, one to Aylesbury and one to Wendover. The Aylesbury branch remains active to this day, whilst the Wendover arm was closed over a century ago. However it is now being restored by a volunteer trust who have reopened it as far as Little Tring. It is presently being restored back to Aston Clinton (see trust website). Another branch which is the subject of restoration efforts is the branch to Buckingham. This left the canal at Cosgrove in Northamptonshire, just north of Milton Keynes. Almost the entire formation is now disused, and the A5 dual carriageway has severed the route.

Management by exception has both a general business application and a business intelligence application. General business exceptions are cases that deviate from the normal behavior in a business process and need to be cared for in a unique manner, typically by human intervention. Their cause might include: process deviation, infrastructure or connectivity issues, external deviation, poor quality business rules, malformed data, etc. Management by exception here is the practice of investigating, resolving and handling such occurrences by using skilled staff and software tools. Good management can contribute to efficiency of business processes. Often in these cases the process will be called exception management, as exceptional cases are not the sole focus of the managerial policy, and exception management (as opposed to management by exception) denotes a more moderate application of the process. Management by exception (MBE), when applied to business is a style of management that gives employees the responsibility to make decisions and fulfill their work or projects by themselves. It consists of focus and analysis of statistically relevant anomalies in the data. If an unusual situation or deviation in the recorded data appears, which could cause difficulties for the business and can't be managed by the employee at his level, the employee should pass the decision on to the next higher level. For example, if all products are selling at their expected volumes for the quarter, except one particular product which is underperforming or overperforming at a statistically relevant margin, only the data for that product will be presented to the managers for further investigation and discovery of the root cause. Management by exception can bring forward business errors and oversights, ineffective strategies that need to be improved, changes in competition and business opportunities. Management by exception is intended to reduce the managerial load and enable managers to spend their time more effectively in areas where it will have the most impact. This management concept is widely attributed to Frederick W. Taylor and was first discussed in his work, \\"Shop management: A paper read before the American Society of Mechanical Engineers. N.Y: American Society of Mechanical Engineers. Exception management also has an IT application. When writing code, if the programmer sees that there will be an exceptional case where a predefined assumption of the application will be breached, the programmer will need to deal with that exception programmatically from the outset.  Process of management by exception  Primarily, it is necessary to set objectives or norms with predictable or estimated results. These performances are assessed and get equated to the actual performance. Next, the deviation gets analysed. With an insignificant or no deviation, no action is required and senior managers can concentrate on other matters. If actual performances deviate significantly, the concern needs to be passed to the senior managers, as an ‚Äúexception has occurred‚Äù. Finally, the aim is to solve this ‚Äúexception‚Äù immediately.  Management by exception using variance analysis  The accounting department is responsible for the forecasting of budgets and cost performance reports. The difference between the estimated and actual figures is defined as variance. To understand the cause of the difference, managers need to investigate the questions how the variance differs from last period and what are the causes for not reaching the estimated figures. Analysers consider two types of variances: adverse variance and favourable variance. Adverse variance ‚Äúexists when the difference between the budgeted and actual figure leads to a lower than expected profit‚Äù. Favourable variance ‚Äúexists when the difference between the budgeted and actual figure leads to a higher than expected profit‚Äù. Rather than considering all variances, managers establish criteria to determine which variances are significant to focus on. Management by exception focuses mainly on large adverse variances, to find the areas of business, which deviates from predetermined standards in a negative way.  Active Management by exception versus Passive Management by exception  When reviewing management by exception and trying to determine where a skill set resides or what style they follow, it is important to keep in mind that this leadership method involves two distinct paths. One, active management by exception, where the leader is proactive in assisting with issues and actively participates and watches subordinates to prevent mistakes. Two, passive management by exception. In this method, the manager only intervenes when standards are not being met and action must be taken, usually after something has happened rather than along the way. There is value in taking either approach, but is not determinable until you can understand your environment. In a Laissez-faire, relaxed environment, where individuals understand their roles and are SMEs respectively, then following a more passive approach may encourage group morale and sense of independence. In a more stringent, less straightforward environment with people who are only starting in the role or not fully understanding tasks, taking a more active position would most likely prove to be the more beneficial route, as the step- by-step guidance can improve competence, as well as confidence.  Advantages of management by exception  The main advantage of management by exception is that problematic issues are identified rapidly and managers are able to use their time and energy more wisely for important issues rather than for less important ones that could provoke delays in their daily operations. Additionally, managers need to work less on statistics and the frequency of making decisions becomes less, which saves time. As managers take fewer decisions, employees have more responsibility, which increases their motivation.  Disadvantage of management by exception  Occurrences of mistakes in calculating budgets results in large variance differences and finding the errors can be time-consuming (thus expensive). Furthermore, financial analysts responsible for calculation variances are increasing overhead costs of a company. If the financial analysts are not performing well, it will become a waste of time and money. Another disadvantage is that only managers have the power over really important decisions, which can be demotivating for employees at a lower level. Furthermore, it takes time to pass the issues to managers. Managing employees who deviate from the normal procedures because of compliance failures are considered difficult to manage and typically find themselves with limited job duties and ultimately dismissed/terminated.

Mythology Tricksters, as archetypal characters, appear in the myths of many different cultures. Lewis Hyde describes the trickster as a \\"boundary- crosser\\".Hyde, Lewis. Trickster Makes This World: Mischief, Myth, and Art. New York: Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 1998. The trickster crosses and often breaks both physical and societal rules: Tricksters \\"violate principles of social and natural order, playfully disrupting normal life and then re-establishing it on a new basis.\\" Often, this bending/breaking of rules, takes the form of tricks or thievery. Tricksters can be cunning or foolish or both. The trickster openly questions, disrupts or mocks authority. They are often male characters, and are fond of breaking rules, boasting, and playing tricks on both humans and gods. Many cultures have tales of the trickster, a crafty being who uses cunning to get food, steal precious possessions, or simply cause mischief. In some Greek myths Hermes plays the trickster. He is the patron of thieves and the inventor of lying, a gift he passed on to Autolycus, who in turn passed it on to Odysseus. In Slavic folktales, the trickster and the culture hero are often combined. Loki cuts the hair of the goddess Sif. Frequently the trickster figure exhibits gender and form variability. In Norse mythology the mischief-maker is Loki, who is also a shape shifter. Loki also exhibits gender variability, in one case even becoming pregnant. He becomes a mare who later gives birth to Odin's eight-legged horse Sleipnir. In a wide variety of African language communities, the rabbit, or hare, is the trickster. In West Africa (and thence into the Caribbean via the slave trade), the spider (Anansi) is often the trickster. Archetype The trickster or clown is an example of a Jungian archetype. Trickster or clown The trickster is a term used for a non performing 'trick maker'; they may have many motives behind their intention but those motives are not in public view largely. They are internal to the character or person. The clown on the other hand is a persona of a performer who diplays their actions in public intentionally for an audience. In literature In modern literature, the trickster survives as a character archetype, not necessarily supernatural or divine, sometimes no more than a stock character. Often, the trickster is distinct in a story by his acting as a sort of catalyst; his antics are the cause of other characters' discomfiture, but he himself is left untouched. A once-famous example of this was the character Froggy the Gremlin on the early USA children's television show \\"Andy's Gang\\". A cigar-puffing puppet, Froggy induced the adult humans around him to engage in ridiculous and self-destructive hi-jinks.Smith, R. L. \\"Remembering Andy Devine\\". For example, many European fairy tales have a king who wants to find the best groom for his daughter by ordering several trials. No brave and valiant prince or knight manages to win them, until a poor and simple peasant comes. With the help of his wits and cleverness, instead of fighting, they evade or fool monsters, villains and dangers in unorthodox ways. Against expectations, the most unlikely candidate passes the trials and receives the reward. More modern and obvious examples of the same type include Bugs Bunny in the USA and from Sweden the female hero in the Pippi Longstocking stories. Role in African American literature Modern African American literary criticism has turned the trickster figure into an example of how it is possible to overcome a system of oppression from within. For years, African American literature was discounted by the greater community of American literary criticism while its authors were still obligated to use the language and the rhetoric of the very system that relegated African Americans and other minorities to the ostracized position of the cultural \\"other.\\" The central question became one of how to overcome this system when the only words available were created and defined by the oppressors. As Audre Lorde explained, the problem was that \\"the master's tools [would] never dismantle the master's house.\\" In his writings of the late 1980s, Henry Louis Gates Jr. presents the concept of Signifyin'. Wound up in this theory is the idea that the \\"master's house\\" can be \\"dismantled\\" using his \\"tools\\" if the tools are used in a new or unconventional way. To demonstrate this process, Gates cites the interactions found in African American narrative poetry between the trickster, the Signifying Monkey, and his oppressor, the Lion. According to Gates, the \\"Signifying Monkey\\" is the \\"New World figuration\\" and \\"functional equivalent\\" of the Eshu trickster figure of African Yoruba mythology. The Lion functions as the authoritative figure in his classical role of \\"King of the Jungle.\\" He is the one who commands the Signifying Monkey's movements. Yet the Monkey is able to outwit the Lion continually in these narratives through his usage of figurative language. According to Gates, \\"[T]he Signifying Monkey is able to signify upon the Lion because the Lion does not understand the Monkey's discourse‚Ä¶ The monkey speaks figuratively, in metaphor. The lion interprets or reads this literally and suffers the consequences of his folly...See: In this way, the Monkey uses the same language as the Lion, but he uses it on a level that the Lion cannot comprehend. This usually leads to the Lion's \\"trounc[ing]\\" at the hands of a third party, the Elephant. The net effect of all of this is \\"the reversal of (the Lion's) status as the King of the Jungle.\\" In this allegorical way, the \\"master's house\\" is dismantled when his own tools are turned against him. Br'er Rabbit is a trickster character who succeeds through his wits rather than through strength. Following in this tradition, critics since Gates have come to assert that another popular African American folk trickster, Br'er Rabbit (a contraction of \\"Brother Rabbit\\"), uses clever language to perform the same kind of rebellious societal deconstruction as the Signifying Monkey. Brer Rabbit is the \\"creative way that the slave community responded to the oppressor's failure to address them as human beings created in the image of God.\\" In the figurative representative of this slave community; Brer Rabbit is the hero with a \\"fragile body but a deceptively strong mind\\" that allows him to \\"create [his] own symbols in defiance of the perverted logic of the oppressor.\\" By twisting language to create these symbols, Brer Rabbit not only was the \\"personification of the ethic of self-preservation\\" for the slave community, but also \\"an alternative response to their oppressor's false doctrine of anthropology.\\" Through his language of trickery, Brer Rabbit outwits his oppressors, deconstructing, in small ways, the hierarchy of subjugation to which his weak body forces him to physically conform. Before Gates, there was some precedent for the analysis of African American folk heroes as destructive agents of an oppressive hierarchical system. In the 1920s and 1930s, T. S. Eliot and Ezra Pound engaged in an epistolary correspondence.North, Michael, The Dialect of Modernism: Race, Language, and Twentieth-Century Literature (New York: Oxford University Press, 1994), 77. Both writers signed the letters with pseudonyms adopted from the Uncle Remus tales; Eliot was \\"Possum;\\" Pound was \\"Tar Baby.\\" Pound and Eliot wrote in the same \\"African slave\\" dialect of the tales. Pound, writing later of the series of letters, distinguished the language from \\"the Queen's English, the language of public propriety.\\" This rebellion against proper language came as part of \\"collaboration\\" between Pound and Eliot \\"against the London literary establishment and the language that it used.\\" Although Pound and Eliot were not attempting to overthrow an establishment as expansive as the one oppressing the African American slave community, they were actively trying to establish for themselves a new kind of literary freedom. In their usage of the Uncle Remus trickster figures' names and dialects, they display an early understanding of the way in which cleverly manipulated language can dismantle a restrictive hierarchy. African American literary criticism and folktales are not the only place in the American literary tradition that tricksters are to be found combating subjugation from within an oppressive system: In, When Brer Rabbit Meets Coyote, the argument is posited that the Brer Rabbit stories were derived from a mixture of African and Native American mythology, thus attributing part of the credit for the formation of the tales and wiles of Brer Rabbit to \\"Indian captivity narratives\\" and the rabbit trickster found in Cherokee mythology. In arguing for a merged \\"African‚ÄìNative American folklore\\", the idea is forwarded that certain shared \\"cultural affinities\\" between African Americans and Native Americans allowed both groups \\"through the trickster tales‚Ä¶survive[d] European American cultural and political domination.\\" In Native American tradition While the trickster crosses various cultural traditions, there are significant differences between tricksters in the traditions of different parts of the world: > Many native traditions held clowns and tricksters as essential to any > contact with the sacred. People could not pray until they had laughed, > because laughter opens and frees from rigid preconception. Humans had to > have tricksters within the most sacred ceremonies for fear that they forget > the sacred comes through upset, reversal, surprise. The trickster in most > native traditions is essential to creation, to birth.Byrd Gibbens, Professor > of English at University of Arkansas at Little Rock; quoted epigraph in > Napalm and Silly Putty by George Carlin, 2001 Native American tricksters should not be confused with the European fictional picaro. One of the most important distinctions is that \\"we can see in the Native American trickster an openness to life's multiplicity and paradoxes largely missing in the modern Euro-American moral tradition\\". In some stories the Native American trickster is foolish and other times wise. He can be a hero in one tale and a villain in the next. In many Native American and First Nations mythologies, the Coyote spirit (Southwestern United States) or Raven spirit (Pacific Northwest) stole fire from the gods (stars, moon, and/or sun). Both are usually seen as jokesters and pranksters. In Native American creation stories, when Coyote teaches humans how to catch salmon, he makes the first fish weir out of logs and branches. Wakdjunga in Winnebago mythology is an example of the trickster archetype. =Coyote= Coyote often has the role of trickster as well as a clown in traditional stories. The Coyote mythos is one of the most popular among western Native American cultures, especially among indigenous peoples of California and the Great Basin. According to Crow (and other Plains) tradition, Old Man Coyote impersonates the Creator: \\"Old Man Coyote took up a handful of mud and out of it made people\\".\\"Gold Fever California on the Eve- California Indians\\", Oakland Museum of California He also bestowed names on buffalo, deer, elk, antelopes, and bear. According to A. Hultkranz, the impersonation of Coyote as Creator is a result of a taboo, a mythic substitute to the religious notion of the Great Spirit whose name was too dangerous and/or sacred to use apart from at special ceremonies. In Chelan myths, Coyote belongs to the animal people but he is at the same time \\"a power just like the Creator, the head of all the creatures.\\" while still being a subject of the Creator who can punish him or remove his powers. In the Pacific Northwest tradition, Coyote is mostly mentioned as a messenger, or minor power. As the culture hero, Coyote appears in various mythic traditions, but generally with the same magical powers of transformation, resurrection, and \\"medicine\\". He is engaged in changing the ways of rivers, creating new landscapes and getting sacred things for people. Of mention is the tradition of Coyote fighting against monsters. According to Wasco tradition, Coyote was the hero to fight and kill Thunderbird, the killer of people, but he could do that not because of his personal power, but due to the help of the Spirit Chief. In some stories, Multnomah Falls came to be by Coyote's efforts; in others, it is done by Raven. More often than not Coyote is a trickster, but always different. In some stories, he is a noble trickster: \\"Coyote takes water from the Frog people... because it is not right that one people have all the water.\\" In others, he is malicious: \\"Coyote determined to bring harm to Duck. He took Duck's wife and children, whom he treated badly.\\" In Internet and multimedia studies In online environments, there has been a link between the trickster and Internet trolling. Some have said that a trickster is a type of online community character.Campbell, J., Fletcher, G. & Greenhill, A. (2002). \\"Tribalism, Conflict and Shape-shifting Identities in Online Communities.\\" In the Proceedings of the 13th Australasia Conference on Information Systems, Melbourne Australia, 7‚Äì9 December 2002Campbell, J., Fletcher, G. and Greenhill, A. (2009). \\"Conflict and Identity Shape Shifting in an Online Financial Community\\", Information Systems Journal, (19:5), pp. 461‚Äì478. . Anthropologist James Cuffe has called the Chinese internet character Grass Mud Horse (ËçâÊ≥•È©¨Ôºâa trickster candidate because of its duplicity in meaning. Cuffe argues the Grass Mud Horse serves to highlight the creative potential of the trickster archetype in communicating experiential understanding through symbolic narrative. The Grass Mud Horse relies on the interpretative capacity of storytelling in order to skirt internet censorship while simultaneously commenting on the experience of censorship in China. In this sense Cuffe proposes the Grass Mud Horse trickster as 'a heuristic cultural function to aid the perceiver to re-evaluate their own experiential understanding against that of their communities. By framing itself against and in spite of limits the trickster offers new coordinates by which one can reassess and judges one's own experiences.'

Local kings and princes took the opportunity of troubled times to try to reassert themselves. The various governments in the homeland tried various means to retrieve matters, including troop reinforcements and reforms, finally formally taking over the government functions of the VOC. Siberg resisted many of the reforms, and continued to do so after being removed from office. Early career Johannes (or Joannes) Siberg born on 14 October 1740 in Rotterdam. When he was 18 years old, he left for the Indies as a contabelsmaat (assistant artillery master). He soon gave up the sea and climbed expertly through the Company's ranks - Underbuyer (onderkoopman) in 1770, Buyer (koopman) in 1771, to reach Senior Buyer (opperkoopman) in 1776. He married the daughter of Willem Arnold Alting (soon to be Governor-General) and shortly after that left for Panang to be the governor (gezaghebber) of Sumatra's West Coast. In 1780, he became Governor and Director of Java's Northwest Coast. He occupied this extremely lucrative post for seven years and became enormously wealthy. Meanwhile, in 1782 he became Counsellor- extraordinary (buitengewoon Raad) in the Dutch Council of the Indies. After returning to Batavia, in 1787, he became President of the Schepenbank (the Bench of Aldermen, dealing with local administration), as well as a colonel in the local militia. In 1791, he was appointed full Counsellor of the Indies (Raad van Indi√´); in 1793 he was First Counsellor and Director-General (Eerste Raad en Directeur-Generaal). At the same time his father-in-law managed to get him appointed one of the three Commissies-generaal (General Commissioners sent to re-organise the Dutch possessions in the face of British and French incursions, as well as restive native rulers). This duo managed to concentrate a lot of power in their hands, and those of their wider family attachments, especially after the new Batavian Republic merged the Commissie-generaal with the Raad van Indi√´ (Council of the Indies). In 1800, the Batavian Republic took over formal control of the government of Nederlands-Indi√´ (as it was now called) and vested authority in Council for the Asian Possessions, (Raad der Aziatische Bezittingen) whose combined assembly was packed with family members. They acted as a brake on much needed reforms, and lost ground to the British in particular. Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies In 1801, following the death of his predecessor, Pieter Gerardus van Overstraten, he became acting Governor-General, and, one year later, was confirmed in the full, official function by the Batavian Republic. In 1802, the Peace of Amiens (ending the first phase of the Napoleonic Wars) also ended the Dutch trading monopoly, and they came under increasing British pressure. Following accusations of corruption and financial bungling, he was removed from office in 1805. In 1806, the Kingdom of Holland replaced the Batavian Republic. The new (Napoleonic) Kingdom established a Ministry of the Colonies to deal with Indian affairs. The new Governor-General Albertus Henricus Wiese was charged with making much needed reforms. Siberg, however, remained in the Indies, as leader of the Oudgastenpartij, a group of conservative landowners and merchants, still influencing (or interfering with, or frustrating, according to taste) his successors' attempts at reforms.

In mathematics, the irrational numbers are all the real numbers which are not rational numbers. That is, irrational numbers cannot be expressed as the ratio of two integers. When the ratio of lengths of two line segments is an irrational number, the line segments are also described as being incommensurable, meaning that they share no \\"measure\\" in common, that is, there is no length (\\"the measure\\"), no matter how short, that could be used to express the lengths of both of the two given segments as integer multiples of itself.

Like all real numbers, irrational numbers can be expressed in positional notation, notably as a decimal number. In the case of irrational numbers, the decimal expansion does not terminate, nor end with a repeating sequence. For example, the decimal representation of starts with 3.14159, but no finite number of digits can represent exactly, nor does it repeat. Conversely, a decimal expansion that terminates or repeats must be a rational number. These are provable properties of rational numbers and positional number systems, and are not used as definitions in mathematics. Irrational numbers can also be expressed as non-terminating continued fractions and many other ways. As a consequence of Cantor's proof that the real numbers are uncountable and the rationals countable, it follows that almost all real numbers are irrational.  History  Set of real numbers (R), which include the rationals (Q), which include the integers (Z), which include the natural numbers (N). The real numbers also include the irrationals (R\\\\Q). = Ancient Greece = The first proof of the existence of irrational numbers is usually attributed to a Pythagorean (possibly Hippasus of Metapontum), who probably discovered them while identifying sides of the pentagram.. The then-current Pythagorean method would have claimed that there must be some sufficiently small, indivisible unit that could fit evenly into one of these lengths as well as the other. However, Hippasus, in the 5th century BC, was able to deduce that there was in fact no common unit of measure, and that the assertion of such an existence was in fact a contradiction. He did this by demonstrating that if the hypotenuse of an isosceles right triangle was indeed commensurable with a leg, then one of those lengths measured in that unit of measure must be both odd and even, which is impossible. His reasoning is as follows: * Start with an isosceles right triangle with side lengths of integers a, b, and c. The ratio of the hypotenuse to a leg is represented by c:b. * Assume a, b, and c are in the smallest possible terms (i.e. they have no common factors). * By the Pythagorean theorem: c2 = a2+b2 = b2+b2 = 2b2. (Since the triangle is isosceles, a = b). * Since c2 = 2b2, c2 is divisible by 2, and therefore even. * Since c2 is even, c must be even. * Since c is even, dividing c by 2 yields an integer. Let y be this integer (c = 2y). * Squaring both sides of c = 2y yields c2 = (2y)2, or c2 = 4y2. * Substituting 4y2 for c2 in the first equation (c2 = 2b2) gives us 4y2= 2b2. * Dividing by 2 yields 2y2 = b2. * Since y is an integer, and 2y2 = b2, b2 is divisible by 2, and therefore even. * Since b2 is even, b must be even. * We have just shown that both b and c must be even. Hence they have a common factor of 2. However this contradicts the assumption that they have no common factors. This contradiction proves that c and b cannot both be integers, and thus the existence of a number that cannot be expressed as a ratio of two integers.Kline, M. (1990). Mathematical Thought from Ancient to Modern Times, Vol. 1. New York: Oxford University Press. (Original work published 1972). p.33. Greek mathematicians termed this ratio of incommensurable magnitudes alogos, or inexpressible. Hippasus, however, was not lauded for his efforts: according to one legend, he made his discovery while out at sea, and was subsequently thrown overboard by his fellow Pythagoreans ‚Äú‚Ä¶for having produced an element in the universe which denied the‚Ä¶doctrine that all phenomena in the universe can be reduced to whole numbers and their ratios.‚ÄùKline 1990, p. 32. Another legend states that Hippasus was merely exiled for this revelation. Whatever the consequence to Hippasus himself, his discovery posed a very serious problem to Pythagorean mathematics, since it shattered the assumption that number and geometry were inseparable-a foundation of their theory. The discovery of incommensurable ratios was indicative of another problem facing the Greeks: the relation of the discrete to the continuous. This was brought into light by Zeno of Elea, who questioned the conception that quantities are discrete and composed of a finite number of units of a given size. Past Greek conceptions dictated that they necessarily must be, for ‚Äúwhole numbers represent discrete objects, and a commensurable ratio represents a relation between two collections of discrete objects,‚ÄùKline 1990, p.34. but Zeno found that in fact ‚Äú[quantities] in general are not discrete collections of units; this is why ratios of incommensurable [quantities] appear‚Ä¶.[Q]uantities are, in other words, continuous.‚Äù What this means is that, contrary to the popular conception of the time, there cannot be an indivisible, smallest unit of measure for any quantity. That in fact, these divisions of quantity must necessarily be infinite. For example, consider a line segment: this segment can be split in half, that half split in half, the half of the half in half, and so on. This process can continue infinitely, for there is always another half to be split. The more times the segment is halved, the closer the unit of measure comes to zero, but it never reaches exactly zero. This is just what Zeno sought to prove. He sought to prove this by formulating four paradoxes, which demonstrated the contradictions inherent in the mathematical thought of the time. While Zeno's paradoxes accurately demonstrated the deficiencies of current mathematical conceptions, they were not regarded as proof of the alternative. In the minds of the Greeks, disproving the validity of one view did not necessarily prove the validity of another, and therefore further investigation had to occur. The next step was taken by Eudoxus of Cnidus, who formalized a new theory of proportion that took into account commensurable as well as incommensurable quantities. Central to his idea was the distinction between magnitude and number. A magnitude ‚Äú...was not a number but stood for entities such as line segments, angles, areas, volumes, and time which could vary, as we would say, continuously. Magnitudes were opposed to numbers, which jumped from one value to another, as from 4 to 5.‚ÄùKline 1990, p.48. Numbers are composed of some smallest, indivisible unit, whereas magnitudes are infinitely reducible. Because no quantitative values were assigned to magnitudes, Eudoxus was then able to account for both commensurable and incommensurable ratios by defining a ratio in terms of its magnitude, and proportion as an equality between two ratios. By taking quantitative values (numbers) out of the equation, he avoided the trap of having to express an irrational number as a number. ‚ÄúEudoxus‚Äô theory enabled the Greek mathematicians to make tremendous progress in geometry by supplying the necessary logical foundation for incommensurable ratios.‚ÄùKline 1990, p.49. This incommensurability is dealt with in Euclid's Elements, Book X, Proposition 9. As a result of the distinction between number and magnitude, geometry became the only method that could take into account incommensurable ratios. Because previous numerical foundations were still incompatible with the concept of incommensurability, Greek focus shifted away from those numerical conceptions such as algebra and focused almost exclusively on geometry. In fact, in many cases algebraic conceptions were reformulated into geometric terms. This may account for why we still conceive of x2 and x3 as x squared and x cubed instead of x to the second power and x to the third power. Also crucial to Zeno‚Äôs work with incommensurable magnitudes was the fundamental focus on deductive reasoning that resulted from the foundational shattering of earlier Greek mathematics. The realization that some basic conception within the existing theory was at odds with reality necessitated a complete and thorough investigation of the axioms and assumptions that underlie that theory. Out of this necessity, Eudoxus developed his method of exhaustion, a kind of reductio ad absurdum that ‚Äú...established the deductive organization on the basis of explicit axioms...‚Äù as well as ‚Äú...reinforced the earlier decision to rely on deductive reasoning for proof.‚ÄùKline 1990, p.50. This method of exhaustion is the first step in the creation of calculus. Theodorus of Cyrene proved the irrationality of the surds of whole numbers up to 17, but stopped there probably because the algebra he used could not be applied to the square root of 17.. It was not until Eudoxus developed a theory of proportion that took into account irrational as well as rational ratios that a strong mathematical foundation of irrational numbers was created. =India= Geometrical and mathematical problems involving irrational numbers such as square roots were addressed very early during the Vedic period in India. There are references to such calculations in the Samhitas, Brahmanas, and the Shulba Sutras (800 BC or earlier). (See Bag, Indian Journal of History of Science, 25(1-4), 1990). It is suggested that the concept of irrationality was implicitly accepted by Indian mathematicians since the 7th century BC, when Manava (c. 750 - 690 BC) believed that the square roots of numbers such as 2 and 61 could not be exactly determined.T. K. Puttaswamy, \\"The Accomplishments of Ancient Indian Mathematicians\\", pp. 411-2, in . However, historian Carl Benjamin Boyer writes that \\"such claims are not well substantiated and unlikely to be true\\". It is also suggested that Aryabhata (5th century AD), in calculating a value of pi to 5 significant figures, used the word ƒÅsanna (approaching), to mean that not only is this an approximation but that the value is incommensurable (or irrational). Later, in their treatises, Indian mathematicians wrote on the arithmetic of surds including addition, subtraction, multiplication, rationalization, as well as separation and extraction of square roots. Mathematicians like Brahmagupta (in 628 AD) and BhƒÅskara I (in 629 AD) made contributions in this area as did other mathematicians who followed. In the 12th century BhƒÅskara II evaluated some of these formulas and critiqued them, identifying their limitations. During the 14th to 16th centuries, Madhava of Sangamagrama and the Kerala school of astronomy and mathematics discovered the infinite series for several irrational numbers such as œÄ and certain irrational values of trigonometric functions. Jye·π£·π≠hadeva provided proofs for these infinite series in the YuktibhƒÅ·π£ƒÅ.Katz, V. J. (1995), \\"Ideas of Calculus in Islam and India\\", Mathematics Magazine (Mathematical Association of America) 68 (3): 163-74. =Middle Ages= In the Middle ages, the development of algebra by Muslim mathematicians allowed irrational numbers to be treated as algebraic objects.. Middle Eastern mathematicians also merged the concepts of \\"number\\" and \\"magnitude\\" into a more general idea of real numbers, criticized Euclid's idea of ratios, developed the theory of composite ratios, and extended the concept of number to ratios of continuous magnitude.. In his commentary on Book 10 of the Elements, the Persian mathematician Al-Mahani (d. 874/884) examined and classified quadratic irrationals and cubic irrationals. He provided definitions for rational and irrational magnitudes, which he treated as irrational numbers. He dealt with them freely but explains them in geometric terms as follows: In contrast to Euclid's concept of magnitudes as lines, Al- Mahani considered integers and fractions as rational magnitudes, and square roots and cube roots as irrational magnitudes. He also introduced an arithmetical approach to the concept of irrationality, as he attributes the following to irrational magnitudes: The Egyptian mathematician Ab≈´ KƒÅmil ShujƒÅ ibn Aslam (c. 850 - 930) was the first to accept irrational numbers as solutions to quadratic equations or as coefficients in an equation, often in the form of square roots, cube roots and fourth roots.Jacques Sesiano, \\"Islamic mathematics\\", p. 148, in . In the 10th century, the Iraqi mathematician Al-Hashimi provided general proofs (rather than geometric demonstrations) for irrational numbers, as he considered multiplication, division, and other arithmetical functions.. Iranian mathematician, Ab≈´ Ja'far al-KhƒÅzin (900-971) provides a definition of rational and irrational magnitudes, stating that if a definite quantity is:. Many of these concepts were eventually accepted by European mathematicians sometime after the Latin translations of the 12th century. Al-HassƒÅr, a Moroccan mathematician from Fez specializing in Islamic inheritance jurisprudence during the 12th century, first mentions the use of a fractional bar, where numerators and denominators are separated by a horizontal bar. In his discussion he writes, \\"..., for example, if you are told to write three-fifths and a third of a fifth, write thus, \\\\frac{3 \\\\quad 1}{5 \\\\quad 3}.\\" pg. 269. This same fractional notation appears soon after in the work of Leonardo Fibonacci in the 13th century. =Modern period= The 17th century saw imaginary numbers become a powerful tool in the hands of Abraham de Moivre, and especially of Leonhard Euler. The completion of the theory of complex numbers in the 19th century entailed the differentiation of irrationals into algebraic and transcendental numbers, the proof of the existence of transcendental numbers, and the resurgence of the scientific study of the theory of irrationals, largely ignored since Euclid. The year 1872 saw the publication of the theories of Karl Weierstrass (by his pupil Ernst Kossak), Eduard Heine (Crelle's Journal, 74), Georg Cantor (Annalen, 5), and Richard Dedekind. M√©ray had taken in 1869 the same point of departure as Heine, but the theory is generally referred to the year 1872. Weierstrass's method has been completely set forth by Salvatore Pincherle in 1880, and Dedekind's has received additional prominence through the author's later work (1888) and the endorsement by Paul Tannery (1894). Weierstrass, Cantor, and Heine base their theories on infinite series, while Dedekind founds his on the idea of a cut (Schnitt) in the system of all rational numbers, separating them into two groups having certain characteristic properties. The subject has received later contributions at the hands of Weierstrass, Leopold Kronecker (Crelle, 101), and Charles M√©ray. Continued fractions, closely related to irrational numbers (and due to Cataldi, 1613), received attention at the hands of Euler, and at the opening of the 19th century were brought into prominence through the writings of Joseph-Louis Lagrange. Dirichlet also added to the general theory, as have numerous contributors to the applications of the subject. Johann Heinrich Lambert proved (1761) that œÄ cannot be rational, and that en is irrational if n is rational (unless n = 0). While Lambert's proof is often called incomplete, modern assessments support it as satisfactory, and in fact for its time it is unusually rigorous. Adrien-Marie Legendre (1794), after introducing the Bessel-Clifford function, provided a proof to show that œÄ2 is irrational, whence it follows immediately that œÄ is irrational also. The existence of transcendental numbers was first established by Liouville (1844, 1851). Later, Georg Cantor (1873) proved their existence by a different method, which showed that every interval in the reals contains transcendental numbers. Charles Hermite (1873) first proved e transcendental, and Ferdinand von Lindemann (1882), starting from Hermite's conclusions, showed the same for œÄ. Lindemann's proof was much simplified by Weierstrass (1885), still further by David Hilbert (1893), and was finally made elementary by Adolf Hurwitz and Paul Gordan.  Examples  = Square roots = The square root of 2 was the first number proved irrational, and that article contains a number of proofs. The golden ratio is another famous quadratic irrational number. The square roots of all natural numbers which are not perfect squares are irrational and a proof may be found in quadratic irrationals. =General roots= The proof above for the square root of two can be generalized using the fundamental theorem of arithmetic. This asserts that every integer has a unique factorization into primes. Using it we can show that if a rational number is not an integer then no integral power of it can be an integer, as in lowest terms there must be a prime in the denominator that does not divide into the numerator whatever power each is raised to. Therefore, if an integer is not an exact th power of another integer, then that first integer's th root is irrational. = Logarithms = Perhaps the numbers most easy to prove irrational are certain logarithms. Here is a proof by contradiction that log2 3 is irrational (log2 3 ‚âà 1.58 > 0). Assume log2 3 is rational. For some positive integers m and n, we have : \\\\log_2 3 = \\\\frac{m}{n}. It follows that : 2^{m/n}=3 : (2^{m/n})^n = 3^n : 2^m=3^n. However, the number 2 raised to any positive integer power must be even (because it is divisible by 2) and the number 3 raised to any positive integer power must be odd (since none of its prime factors will be 2). Clearly, an integer cannot be both odd and even at the same time: we have a contradiction. The only assumption we made was that log2 3 is rational (and so expressible as a quotient of integers m/n with n ‚â† 0). The contradiction means that this assumption must be false, i.e. log2 3 is irrational, and can never be expressed as a quotient of integers m/n with n ‚â† 0\\\\. Cases such as log10 2 can be treated similarly. Types * number theoretic distinction : transcendental/algebraic * normal/ abnormal (non- normal) = Transcendental/algebraic = Almost all irrational numbers are transcendental and all real transcendental numbers are irrational (there are also complex transcendental numbers): the article on transcendental numbers lists several examples. So e r and œÄ r are irrational for all nonzero rational r, and, e.g., eœÄ is irrational, too. Irrational numbers can also be found within the countable set of real algebraic numbers (essentially defined as the real roots of polynomials with integer coefficients), i.e., as real solutions of polynomial equations :p(x) = a_nx^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + \\\\cdots + a_1x + a_0 = 0\\\\;, where the coefficients a_i are integers and a_n e 0. Any rational root of this polynomial equation must be of the form r /s, where r is a divisor of a0 and s is a divisor of an. If a real root x_0 of a polynomial p is not among these finitely many possibilities, it must be an irrational algebraic number. An exemplary proof for the existence of such algebraic irrationals is by showing that x0 = (21/2 + 1)1/3 is an irrational root of a polynomial with integer coefficients: it satisfies (x3 ‚àí 1)2 = 2 and hence x6 ‚àí 2x3 ‚àí 1 = 0, and this latter polynomial has no rational roots (the only candidates to check are ¬±1, and x0, being greater than 1, is neither of these), so x0 is an irrational algebraic number. Because the algebraic numbers form a subfield of the real numbers, many irrational real numbers can be constructed by combining transcendental and algebraic numbers. For example, 3 + 2, + and e are irrational (and even transcendental). Decimal expansions The decimal expansion of an irrational number never repeats or terminates (the latter being equivalent to repeating zeroes), unlike any rational number. The same is true for binary, octal or hexadecimal expansions, and in general for expansions in every positional notation with natural bases. To show this, suppose we divide integers n by m (where m is nonzero). When long division is applied to the division of n by m, only m remainders are possible. If 0 appears as a remainder, the decimal expansion terminates. If 0 never occurs, then the algorithm can run at most m ‚àí 1 steps without using any remainder more than once. After that, a remainder must recur, and then the decimal expansion repeats. Conversely, suppose we are faced with a repeating decimal, we can prove that it is a fraction of two integers. For example, consider: :A=0.7\\\\,162\\\\,162\\\\,162\\\\,\\\\ldots Here the repetend is 162 and the length of the repetend is 3. First, we multiply by an appropriate power of 10 to move the decimal point to the right so that it is just in front of a repetend. In this example we would multiply by 10 to obtain: :10A = 7.162\\\\,162\\\\,162\\\\,\\\\ldots Now we multiply this equation by 10r where r is the length of the repetend. This has the effect of moving the decimal point to be in front of the \\"next\\" repetend. In our example, multiply by 103: :10,000A=7\\\\,162.162\\\\,162\\\\,\\\\ldots The result of the two multiplications gives two different expressions with exactly the same \\"decimal portion\\", that is, the tail end of 10,000A matches the tail end of 10A exactly. Here, both 10,000A and 10A have after the decimal point. Therefore, when we subtract the 10A equation from the 10,000A equation, the tail end of 10A cancels out the tail end of 10,000A leaving us with: :9990A=7155. Then :A= \\\\frac{7155}{9990} is a ratio of integers and therefore a rational number.  Irrational powers  Dov Jarden gave a simple non-constructive proof that there exist two irrational numbers a and b, such that ab is rational: Consider ; if this is rational, then take a = b = . Otherwise, take a to be the irrational number and b = . Then ab = () = ¬∑ = 2 = 2, which is rational. Although the above argument does not decide between the two cases, the Gelfond‚ÄìSchneider theorem shows that is transcendental, hence irrational. This theorem states that if a and b are both algebraic numbers, and a is not equal to 0 or 1, and b is not a rational number, then any value of ab is a transcendental number (there can be more than one value if complex number exponentiation is used). An example that provides a simple constructive proof isLord, Nick, \\"Maths bite: irrational powers of irrational numbers can be rational\\", Mathematical Gazette 92, November 2008, p. 534. :\\\\left(\\\\sqrt{2}\\\\right)^{\\\\log_{\\\\sqrt{2}}3}=3. The base of the left side is irrational and the right side is rational, so one must prove that the exponent on the left side, \\\\log_{\\\\sqrt{2}}3, is irrational. This is so because, by the formula relating logarithms with different bases, :\\\\log_{\\\\sqrt{2}}3=\\\\frac{\\\\log_2 3}{\\\\log_2 \\\\sqrt{2}}=\\\\frac{\\\\log_2 3}{1/2} = 2\\\\log_2 3 which we can assume, for the sake of establishing a contradiction, equals a ratio m/n of positive integers. Then \\\\log_2 3 = m/2n hence 2^{\\\\log_2 3}=2^{m/2n} hence 3=2^{m/2n} hence 3^{2n}=2^m, which is a contradictory pair of prime factorizations and hence violates the fundamental theorem of arithmetic (unique prime factorization). A stronger result is the following:Marshall, Ash J., and Tan, Yiren, \\"A rational number of the form aa with a irrational\\", Mathematical Gazette 96, March 2012, pp. 106-109. Every rational number in the interval ((1/e)^{1/e}, \\\\infty) can be written either as aa for some irrational number a or as nn for some natural number n. Similarly, every positive rational number can be written either as a^{a^a} for some irrational number a or as n^{n^n} for some natural number n.  Open questions  It is not known if \\\\pi+e (or \\\\pi-e) is irrational. In fact, there is no pair of non-zero integers m, n for which it is known whether m\\\\pi+ n e is irrational. Moreover, it is not known if the set \\\\\\\\{\\\\pi, e\\\\\\\\} is algebraically independent over \\\\Q. It is not known if \\\\pi e,\\\\ \\\\pi/e,\\\\ 2^e,\\\\ \\\\pi^e,\\\\ \\\\pi^\\\\sqrt{2},\\\\ \\\\ln\\\\pi, Catalan's constant, or the Euler‚ÄìMascheroni constant \\\\gamma are irrational. (Senior Mathematics Seminar, Spring 2008 course) It is not known if either of the tetrations ^n\\\\pi or ^n e is rational for some integer n > 1.  Set of all irrationals  Since the reals form an uncountable set, of which the rationals are a countable subset, the complementary set of irrationals is uncountable. Under the usual (Euclidean) distance function d(x, y) = x ‚àí y, the real numbers are a metric space and hence also a topological space. Restricting the Euclidean distance function gives the irrationals the structure of a metric space. Since the subspace of irrationals is not closed, the induced metric is not complete. However, being a G-delta set--i.e., a countable intersection of open subsets--in a complete metric space, the space of irrationals is completely metrizable: that is, there is a metric on the irrationals inducing the same topology as the restriction of the Euclidean metric, but with respect to which the irrationals are complete. One can see this without knowing the aforementioned fact about G-delta sets: the continued fraction expansion of an irrational number defines a homeomorphism from the space of irrationals to the space of all sequences of positive integers, which is easily seen to be completely metrizable. Furthermore, the set of all irrationals is a disconnected metrizable space. In fact, the irrationals equipped with the subspace topology have a basis of clopen sets so the space is zero-dimensional.

An early device in the PDA category (the Newton originated the term), it was the first to feature handwriting recognition. Apple started developing the platform in 1987 and shipped the first devices in 1993. Production officially ended on February 27, 1998. Newton devices ran on a proprietary operating system, Newton OS; examples include Apple's MessagePad series and the eMate 300, and other companies also released devices running on Newton OS. Most Newton devices were based on the ARM 610 RISC processor and all featured handwriting-based input. The Newton was considered technologically innovative at its debut, but a combination of factors, some of which included its high price and early problems with its handwriting recognition feature, limited its sales. This led to Apple ultimately discontinuing the platform at the direction of Steve Jobs in 1998, a year after his return to the company. Three Newton MessagePad devices with keyboard and LinearFlash PCMCIA memory card accessories Development The custom ASIC chip inside the original Apple Newton H1000 Inside the Apple Newton Messagepad H1000, with back cover removed The original color Apple logo on the Newton The Newton project was a personal digital assistant platform. The PDA category did not exist for most of Newton's genesis, and the phrase \\"personal digital assistant\\" was coined relatively late in the development cycle by Apple's CEO John Sculley, the driving force behind the project. Larry Tesler determined that an advanced, low-power processor was needed for sophisticated graphics manipulation. He found Hermann Hauser, with the Acorn RISC Machine (ARM) processor, and put together Advanced RISC Machines (now ARM Holdings). When the move was made to a smaller design (designed by Jonathan Ive), the Dylan programming language, at one time intended for use with the Apple Newton (and for development of the Apple Newton operating system), was relegated to experimental status in the \\"Bauhaus Project\\" (and eventually canceled outright in 1995). Its replacement, NewtonScript, had garbage collection and tight integration with the \\"soup\\" storage and user-interface toolkit, and was specifically designed to run in environments with small RAM and large ROM. It was mostly developed by Walter Smith from 1992 to 1993. Newton used a mix of C/C++ and NewtonScript. Although PDAs had been developing since the original Psion Organiser in 1984,History of PDAs blog the Newton has left one particular lasting impression: the term personal digital assistant was first coined to refer to the Newton. According to former Apple CEO John Sculley, the company invested approximately $100 million to develop Newton. =Later history and cancellation= The Newton was considered innovative at its debut, but it suffered from its high price and problems with the handwriting recognition element, its most anticipated feature. The handwriting software was barely ready by 1993 and its tendency to misread characters was widely derided in the media. This was parodied in The Simpsons episode Lisa on Ice; where a scene makes fun of the Newton's handwriting recognition turning \\"Beat up Martin\\" into \\"Eat up Martha\\". Garry Trudeau also mocked the Newton in a weeklong arc of his comic strip Doonesbury, portraying it as a costly toy that served the same function as a cheap notepad, and using its accuracy problems to humorous effect. In one panel, Michael Doonesbury's Newton misreads the words \\"Catching on?\\" as \\"Egg Freckles\\", a phrase that became widely repeated as symbolic of the Newton's problems. This phrase was subsequently included as a trigger for an easter egg in later editions of the MessagePad, producing a panel from the strip when it was entered on the device. In acknowledgement of the strip, Apple subsequently gifted a MessagePad to Trudeau. Although the software improved substantially in Newton OS 2.0, it was not enough to inspire strong sales. The Newton became popular in some industries, notably the medical field. However, the debut of the competing Palm Pilot substantially reduced its market share. Apple struggled to find a new direction for the Newton, and when Steve Jobs returned to the company in 1997, he killed the product line. He was critical of the device's weak performance, the management of the development team, and the stylus, which he disliked as it prevented the use of the fingers. He was likely also motivated by the fact that the Newton was the pet project of his old adversary John Sculley. However, Jobs saw potential in the technology and concept, if not the execution, and eventually led Apple to create its multi-touch devices inspired by FingerWorks, the iPhone and iPad.

This included such applications as Notes, Names, and Dates, as well as a variety of productivity tools such as a calculator, conversion calculators (metric conversions, currency conversions, etc.), time-zone maps, etc. In later/2.x versions of the Newton OS these applications were refined, and new ones were added, such as the Works word processor and the Newton Internet Enabler, as well as the inclusion of bundled 3rd party applications, such as Notion: The Newton List Manager, the QuickFigure Works spreadsheet (a \\"lite\\" version of Pelicanware's QuickFigure Pro), Pocket Quicken, the NetHopper web browser, and the EnRoute email client. Various Newton applications had full import/export capabilities with popular desktop office suite and PIM (Personal Information Manager) application file formats, primarily by making use of Apple's bundled Newton Connection Utilities (or the older Newton Connection Kit, which had been sold separately for Newton devices that used the 1.x versions of the OS). Notes The Notes application allowed users to create small documents that could contain text that had been typed, or that had been recognized from handwriting, as well as free-hand sketches, \\"Shapes\\", and \\"ink text\\". checked and/or \\"collapsed\\" In version 2.0 of the Newton OS, the Notes application (as well as Names) could accept what Apple termed \\"stationery\\", 3rd-party created plug-in modules that could extend the functionality of the basic applications. One of the new types of Notes stationery added to Newton OS 2.0 was a hierarchical, bullet-ed, collapsible, multi-line \\"Checklist\\", an implementation of outliner software. This could be used for organizing thoughts, priorities, \\"to do\\" lists, planning steps and sub-tasks, etc. Each bullet point could contain as many lines of text as desired. A bullet point could be dragged and placed underneath another bullet point, thus forming a hierarchical outline/tree. When a bullet point was dragged, the entire sub- tree of child bullet points underneath it (if any) would be dragged along as well. If a bullet point had child bullet points, tapping the hollow parent bullet point once would \\"roll up\\" or collapse all the children (\\"windowshade\\" effect). The parent bullet point would become a solid black circle and all the children would disappear. Tapping the parent bullet point again would make the children re-appear. This functionality arrived in Newton OS 2.0, but several third parties made similar software previously for OS 1.x Newton machines, the most notable of which was Dyno Notepad, released in 1993. Names The Names application was used for storing contacts. Contacts created either on the Newton device or on a Windows or Macintosh desktop PIM could be synchronized to each other.Apple Computer. \\"Newton Connection Utilities ReadMe\\" , Apple, July 24, 1997Apple Computer. \\"Newton Connection Utilities Features\\", Newton Source Entering a date in Names for fields such as birthday or anniversary automatically created corresponding repeating events in the Dates application. Each contact had an attached free-form notes field available to it, that could contain any mix of interleaved text, ink text, Shapes, or Sketches. Like Notes, Names could be extended by developers, to create special new categories of contacts with specialized pre-defined fields. Names shipped with 3 types of contacts, \\"people\\", \\"companies\\", and \\"groups\\", but a developer could define new types, for instance \\"client\\", \\"patient\\", etc. Stand Alone Software, Inc. also created a Newton software package called the Stationery Construction Kit, which allowed users to make stationery themselves without aid of any other tools. Dates Dates supplied calendar, events, meeting, and alarms functions, including an integrated \\"to do\\" list manager. It offered many different display and navigation styles, including a list view, graphical day \\"time blocking\\" view, or a week, month, or year grid. As with Names and Notes, Dates items created either on the Newton or on a Windows or Macintosh desktop PIM could be synchronized to each other. =Operating system and programming environment= The Newton OS consists of three layers. At the lowest level, a microkernel handles resources like tasks and memory. On top of the microkernel, the bulk of the operating system is implemented in C++, including the communications layer, handwriting recognition, and the NewtonScript environment. The top layer consists of built-in and user installed applications written in NewtonScript. NewtonScript is an advanced object-oriented programming language, developed by Apple employee Walter Smith. Some programmers complained at the $1000 cost of the Toolbox programming environment. Additionally, it required learning a new way of programming. The Newton Toolkit (NTK), an integrated environment tailored to the graphical nature of the Newton platform, was developed specifically for developing applications for the Newton platform and included a graphical view editor, a template browser, and an interactive inspector window for debugging. Initially, it was only available for Macintosh computers, and later a Microsoft Windows version was developed. The Technical Lead for the Newton Toolkit was Norberto Menendez; other engineers on the team were Ben Sharpe and Peter Potrebic. =Data storage= Data in Newton is stored in object-oriented databases known as soups. One of the innovative aspects of Newton is that soups are available to all programs; and programs can operate cross-soup; meaning that the calendar can refer to names in the address book; a note in the notepad can be converted to an appointment, and so forth; and the soups can be programmer-extended‚Äîa new address book enhancement can be built on the data from the existing address book. The soup system also made it easy to synchronize data, and the Newton Connection tools could be used for importing and exporting data. Among many file formats are the Rich Text Format, Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel, Microsoft Works, and many more. Another consequence of the data-object soup is that objects can extend built-in applications such as the address book so seamlessly that Newton users can sometimes not distinguish which program or add-on object is responsible for the various features on their own system, because the advanced nature of Newton devices makes it easy to accept such add-ons. A user rebuilding their system after extended usage might find themselves unable to manually restore their system to the same functionality because some long-forgotten downloaded extension was missing. Data owned and used by applications and extensions themselves is tossed in the \\"Storage\\" area of the \\"Extras\\" drawer in 2.x Newton devices; on 1.x systems, they can only be found or removed in the Memory section of the built-in Prefs application, in the Card slip (also built-in), or with third-party tools such as NewtCase. There is no built-in distinction between types of data in that area. For example, an installed application's icon could be sitting right next to a database of addresses used by another installed extension further down the list. Finally, the data soup concept works well for data like addresses, which benefit from being shared cross-functionally, but it works poorly for discrete data sets like files and documents. Later, the 2.0 release of the Newton OS introduced Virtual Binary Objects to alleviate the problem of handling large data objects. =Package installation, capacity planning, and disaster recovery= Several software utilities which accommodate data transfer to and from a host system exist for the following platforms: * Mac OS * OS X * UNIX * Linux * Microsoft Windows Newton technology after cancellation Before the Newton project was canceled, it was \\"spun off\\" into an Apple wholly owned subsidiary company, Newton Inc., but was reabsorbed several months later when Apple CEO Gil Amelio was fired by the board and Steve Jobs took over as then interim CEO. Two ex- Apple Newton developers founded Pixo, the company that created the operating system for the original iPod. Speculation continued for several years that Apple might release a new PDA with some Newton technology or collaborate with Palm. Feeding a bit of speculation, Apple put the \\"Print Recognizer\\" part of the Newton 2.1 handwriting recognition system into Mac OS X v10.2 (known as \\"Jaguar\\"). It can be used with graphics tablets to seamlessly input handwritten printed text anywhere there was an insertion point on the screen. This technology, known as \\"Inkwell\\", appears in the System Preferences whenever a tablet input device is plugged in. An Easter egg in Print Recognizer on the Newton (write \\"ROSETTA! ROSETTA! ROSETTA!\\", and the Newton will insert \\"ROSETTA! ROSETTA! Hey, that's me!\\" instead) was present in Inkwell in Mac OS 10.2 and 10.3, but seems to have been removed in 10.4. Larry Yaeger was the author of the original Rosetta recognizer on the Newton, and was also responsible for porting it to Mac OS X.Handwriting Recognition Technology in the Newton's Second Generation \\"Print Recognizer\\" (The One That Worked), By Larry Yaeger Apple Computer, World Wide Newton Conference, September 4‚Äì5, 2004, Slides The Rosetta name was later used for Apple's PowerPC software translation layer for Intel-based Macs. Some of the handwriting recognition technology from the Newton later found its way into Windows CE. The letter preferences menus showing the different ways that people write cursive characters were pixel identical on Windows CE to those previously used on the MessagePad.. At an All Things Digital conference in 2004, Steve Jobs made reference to a new \\"Apple PDA\\" (perhaps a successor to the Newton) which the company had developed but had decided not to bring to market.Jobs: Apple developed, but did not ship Apple PDA, By Kasper Jade, June 7, 2004, AppleInsider The tablet likely eventually evolved into the iPhone or iPad.. =Newton emulation= Since 2004, the Einstein Project has been working on emulating the Newton for use as an alternative OS on other platforms. It is currently available for the Sharp Zaurus, Apple's Mac OS X, Nokia Maemo, Microsoft Windows, and the Pepper Pad 3. The emulator is an open source project, but requires an original Newton ROM to be installed in order to function. iPhones and iPads run Einstein since September 2010. The Android operating system runs Einstein since March 2011.Apple Newton on Android, March 13, 2011, My Apple Newton =Future= A possible Newton revival was at one time a common source of speculation among the Macintosh user base; when patents for a tablet based Macintosh were applied for,Appleinsider, Euro filing reveals Apple handheld design images, August 13, 2004 rumor sites jumped at the possibility of a new tablet PC-style Macintosh. This later turned out to be the iPad, which currently runs Apple's proprietary iPadOS System Software. In September 2009, Michael Tchao, who pitched the original Newton concept to John Sculley,Remembering the Apple Newton's Prophetic Failure and Lasting Impact, Wired, August 2013, https://www.wired.com/2013/08/remembering-the-apple-newtons-prophetic-failure- and-lasting-ideals/ returned to Apple. Michael Tchao is now the VP of iPad Product Marketing. =Development= Programs have been written for the Newton since its cancellation, including an RSS reader. Hardware mods made by Newton users included a board for USB connectivity, headphone jacks, and replacing the backlight with different colors. In popular culture In Serial Experiments Lain, a common portable computing device, known as a HandiNavi (named after the Apple product concept, The Knowledge Navigator), is heavily influenced by the Newton. During Apple's March 21, 2016, keynote conference, a celebration video called \\"40 Years in 40 Seconds\\" was unveiled. The video featured flashing text of names from Apple's most notable products and taglines in their forty-year history, including Newton. However, in Newton's case, it was the only name depicted in the video being explicitly scratched out, mimicking how users deleted text on the device, and referencing the full cancellation of the product line.Hackett, Stephen (March 22, 2016) Apple‚Äôs ‚Äô40 Years in 40 Seconds‚Äô Video Annotated 512 Pixels (blog).

Common symptoms in humans and other animals include: red or reddish skin that is hot to the touch or painful, general fatigue, and mild dizziness. Excessive UV radiation can be life-threatening in extreme cases. Excessive UV radiation is the leading cause of, primarily, non-malignant skin tumors.World Health Organization, International Agency for Research on Cancer \\"Do sunscreens prevent skin cancer\\" Press release No. 132, 5 June 2000World Health Organization, International Agency for Research on Cancer \\"Solar and ultraviolet radiation\\" IARC Monographs on the Evaluation of Carcinogenic Risks to Humans, Volume 55, November 1997 Sunburn is an inflammatory response in the tissue triggered by direct DNA damage by UV radiation. When the cells' DNA is overly damaged by UV radiation, type I cell-death is triggered and the tissue is replaced. Sun protective measures including sunscreen and sun protective clothing are widely accepted to prevent sunburn and some types of skin cancer. Special populations, including children, are especially susceptible to sunburn and protective measures should be used to prevent damage. Signs and symptoms Blisters on a shoulder caused by sunburn Typically, there is initial redness, followed by varying degrees of pain, proportional in severity to both the duration and intensity of exposure. Other symptoms can include blistering, swelling (edema), pruritus (itching), peeling skin, rash, nausea, fever, chills, and fainting (syncope). Also, a small amount of heat is given off from the burn, caused by the concentration of blood in the healing process, giving a warm feeling to the affected area. Sunburns may be classified as superficial, or partial thickness burns. Blistering is a sign of second degree sunburn. =Variations= Minor sunburns typically cause nothing more than slight redness and tenderness to the affected areas. In more serious cases, blistering can occur. Extreme sunburns can be painful to the point of debilitation and may require hospital care. =Duration= Sunburn can occur in less than 15 minutes, and in seconds when exposed to non-shielded welding arcs or other sources of intense ultraviolet light. Nevertheless, the inflicted harm is often not immediately obvious. After the exposure, skin may turn red in as little as 30 minutes but most often takes 2 to 6 hours. Pain is usually strongest 6 to 48 hours after exposure. The burn continues to develop for 1 to 3 days, occasionally followed by peeling skin in 3 to 8 days. Some peeling and itching may continue for several weeks. =Skin cancer= Ultraviolet radiation causes sunburns and increases the risk of three types of skin cancer: melanoma, basal-cell carcinoma and squamous-cell carcinoma.\\"Facts About Sunburn and Skin Cancer\\", Skin Cancer Foundation Of greatest concern is that the melanoma risk increases in a dose-dependent manner with the number of a person's lifetime cumulative episodes of sunburn. It has been estimated that over 1/3 of melanomas in the United States and Australia could be prevented with regular sunscreen use. Causes The cause of sunburn is the direct damage that a UVB photon can induce in DNA (left). One of the possible reactions from the excited state is the formation of a thymine-thymine cyclobutane dimer (right). Sunburn is caused by UV radiation, either from the sun or from artificial sources, such as tanning lamps, welding arcs, or ultraviolet germicidal irradiation. It is a reaction of the body to direct DNA damage from UVB light. This damage is mainly the formation of a thymine dimer. The damage is recognized by the body, which then triggers several defense mechanisms, including DNA repair to revert the damage, apoptosis and peeling to remove irreparably damaged skin cells, and increased melanin production to prevent future damage. Melanin readily absorbs UV wavelength light, acting as a photoprotectant. By preventing UV photons from disrupting chemical bonds, melanin inhibits both the direct alteration of DNA and the generation of free radicals, thus indirect DNA damage. However human melanocytes contain over 2,000 genomic sites that are highly sensitive to UV, and such sites can be up to 170-fold more sensitive to UV induction of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers than the average sitePremi S, Han L, Mehta S, Knight J, Zhao D, Palmatier MA, Kornacker K, Brash DE. Genomic sites hypersensitive to ultraviolet radiation. Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2019 Nov 26;116(48):24196-24205. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1907860116. Epub 2019 Nov 13. PMID: 31723047 These sensitive sites often occur at biologically significant locations near genes. Sunburn causes an inflammation process, including production of prostanoids and bradykinin. These chemical compounds increase sensitivity to heat by reducing the threshold of heat receptor (TRPV1) activation from to . The pain may be caused by overproduction of a protein called CXCL5, which activates nerve fibres. Skin type determines the ease of sunburn. In general, people with lighter skin tone and limited capacity to develop a tan after UV radiation exposure have a greater risk of sunburn. The Fitzpatrick's Skin phototypes classification describes the normal variations of skin responses to UV radiation. Persons with type I skin have the greatest capacity to sunburn and type VI have the least capacity to burn. However, all skin types can develop sunburn. Fitzpatrick's skin phototypes: * (Albino) *Type I: Pale white skin, burns easily, does not tan * Type II: White skin, burns easily, tans with difficulty * Type III: White skin, may burn but tans easily * Type IV: Light brown/olive skin, hardly burns, tans easily * Type V: Brown skin, usually does not burn, tans easily * Type VI: Black skin, very unlikely to burn, becomes darker with UV radiation exposure Age also affects how skin reacts to sun. Children younger than six and adults older than sixty are more sensitive to sunlight. There are certain genetic conditions, for example xeroderma pigmentosum, that increase a person's susceptibility to sunburn and subsequent skin cancers. These conditions involve defects in DNA repair mechanisms which in turn decreases the ability to repair DNA that has been damaged by UV radiation. =Medications= The risk of a sunburn can be increased by pharmaceutical products that sensitize users to UV radiation. Certain antibiotics, oral contraceptives, antidepressants, acne medications, and tranquillizers have this effect.\\"Avoiding Sun-Related Skin Damage\\". Fact- Sheets.com. 2004. Retrieved 3 January 2015. =UV intensity= The UV Index indicates the risk of getting a sunburn at a given time and location. Contributing factors include: # The time of day. In most locations, the sun's rays are strongest between approximately 10am and 4pm daylight saving time. # Cloud cover. UV is partially blocked by clouds; but even on an overcast day, a significant percentage of the sun's damaging UV radiation can pass through clouds. # Proximity to reflective surfaces, such as water, sand, concrete, snow, and ice. All of these reflect the sun's rays and can cause sunburns. # The season of the year. The position of the sun in late spring and early summer can cause a more-severe sunburn. # Altitude. At a higher altitude it is easier to become burnt, because there is less of the earth's atmosphere to block the sunlight. UV exposure increases about 4% for every 1000 ft (305 m) gain in elevation. # Proximity to the equator (latitude). Between the polar and tropical regions, the closer to the equator, the more direct sunlight passes through the atmosphere over the course of a year. For example, the southern United States gets fifty percent more sunlight than the northern United States. Erythemal dose rate at three Northern latitudes. (Divide by 25 to obtain the UV Index.) Source: NOAA. Because of variations in the intensity of UV radiation passing through the atmosphere, the risk of sunburn increases with proximity to the tropic latitudes, located between 23.5¬∞ north and south latitude. All else being equal (e.g., cloud cover, ozone layer, terrain, etc.), over the course of a full year, each location within the tropic or polar regions receives approximately the same amount of UV radiation. In the temperate zones between 23.5¬∞ and 66.5¬∞, UV radiation varies substantially by latitude and season. The higher the latitude, the lower the intensity of the UV rays. Intensity in the northern hemisphere is greatest during the months of May, June and July ‚Äî and in the southern hemisphere, November, December and January. On a minute-by-minute basis, the amount of UV radiation is dependent on the angle of the sun. This is easily determined by the height ratio of any object to the size of its shadow (if the height is measured vertical to the earth's gravitational field, the projected shadow is ideally measured on a flat, level surface; furthermore, for objects wider than skulls or poles, the height and length are best measured relative to the same occluding edge). The greatest risk is at solar noon, when shadows are at their minimum and the sun's radiation passes most directly through the atmosphere. Regardless of one's latitude (assuming no other variables), equal shadow lengths mean equal amounts of UV radiation. The skin and eyes are most sensitive to damage by UV at 265‚Äì275 nm wavelength, which is in the lower UVC band that is almost never encountered except from artificial sources like welding arcs. Most sunburn is caused by longer wavelengths, simply because those are more prevalent in sunlight at ground level. =Ozone depletion= In recent decades, the incidence and severity of sunburn have increased worldwide, partly because of chemical damage to the atmosphere's ozone layer. Between the 1970s and the 2000s, average stratospheric ozone decreased by approximately 4%, contributing an approximate 4% increase to the average UV intensity at the earth's surface. Ozone depletion and the seasonal \\"ozone hole\\" have led to much larger changes in some locations, especially in the southern hemisphere. =Tanning= Suntans, which naturally develop in some individuals as a protective mechanism against the sun, are viewed by most in the Western world as desirable. This has led to an overall increase in exposure to UV radiation from both the natural sun and tanning lamps. Suntans can provide a modest sun protection factor (SPF) of 3, meaning that tanned skin would tolerate up to three times the UV exposure as pale skin. Sunburns associated with indoor tanning can be severe. The World Health Organization, American Academy of Dermatology, and the Skin Cancer Foundation recommend avoiding artificial UV sources such as tanning beds, and do not recommend suntans as a form of sun protection.  Diagnosis  = Differential diagnosis = The differential diagnosis of sunburn includes other skin pathology induced by UV radiation including photoallergic reactions, phototoxic reactions to topical or systemic medications, and other dermatologic disorders that are aggravated by exposure to sunlight. Considerations for diagnosis include duration and intensity of UV exposure, use of topical or systemic medications, history of dermatologic disease, and nutritional status. * Phototoxic reactions: Non-immunological response to sunlight interacting with certain drugs and chemicals in the skin which resembles an exaggerated sunburn. Common drugs that may cause a phototoxic reaction include amiodarone, dacarbazine, fluoroquinolones, 5-fluorouracil, furosemide, nalidixic acid, phenothiazines, psoralens, retinoids, sulfonamides, sulfonylureas, tetracyclines, thiazides, and vinblastine. * Photoallergic reactions: Uncommon immunological response to sunlight interacting with certain drugs and chemicals in the skin. When in excited state by UVR, these drugs and chemicals form free radicals that react to form functional antigens and induce a Type IV hypersensitivity reaction. These drugs include 6-methylcoumarin, aminobenzoic acid and esters, chlorpromazine, promethazine, diclofenac, sulfonamides, and sulfonylureas. Unlike phototoxic reactions which resemble exaggerated sunburns, photoallergic reactions can cause intense itching and can lead to thickening of the skin. * Phytophotodermatitis: UV radiation induces inflammation of the skin after contact with certain plants (including limes, celery, and meadow grass). Causes pain, redness, and blistering of the skin in the distribution of plant exposure. * Polymorphic light eruption: Recurrent abnormal reaction to UVR. It can present in various ways including pink-to-red bumps, blisters, plaques and urticaria. * Solar urticaria: UVR-induced wheals that occurs within minutes of exposure and fades within hours. * Other skin diseases exacerbated by sunlight: Several dermatologic conditions can increase in severity with exposure to UVR. These include systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), dermatomyositis, acne, atopic dermatitis, and rosacea. Additionally, since sunburn is a type of radiation burn,https://www.webmd.com/first-aid/types- degrees- burnshttps://www.urmc.rochester.edu/encyclopedia/content.aspx?contenttypeid=85&contentid;=P00317 it can initially hide a severe exposure to radioactivity resulting in acute radiation syndrome or other radiation-induced illnesses, especially if the exposure occurred under sunny conditions. For instance, the difference between the erythema caused by sunburn and other radiation burns is not immediately obvious. Symptoms common to heat illness and the prodromic stage of acute radiation syndrome like nausea, vomiting, fever, weakness/fatigue, dizziness or seizurehttps://www.cdc.gov/nceh/radiation/emergencies/ars.htm?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Femergency.cdc.gov%2Fradiation%2Fars.asp can add to further diagnostic confusion. Prevention Sunburn effect (as measured by the UV Index) is the product of the sunlight spectrum at the earth's surface (radiation intensity) and the erythemal action spectrum (skin sensitivity). Long-wavelength UV is more prevalent, but each milliwatt at 295 nm produces almost 100 times more sunburn than at 315 nm. Sunburn peeling on the arm ‚Äì the destruction of lower layers of the epidermis causes rapid loss of the top layers. The most effective way to prevent sunburn is to reduce the amount of UV radiation reaching the skin. The World Health Organization, American Academy of Dermatology, and Skin Cancer Foundation recommend the following measures to prevent excessive UV exposure and skin cancer: * Limiting sun exposure between the hours of 10am and 4pm, when UV rays are the strongest * Seeking shade when UV rays are most intense * Wearing sun- protective clothing including a wide brim hat, sunglasses, and tightly-woven, loose-fitting clothing * Using sunscreen * Avoiding tanning beds and artificial UV exposure = UV intensity = The strength of sunlight is published in many locations as a UV Index. Sunlight is generally strongest when the sun is close to the highest point in the sky. Due to time zones and daylight saving time, this is not necessarily at 12 noon, but often one to two hours later. Seeking shade including using umbrellas and canopies can reduce the amount of UV exposure, but does not block all UV rays. The WHO recommends following the shadow rule: \\"Watch your shadow ‚Äì Short shadow, seek shade!\\" = Sunscreen = Commercial preparations are available that block UV light, known as sunscreens or sunblocks. They have a sun protection factor (SPF) rating, based on the sunblock's ability to suppress sunburn: The higher the SPF rating, the lower the amount of direct DNA damage. The stated protection factors are correct only if 2 mg of sunscreen is applied per square cm of exposed skin. This translates into about 28 mL (1 oz) to cover the whole body of an adult male, which is much more than many people use in practice. Sunscreens function as chemicals such as oxybenzone and dioxybenzone that absorb UV radiation (chemical sunscreens) or opaque materials such as zinc oxide or titanium oxide to physically block UV radiation (physical sunscreens). Chemical and mineral sunscreens vary in the wavelengths of UV radiation blocked. Broad-spectrum sunscreens contain filters that protect against UVA radiation as well as UVB. Although UVA radiation does not primarily cause sunburn, it does contribute to skin aging and an increased risk of skin cancer. Sunscreen is effective and thus recommended for preventing melanoma and squamous cell carcinoma. There is little evidence that it is effective in preventing basal cell carcinoma. Typical use of sunscreen does not usually result in vitamin D deficiency, but extensive usage may.  Recommendations  Research has shown that the best sunscreen protection is achieved by application 15 to 30 minutes before exposure, followed by one reapplication 15 to 30 minutes after exposure begins. Further reapplication is necessary only after activities such as swimming, sweating, and rubbing. This varies based on the indications and protection shown on the label ‚Äî from as little as 80 minutes in water to a few hours, depending on the product selected. The American Academy of Dermatology recommends the following criteria in selecting a sunscreen: * Broad spectrum: protects against both UVA and UVB rays * SPF 30 or higher * Water resistant: sunscreens are classified as water resistant based on time, either 40 minutes, 80 minutes, or not water resistant =Eyes= The eyes are also sensitive to sun exposure at about the same UV wavelengths as skin; snow blindness is essentially sunburn of the cornea. Wrap-around sunglasses or the use by spectacle-wearers of glasses that block UV light reduce the harmful radiation. UV light has been implicated in the development of age-related macular degeneration, pterygium and cataract. Concentrated clusters of melanin, commonly known as freckles, are often found within the iris. = Lips = The lips can become chapped (cheilitis) by sun exposure. Sunscreen on the lips does not have a pleasant taste and might be removed by saliva. Some lip balms (ChapSticks) have SPF ratings and contain sunscreens. = Feet = The skin of the feet is often tender and protected, so sudden prolonged exposure to UV radiation can be particularly painful and damaging to the top of the foot. Protective measures include sunscreen, socks, and swimwear or swimgear that covers the foot. =Diet= Dietary factors influence susceptibility to sunburn, recovery from sunburn, and risk of secondary complications from sunburn. Several dietary antioxidants, including essential vitamins, have been shown to have some effectiveness for protecting against sunburn and skin damage associated with ultraviolet radiation, in both human and animal studies. Supplementation with Vitamin C and Vitamin E was shown in one study to reduce the amount of sunburn after a controlled amount of UV exposure. A review of scientific literature through 2007 found that beta carotene (Vitamin A) supplementation had a protective effect against sunburn, but that the effects were only evident in the long-term, with studies of supplementation for periods less than 10 weeks in duration failing to show any effects. There is also evidence that common foods may have some protective ability against sunburn if taken for a period before the exposure. = Protecting children = Babies and children are particularly susceptible to UV damage which increases their risk of both melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancers later in life. Children should not sunburn at any age and protective measures can ensure their future risk of skin cancer is reduced. * Infants 0‚Äì6 months: Children under 6mo generally have skin too sensitive for sunscreen and protective measures should focus on avoiding excessive UV exposure by using window mesh covers, wide brim hats, loose clothing that covers skin, and reducing UV exposure between the hours of 10am and 4pm. * Infants 6‚Äì12 months: Sunscreen can safely be used on infants this age. It is recommended to apply a broad-spectrum, water-resistant SPF 30+ sunscreen to exposed areas as well as avoid excessive UV exposure by using wide-brim hats and protective clothing. * Toddlers and Preschool-aged children: Apply a broad-spectrum, water-resistant SPF 30+ sunscreen to exposed areas, use wide-brim hats and sunglasses, avoid peak UV intensity hours of 10am-4pm and seek shade. Sun protective clothing with a SPF rating can also provide additional protection. = Artificial UV exposure = The WHO recommends that artificial UV exposure including tanning beds should be avoided as no safe dose has been established. When one is exposed to any artificial source of occupational UV, special protective clothing (for example, welding helmets/shields) should be worn. Such sources can produce UVC, an extremely carcinogenic wavelength of UV which ordinarily is not present in normal sunlight, having been filtered out by the atmosphere. Treatment tanning) The primary measure of treatment is avoiding further exposure to the sun. The best treatment for most sunburns is time. Most sunburns heal completely within a few weeks. The American Academy of Dermatology recommends the following for the treatment of sunburn: * For pain relief, take cool baths or showers frequently. * Use soothing moisturizers that contain aloe vera or soy. * Anti-inflammatory medications such as ibuprofen or aspirin can help with pain. * Keep hydrated and drink extra water. * Do not pop blisters on a sunburn. Instead, let them heal on their own. * Protect sunburned skin with loose clothing when going outside to prevent further damage while not irritating the sunburn. Non-steroidal anti- inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs; such as ibuprofen or naproxen), and aspirin may decrease redness and pain. Local anesthetics such as benzocaine, however, are contraindicated. Schwellnus et al. state that topical steroids (such as hydrocortisone cream) do not help with sunburns, although the American Academy of Dermatology says they can be used on especially sore areas. While lidocaine cream (a local anesthetic) is often used as a sunburn treatment, there is little evidence for the effectiveness of such use. A home treatment that may help the discomfort is using cool and wet cloths on the sunburned areas. Applying soothing lotions that contain aloe vera to the sunburn areas was supported by multiple studies, though others have found aloe vera to have no effect. Note that aloe vera has no ability to protect people from new or further sunburn. Another home treatment is using a moisturizer that contains soy. A sunburn draws fluid to the skin‚Äôs surface and away from the rest of the body. Drinking extra water is recommended to help prevent dehydration.

A transit mall is a street, or set of streets, in a city or town along which automobile traffic is prohibited or greatly restricted and only public transit vehicles, bicycles, and pedestrians are permitted. Transit malls are instituted by communities who feel that it is desirable to have areas not dominated by the automobile, or as a way to speed travel time through an area--usually the city center--for transit vehicles and as a transport hub for interchanges, making them more efficient and thereby more attractive as an alternative to car use. Converting a street or an area to a transit mall can be a form of pedestrianization, allowing pedestrians and cyclists as well as transit vehicles to move more freely, unimpeded by private motor traffic, if autos are banned completely. However, some transit malls are not auto-free, but rather restrict cars and other private traffic to only short segments or only one lane, with other lanes being limited to buses or trams (streetcars). Europe A number of European towns and cities have made part or all of areas their car-free while permitting public transit vehicles. These are often accompanied by car parks on the edge of the area and/or park- and-ride schemes. Most of these zones allow delivery trucks to service the businesses located there during the early morning, and street-cleaning vehicles will usually go through these streets after most shops have closed for the night. Examples include: * Gothenburg, Sweden * Princes Street in Edinburgh, Scotland * Queen Street in Oxford, England North America In North America, the creation of pedestrian-friendly urban environments is still in its infancy, but transit malls have existed in a few cities for more than 40 years, starting with the Nicollet Mall in Minneapolis, Minnesota in 1968, followed by the Granville Mall in Vancouver, British Columbia, in 1974 and the Portland Mall in 1977. In North America, transit malls usually take the form of single streets in which automobiles are mostly prohibited but transit vehicles are allowed. They are rarely completely free of motor vehicles. Often, all of the cross streets are open to motorized traffic, and in some cases taxis are allowed and truck deliveries are made by night. Examples include: * King Street Transit Priority Corridor in Toronto, Ontario * SODO Busway in Seattle, Washington * Bryant-Pacific Transit Mall in Dallas, TX * Nicollet Mall in Minneapolis, Minnesota * Granville Mall in Vancouver, British Columbia * Portland Transit Mall in Portland, Oregon * 7th Avenue in Calgary, Alberta * 10th Street NW, Federal Triangle, Washington, DC, de facto * 16th Street Mall in Denver, Colorado * Fulton Mall in Brooklyn, New York * Graham Avenue Transit Mall in Winnipeg, Manitoba * Long Beach Transit Mall in Los Angeles County * Main Street Mall in Memphis, Tennessee * Santa Rosa Transit Mall in Santa Rosa, California * State Street in Madison, Wisconsin * Transit Plaza in Champaign, Illinois * Sundance Square Plaza (Main Street between 3rd & 4th Streets) in Fort Worth, Texas * The former Chestnut Street Busway in Philadelphia.

An escalator is a moving staircase which carries people between floors of a building. It consists of a motor-driven chain of individually linked steps on a track which cycle on a pair of tracks which keep them horizontal. Escalators are often used around the world in places where lifts would be impractical, or they can be used in conjunction with them. Principal areas of usage include department stores, shopping malls, airports, transit systems (railway/railroad stations), convention centers, hotels, arenas, stadiums and public buildings. Escalators have the capacity to move large numbers of people. They can be placed in the same physical space as a staircase. They have no waiting interval (except during very heavy traffic). They can be used to guide people toward main exits or special exhibits. They may be weatherproofed for outdoor use. A nonfunctional escalator can function as a normal staircase, whereas many other methods of transport become useless when they break down or lose power. Design, components, and operation =Operation and layout= Escalators typically rise at an angle of about 30 degrees from the ground. They move at per second (like moving walkways) and may traverse vertical distances in excess of . Most modern escalators have single-piece aluminum or stainless steel steps that move on a system of tracks in a continuous loop. \\"Crisscross\\" layout, Shanghai Museum \\"Multiple parallel\\" layout, Holborn Station, London \\"Parallel\\" layout Escalators are typically configured in one of three ways: parallel (up and down escalators adjacent or nearby, often seen in metro stations and multilevel movie theaters), multiple parallel (banks of more than one escalator going in the same direction parallel to banks going the other direction), or crisscross (escalators going in one direction \\"stacked\\" with escalators going the opposite direction oriented adjacent but perpendicular, frequently used in department stores or shopping centers). Most countries require escalators to have moving handrails that keep pace with the movement of the steps as a safety measure. This helps riders steady themselves, especially when stepping onto the moving stairs. Occasionally a handrail moves at a slightly different speed from the steps, causing it to \\"creep\\" slowly forward or backward relative to the steps; it is only slippage and normal wear that causes such losses of synchronicity, and is not by design. The direction of escalator movement (up or down) can be permanently set, controlled manually depending on the predominant flow of the crowd, or controlled automatically. In some setups, the direction is controlled by whoever arrives first. =Design and layout considerations= Design factors include physical requirements, location, traffic patterns, safety considerations and aesthetics. Physical factors such as the distance to be spanned determine the length and pitch of the escalator, while factors such as the infrastructure's ability to provide support and power must be considered. How upward and downward traffic is separated and load/unload areas are other important considerations. Temporal traffic patterns must be anticipated. Some escalators need only to move people from one floor to another, but others may have specific requirements, such as funneling visitors towards exits or exhibits. The visibility and accessibility of the escalator to traffic is relevant. Designers need to account for the projected traffic volumes. For example, a single-width escalator traveling at about per second can move about 2000 people per hour, assuming that passengers ride single file. The carrying capacity of an escalator system is typically matched to the expected peak traffic demand. For example, escalators at transit stations must be designed to cater for the peak traffic flow discharged from a train, without excessive bunching at the escalator entrance. In this regard, escalators help manage the flow of people. For example, at many airports an unpaired escalator delivers passengers to an exit, with no means for anyone entering at the exit to access the concourse. Escalators are often built next to or around staircases that allow alternative travel between the same two floors. Elevators are necessary for disability access to floors serviced by escalators. =Components= Landing platforms Landing platforms are the two platforms (at the two ends) that house the curved sections of the tracks, as well as the gears and motors that drive the stairs. The top platform usually contains the motor assembly and the main drive gear, while the bottom holds the return gear. These sections also anchor the ends of the escalator truss. Each platform also has a floor and a comb plate. The floor plate provides a place for the passengers to stand before they step onto the moving stairs, flush with the rest of the floor and usually hinged to allow easy maintenance access, while the comb plate lies between the stationary floor plate and the moving step, so named for the cleats on its edge which mesh with the matching cleats on each step (and resemble a comb). The interlocking cleats help to minimize the gap between the stairs and landing, preventing objects or persons from becoming caught in it. Truss The truss is the hollow metal structure that bridges the lower and upper landings, composed of two side sections joined together with cross braces across the bottom and just below the top. The ends of the truss are attached to the top and bottom landing platforms via steel or concrete supports. It carries all the straight track sections connecting the upper and lower sections. Balustrade The balustrade is composed of handrails, balustrade panels, and skirt panelsTehrani, C. M. (2001). U.S. Patent No. 6,257,390. Washington, DC: U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.: =Handrail= The handrail provides a handhold for passengers while they are riding the escalator. The handrail is pulled along its own track by a chain that is connected to the main drive gear by a series of pulleys, keeping it at the same speed as the steps. Four distinct sections make up the rail: at its center is a \\"slider\\", also known as a \\"glider ply\\", which is a layer of a cotton or synthetic textile that allows the rail to move smoothly along its track. The \\"tension member\\" lies on the slider and consists of either steel cable or flat steel tape, providing the handrail with tensile strength and flexibility. The inner components, on top of the tension member, are made of chemically treated rubber designed to prevent the layers from separating. Finally, the outer layerthe part that passengers see‚Äîis the cover, typically a blend of synthetic polymers and rubber. Covers are designed to resist degradation from environmental conditions, mechanical wear and tear and vandalism. In a factory, handrails are constructed by feeding rubber through an extrusion machine to produce layers of the required size and type in order to match specific orders. The component layers of fabric, rubber and steel are shaped by workers before being fed into the presses which fuse them together. In the mid-twentieth century, some handrail designs consisted of a rubber bellows, with rings of smooth metal cladding called \\"bracelets\\" between each coil. This gave the handrail a rigid yet flexible feel. Additionally, each bellows section was no more than a few feet long, so if part of the handrail was damaged, only the bad segment needed to be replaced. These forms of handrail have largely been replaced with fabric-and-rubber railings. = Balustrade panel= Being made of either metal, sandwich panel, or glass, the balustrade panel supports the handrails of the escalator. It also provides additional protection for the handrail and passengers. Some escalators have direction arrows on the ends of the balustrade. Escalators' on/off buttons are frequently located at the ends of the balustrade. Moving walkways often use balustrades in the same way. = Skirt Panel= The bottom of the balustrade is called a skirt panel. It is notorious in this art for being a frequent site of injuries and failures, due to the possible entrapment of materials (including body parts) in the machinery. Multiple solutions have been suggested for this issue, including coating with a low-friction material, employing bristles, and others. Notably, although the bristles were originally developed as a safety brush and to alert the rider that he is approaching the edgeWatanabe, K., & Fujieda, S. (1997). U.S. Patent No. 5,695,040. Washington, DC: U.S. Patent and Trademark Office., they are sometimes conceived as a shoe brush (buffer), which, in hindsight, might be an application of energy harvesting. Tracks The track system is built into the truss to guide the step chain, which continuously pulls the steps from the bottom platform and back to the top in an endless loop. One track guides the front wheels of the steps (called the step-wheel track) and another guides the back wheels of the steps (called the trailer-wheel track). The relative positions of these tracks cause the steps to form a staircase as they move out from under the comb plate. Along the straight section of the truss the tracks are at their maximum distance apart. This configuration forces the back of one step to be at a 90-degree angle relative to the step behind it. This right angle forces the steps into a shape resembling a staircase. At the top and bottom of the escalator, the two tracks converge so that the front and back wheels of the steps are almost in a straight line. This causes the stairs to lay in a flat sheetlike arrangement, one after another, so they can easily travel around the bend in the curved section of track. The tracks carry the steps down along the underside of the truss until they reach the bottom landing, where they pass through another curved section of track before exiting the bottom landing. At this point, the tracks separate and the steps once again assume a staircase configuration. This cycle is repeated continually as the steps are pulled from bottom to top and back to the bottom again. Steps The steps themselves are solid, one piece, die-cast aluminium or steel. Yellow demarcation lines are sometimes added to indicate their edges. In most escalator models manufactured after 1950, both the riser and the tread of each step is cleated (given a ribbed appearance) with comb-like protrusions that mesh with the comb plates on the top and bottom platforms and the succeeding steps in the chain. Seeberger escalators featured flat treads and smooth risers; other escalator models have cleated treads and smooth risers. The steps are linked by a continuous metal chain that forms a closed loop. The front and back edges of the steps each have two wheels, the rear of which are set further apart and fit into the trailer-wheel track while the front set have narrower axles and fit the step-wheel track. Safety Escalator safety guidelines at Taipei Metro. Escalators have a grip at their side for passengers aboard to hold. Safety is a major concern in escalator design, as escalators are powerful machines that can become entangled with clothing and other items. Such entanglements can injure or kill riders. In India many women wear saris, increasing the likelihood of entangling the clothing's loose end (pallu). To prevent this, sari guards are built into most escalators in India. Children wearing footwear such as Crocs and flip-flops are especially at risk of being caught in escalator mechanisms. The softness of the shoe's material combined with the smaller size of children's feet makes this sort of accident especially common. Escalators sometimes include fire protection systems including automatic fire detection and suppression systems within the dust collection and engineer pit. To limit the danger caused by overheating, spaces that contain motors and gears typically include additional ventilation. Small, targeted clean agent automatic extinguishing systems are sometimes installed in these areas. Fire protection of an escalator floor opening is also sometimes provided by adding automatic sprinklers or fireproof shutters to the opening, or by installing the escalator in an enclosed fire-protected space. =Accidents and litigation= Mahboonkrong Center, widely known as the MBK Center, in Bangkok. Such layouts are used to minimize structural space requirements by \\"stacking\\" escalators that go in one direction. King's Cross fire Greenford station escalators (2006) The King's Cross fire of 1987 illustrated the demanding nature of escalator upkeep and the devices' propensity to collect \\"fluff\\" and other small debris when not properly maintained. The official inquiry determined that the fire started slowly, smoldering virtually undetected for a time, and then exploded into the ticket hall above in a previously-unrecognised phenomenon now known as the \\"trench effect\\". In the escalators' undercarriage, approximately of accumulated detritus acted as a wick to a neglected buildup of interior lubricants; wood veneers, paper and plastic advertisements, solvent-based paint, plywood in the ticket hall, and melamine combustion added to the impact of the calamity.‚ÄùBuilding Design Editorial: the King‚Äôs Cross Inquiry,‚Äù ‚Äò‚ÄôBuilding Design‚Äô‚Äô, November 19, 1988: 9 Following the report, older wooden escalators were removed from service in the London Underground. Additionally, sections of the London Underground that were actually below ground were made non-smoking; ultimately, the whole system became a smoke-free zone. Chongqing accident In October 2015 on a Thursday morning, a 4-year-old boy suffocated and died in a Chinese train station in the city of Chongqing, China. The boy was playing with an escalator handrail when he fell and got stuck underneath it with his chest wedged between the bottom of the handrail and the ground. Litigation In the 1930s, at least one suit was filed against a department store, alleging that its escalators posed an attractive nuisance, responsible for a child's injury.‚ÄùNegligence: Escalator Not an Attractive Nuisance,‚Äù Michigan Law Review, Vol. 38, No. 2 (Dec. 1939): 265 ‚Äì 267. =Legislation= United States Despite their considerable scope, the two Congressional Acts regarding accessibility (the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA)) did not directly affect escalators or their public installations. Since Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act included public transportation systems, for a few years, the United States Department of Transportation considered designs to retrofit existing escalators for wheelchair access. Nonetheless, Foster-Miller Associates' 1980 plan, Escalator Modification for the Handicapped was ultimately ignored in favor of increased elevator installations in subway systems. Likewise, the ADA provided more accessibility options, but expressly excluded escalators as \\"accessible means of egress\\", advocating neither their removal nor their retention in public structures.‚ÄùADA Requirements, November 23, 1998,‚Äù U.S. Department of Justice, Civil Rights Division, 1998: 3. =Codes and regulation= Notice on escalators in Spain In the United States and Canada, new escalators must abide by ASME A17.1 standards, and old/historic escalators must conform to the safety guidelines of ASME A17.3. In Europe, the escalator safety code is EN115. History =Inventors and manufacturers= Nathan Ames Illustration from U.S. Patent#25,076: Revolving Stairs. Issued August 9, 1859, to Nathan Ames Nathan Ames, a patent attorney from Saugus, Massachusetts, is credited with patenting the first \\"escalator\\" in 1859, despite the fact that no working model of his design was ever built. His invention, the \\"revolving stairs\\", is largely speculative and the patent specifications indicate that he had no preference for materials or potential use (he noted that steps could be upholstered or made of wood, and suggested that the units might benefit the infirm within a household use). The suggested motive power was either manual or hydraulic. Leamon Souder In 1889, Leamon Souder successfully patented the \\"stairway\\", an analogous device that featured a \\"series of steps and links jointed to each other\\". No model was ever built. This was the first of at least four escalator-style patents issued to Souder, including two for spiral designs. Jesse Wilford Reno, George A. Wheeler, and Charles Seeberger On March 15, 1892, Jesse W. Reno patented the \\"Endless Conveyor or Elevator.\\" A few months after Reno's patent was approved, George A. Wheeler patented his ideas for a more recognizable moving staircase, though it was never built. Wheeler's patents were bought by Charles Seeberger; some features of Wheeler's designs were incorporated in Seeberger's prototype that was built by the Otis Elevator Company in 1899. Reno, a graduate of Lehigh University, produced the first working escalator (called the \\"inclined elevator\\") and installed it alongside the Old Iron Pier at Coney Island, New York City in 1896.This is accepted as the world's first operable escalator installation. Dates for the Harrods Piat escalator installation are inconsistent. This particular device was little more than an inclined belt with cast-iron slats or cleats on the surface for traction, and traveled along a 25 degree incline. A few months later, the same prototype was used for a month-long trial period on the Manhattan side of the Brooklyn Bridge. Reno eventually joined forces with Otis and retired once he had sold his patents. Some Reno-type escalators were still being used in the Boston subway until construction for the Big Dig (ca. 1991) precipitated their removal. The Smithsonian Institution considered re-assembling one of these historic units from 1914 in their collection of Americana, but \\"logistics and reassembly costs won out over nostalgia\\", and the project was discarded.Topel, Michael. \\"Ancient Escalator Was a Link to History,\\" The Patriot-Ledger, April 3, 1995. See also Around May 1895, Charles Seeberger began drawings on a form of escalator similar to those patented by Wheeler in 1892. This device consisted of flat, moving stairs, not unlike the escalators of today, except for one important detail: the step surface was smooth, with no comb effect to safely guide the rider's feet off at the ends. Instead, the passenger had to step off sideways. To facilitate this, at the top or bottom of the escalator the steps continued moving horizontally beyond the end of the handrail (like a miniature moving sidewalk) until they disappeared under a triangular \\"divider\\" which guided the passenger to either side. Seeberger teamed with Otis in 1899, and together they produced the first commercial escalator. It won first prize at the 1900 Paris Exposition Universelle. Also on display at the Exposition were Reno's inclined elevator, a similar model by James M. Dodge and the Link Belt Machinery Co., and two different devices by the French manufacturers Hall√© and Piat. Early European manufacturers: Hall√©, Hocquardt and Piat Piat installed its \\"stepless\\" escalator in Harrods Knightsbridge store on Wednesday, November 16, 1898, though the company relinquished its patent rights to the department store. Noted by Bill Lancaster in The Department Store: a Social History, \\"customers unnerved by the experience were revived by shopmen dispensing free smelling salts and cognac.\\" The Harrods unit was a continuous leather belt made of \\"224 pieces . . . strongly linked together traveling in an upward direction\\", and was the first \\"moving staircase\\" in England.\\"The First Moving Staircase in England,\\" The Drapers' Record, November 19, 1898: 465. Hocquardt received European patent rights for the Fahrtreppe in 1906. After the Exposition, Hall√© continued to sell its escalator device in Europe but was eventually eclipsed in sales by other major manufacturers. American manufacturers and nomenclature In the first half of the twentieth century, several manufacturers developed their own escalator products, though they had to market their devices under different names, due to Otis‚Äô hold on the trademark rights to the word \\"escalator.\\" New York-based Peelle Company called their models the Motorstair, while Westinghouse called their model an Electric Stairway. The Toledo-based Haughton Elevator company referred to their product as simply Moving Stairs. The Otis trademark is no longer in effect. Mergers and buyouts: the playing field narrows Kone and Schindler introduced their first escalator models several decades after the Otis Elevator Co., but grew to dominate the field over time. Today, they, Mitsubishi, and ThyssenKrupp are Otis' primary rivals. Kone expanded internationally by acquisition in the 1970s, buying out Swedish elevator manufacturer Asea-Graham, and purchasing other minor French, German and Austrian elevator makers before assuming control of Westinghouse's European elevator business. As the last of the \\"big four\\" manufacturers to emerge onto the global market, Kone first acquired Montgomery Elevator company, then took control of Germany's Orenstein & Koppel Rolltreppen. In the twenty-first century Schindler became the largest maker of escalators and second largest maker of elevators in the world, though their first escalator installation did not occur until 1936. In 1979, the company entered the United States market by purchasing Haughton Elevator. A decade later, Schindler assumed control of the North American escalator/elevator operations of Westinghouse, forming Schindler's American division. =Alternate designs= Spiral/helical Times Square, Hong Kong Jesse Reno also designed the first escalators installed in any underground subway system in the form of a helical escalator at Holloway Road tube station in London in 1906. The experimental device never saw public use and its remains are now in the London Transport Museum's depot in Acton.LTM collection London's Transport Museum Photographic Collection, \\"1906 Escalator Operated on Opening Day of Great Northern Picadilly and Brompton Railway, December 15, 1906.\\" Although the first fully operational spiral escalator, Reno's design was nonetheless only one in a series of similar proposed contraptions. Souder patented two helical designs, while Wheeler drafted helical stairway plans in 1905. Seeberger devised at least two helical designs between 1906 and 1911 (including an unrealized arrangement for the London Underground), and Gilbert Luna obtained West German, Japanese, and United States patents for his version of a spiral escalator by 1973. When interviewed for the Los Angeles Times that year, Luna was in the process of soliciting major firms for acquisition of his patents and company, but statistics are unclear on the outcome of these endeavors.Hillinger, Charles. \\"Spiral Escalator May Be his Wheel of Fortune\\", Los Angeles Times, November 11, 1973: 3. Karl-Heinz Pahl received a European and a US patent for a spiral escalator in 1992.EP0415953, Spiral Escalator US Patent 5,158,167 (Pahl 1992) Drawing The Mitsubishi Electric Corporation was most successful in its development of spiral/helical escalators, and it alone has sold them since the mid-1980s. The world's first practical spiral escalator‚Äîa Mitsubishi model‚Äîwas installed in Osaka, Japan, in 1985. Helixator, an experimental spiral/helical escalator design which currently exists as a prototype scale model, could further reduce floor space demands. Its design has several innovations that allow a continuous helix; driven by a linear motor instead of a chain system, it spreads force evenly along the escalator path, avoiding excessive force on the top chain links and hence avoiding the geometry, length and height limits of standard escalators. Westfield San Francisco Centre, San Francisco, California, United States ‚Äî is the first spiral escalator in the Western Hemisphere.Sachner, Paul M. \\"Two on the Town: Heritage on the Garden, in Boston, and San Francisco Centre, in San Francisco\\", Architectural Record, vol. 177, no. 6, May 1989: 122‚Äì127. Freeform Levytator, a design originating at City University in London, can move in straight lines or curves with or without rising or descending. The returning steps do not move underneath the in-use steps: rather, they provide steps for travel in the opposite direction, as in the Pahl spiral escalator patent. Etymology Authors and historians have offered multiple interpretations of the source of the word ‚Äúescalator‚Äù, and some degree of misinformation then proliferated.

(Alisa Goetz, ed.) London: Merrell, 2003. =Name development and original intentions= Seeberger trademarked the word \\"escalator\\" in 1900, to coincide with his device's debut at the Exposition Universelle. According to his own account, in 1895, his legal counsel advised him to name his new invention, and he then set out to devise a title for it. As evidenced in Seeberger's handwritten documents, the inventor consulted \\"a Latin lexicon\\" and \\"adopted as the root of the new word, 'Scala'; as a prefix, 'E' and as a suffix, 'Tor.'\\"De Fazio, Diane H. Like Blood to the Veins: Escalators, their History, and the Making of the Modern World (Master's Thesis, Columbia University Graduate School of Architecture, Planning, and Preservation), 2007: 58 ‚Äì 61. His own rough translation of the word thus created was \\"means of traversing from\\", and he intended for the word to be pronounced, \\"es‚Äß πk√¶l‚Äß…ô‚Äßt…ôr\\" (es-CAL-a-tor). By 1906, Seeberger noted that the public had instead come to pronounce it \\"esc…ô‚ÄßlƒÅ π‚Äßt…ôr\\" (es-ca-LƒÄ- tor).De Fazio, 60. \\"Escalator\\" was not a combination of other French or Greek words, and was never a derivative of \\"elevator\\" in the original sense, which means \\"one who raises up, a deliverer\\" in Latin. Similarly, the root word \\"scala\\" does not mean \\"a flight of steps\\", but is the singular form of the plural noun \\"scalae\\", which can denote any of: \\"a flight of steps or stairs, a staircase; a ladder, [or] a scaling-ladder.\\" The alleged intended capitalization of \\"escalator\\" is likewise a topic of debate. Seeberger's trademark application lists the word not only with the \\"E\\", but also with all of the letters capitalized (in two different instances), and he specifies that \\"any other form and character of type may be employed . . . without altering in any essential manner the character of [the] trade-mark.\\"Seeberger, Charles D. \\"Trade-mark for Passenger-Elevators.\\" U.

Teply. \\"Trademarked Generic Words\\", The Yale Law Journal, Vol. 89, No. 7 (Jun. 1980): 1323‚Äì1359. Confirming the contention of the Examiner of Trademark Interferences, Assistant Commissioner of Patents Murphy's decision rejected Otis‚Äô appeal to keep their trademark intact, and noted that \\"the term 'escalator' is recognized by the general public as the name for a moving stairway and not the source thereof\\", observing that Otis had \\"used the term as a generic descriptive term . . . in a number of patents which [had] been issued to them and . . . in their advertising matter.\\"Haughton Elevator Co. v. Seeberger85 U. S. P. Q. (BNA) 80‚Äì81 (Dec. Comm. Pat. 1950). All trademark protections were removed from the word \\"escalator\\", the term was officially genericized, and it fell into the public domain. Extant historic escalator models Macy's Herald Square store in New York City holds some well-known historic escalators. The model shown here, retrofitted with metal steps in the 1990s, is among the oldest of the store's 40 escalators. Otis \\"L-type\\" escalators with distinctive wood treads (not shown) have operated in the store since 1927. Wooden treads on a 1930s Otis escalator, formerly at Wynyard railway station, Sydney, Australia Notable examples of historic escalators still in operation include: ;Europe * St Anna Pedestrian Tunnel underneath the Scheldt river in Antwerp, Belgium.

It rises 8 stories and is long. Originally built as the entrance to the amusement park The World of Sid and Marty Krofft, the escalator is now used for CNN studio tours. Asia * The Rustaveli station in the Tbilisi Metro has one of the world's longest escalators. It is high and long. * One of the longest single escalators in Asia is in Chongqing, China. It joins the Chongqing Rail Transit underground station Lianglukou with the overground railway station at Caiyuanba. The escalator is long and has a transit time of about 2 minutes 30 seconds. The ride costs 2 yuan. Due to the hilly nature of Chongqing, the underground railway station is at the top of the escalator while the overground station is at the bottom. * The longest escalator in Bangkok, Thailand and Southeast Asia is in the MRT's Si Lom Station. It connects the concourse level with platform 1 which in turn connects to Hua Lam Phong. It is in length and in depth. Australia * The longest set of single-span uninterrupted escalators in the Southern Hemisphere is at Parliament underground railway station in Melbourne.

Etiquette Riders stand to the right on this escalator in Umeda, Osaka, Japan In most major countries, the expectation is that escalator users wishing to stand keep to one side to allow others to climb past them on the other. Due to historic design purposes,Mason, M. (2013). Walk the Lines: The London Underground, Overground. London: Arrow Books. riders in Canada, Germany, Hong Kong, Taiwan, the United Kingdom, France and the United States are expected to stand on the right and walk on the left. However, in Australia and New Zealand, the opposite is the case. Practice may differ from city to city within countries ‚Äì in Osaka, riders stand on the right, whereas in Tokyo (and most other Japanese cities), riders stand on the left. In certain high-traffic systems, including the East Japan Railway Company and the Prague metro, escalator users are encouraged to stand on whichever side they choose, with the aim of preventing wear and tear and asymmetrical burdening. All Tokyo metro stations also have posters next to the escalators that ask users not to walk but instead to stand on either side. The practice of standing on one side and walking on the other may cause uneven wear on escalator mechanisms. Transport for London trialed standing on both sides (no walking) for a several month period in 2016. This increased capacity and eliminated queues approaching the escalator during peak travel times. A follow-up report was released several months later with no recommendation to continue the practice.

They are gram-positive, non‚Äìacid fast, nonmotile, facultatively anaerobic, and non‚Äìendospore forming. They are widely distributed in nature in the microbiota of animals (including the human microbiota) and are mostly innocuous. Some can cause disease in humans and other animals (for example, Arcanobacterium haemolyticum infections). As with various species of a microbiota (including their cousins in the genera Corynebacterium and Trueperella), they usually are not pathogenic but can occasionally opportunistically capitalize on atypical access to tissues (via wounds) or weakened host defenses.  Taxonomy  As explained by Yassin et al., the genus Arcanobacterium was first described by Collins et al. in 1982 to accommodate bacterial strains previously assigned to the genus Corynebacterium variously (and controversially) as C. pyogenes hominis and then C. haemolyticum, thenceforth to be known as Arcanobacterium haemolyticum. The name (from arcanus + bacterium) means \\"secretive bacterium\\" or \\"enigmatic/mysterious bacterium\\". In 2011, Yassin et al., on the basis of 16S rRNA signature nucleotide comparisons, menaquinone and phospholipid compositions, and Christie‚ÄìAtkins‚ÄìMunch-Petersen (CAMP) tests, proposed that four species‚ÄîA. haemolyticum, A. hippocoleae, A. phocae, and A. pluranimalium‚Äîshould continue to be affiliated with the genus Arcanobacterium, whereas the species A. abortisuis, A. bernardiae, A. bialowiezense, A. bonasi, and A. pyogenes should be reclassified as members of a new genus, Trueperella, as Trueperella abortisuis comb. nov., Trueperella bernardiae comb. nov., Trueperella bialowiezensis comb. nov., Trueperella bonasi comb. nov., and Trueperella pyogenes comb. nov. Therefore, they provided an emended description of the genus Arcanobacterium. In 2001, Lawson et al. reported that A. pluranimalium sp. nov. had been isolated from a harbour porpoise and a deer. In 2002, Hoyles et al. reported that A. hippocoleae sp. nov. had been isolated from a vaginal discharge of a horse. In 2012, Hijazin et al. reported that A. canis sp. nov. had been isolated from otitis externa in a dog. In 2013 the same group (with Hijazin, Sammra, and others) reported that A. phocisimile sp. nov. had been isolated from harbor seals. In 2015, the same group (with Sammra and others) reported that A. pinnipediorum sp. nov. had also been isolated from a harbor seal.

Although they hailed from various regions in India, the vast majority of Indo-Fijians trace their origins to the area of modern-day Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. The major home districts of Fiji's North Indian labourers were Basti, Gonda, Faizabad, Sultanpur and Azamgarh, in the present-day Awadh region of Uttar Pradesh and the present-day Bhojpur region of Bihar.https://qz.com/india/290497/the-forgotten-story-of-indias-colonial- slave-workers-who-began-leaving-home-180-years-ago/ Others (in a smaller quantity) originated in the Tamil and Telugu regions of the Madras Presidency, and free immigrants came from Gujarat and Sindh. Fiji's British colonial rulers brought Indian people to the Colony of Fiji as indentured servants between 1879 and 1916 to work on Fiji's sugar-cane plantations. Mahendra Chaudhry became Fiji's first Indo-Fijian Prime Minister on 19 May 1999.  Early ancestors of Indo-Fijians  = First Indian in Fiji = Indians had been employed for a long time on the European ships trading in India and the East Indies. Many of the early voyages to the Pacific either started or terminated in India, and many of these ships were wrecked in the uncharted waters of the South Pacific. The first recorded presence of an Indian in Fiji was by Peter Dillon, a sandalwood trader in Fiji, of a lascar (Indian seaman) who survived a ship wreck and lived amongst the natives of Fiji in 1813. = First attempt to procure Indian labourers = Before Fiji was colonized by Great Britain, some planters had tried to obtain Indian labour and had approached the British Consul in Levuka, Fiji but were met with a negative response. In 1870 a direct request by a planter to the Government of India was also turned down and in 1872, an official request by the Cakobau Government was informed that British rule in Fiji was a pre-condition for Indian emigration to Fiji. The early ancestors of Fiji Indians came from different regions and backgrounds from India and other neighbouring countries. However, most came from rural villages in northern and southern India. In January 1879, thirty-one Indians, who had originally been indentured labourers in R√©union, were brought from New Caledonia to Fiji under contract to work on a plantation in Taveuni. These labourers demonstrated knowledge of the terms of the indenture agreement and were aware of their rights and refused to do the heavy work assigned to them. Their contract was terminated by mutual agreement between the labourers and their employers. In 1881, thirty-eight more Indians arrived from New Caledonia and again most of them left but some stayed taking Indian wives or island women. = Arrival under the indentured system = The colonial authorities promoted the sugar cane industry, recognising the need to establish a stable economic base for the colony, but were unwilling to exploit indigenous labour and threaten the Fijian way of life. The use of imported labour from the Solomon Islands and what is now Vanuatu generated protests in the United Kingdom, and the Governor Sir Arthur Hamilton-Gordon decided to implement the indentured labour scheme, which had existed in the British Empire since 1837. A recruiting office was set up especially around Calcutta and the South, West and North later, especially a lot in rural village areas in different farming regions, land and areas. The Leonidas, a labour transport vessel, disembarked at Levuka from Calcutta on 14 May 1879. The 463 indentured workers who disembarked were the first of over 61,000 to arrive from South and East Asia in the following 37 years. The majority were from the districts of eastern and southern provinces, followed by labourers from northern and western regions, then later south eastern countries, they originated from different regions, villages, backgrounds and castes that later mingled or intermarried hence the \\"Fijian Indian\\" identity was created. The indentured workers originated mostly from rural village backgrounds. .  Life during the indenture period  The contracts of the indentured labourers, which they called girmit (agreements), required them to work in Fiji for a period of five years. Living conditions on the sugar cane plantations, on which most of the girmityas (indentured labourers) worked, had poor standards which resembled that of slavery. Hovels known as \\"coolie lines\\" dotted the landscape.  End of indenture  Public outrage in the United Kingdom at such abuses was a factor in the decision to halt the scheme in 1916. With the intervention of Banarsidas Chaturvedi and Reverend C.F. Andrews all existing indenture was cancelled on 1 January 1920.  Emergence of the Fiji Indian identity  After a further five years of work as an indentured labourer or as a khula (free labourer), they were given the choice of returning to India at their own expense, or remain in Fiji. The great majority opted to stay because they could not afford to return under the low pay (even in many instances they were denied paid wages) of the British government or were refused to be sent back. After the expiry of their girmits, many leased small plots of land from Fijians and developed their own sugarcane fields or cattle farmlets. Others went into business in the towns that were beginning to spring up. The indenture system had two positive effects on subsequent generations. Firstly the need for people of different castes to live work and eat together led to an end of the caste system. Furthermore, shortage of females resulted in many marrying outside their caste. Another positive was the development of a new koin√© language, known as Fiji Hindi that was formed from different languages and dialects of India. The speakers of these languages originated from different regions in India that supplied a lot of labourers. Music too, was important, with a distinct Fiji Hindi culture that some commentators have described as a forerunner to both bangla and jazz. For the most part, these people came from in certain rural or village areas. The language was further heavily enriched by the inclusion of many Fijian and English words. The language is now the mother tongue of majority Fiji Indians and is the lingua franca of not only all the Fiji Indians but also of all Fijian communities where ethnic Indians are in a majority.  Free immigrants  From the early 1900s, Indians started arriving in Fiji as free agents. Many of these paid their own way and had previously served in Fiji or other British colonies or had been born in Fiji. Amongst the early free migrants, there were religious teachers, missionaries and at least one lawyer. The government and other employers brought clerks, policemen, artisans, gardeners, experienced agricultural workers, a doctor and a school teacher. Punjabi farmers and Gujarati craftsmen also paid their own way to Fiji and in later years formed an influential minority amongst the Fiji Indians.  Indian Platoon during the Second World War  In 1916, Manilal Doctor, the de facto leader of the Fiji Indians persuaded the colonial government of Fiji to form an Indian platoon for the war effort during the First World War. He sent the names of 32 volunteers to the government but his requests were ignored. As a result, a number of Fiji Indians volunteered for the New Zealand Army while one served in Europe during the First World War. In 1934, Governor Fletcher, enacted a policy which warranted an Indian Platoon within the Fiji Defence Force consisting entirely of enlisted-ranked Indians. Governor Fletcher encouraged Indians to regard Fiji as their permanent home. One could say this was Governor Fletcher's insurance policy against an anticipated anti-European revolt at the hands of the Native population, which subsequently took place in 1959. While the Fiji Indian troops had the Europeans as their commanding and non-commissioned officers, the Native Fijians had Ratu Edward Cakobau, a Native Fijian, as their commanding officer. Prior to World War II, soldiers served voluntarily and were paid \\"capitation grants\\" according to efficiency ratings without regard to race. In 1939, during the mobilisation of the Fiji Defence Force, the British Royal Military changed its payment system to four shillings per day for enlisted men of European descent while enlisted men of non-European descent were paid only two shillings per day. Indian platoon readily disputed this disparity in pay. The British, fearing this dissidence would eventually be shared by the Native Fijians, decided to disband the Indian platoon in 1940 citing lack of available equipment, such as military armour, as their reason.  Name debate  Indians are defined by the constitution of Fiji as anybody who can trace, through either the male or the female line, their ancestry back to anywhere on the Indian subcontinent and all government documents use this name. However, a number of names have been proposed to distinguish Fiji-born citizens of Indian origin both from the indigenous inhabitants of Fiji and from India-born immigrants. Among the more popular proposals are Fiji Indian and Indo-Fijian. These labels have proved culturally and politically controversial, and finding a label of identification for the Indian community in Fiji has fuelled a debate that has continued for many decades. Other proposed names have been Fiji Indian and Fiji Born Indian. = Fiji Indians versus indigenous Fijians = In the late 1960s the leader of the National Federation Party, A. D. Patel, who used the slogan, \\"One Country, One People, One Destiny\\" suggested that all Fiji's citizens should be called Fijians and to distinguish the original inhabitants from the rest, the name Taukei should be used for native Fijians. There was widespread opposition to this from the native Fijians who feared that any such move would deprive them of the special privileges they had enjoyed since cession in 1874. The Fiji Times started using Fiji Islander to describe all Fiji's citizens but this name did not catch on. The United States Department of State gives the nationality of Fiji citizens as \\"Fiji Islander\\" and states that \\"the term \\"Fijian\\" has exclusively ethnic connotations and should not be used to describe any thing or person not of indigenous Fijian descent.\\"United States Department of State US Department of State As the labels carry emotional and (according to some) politically loaded connotations, they are listed below in alphabetical order. = Fiji Indian = For a long time Fiji Indian was used to distinguish between Fiji citizens of Indian origin and Indians from India. The term was used by writers like K.L. Gillion and by the academic and politician, Ahmed Ali. The late President of Fiji, Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara, also used this term in his speeches and writings. The term was also used by the Methodist Church of Fiji and Rotuma, Fiji's largest Christian denomination, which had a Fiji-Indian division. = Indo-Fijian = This term has been used by such writers as Adrian Mayer and Brij Lal. Ratu Joni Madraiwiwi, Fiji's Vice-President from 2004 to 2006, also used it in his speeches. In 2006, Jone Navakamocea, Minister of State for National Planning in the Qarase government, called for the use of the term \\"Indo-Fijian\\" to be officially banned. He declared that the term was \\"unacceptable\\", and that Indo-Fijians should be referred to only as \\"Indians\\". The Hindustan Times reported Navakamocea had \\"alleged that the Indo-Fijian term was coined by Indian academics in Fiji to 'Fijianise' their Indian ethnicity\\", which, in Navakamocea's view, undermined the paramountcy of indigenous rights.\\"Ban the term Indo-Fijian: Minister\\", Hindustan Times, 5 August 2006 Navakamocea lost office in the 2006 military coup when the army accused the Qarase government of anti-Fijian Indian racism and overthrew it.  Political participation: early 20th century  The colonial rulers attempted to assuage Indian discontent by providing for one of their number to be nominated to the Legislative Council from 1916 onwards. Badri Maharaj, a strong supporter of the British Empire but with little support among his own people, was appointed by the Governor in 1916. His appointment did little to redress the grievances of the Indian community. Buttressed by the Indian Imperial Association founded by Manilal Maganlal, a lawyer who had arrived in Fiji in 1912, the Indians continued to campaign for better work and living conditions, and for an extension of the municipal franchise; literacy tests disqualified most Indians from participation. A strike by Indian municipal workers and Public Works Department employees, which began on 15 January 1920, ended in a riot which was forcibly quelled on 12 February; Manilal, widely blamed for the unrest, was deported. Another strike, from January to July in 1921, led by Sadhu (priest) Vashist Muni, demanded higher rates of pay for workers of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company (CSR), the unconditional return of Manilal, and the release of imprisoned 1920 strikers. The authorities responded by deporting Muni from Fiji. Demands increased for direct representation in the legislature. In 1929, Indian immigrants and their descendants were authorised to elect three members to the Legislative Council on a communal roll. Vishnu Deo, James Ramchandar Rao and Parmanand Singh were duly elected. Agitation continued for a common roll, which the colonial administrators rejected, citing the fears of European settlers and Fijian chiefs that a common electoral roll would lead to political domination by Indians, whose numbers were rapidly increasing. The fear of Indo-Fijian domination also led to the abolition of the elected membership of Suva Municipal Council in 1934, with the council becoming a wholly appointed body.Why Suva Council was abolished Pacific Islands Monthly January 1935, pp14‚Äì15  Religious and social divisions: 1920‚Äì1945  The Sri Siva Subramaniya temple, a South-Indian type temple in the Indo-Fijian town of Nadi. Two major Hindu movements attracted widespread support in the 1920s, and relationships between Hindus and Muslims also became increasingly strained. The Arya Samaj in Fiji advocated purging Hinduism of what it saw as its superstitious elements and expensive rituals, opposed child marriage, and advocated the remarriage of widows, which orthodox Hinduism didn't promote at that time. The Arya Samaj also encouraged education for girls, which wasn't the norm at the time. The Arya Samaj began by establishing schools and by using a newspaper of one of its supporters, the Fiji Samachar founded in 1923, to expound their views. The traditional Sanatan Dharma, was more orthodox than the Hindu-reformist Arya Samaj. It affirmed traditional Hindu rituals and prayers. However, Fijian Indians who practice Sanatana Dharma also do not have child marriages, as it is unheard of until the youths reach maturity age or level.  Developments since 1945  Saris on sale in Lautoka, Viti Levu. A post-war effort by European members of the Legislative Council to repatriate ethnic Indians to India, starting with sixteen-year-old males and fourteen-year-old females, was not successful, but reflected the tensions between Fiji's ethnic communities. Differences between ethnic Fijians and Indians complicated preparations for Fiji independence, which the United Kingdom granted in 1970, and have continued to define Fiji politics since. Prior to independence, Indians sought a common electoral roll, based on the principle of \\"one man, one vote.\\" Ethnic Fijian leaders opposed this, believing that it would favour urban voters who were mostly Indian; they sought a communal franchise instead, with different ethnic groups voting on separate electoral rolls. At a specially convened conference in London in April 1970, a compromise was worked out, under which parliamentary seats would be allocated by ethnicity, with ethnic Fijians and Indians represented equally. In the House of Representatives, each ethnic group was allocated 22 seats, with 12 representing Communal constituencies (elected by voters registered as members of their particular ethnic group) and a further 10 representing National constituencies (distributed by ethnicity but elected by universal suffrage. A further 8 seats were reserved for ethnic minorities, 3 from \\"communal\\" and 5 from \\"national\\" constituencies. In 1987, shortly after a coalition government was formed that represented both communities, two military coups were staged by low-ranking Fijian officers that aimed at sidelining the Indian community in politics.Victor Lal, \\"The Fiji Indians: Marooned at Home,\\" in South Asians Overseas: Migration and Ethnicity Cambridge University Press, 2010 Ethnic Indians outnumbered indigenous Fijians from 1956 through the late 1980s. This was due to the death of 1/3 of the indigenous population, mainly male and children, that died from smallpox contracted when King Cakobau and other chief leaders returned from a trip from Australia during which they caught smallpox. The percentage of Indigenous female population increased as a result, and the native male population was scarce at one stage,Biotechnology for beginners By Reinhard Renneberg, Arnold L. Demain but by 2000 their share of the population had declined to 43.7%, because of a higher ethnic-Fijian birthrate and particularly because of the greater tendency of Fijian Indians to emigrate. Emigration accelerated following the coups of 1987 (which removed an Indian-supported government from power and, for a time, ushered in a constitution that discriminated against them in numerous ways) and of 2000 (which removed an Indian Prime Minister from office). Political differences between the two communities, rather than ideological differences, have characterised Fijian politics since independence, with the two communities generally voting for different political parties. The National Federation Party founded by A.D. Patel, was the party favoured overwhelmingly by the Indian community throughout most of the nation's history, but its support collapsed in the parliamentary election of 1999, when it lost all of its seats in the House of Representatives; its support fell further still in the 2001 election, when it received only 22% of the Indian vote, and in the 2006 election, when it dropped to an all-time low of 14%. The party formerly favoured by Indians was the Fiji Labour Party, led by Mahendra Chaudhry, which received about 75% of the Indian vote in 2001, and won all 19 seats reserved for Indians. Founded as a multi-racial party in the 1980s, it was supported mostly by Indians, but has seen no representation in parliament since the coup of 2006.  Impact of the Church and religious/ethnic politics  The Church plays a major role in Fiji politics.Let us pray, churches say , Fiji Times Online, 29 November 2006 Often some leaders appeal to Fijians addressing them as \\"Christians\\", even though Hindus are 33% of the population in Fiji, compared with 52% Christians.Background Note: Fiji, Bureau of East Asian and Pacific Affairs, September 2006, U.S. Department of State The 2000 Fijian coup d'√©tat that removed the elected PM Mahendra Chaudhry, was supported by the Methodist church.Fiji military dismisses GCC and Methodist support for reconciliation bill, Radio New Zealand International, 25 August 2005 Some Methodist Church authorities have continued to advocate the establishment of a Christian state. In a letter of support from the then head of the Methodist Church, Reverend Tomasi Kanilagi, to George Speight, the leader of 19 May 2000, armed takeover of Parliament, Reverend Kanilagi publicly expressed his intention to use the Methodist Church as a forum under which to unite all ethnic Fiji political parties.International Religious Freedom Report 2003, Released by the Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor, U.S. Department of State The Methodist church also supported forgiveness to those who plotted the coup in form of so- called \\"Reconciliation, Tolerance, and Unity Bill\\". In 2005, Methodist church general secretary Reverend Ame Tugaue argued that practice of Hinduism and other religions should not be guaranteed in law: :\\"Sodom and Gomorrah were only destroyed after the Lord removed the faithful from there and not because of a few would we allow God's wrath to befall the whole of Fiji. It was clearly stated in the 10 Commandments that God gave to Moses that Christians were not allowed to worship any other gods and not to worship idols. One thing other religions should be thankful for is that they are tolerated in Fiji as it's naturally a peaceful place but their right of worship should never be made into law.\\"christianaggression.org , extract from Fiji Times, 27 March 2005 Following the military coup in Fiji, which deposed the government of Laisenia Qarase (which Indians claimed as unsympathetic to Indian interests), Reverend Tuikilakila Waqairatu of the Fiji Council of Churches and Assembly of Christian Churches has stated that the coup is \\"un-Christian\\" and is \\"manifestation of darkness and evil\\". He claimed that \\"52% of Fijians are Christian and the country's Christian values are being undermined.\\"Fiji military monitoring the media , Radio New Zealand, 6 December 2006  Demographic factors  Indo Fijians are concentrated in the so-called Sugar Belt and in cities and towns on the northern and western coasts of Viti Levu and Vanua Levu; their numbers are much scarcer in the south and inland areas. The majority of Fijian Indians came from northern and southeastern part of India and converse in what is known as the Fiji Hindi language that has been coined from the eastern Hindi dialects mixed with some native Fijian and small numbers of English words,Moag, Rodney F. (1977). Fiji Hindi: A basic course and reference grammar. Canberra: Australian National University. . with some minorities speaking Gujarati, and Punjabi, and many who speak Tamil as their mother tongue with less fluency.Languages of fiji.pdf, Sangam conventional Magazine, 2003 Almost all Indians are also fluent in English. According to the 1996 census (the latest available), 76.7% of Indians are Hindus and a further 15.9% are Muslims. Christians comprise 6.1% of the Indian population, while about 0.9% are members of the Sikh faith. The remaining 0.4% are mostly nonreligious. Hindus in Fiji belong mostly to the SanƒÅtana Dharma sect (74.3% of all Hindus); a minority (3.7%) follow Arya Samaj. Smaller groups, including The International Society for Krishna Consciousness, and numerous unspecified Hindu sects, comprise 22% of the Hindu population. Muslims are mostly Sunni (59.7%) or unspecified (36.7%); there is an Ahmadiya minority (3.6%). Indian Christians are a diverse body, with Methodists forming the largest group (26.2%), followed by the Assemblies of God (22.3%), Roman Catholics (17%), and Anglicans (5.8%). The remaining 28.7% belong to a medley of denominations. There is an Indian Division of the Methodist Church in Fiji. About 5000 Indians are Methodist. They are part of the Methodist Church in Fiji and support the position of the Methodist Church in Fiji, rather than the rights of Indians.  Diaspora  The Fiji Indian diaspora developed with people of Indian origin leaving Fiji, mainly following the racially inspired coups of 1987 and 2000, to settle primarily in Australia, New Zealand, United States and Canada. Smaller numbers have settled in other Pacific islands, the United Kingdom and other European countries.Microsoft Word ‚Äì 05-05-ana1.rtf Indians from all over India were initially brought to Fiji as indentured laborers to work on sugar cane plantations. Between 1879 and 1916, a total of 60,000 Indians arrived in Fiji. Approximately 25,000 of these returned to India. From 1900 onwards, some Indians arrived as free immigrants, who were mostly from the provinces of Gujarat, Sindh and Punjab. Fiji Indians have been emigrating to United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and the United Kingdom since the early 1960s. These were mainly economic migrants and their number gradually increased in the 1970s and 1980s to reach approximately 4000 per year. Following the military coup of 1987, many Indians saw little future in staying in Fiji and tried to find any means to leave the country. Professional, middle class and business found it easier to emigrate. It has been estimated that more than 100,000 Fiji Indians have emigrated since 1987. This represents a third of the existing Indian population in Fiji. Former Prime Minister Chaudhry has expressed alarm at the high rate of emigration of educated Fiji-Indians. \\"If the trend continues, Fiji will be left with a large pool of poorly educated, unskilled work force with disastrous consequences on our social and economic infrastructure and levels of investment,\\" he said on 19 June 2005.

Outside of combat sports, a \\"journeyman\\" is a trader or craftsman who has completed an apprenticeship, but is not at the level of a master craftsman. Hence, when applied to sports, a \\"journeyman\\" implies a fighter who is no longer a novice, and has the sufficient degree of skill that may be expected from a professional, but who does not have the mastery possessed by the title contenders. Journeymen will often serve as opponents for young up and coming prospects and will often step in at late notice should a fight fall through. Journeymen are said to have little or no expectation of winning fights against contenders or most gatekeepers, but this does not preclude them from having a winning record against less-skilled fighters.Boxrec  Definition of a Boxing JourneymanEastsideboxing  The Journeyman In testimony to the United States Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, DeGuardia states that becoming a journeyman is the fate of many professional boxers, and that a boxer will realize that he has become a journeyman \\"after about 10 years\\" in the profession. Journeymen boxers float \\"from promoter to promoter, or manager to manager, hoping to get placed as opponents in fights\\" by promoters, and making very little money. They will \\"fight all the time, anywhere, in order to make enough money to get by.\\" In earlier testimony to the committee, it had been reported that some journeymen boxers regard themselves as existing in the sport solely as \\"a body for better men to beat on.\\" History Svinth reports that the activities of journeymen boxers changed over the course of the 20th century, with journeymen of the 1920s fighting a couple of times per week and spending little time in the gymnasium, but journeymen of the 1990s fighting a couple of times per year and sparring in the gymnasium three or four nights per week.

It is usually employed as an ethnic or racial slur, and considered derogatory and offensive. Origin The origin of the term is unclear. It was first noted by lexicographer F.C. Bowen in 1929, in his Sea Slang: a dictionary of the old- timers‚Äô expressions and epithets, where he defines wogs as \\"lower class Babu shipping clerks on the Indian coast.\\" Many dictionaries say \\"wog\\" probably derives from the golliwogg, a blackface minstrel doll character from a children's book, The Adventures of Two Dutch Dolls and a Golliwogg by Florence Kate Upton, published in 1895; or from pollywog, a dialect term for tadpole that is used in maritime circles to indicate someone who has not crossed the equator. Suggestions that the word is an acronym for \\"wily Oriental gentleman\\", \\"working on government service\\", or similar, are examples of false etymology or backronyms. Use in British English \\"Wog\\", in the UK, is a derogatory and racially offensive slang word referring to a non-white, or darker-skinned white person, including people from the Middle East, North Africa, the Indian subcontinent, other parts of Asia such as the East Indies, or the Mediterranean area, including Southern Europeans. A similar term, wop, has historically been used to refer to Italians. The saying, \\"The wogs begin at Calais\\" (implying that everyone who is not British is a wog), appears to date from the First World War but was popularised by George Wigg, Labour MP for Dudley, in 1949 when in a parliamentary debate concerning the Burmese, Wigg shouted at the Conservative benches, \\"The Honourable Gentleman and his friends think they are all 'wogs'. Indeed, the Right Honourable Member for Woodford [i.e., Winston Churchill] thinks that the 'wogs' begin at Calais.\\" col 2845. As reported by English-Jewish journalist Linda Grant, people in England have referred to Jews and Israelis as \\"wogs\\", as well. \\"It started at once, [Ophir] said, with the geography teacher, 'who we used to call Bullet, who had a map on the wall where Israel appeared as Palestine and to my face he called Jews and Israelis 'terrorist wogs'... As for calling Jews 'wogs,' Ophir was to understand that there was nothing derogatory in the term, it simply meant Western Oriental Gentleman.\\" In Season 1 Episode 6 - \\"The Germans\\" episode of Fawlty Towers (a 1975 British TV show), Major Gowen specifically refers to \\"wog\\" as meaning any person from India (when speaking about the India vs England cricket game at The Oval to Basil Fawlty). Use in Australian English In Australia, the term \\"wog\\" refers to residents of Southern European, Southeast European, Jewish or Middle Eastern ethnicity or appearance. The slur became widely diffused with an increase in immigration from Southern Europe and the Levant after the Second World War and the term expanded to include immigrants from the Mediterranean region and the Middle East. These new arrivals were perceived by the majority population as contrasting with the larger predominant Anglo-Celtic Australian culture. Today, \\"wog\\" is used particularly in places in Australia with substantial numbers of Southern European Australians, as well as non-European Middle Eastern populations, such as in Sydney and Melbourne. As with other slang and prima facie profanity used in contemporary Australian English, the term \\"wog\\" may be employed either aggressively or affectionately within differing contexts. In Australian English, \\"wog\\" can also be used as a slang word for an illness such as a common cold or influenza, as in: \\"I'm coming down with a wog\\". Such usage is not perceived as derogatory. =In the media= More recently, Southern European-Australian performing artists have taken ownership of the term \\"wog\\", defusing its original pejorative nature. The popular 1980s stage show Wogs Out of Work, created by Nick Giannopoulos and Simon Palomares, is an early example. The production was followed on television with Acropolis Now, starring Giannopoulos, Palomares, George Kapiniaris, and Mary Coustas, and films such as The Wog Boy and Wog Boy 2: Kings of Mykonos, and parodies such as those of Santo Cilauro (Italian), Eric Bana (Croatian-German), Vince Colosimo (Italian), Nick Giannopoulos (Greek), Frank Lotito (Italian), Mary Coustas (Greek), and SBS Television's offbeat Pizza and later Here Come the Habibs. TV series have continued this change in Australian cultural history‚Äîwith some even classifying a genre of \\"wogsploitation\\" of pop culture products being created by and for a proudly \\"wog\\" market. Recent works of the genre have been used by Australians of non-English speaking backgrounds to assert ethnic identity rather than succumb to ethnic stereotypes. Upon the release of Wog Boy 2, Giannopoulos discussed the contemporary use of the term \\"wog\\" in the Australian context: > I think by defusing the word 'wog' we've shown our maturity and our great > ability to adapt and just laugh things off, you know... When I first came > [to Greece] and I started trying to explain to them why we got called 'wog' > they'd get really angry about it, you know. They were, \\"Why? Why they say > this about the Greek people?\\" You know? But then when they see what we've > done with it‚Äîand this is the twist‚Äîthat we've turned it into a term of > endearment, they actually really get into that... Thus, in contemporary Australia, the term \\"wog\\" may, in certain contexts, be viewed as a \\"nickname\\" rather than a pejorative term‚Äîakin to the nicknames ascribed within Australian English to other historically significant cultural groupings such as the English (\\"Poms\\"), the Americans (\\"Yanks\\") and New Zealanders (\\"Kiwis\\"). Use in the American English Duane Clarridge, a former CIA officer, explained that the term \\"wog factor\\" was used by the CIA \\"to acknowledge that the motivations that shape decision-making in North Africa, the Middle East, and the Indian subcontinent are very different from our own.\\"  Scientology  The word \\"wog\\" is used by Scientologists to refer to non-Scientologists. Scientology's founder L. Ron Hubbard defined wog as a \\"common, everyday garden-variety humanoid ... He 'is' a body. [He] doesn't know he's there, etc. He isn't there as a spirit at all. He is not operating as a thetan.\\"Saint Hill Briefing Course-82 6611C29 See also *List of ethnic slurs References External links * Essays looking at the origins of the word and its possible relationship with \\"golliwog\\" Anti-Asian sentiment Anti-Arabism English-language slang Ethnic and religious slurs Xenophobia Anti-black racism English words ","title":"Wog"},{"id":"20647995","text":"Shirley Yu (‰ΩôËééËéâ) is a Hong Kong actress.

Biography An African American, Lonnie Clayton was born in Kansas City, Missouri, on March 27, 1876, one of the nine children of Robert and Evaline Clayton. At age ten, his family moved to North Little Rock, Arkansas, where he attended school and worked as a gofer for a hotel and as a shoeshine boy to help support his family. According to the Central Arkansas Library System's Encyclopedia of Arkansas History & Culture, a correspondent for the Thoroughbred Record wrote in 1896 that Clayton attended school and was considered \\"exceptionally bright.\\" At age twelve the diminutive Lonnie Clayton left home and made his way north to Chicago's Washington Park Race Track where his brother Albertus was a jockey for prominent Thoroughbred horse racing stable owner, Lucky Baldwin. Lonnie Clayton was given a job as a stablehand and exercise rider for the Baldwin stable then the following year he moved east to the Clifton Race Track in New Jersey where in 1890 the fourteen-year- old began his professional riding career. Immediately successful, in 1891 at Morris Park Racetrack in The Bronx, New York, Clayton won the important Champagne Stakes aboard Bashford Manor Stable's two-year-old colt, Azra. On May 11, 1892, he rode Azra to victory in the Kentucky Derby which at age fifteen made him the youngest jockey in history to ever win the Derby.\\"Kansas Jockey won derby, was forced out of racing\\" , Wichita Eagle and Kansas.com, April 19, 2010. Clayton and Azra followed up their Derby success with victories in the Clark Handicap and the Travers Stakes. At Monmouth Park in New Jersey Clayton won the 1893 Monmouth Handicap and went on to win the fall riding title at Churchill Downs. One of the leading money winners on the East Coast racing circuit during the 1890s, he won races from New York to California. He captured back-to-back runnings of the Kentucky Oaks in 1894 and 1895, the latter a year in which he won 144 races and finished in the money sixty percent of the time. In 1895 he won the Arkansas Derby and in 1896 finished third in the Preakness Stakes aboard the filly, Intermission. Alonzo Clayton, circa 1898 However, by the start of the 20th century, racism began to raise its ugly head and opportunities to ride soon vanished as stable owners switched to using white riders only. Within a few years, African-American jockeys, who had dominated racing for centuries and who had played a major role in bringing Thoroughbred racing to the forefront of American sport, were forced out of the business. Since 1909, no African-American jockey has ridden a winner in any major American Graded stakes race. An 1896 report and a 1900 report in the Brooklyn Daily Eagle stated that Clayton planned to join other black jockeys riding in Europe but no records have been found to confirm he actually went there. Lonnie Clayton's success had allowed him to acquire a property in Little Rock, Arkansas, upon which he competed construction of a new home in early 1895. Described by the Arkansas Gazette as the \\"finest house on the North Side,\\" it was designed in the fashion of Queen Anne style architecture in the United States. An astute businessman, in 1897 Clayton also built a commercial building at 617‚Äì619 Main Street in Little Rock, which stood until about 1980. However, denied the right to earn a living in racing, he was forced to sell his investment property and his home. His residence is today known as Engelberger House and since 1990 has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Clayton lived his last few years in California where he worked as a hotel bellhop. He died at age forty on March 17, 1917, of chronic pulmonary tuberculosis. He is buried at Evergreen Cemetery in Los Angeles. Alonzo Clayton's accomplishments in racing were recognized by the Arkansas Sports Hall of Fame with his induction in 2012.

Early use of term The Oxford Living Dictionaries dates the term to the early 19th century. Examples are plentiful through the 20th century. Former Chief Constable of Glasgow Sir Percy Sillitoe noted use of the word by gangs and police in the 1930s. Leader columns of newspapers in the 1960s featured the term in relation to teenage gang violence.Stirling Observer counties edition, \\"Stop the Rise of the teen-ager\\" July 1960 In a 1962 book, the crime writer and broadcaster Bill Knox referred to stolen cars turning up after having been taken \\"by a bunch of neds who want transport for some house- breaking job\\". He publicised the term more widely in his 1970s police report series Crimedesk, made and broadcast by STV. In his 1975 novel Rally to Kill, Knox described \\"neds\\" as Glasgow's \\"tag for small-time hoodlums\\", saying that \\"neds\\" and their families from the Gorbals had been rehoused elsewhere in the city, \\"taking their violence with them to the new areas\\". A 1982 analysis of crime fiction notes Knox's 1977 novel Pilot Error describing Strathclyde Police as being unconcerned about \\"neds\\" getting hurt in a fight as long as no one else is affected and translates the term as \\"Glasgow slang for hoods\\". In his 2002 autobiography Granny Made me an Anarchist, the Glaswegian writer Stuart Christie described the Glasgow \\"Neds\\" as preceding the Teddy Boys of 1955 as a hangover from the poverty of the 1930s. These \\"Neds\\" had long hair parted in the middle and smoothed down with liquid paraffin, commonly with a \\"dowt\\" tucked behind their ear as a fire hazard which in urban legend had resulted in one \\"Ned\\" getting severe burns. He describes them as slouching along with their elbows projecting aggressively, wearing a white silk scarf tucked into their tightly buttoned jacket, and carrying a cut-throat razor in its breast pocket. Over this, on outings for a fight or a dance, they allegedly wore an old tweed overcoat with weapons such as hatchets or hammers concealed in the lining. According to Christie, the \\"Teds\\" who followed them also had a reputation for wild behaviour, but were too concerned about their clothes to engage in aggression. Ned culture In 2003, the Scottish Socialist Party MSP Rosie Kane tabled a question to the Scottish Parliament condemning use of the word ned which she said was degrading and insulting to young people as it stood for non-educated delinquent. This is a widespread folk etymology, but appears to be a backronym arising long after the term came into use. A 2011 study using ethnography as a methodology of linguistic research found working-class adolescent males in a high school in the south side of Glasgow deploying a number of distinct social identities: * those identified as \\"neds\\" by themselves and others * \\"alternatives\\" (sometimes called \\"Goths\\" or \\"Moshers\\") who enjoyed rock music and wore black clothes * \\"sports\\" who enjoyed football and rugby and wore trainers and sports clothing * \\"schoolies\\" who generally did not play sports but played musical instruments. Many pupils in the study distanced themselves from the stereotypes. Each group had a characteristic way of speaking and used this to create social identity. Those in the \\"ned\\" category, for example, lowered tones in words such as \\"cat\\" and extended the vowels. This in itself was insufficient to identify someone as being a \\"ned\\": consideration of clothing and social activities was also needed. Both the \\"neds\\" and the \\"sports\\" had an attitude of enjoying engaging in physical violence while the \\"schoolies\\" avoided violence, but antisocial behaviour was often only carried out by a small minority of adolescents. The \\"neds\\" were just as concerned about violence and crime as the other groups, but, unlike them, socialised in the street rather than being engaged in the school culture. and Full Report In Dundee, the Roma word gadgie (a non-Roma man) has been used historically; however, ned has been introduced by popular culture. In all other parts of Scotland and in parts of northeast England (particularly Newcastle upon Tyne), gadgie remains current with its Roma meaning. British psychologist Adrian Raine has expressed contempt for what he feels is the glorification of ned culture in the Scottish media. He has also opined that ned culture is closely correlated with psychopathy.Raine, Adrian. \\"21st Century Television's Faltering Moral Compass\\". The Economist. 8 April 2009.

It criminalizes production and dissemination of technology, devices, or services intended to circumvent measures that control access to copyrighted works (commonly known as digital rights management or DRM). It also criminalizes the act of circumventing an access control, whether or not there is actual infringement of copyright itself. In addition, the DMCA heightens the penalties for copyright infringement on the Internet.DMCA p7.United States Code (2010) Title 17 CHAPTER 5, COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT AND REMEDIES, Sec. 506 ‚Äì Criminal offenses Passed on October 12, 1998, by a unanimous vote in the United States Senate and signed into law by President Bill Clinton on October 28, 1998, the DMCA amended Title 17 of the United States Code to extend the reach of copyright, while limiting the liability of the providers of online services for copyright infringement by their users. The DMCA's principal innovation in the field of copyright is the exemption from direct and indirect liability of Internet service providers and other intermediaries. This exemption was adopted by the European Union in the Electronic Commerce Directive 2000. The Information Society Directive 2001 implemented the 1996 WIPO Copyright Treaty in the EU. Provisions =Title I: WIPO Copyright and Performances and Phonograms Treaties Implementation Act= DMCA Title I, the WIPO Copyright and Performances and Phonograms Treaties Implementation Act, amends U.S. copyright law to comply with the WIPO Copyright Treaty and the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty, adopted at the WIPO Diplomatic Conference in December 1996. The treaties have two major portions. One portion includes works covered by several treaties in U.S. copy prevention laws and gave the title its name. For further analysis of this portion of the Act and of cases under it, see WIPO Copyright and Performances and Phonograms Treaties Implementation Act. The second portion (17 U.S.C. 1201) is often known as the DMCA anti-circumvention provisions. These provisions changed the remedies for the circumvention of copy-prevention systems (also called \\"technical protection measures\\"). The section contains a number of specific limitations and exemptions, for such things as government research and reverse engineering in specified situations. Although, section 1201(c) of the title stated that the section does not change the underlying substantive copyright infringement rights, remedies, or defenses, it did not make those defenses available in circumvention actions. The section does not include a fair use exemption from criminality nor a scienter requirement, so criminal liability could attach to even unintended circumvention for legitimate purposes. =Title II: Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act= DMCA Title II, the Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act (\\"OCILLA\\"), creates a safe harbor for online service providers (OSPs, including ISPs) against copyright infringement liability, provided they meet specific requirements.Cullins, Ashley Music Industry A-Listers Call on Congress to Reform Copyright Act Hollywood Reporter. April 5, 2016 OSPs must adhere to and qualify for certain prescribed safe harbor guidelines and promptly block access to alleged infringing material (or remove such material from their systems) when they receive notification of an infringement claim from a copyright holder or the copyright holder's agent. OCILLA also includes a counternotification provision that offers OSPs a safe harbor from liability to their users when users claim that the material in question is not, in fact, infringing. OCILLA also facilitates issuing of subpoenas against OSPs to provide their users' identity. =Title III: Computer Maintenance Competition Assurance Act= DMCA Title III modified section 117 of the copyright title so that those repairing computers could make certain temporary, limited copies while working on a computer. It reversed the precedent set in MAI Systems Corp. v. Peak Computer, Inc., 991 F.2d 511 (9th Cir. 1993). =Title IV: Miscellaneous Provisions= DMCA Title IV contains an assortment of provisions: * Clarified and added to the duties of the Copyright Office. * Added ephemeral copy for broadcasters provisions, including certain statutory licenses. * Added provisions to facilitate distance education. * Added provisions to assist libraries with keeping phonorecords of sound recordings. * Added provisions relating to collective bargaining and the transfer of movie rights. =Title V: Vessel Hull Design Protection Act= DMCA Title V added sections 1301 through 1332 to add a sui generis protection for boat hull designs. Boat hull designs were not considered covered under copyright law because boats are useful articles whose form cannot be separated from their function.17 U.S.C. 101 (defining \\"Pictorial, graphic and sculptural works\\" as \\"Such works shall include works of artistic craftsmanship insofar as their form but not their mechanical or utilitarian aspects are concerned; the design of a useful article, as defined in this section, shall be considered a pictorial, graphic, or sculptural work only if, and only to the extent that, such design incorporates pictorial, graphic, or sculptural features that can be identified separately from, and are capable of existing independently of, the utilitarian aspects of the article.\\")\\"Vessel Hull Design Protection Act of 1997 (H.R. 2696)\\", Statement of MaryBeth Peters, The Register of Copyrights, before the Subcommittee on Courts and Intellectual Property, Committee on the Judiciary, Oct. 23, 1997 (\\"It is a long-held view of the Office that a gap exists in legal protection for the designs of useful articles. Existing bodies of federal intellectual property law do not provide appropriate and practical coverage for such designs, while state law is largely preempted in this area. Consequently, while considerable investment and creativity may go into the creation of innovative designs, they often can be copied with impunity.\\"). Anti-circumvention exemptions In addition to the safe harbors and exemptions the statute explicitly provides, 17 U.S.C. 1201(a)(1) requires that the Librarian of Congress issue exemptions from the prohibition against circumvention of access-control technology. Exemptions are granted when it is shown that access-control technology has had a substantial adverse effect on the ability of people to make non-infringing uses of copyrighted works. The exemption rules are revised every three years. Exemption proposals are submitted by the public to the Registrar of Copyrights, and after a process of hearings and public comments, the final rule is recommended by the Registrar and issued by the Librarian. Exemptions expire after three years and must be resubmitted for the next rulemaking cycle. Consequently, only the most recent rulemaking is valid, and prior exemptions issued (in 2000, 2003, 2006, 2010 and 2013) are no longer valid. As of 2017 (for the 2018 rulemaking), the Copyright Office is considering re-authorizing such exemptions if no new evidence is submitted to the contrary. = Section 1201 Study = After much criticism (see below), on December 29, 2015, the Copyright Office initiated a study to assess the operation of section 1201 and the triennial rulemaking process. This is different from usual public comments on exemption proposals. It includes the role of the anti-trafficking provisions and permanent exemptions, and the requirements of the rulemaking itself. The Office has issued a Notice of Inquiry requesting public comment. Several comments were posted by individuals and organizations. An individual recalls that the Copyright Clause has limitations. Association of American Publishers et al. hold there is no need to amend the statute or to significantly alter the rulemaking. They are happy with the protection they are being granted, including anti-trafficking provisions, and talk of placing the cart before the horse, when they argue about requiring a proof of the mindset that consumers would have when utilizing circumvention tools before actual acts of circumvention occur. In their opinion, the meaning of Section 1201 is to extend, not merely duplicate, copyright holder's rights. Society of American Archivists say they are not aware that the anti-trafficking provisions of section 1201(a)(2) and 1201(b) have had any impact in deterring copyright infringement. They do know, however, that the provisions have created an absurd, Catch-22 situation for any archives that sought to adhere to the letter of the law. iFixit also talks of Catch-22 on stressing that since it is up to proponents to show that an exemption is relevant, they need to show that there's overwhelming market demand if only it were legal. Rapid7 notice that DMCA adversely affects good faith security research by forbidding researchers from circumventing technological protection measures (TPMs) to analyze software for vulnerabilities. Cyberlaw Clinic at Harvard Law School points out that the rulemaking is a complicated, ad hoc, and unduly burdensome process. The Learning Disabilities Association of America (LDA) commented that circumventing DRM restrictions to meet accessibility needs deserves a permanent exception. Entertainment Software Association gives a vivid and detailed description of a flourishing market which is only possible because of DMCA. They are deeply concerned about people with disabilities, but that concern is already being taken care of by the copyright holders, so that no permanent exception is needed. Comments have also been submitted by, among others, R Street Institute American Association of Law Libraries, Business Software Alliance, Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, Association of American Universities et al., Copyright Alliance, Association for Computing Machinery U.S. Public Policy Council, the Software and Information Industry Association, DVD Copy Control Association (\\"DVD CCA\\") et al., Microsoft Corporation, Association for Competitive Technology, Public Knowledge, American Automobile Association. In June 2017, the Copyright Office published a report where it \\"shares the concern\\" that Section 1201 can affect activities unrelated to copyright infringement, but it does not advise to amend it because it could \\"severely weaken the right of copyright owners to exercise meaningful control over the terms of access to their works online\\", which they believe is \\"essential to the development of the digital marketplace for creative content\\".Section 1201 of Title 17: A report of the Register of Copyrights - United States Copyright Office, June 2017 = Previous exemptions = The Copyright Office approved two exemptions in 2000, four in 2003, six each in 2006 and 2010, five in 2012 and nine in 2015. ; 2000 rulemaking In 2000, the first rulemaking, the Office exempted: * \\"Compilations consisting of lists of websites blocked by filtering software applications\\" (renewed in 2003 but not renewed in 2006); and * \\"Literary works, including computer programs and databases, protected by access control mechanisms that fail to permit access because of malfunction, damage, or obsoleteness.\\" (revised and limited in 2003 and again in 2006). ;2003 rulemaking In 2003, the Office made the following rules: * The 2000 filtering exemption was revised and renewed. * The 2000 \\"literary works including computer programs\\" exemption was limited to \\"Computer programs protected by dongles that prevent access due to malfunction or damage and which are obsolete\\" and this exemption was renewed in both 2006 and 2010. * A new exemption was implemented for electronic books for which technological protection measures prevented the use of read-aloud software or screen readers. This exemption was renewed in 2006, 2010, 2012, and 2015. * A new exemption was made for \\"Computer programs and video games distributed in formats that have become obsolete and which require the original media or hardware as a condition of access.\\" This exemption was renewed in 2006 but not in 2010. ;2006 rulemaking In 2006, the Office made the following rules: * The 2003 exemption on obsolete computer programs and video games was renewed. * The 2003 exemption on computer programs protected by dongles was renewed. * The 2003 exemption on electronic books was renewed. * A new exemption was made for sound recordings allowed after security flaws were found in a copy protection system on some Sony CDs; this was not renewed in 2010. * A new exemption was implemented covering the audiovisual works included in the educational library of a college or university's film or media studies department; this was not renewed in 2010. * A new exemption was implemented allowing circumvention to allow wireless telephone handsets to connect to wireless networks. This exemption was revised in 2010 to specify used handsets and require authorization from the wireless network operator. Another exemption for wireless handsets was introduced in 2010 specific to interoperability software on the phone itself. ; 2010 rulemaking Rulemaking was scheduled to occur in 2009, but the final rule was not issued until the following year. The 2010 exemptions, issued in July 2010, are: * Motion pictures on DVDs that are lawfully made and acquired and that are protected by the Content Scrambling System when circumvention is accomplished solely in order to accomplish the incorporation of short portions of motion pictures into new works for the purpose of criticism or comment, and where the person engaging in circumvention believes and has reasonable grounds for believing that circumvention is necessary to fulfill the purpose of the use in the following instances: ** Educational uses by college and university professors and by college and university film and media studies students; ** Documentary filmmaking; ** Obsolete software and video game formats. ** Noncommercial videos. (A new exemption in 2010, similar to a previous educational exemption.) * Computer programs that enable wireless telephone handsets to execute software applications, where circumvention is accomplished for the sole purpose of enabling interoperability of such applications, when they have been lawfully obtained, with computer programs on the telephone handset. (A new exemption in 2010.) * Computer programs, in the form of firmware or software, that enable used wireless telephone handsets to connect to a wireless telecommunications network, when circumvention is initiated by the owner of the copy of the computer program solely in order to connect to a wireless telecommunications network and access to the network is authorized by the operator of the network. (Revised from a similar exemption approved in 2006.) * Video games accessible on personal computers and protected by technological protection measures that control access to lawfully obtained works, when circumvention is accomplished solely for the purpose of good faith testing for, investigating, or correcting security flaws or vulnerabilities, if: ** The information derived from the security testing is used primarily to promote the security of the owner or operator of a computer, computer system, or computer network; and ** The information derived from the security testing is used or maintained in a manner that does not facilitate copyright infringement or a violation of applicable law. (A new exemption in 2010.) * Computer programs protected by dongles that prevent access due to malfunction or damage and which are obsolete. A dongle shall be considered obsolete if it is no longer manufactured or if a replacement or repair is no longer reasonably available in the commercial marketplace. (A renewed exemption from 2006, based on a similar exemption approved in 2003.) * Literary works distributed in e-book format when all existing e-book editions of the work (including digital text editions made available by authorized entities) contain access controls that prevent the enabling either of the book's read- aloud function or of screen readers that render the text into a specialized format. (A renewed exemption from 2006, based on a similar exemption approved in 2003.) ; 2012 rulemaking The 2012 exemptions, issued in November 2012, are for: * Literary works, distributed electronically, that are protected by technological measures that either prevent the enabling of read-aloud functionality or interfere with screen readers or other applications or assistive technologies * Computer programs that enable smartphones and portable all-purpose mobile computing devices to execute lawfully obtained software applications, where circumvention is accomplished for the sole purpose of enabling interoperability of such applications with computer programs on the smartphone or device, or to permit removal of software from the smartphone or device * Computer programs that enable certain types of wireless devices to connect to a wireless telecommunications network, when circumvention is undertaken solely in order to connect to a wireless telecommunications network and such connection is authorized by the operator of such network * Motion pictures (including television shows and videos), as defined in 17 U.S.C. 101, where circumvention is undertaken solely in order to make use of short portions of the motion pictures for the purpose of criticism or comment in limited instances * Motion pictures and other audiovisual works on DVDs that are protected by the Content Scrambling System, or that are distributed by an online service and protected by technological measures that control access to such works, where circumvention is related to developing captioning and descriptive audio technologies ; 2015 rulemaking The 2015 exemptions, issued in October 2015, are for: * Motion pictures (including television shows and videos), as defined in 17 U.S.C. 101, where circumvention is undertaken solely in order to make use of short portions of the motion pictures for the purpose of criticism or comment in limited instances, * Literary works, distributed electronically, that are protected by technological measures that either prevent the enabling of read-aloud functionality or interfere with screen readers or other applications or assistive technologies, * Computer programs that enable the following types of wireless devices to connect to a wireless telecommunications network, when circumvention is undertaken solely in order to connect to a wireless telecommunications network and such connection is authorized by the operator of such network, * Computer programs that enable smartphones, tablets and portable all-purpose mobile computing devices, and smart televisions to execute lawfully obtained software applications, where circumvention is accomplished for the sole purpose of enabling interoperability of such applications with computer programs on the smartphone or device, or to permit removal of software from the smartphone or device, * Computer programs that are contained in and control the functioning of a motorized land vehicle such as a personal automobile, commercial motor vehicle or mechanized agricultural vehicle, except for computer programs primarily designed for the control of telematics or entertainment systems for such vehicle, when circumvention is a necessary step undertaken by the authorized owner of the vehicle to allow the diagnosis, repair or lawful modification of a vehicle function, * Computer programs, where the circumvention is undertaken on a lawfully acquired device or machine on which the computer program operates solely for the purpose of good-faith security research and does not violate any applicable law, * Video games in the form of computer programs embodied in physical or downloaded formats that have been lawfully acquired as complete games, when the copyright owner or its authorized representative has ceased to provide access to an external computer server necessary to facilitate an authentication process to enable local gameplay, * Computer programs that operate 3D printers that employ microchip-reliant technological measures to limit the use of feedstock, when circumvention is accomplished solely for the purpose of using alternative feedstock and not for the purpose of accessing design software, design files or proprietary data, and * Literary works consisting of compilations of data generated by medical devices that are wholly or partially implanted in the body or by their corresponding personal monitoring systems, where such circumvention is undertaken by a patient for the sole purpose of lawfully accessing the data generated by his or her own device or monitoring system. Linking to infringing content The law is currently unsettled with regard to websites that contain links to infringing material; however, there have been a few lower-court decisions which have ruled against linking in some narrowly prescribed circumstances. One is when the owner of a website has already been issued an injunction against posting infringing material on their website and then links to the same material in an attempt to circumvent the injunction. Another area involves linking to software or devices which are designed to circumvent (digital rights management) devices, or links from websites whose sole purpose is to circumvent copyright protection by linking to copyrighted material. =Edelman v. N2H2= In July 2002, American Civil Liberties Union filed a lawsuit on the behalf of Benjamin Edelman, a computer researcher at Berkman Center for Internet and Society, seeking a declaratory judgment to affirm his first amendment rights when reverse engineering the censorware product of defendant N2H2 in case he intended to publish the finding. N2H2 filed a motion to dismiss, which the court granted. =RealNetworks, Inc. v. DVD Copy Control Association, Inc.= In August 2009, the DVD Copy Control Association won a lawsuit against RealNetworks for violating copyright law in selling its RealDVD software, allowing users to copy DVDs and store them on a harddrive. The DVD Copy Control Association claimed that Real violated the DMCA by circumventing anti-piracy measures ARccOS Protection and RipGuard, as well as breaking Real's licensing agreement with the Content Scrambling System. =Viacom Inc. v. YouTube, Google Inc.= On March 13, 2007, Viacom filed a lawsuit against YouTube and its corporate parent Google for copyright infringement seeking more than $1 billion in damages. The complaint was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. Viacom claims the popular video-sharing site was engaging in \\"massive intentional copyright infringement\\" for making available a contended 160,000 unauthorized clips of Viacom's entertainment programming. Google relied on the 1998 Digital Millennium Copyright Act's \\"safe harbor\\" provision to shield them from liability. On June 23, 2010, U.S. District Judge Louis Stanton granted summary judgment in favor of YouTube.Viacom Int'l Inc., et al., v. YouTube, Inc., et al., Nos. 07-Civ-2103 (LLS), 07-Civ-3582 (LLS) Opinion and Order (S.D.N.Y. June 24, 2010). The court held that YouTube is protected by the safe harbor of the DMCA. Viacom appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. On April 5, 2012, the federal Second Circuit Court of Appeals vacated Judge Louis Stanton's ruling, and instead ruled that Viacom had presented enough evidence against YouTube to warrant a trial, and the case should not have been thrown out in summary judgment. The court did uphold the ruling that YouTube could not be held liable based on \\"general knowledge\\" that users on its site were infringing copyright. The case was sent back to the District Court in New York, and on April 18, 2013, Judge Stanton issued another order granting summary judgment in favor of YouTube. The case is over; no money changed hands. =IO Group, Inc. v. Veoh Networks, Inc.= On June 23, 2006, IO Group, Inc. filed a complaint against Veoh Networks, Inc. in the U.S. District Court for California's Northern District. IO Group alleged that Veoh was responsible for copyright infringement by allowing videos owned by IO Group to be accessed through Veoh's online service without permission over 40,000 times between the dates June 1 and June 22. Veoh is a Flash video site relying on user contributed content. IO Group argued that since Veoh transcoded user uploaded videos to Flash format it became a direct infringer and the materials were under their direct control, thereby disqualifying them for DMCA safe harbor protection. The ruling judge disagreed with the argument, stating that > Veoh has simply established a system whereby software automatically > processes user-submitted content and recasts it in a format that is readily > accessible to its users. Veoh preselects the software parameters for the > process from a range of default values set by the thirdparty software... But > Veoh does not itself actively participate or supervise the uploading of > files. Nor does it preview or select the files before the upload is > completed. Instead, video files are uploaded through an automated process > which is initiated entirely at the volition of Veoh's users. The Court has granted the Veoh's motion for summary judgment, on the basis of the DMCA, holding that the defendant's video-sharing web site complied and was entitled to the protection of the statute's \\"safe harbor\\" provision. Even though Veoh won the court case, it blamed the litigation as one of the causes of its preparing to file Chapter 7 bankruptcy and its subsequent sale to Qlipso.\\"Content sharing company Qlipso buys Veoh\\" (Apr 9, 2010) Athena Information Solutions Pvt. Ltd.\\"UMG v. Veoh: victory has never been so pyrrhic\\" (Dec 22, 2011) Engadget, Newstex =Vernor v. Autodesk, Inc.= After numerous DMCA takedown notices in response to his eBay listings, Timothy S. Vernor sued Autodesk in August 2007, alleging that Autodesk abused the DMCA and disrupted his right to sell used software he bought at a garage sale. In May 2008, a federal district judge in Washington State Autodesk's authorised that the software's license agreement preempted the seller from his rights under the first-sale doctrine. In September 2010, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed, holding that \\"a software user is a licensee rather than an owner of a copy where the copyright owner (1) specifies that the user is granted a license; (2) significantly authorised the user's ability to transfer the software; and (3) imposes notable use authorisations.\\" =Lenz v. Universal Music Corp.= In 2007, Stephanie Lenz, a writer and editor from Gallitzin, Pennsylvania made a home video of her 13-month-old son dancing to the Prince song \\"Let's Go Crazy\\" and posted a 29-second video on the video- sharing site YouTube. Four months after the video was originally uploaded, Universal Music Group, which owned the copyrights to the song, ordered YouTube to remove the video enforcing the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. Lenz notified YouTube immediately that her video was within the scope of fair use, and demanded that it be restored. YouTube complied after six weeks‚Äînot two weeks, as required by the Digital Millennium Copyright Act‚Äîto see whether Universal planned to sue Lenz for infringement. Lenz then sued Universal Music in California for her legal costs, claiming the music company had acted in bad faith by ordering removal of a video that represented fair use of the song. In August 2008, U.S. District Judge Jeremy Fogel of San Jose, California ruled that copyright holders cannot order a deletion of an online file without determining whether that posting reflected \\"fair use\\" of the copyrighted material. On February 25, 2010, Judge Fogel issued a ruling rejecting several of Universal's affirmative defenses, including the defense that Lenz suffered no damages.Lenz v. Universal Music Corp. In 2015, the court ultimately upheld the finding that Universal was liable under 17 USC 512(f) (the DMCA's bad faith notice and takedown provision) for failing to consider fair use before sending its initial takedown notice. =Flava Works Inc. v. Gunter= In the case of Flava Works Inc. v. Gunter the court denied the defendant safe harbor protection under DMCA . The district court found that the defendant had knowledge of its users' infringing activity and also failed to prevent future infringing activity. As such the plaintiff's motion for preliminary injunction was granted. On appeal, however, the Seventh Circuit vacated the injunction, citing the standard set in eBay Inc. v. MercExchange, L.L.C., which states that courts should not rely on categorical rules as a standard for injunction. =Ouellette v. Viacom International Inc.= In this case of Ouellette v. Viacom International Inc., the court denied plaintiff's attempt to find liability for YouTube and Myspace's takedowns of the plaintiff's homemade videos. Despite potential fair use claims, the court found it impossible to use the DMCA takedown provisions as a foundation for liability. The court found that the safe harbor provision serves \\"to limit the liability of internet service providers, not to create liability that could not otherwise be imposed under existing law independent of the DMCA.\\"Ouellette v. Viacom, Dist. Court, D. Montana (2011) =Sony v. George Hotz= In January 2011, Sony Computer Entertainment sued George Hotz over violating the Section 1201 of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act as well as the Federal Fraud and Abuse Act due to facilitating consumers to jailbreak their PlayStation 3 consoles.Sony follows up, officially sues Geohot and fail0verflow over PS3 jailbreak. Nilay Patel, Engadget (2011-01-12). Retrieved on 2011-02-16. Hotz argued that because he had purchased the product, he had the right to do with it as he pleased. After three months, Sony and Hotz decided to settle out of court. This also included an injunction against George Hotz, barring him from hacking any more Sony products. =Automattic, Inc. and Oliver Hotham v. Nick Steiner= In 2013, Oliver Hotham wrote an article on WordPress (owned by Automattic, Inc.) critical of Straight Pride UK that included material from a press release sent to him by Straight Pride UK's press officer, Nick Steiner. Steiner sent WordPress a DMCA takedown notice claiming that Hotham's article infringed their copyright. WordPress and Hotham sued in a federal District Court in California, under ¬ß512(f) of the DMCA, claiming that the takedown notice was fraudulent, and that the takedown cost the plaintiffs time, lost work and attorneys' fees. In 2015, the court issued a default judgment in favor of WordPress and Hotham in the amount of $25,084.Van der Sar, Ernesto. \\"WordPress Wins $25,000 From DMCA Takedown Abuser\\", TorrentFreak.com, March 5, 2015 Criticisms =Abuse of takedown notice= Google asserted misuse of the DMCA in a filing concerning New Zealand's copyright act, quoting results from a 2005 study by California academics Laura Quilter and Jennifer Urban based on data from the Chilling Effects clearinghouse. Takedown notices targeting a competing business made up over half (57%) of the notices Google has received, the company said, and more than one-third (37%), \\"were not valid copyright claims.\\" Currently, there are three main abuses of the DMCA. First, fair use has been a legal gray area, and subject to opposing interpretations. This has caused inequity in the treatment of individual cases. Second, the DMCA has often been invoked overbearingly, favoring larger copyright holders over smaller ones. This has caused accidental takedowns of legitimate content, such as a record company accidentally removing a music video from their own artist. Third, the lack of consequences for perjury in claims encourages censorship. This has caused temporary takedowns of legitimate content that can be financially damaging to the legitimate copyright holder, who has no recourse for reimbursement. This has been used by businesses to censor competition. =Abuse of the anti-circumvention provision= In 2015 Volkswagen abused the DMCA to hide their vehicles emissions cheat.Researchers Could Have Uncovered Volkswagen's Emissions Cheat If Not Hindered by the DMCA  Electronic Frontier Foundation It has been suggested that had the DMCA not prevented access to the software \\"..a researcher with legal access to Volkswagen's software could have discovered the code that changed how the cars behave in testing..\\"Wired = Effect on analog video equipment = Analog Copy Protection (ACP), the encryption technology created by Rovi Corporation (formerly Macrovision, now TiVo), is designed to thwart users' attempts to reproduce content via analog cables. When a DVD is played through an analog video cable and recorded using a VCR, Rovi's ACP technology will distort the copy partially or completely. The technology works by adding additional lines to the video signal. In the NTSC video standard, blank lines (vertical blanking intervals) that the user cannot see are used for functions like closed captioning. Rovi Corporation uses these blank lines to implement its ACP technology. The implementation of ACP has been ill-regarded by some video enthusiasts. Many claim that the technology has led to signal issues with VCRs and analog video equipment. Some VCRs misread the encryption used to prevent copying, distorting the video image regardless of whether the recording is original or a copy. The DMCA has been criticized for forcing all producers of analog video equipment to support the proprietary copy protection technology of Rovi Corporation, a commercial firm. The producers of video equipment are forced by law to support and implement the corporation's proprietary technology. This benefits Rovi Corporation financially, whereas those forced to implement it receive neither profit nor compensation. Additionally, some criticize the implementation of ACP as a violation of their fair use rights. A recently developed TV-streaming product called the Slingbox uses analog signals to convey video from television to a mobile device. However, the encryption used by ACP blocks analog transmission, rendering the Slingbox unusable. Additionally ACP blocks the use of recording for educational purposes. On one or more accounts, students have not been able to cite and record cable sources properly due to ACP restrictions. =Effect on research= The DMCA has affected the worldwide cryptography research community, since an argument can be made that any cryptanalytic research violates, or might violate, the DMCA. The arrest of Russian programmer Dmitry Sklyarov in 2001, for alleged infringement of the DMCA, was a highly publicized example of the law's use to prevent or penalize development of anti-DRM measures. While working for ElcomSoft in Russia, he developed The Advanced eBook Processor, a software application allowing users to strip usage restriction information from restricted e-books, an activity legal in both Russia and the United States. Paradoxically, under the DMCA, it is not legal in the United States to provide such a tool. Sklyarov was arrested in the United States after presenting a speech at DEF CON and subsequently spent nearly a month in jail. The DMCA has also been cited as chilling to legitimate users, such as students of cryptanalysis (including, in a well-known instance, Professor Edward Felten and students at Princeton),RIAA challenges SDMI attack 2002-01-07, Retrieved on 2007-02-26 and security consultants such as Niels Ferguson, who has declined to publish information about vulnerabilities he discovered in an Intel secure-computing scheme because of his concern about being arrested under the DMCA when he travels to the U.S. =Effect on innovation and competition= In at least one court case, the DMCA has been used by open source software projects to defend against conversion of software (i.e., license violations) that involved removal of copyright notices. =Reform and opposition= There have been several Congressional efforts to modify the Act. The Unlocking Technology Act of 2013 was introduced to attempt to exempt non-infringing uses from the anti-circumvention clause. However, the bill was not passed by Congress. In 2014, the Unlocking Consumer Choice and Wireless Competition Act was passed, granting a specific exemption for unlocking cell phones, without affecting the other provisions of the DMCA. Bills in 2015 included the Unlocking Technology Act of 2015,Govtrack.us and the Breaking Down Barriers to Innovation Act of 2015.Congress.gov Republicans are considering legislation as well, as it becomes clear that Section 1201 is impeding the country's security. Facing escalating numbers of cyberthreats, cybersecurity researchers petitioned to conduct research to keep pace with evolving cybersecurity risks and vulnerabilities, stating: \\"Without such an exemption, security risks will lie unaddressed and the public will be substantially less safe.\\"Engagedscholarship.csuohio.edu The bills are intended to address the fact that section 1201 prevents circumvention even when doing so is not copyright infringement. In addition, the section requires exemption proponents to bear the burden of proof every time their exemption comes up for triennial review, instead of there being a presumption of renewal for an exemption whose importance was previously proven. Rick Boucher, a congressman from Virginia, led previous efforts by introducing the Digital Media Consumers' Rights Act (DMCRA). A prominent bill related to the DMCA is the Consumer Broadband and Digital Television Promotion Act (CBDTPA), known in early drafts as the Security Systems and Standards Certification Act (SSSCA). This bill, if it had passed, would have dealt with the devices used to access digital content and would have been even more restrictive than the DMCA. On the fifth anniversary of the DMCA, and several times afterwards, the Electronic Frontier Foundation documented harmful consequences of the anti- circumvention provisions. They document that the DMCA: # Stifles free expression, such as in its use against Russian programmer Dmitry Sklyarov, Princeton Professor Edward Felten, and journalists; # Jeopardizes fair use; # Impedes competition, such as blocking aftermarket competition in toner cartridges, garage door openers, and enforcing walled gardens around the iPod;OdioWorks v. Apple Eff.org and # Interferes with computer intrusion laws. In July 2016, the Electronic Frontier Foundation sued the US government alleging that Section 1201 violates the First Amendment.EFF sues US government to void 'onerous' copyright rules The effects of DMCA are compounded by the extension of copyright coverage. The Electronic Frontier Foundation strongly dislikes the effects of the Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act, specifically the extension of time for the protection of creations. They cite Rufus Pollock's study on optimal copyright term length. He found that copyright works best only when the amount of time protected is fourteen years. The EFF also makes the argument that all the side effects of the Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act are negative for all parties except media companies. Therefore, it only helps the big media companies. See also ;Proposed international law * Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement ;DMCA anti- circumvention cases * 321 Studios v.

Class 311000 trains were manufactured and delivered between 1996 and 2006, and again from 2012 to 2014 to expand service on the Gyeongbu Line and the Gyeongwon Line, and to replace older trains (1st and 2nd batch Class 1000 trains). As numbering spots in the 311000 series run out, the newest Class 311000 trains have begun to sport numbers in the 312000 series.  Technical details  =Formation= The Class 311000 cars are arranged in 10-car trains. Details of the car types of each train are listed below: 3110XX/3120XX - Tc (unpowered driving car with SIV, air compressor, and battery) 3111XX/3121XX - M (powered motor car with inverter and controller) 3112XX/3122XX - M' (powered motor car with pantograph, transformer, inverter, and controller) 3113XX/3123XX - T (unpowered \\"trailer\\" car) 3114XX/3124XX - M' 3115XX/3125XX - T' (unpowered car with SIV, air compressor, and battery) 3116XX/3126XX - T 3117XX/3127XX - M 3118XX/3128XX - M' 3119XX/3129XX - Tc = Electrical parts = Trains 311-01~311-12, 311-14~311-15, 311-17~311-34, 311-36 and 311-42~311-47 use Toshiba GTO-based VVVF controls with active cooling, while trains 311-13, 311-16, 311-35, 311-37~311-41, 311-48~311-65 and all 3rd and 4th generation trains use IGBT controls with passive cooling through heat piping. Power output on the Class 311000 trains is greater than that on the Class 1000 trains. As a result, the trains only utilize five powered cars, as opposed to six powered cars in the Class 1000 trains. The trains are also equipped with regenerative braking, which reduces energy consumption and simplifies train inspection. The trains feature a more powerful air conditioning system than that on the Class 1000 trains. = Interior design = Older Class 311000 trains used an ivory- colored interior with a long sheet prior to their overhauls; all trains now use a white interior. LED panels are installed on the top of each car older than train 311-83 that show announcements; trains 311-83 and beyond have LCD monitor displays that show advertisements along announcements. The end cars have a space for wheelchairs. = Cabin = Older Class 311000 trains share the same cabin design with the Class 341000 and Class 351000 trains (formerly Class 2030), which entered service four years prior.Newer 311000s have identical cabins to 321/331/351/361/371/381/391000 series cabins. The trains feature ATC devices and stop notifiers for express services. Trains equipped with TGIS use color displays, and service machines can be automatically controlled in TGIS after a refurbishment of the trains in 2005. Dead section notifiers are also installed.  Depot  The Class 311000 trains are stored at the Guro, Byeongjeom and Imun train depots. Minor inspections are done at their home depots, while major inspections are conducted at the Siheung depot, which is located after Oido Station on Line 4. * Imun: 311-03~311-25, 311-81~311-82 * Guro: 311-26~311-41, 311-48~311-53, 311-66~311-76, 311-83~311-90, 311-92~312-07 * Byeongjeom: 311-42~311-47, 311-54~311-65, 311-77~311-80 Generations = 1st generation = Class 311000 (1st generation) train 311-26 (ex-Class 5000 train 5-27) The first generation of Class 311000 trains are nearly identical to the first generation Class 341000 and 351000 cars, on which they were based. The first generation trains were built from 1996 to 1999. Because of the flat front ends on these trains, railfans nicknamed the trains \\"flat face\\" (ÎÇ©ÏûëÏù¥). The current trains are numbered 311-01~311-41, but there was one more train prior to 2008, and all were numbered in the 5000-series (trains 5-01~5-42) when delivered. The additional train, train 5-19, was involved in an accident that wrecked cars 5719 and 5119; the remaining eight cars were converted to and reconfigured as Class 319000 trains 319-06~319-07. Meanwhile, trains 5-01~5~18 were renumbered to 311-01~311-18, and trains 5-20~5-42 into 311-19~311-41, since they were not converted. Trains 311-01~311-27 and former train 5-19 were built by Hyundai Precision & Industries from 1996 to 1997 to expand service on Line 1. Trains 311-28~311-41 were built by Daewoo Heavy Industries from 1998 to 1999, mainly to replace the 1st batch Class 1000 trains, which were starting to approach the end of their 25-year lifespans. Trains 311-28~311-41 include cars with wheelchair space. Trains 311-39 (one car only), 311-40, and 311-41 used converted 2nd generation Class 1000 non-driving unpowered cars (from former 1st generation sets 1-39~1-41) from the time they were manufactured to 2019. Train 311-40 now uses two Class 311000 non-driving unpowered cars, train 311-41 uses two Class 341000 non-driving unpowered cars, and train 311-39 uses one Class 341000 non-driving unpowered car. Train 311-02 was damaged in a derailment north of Noryangjin on May 9, 2016. Train 311-01 was taken out of service for unknown reasons in mid-2017. The eight non-driving cars of train 311-01 were utilized on Class 341000 train 341-04. Meanwhile, several powered cars from train 311-02 were utilized on other Class 341000 trains, and the two unpowered non-driving cars were used to replace the original Class 1000 unpowered cars in train 311-40.http://busstory.3310.o-r.kr/221071122901 = 2nd generation = Class 311000 (2nd generation) train 311-45 (ex-Class 5000 train 5-46) The second generation of Class 311000 trains are very identical to the second generation Class 341000 cars. The car body as a whole was redesigned; the front ends of the train were changed completely, and the side windows are now coated and in a single piece (as opposed to the two-window setup between doors). Because of the circular front ends on these trains, railfans nicknamed the trains \\"round face\\" (ÎèôÍ∏ÄÏù¥). The second generation trains are numbered 311-42~311-65. Trains 311-42~311-47 were built by Rotem from 2002 to 2003 to address the Line 1 Gyeongbu Branch's extension from Suwon to Byeongjeom Station. They also retired more 1st batch Class 1000 trains. Trains 311-64 & 311-65 were built by Rotem in 2004 to address the Line 1 Gyeongbu Branch's extension from Byeongjeom to Cheonan Station. They use somewhat smaller bogies, and are the first to use fire-resistant interiors, LED destination signs, and LED train number indicators since their delivery. = 3rd generation = Class 361000 train 361-14 The third-generation were built and delivered from 2005 to 2006 mainly to address new extensions that opened at the time, especially on the 4-track Gyeongin Line, the Gyeongwon Line, and the new double-tracked and electrified Jungang Line. They also replaced the rebuilt 1st/2nd batch Class 1000 trains (trains 1-82 and 1-88~1-94) and four un-overhauled 2nd batch Class 1000 trains, which were all retired in 2006 as they either reached the end of their lifespans or did not conform to fire safety standards. The front ends have been updated once again, and the trains feature snake-like headlights; as a result, railfans nicknamed the trains \\"Î±ÄÎààÏù¥\\" (roughly translated as \\"snake eyes\\") . The interior was also updated and the door motors are electric-powered as opposed to air-powered. The third generation trains are numbered from 311-66~312-03, but more trains will be built in the future. The current trains are numbered 311-66~311-82, but there were more trains prior to 2008, and all were numbered in the 5000-series (trains 5-66~5-92) when delivered. Trains 5-79~5-80, and 5-86~5-92 were converted to Class 319000 trains 319-01~319-05 and Class 321000 trains 321-01~321-07 and parts of 321-15~321-18. Meanwhile, trains 5-67~5~78 were renumbered to 311-66~311-77, and trains 5-81~5-85 into 311-78~311-82, since they were not converted. Trains 311-66~311-77 were originally intended to be built in Rotem's Uiwang factory, but the factory was later closed due to financial problems with Rotem at the time. Trains 311-78~311-82 feature a slightly different interior and ventilation system, and are capable of one- person train operation (OPTO). Car 311580 in trains 311-80 was retrofitted as a \\"365\\" business transactions car from 2010 until the end of 2013. The next batch of the third generation Class 311000 trains were built from 2012 to 2014. They replaced refurbished 2nd batch Class 1000 trains that reached the end of their 25-year lifespans. The front end received such updates as smaller LED destination signs and new bumpers, and several improvements were made to the interior including new overhead LCD destination displays and clearer speakers. The trains are numbered 311-83~311-94. The trains are the first to be delivered new under the 311000-series numbering. Trains 311-83~311-87 used converted Class 321000 cars when delivered in August 2012, but due to complaints from Jungang Line passengers about shortened trains on the line, the trains were taken out of service in late 2013, reconfigured with newly made cars in 2014, and redeployed in August 2014. Trains 311-92~311-94 are the first trains to have been delivered new with LED headlights. Meanwhile, trains 311-88~311-89 were sidelined for years until receiving newly made cars in 2014. Train 311-90 was originally 8-car Class 361000 train 361-14, which was last used on the Jungang Line to make up for the shortened trains on the line. Following the lengthening of the Jungang Line's trains back to eight cars, the two trains were taken out of service, lengthened to 10 cars with two newly built cars, and redeployed on Line 1 in December 2014. Train 311-91 was originally 8-car Class 361000 train 361-15, which was also last used on the Jungang Line to make up for the shortened trains on the line. However, unlike train 311-90, this train was taken out of service in April 2017, and converted back to a Class 361000 train, but is expected to be converted to train 311-91 by 2020. As a result, the two newly built cars in train 311-91 have been stored out of service for the time being.http://gall.dcinside.com/board/view/?id=train&no;=858487 Class 311000 train 311-95 The last batch of third generation Class 311000 trains were built and delivered throughout 2016. They replaced the remaining 2nd batch Class 1000 trains. The fourth generation trains sport some minor changes, such as single-arm pantographs (similar to those used on ITX-Saemaul trains and KTX trains), CCTV cameras, and a third headlight in the same compartment as the destination sign and the run number indicator; as a result, railfans nicknamed the trains \\"ÏÇºÎààÏù¥\\" (roughly translated as \\"three eyes\\"). They share the same design as the Class 371000 trains, first generation Class 381000 trains, Class 391000 trains, and Class 351000 trains 351-73~351-78. These trains are numbered 311-95~312-03. = 4th generation = Class 312000 (5th generation) train 312-05 The fourth generation Class 311000 trains are being built and have been delivered since 2019, along with the third generation Class 341000 trains. They will replace the aging third generation Class 1000 trains. The fifth generation trains sport some minor changes, such as the change in the propulsion system (from an IGBT-based system to an interior permanent magnet- base system). The cab ends of the driving cars changed completely; as a result, railfans nicknamed the trains \\"Ï£ºÎë•Ïù¥\\" (roughly translated as \\"snout face\\"). The fifth generation trains are numbered from 312-04, and are currently being delivered at this time. At this time, four trains, numbered 312-04~312-07, have been delivered and entered service.https://gall.dcinside.com/board/view/?id=train&no;=878983 A further eight trains, tentatively numbered 312-08~312-15, are expected to be manufactured and delivered before 2023.https://v.kakao.com/v/20191219110613029  Refurbishment  Older Class 311000 trains were overhauled from 2004 to 2006 (though minor refurbishments began in 2002). Major and minor refurbishments are listed below. = Overhaul = The Daegu subway fire compelled Korail to introduce flame-resistant interiors for passenger safety. As a result, all trains built before 2004 were overhauled with fire-retardant interiors. = New livery = Refurbished interior of 2nd batch train All 1st generation trains and some 2nd generation trains used an old KNR green (and yellow for the 1st generation trains) livery. These trains were repainted into the current blue and red livery in 2006. The new livery has a metaphor of Taegeuk, but was criticized as being too primitive-looking. Livery is applied only on front and on the doors. = Electric parts = * 2002: Stop notifiers were installed . After overhauls between 2004-2005, TGIS systems were improved to integrate the stop notifiers. * 2003: Comonet broadcasting system was introduced in train 311-37. It has since been removed. * 2004: SIV traction systems were replaced with IGBT traction systems built by Woojin Industrial Systems. * 2005: Trains 311-60~311-62, and part of trains 311-63 (311163, 311263 & 311563) used IGBT inverters (other cars in train 311-63 used GTO inverters). Later on, these trains had their GTO inverters replaced with IGBT inverters. * 2007: The inverter of car 311880 (at the time numbered 5783) was changed temporarily. * 2012: Train 311-35 was retrofitted with IGBT inverters, trains 311-47, 311-53~311-54 had their air-powered door motors replaced with electric-powered door motors, and train 311-75 was retrofitted with LED headlights to test out LED headlights as an option for all existing and future Korail metro railcars. * 2015: Trains 311-13 and 311-16, and 311-48 were retrofitted with IGBT inverters, and trains 311-51~311-52, 311-55~311~60 had their air-powered door motors replaced with electric-powered door motors. * 2016: Trains 311-37~311-41 were retrofitted with IGBT inverters. * 2017: Trains 311-54~311-56, 311-59 were retrofitted with IGBT inverters. Since August 2008, all trains were retrofitted with automatic gangway doors (similar retrofits were also done in Class 321000, 341000, and 351000 trains). This retrofit included the installation of automatic doors to replace the older doors that were manually pulled open; gangway doors can now be automatically opened by the push of a button. This retrofit process was completed by 2013. All trains are now being retrofitted with LED headlights, following the successful testing of LED headlights in trains 311-75 and 311-92~311-94. = Renumbering = Starting from March 2011, former Class 5000 trains were renumbered from the 5000-series to the 311000-series as a part of a new numbering scheme by Korail (the leading \\"3\\" indicating a metro car). Renumbering was finished in September 2011.  Accidents  * On May 12, 2007, a Class 4400 locomotive bound for Incheon crashed into train 5-19 at Yeongdeungpo Station. As a result, the two cars nearest to the locomotive (5119 and 5719) were seriously damaged and subsequently scrapped, while the remaining cars were refurbished into Class 319000 trains 319-06 and 319-07 (two trains of four cars). * On May 1, 2010, train 311-74 (which was known as Class 5000 train 5-75 at the time of the accident) was involved in an accident with Class 1000 train 1-58 at the Guro Car Depot. As a result, car 1158 suffered major damage and was scrapped, while 5075 suffered minor damage at the front, so the whole train was taken to be renumbered into Class 311000 train 311-74 with car 5075 being repaired.  Conversions  Many former Class 5000 trains were not renumbered into the 311000-series and were instead converted into other classes. = Class 319000 = Class 319000 train 319-03, created from parts of Class 5000 trains 5-79~5-80. After it was discovered that the Yeongdungpo-Gwangmyeong shuttle service on Line 1 had a relatively low ridership, it was decided to cut down the number of cars on trains dedicated to the shuttle service. As a result, seven trains, numbered 319-01~319-07 were formed using out-of-service cars and surplus trains. Trains 319-01~319-05 were formed from parts of former Class 5000 trains 5-79~5-80 and 5-86~5-92. Meanwhile, trains 319-06~319-07 were formed from the eight remaining cars from former Class 5000 train 5-19. The gangways and interiors were refurbished as the cars were being converted and rearranged. Three additional trains were ordered along with 5th generation Class 311000 trains 312-04~312-07 (for a total of 58 cars). The trains will be numbered 319-08~319-10, and will be relegated to a future shuttle service between Soyosan and Yeoncheon stations when a reconstructed section of track between the stations is reopened.https://blog.naver.com/990104ms/221688186583 = Class 321000 = Class 321000 train 321-03, created from shortening Class 5000 train 5-88. Trains 321-01~321-07 were formed from former Class 5000 trains 5-86~5-92 by reducing each train by two cars and subsequently renumbering each train. The excess cars were then used for Class 319000 trains 319-01~319-05 and parts of 321-15~321-18, along with some excess cars from Class 6000 trains. These trains now operate on the Gyeongui-Jungang Line.

Most of the species‚Äîand the best-known‚Äîare those in the subclass Eucestoda; they are ribbon-like worms as adults, known as tapeworms. Their bodies consist of many similar units, known as proglottids, which are essentially packages of eggs which are regularly shed into the environment to infect other organisms. Species of the other subclass, Cestodaria, are mainly fish parasites. All cestodes are parasitic; many have complex life histories, including a stage in a definitive (main) host in which the adults grow and reproduce, often for years, and one or two intermediate stages in which the larvae develop in other hosts. Typically the adults live in the digestive tracts of vertebrates, while the larvae often live in the bodies of other animals, either vertebrates or invertebrates. For example, Diphyllobothrium has at least two intermediate hosts, a crustacean and then one or more freshwater fish; its definitive host is a mammal. Some cestodes are host- specific, while others are parasites of a wide variety of hosts. Some six thousand species have been described; probably all vertebrates can host at least one species. The adult tapeworm has a scolex (head), a short neck, and a strobila (segmented body) formed of proglottids. Tapeworms anchor themselves to the inside of the intestine of their host using their scolex, which typically has hooks, suckers, or both. They have no mouth, but absorb nutrients directly from the host's gut. The neck continually produces proglottids, each one containing a reproductive tract; mature proglottids are full of eggs, and fall off to leave the host, either passively in the feces or actively moving. All tapeworms are hermaphrodites, with each individual having both male and female reproductive organs. Humans are subject to infection by several species of tapeworms if they eat undercooked meat such as pork (Taenia solium), beef (T. saginata), and fish (Diphyllobothrium), or if they live in, or eat food prepared in, conditions of poor hygiene (Hymenolepis or Echinococcus species). The unproven concept of using tapeworms as a slimming aid has been touted since around 1900.  Diversity and habitat All 6000 species of Cestoda are parasites, mainly intestinal; their definitive hosts are vertebrates, both terrestrial and marine, while their intermediate hosts include insects, crustaceans, molluscs, and annelids as well as other vertebrates. T. saginata, the beef tapeworm, can grow up to 20 m (65 ft); the largest species, the whale tapeworm Tetragonoporus calyptocephalus, can grow to over 30 m (100 ft). Species with small hosts tend to be small. For example, vole and lemming tapeworms are only in length, and those parasitizing shrews only . Anatomy Cestodes have no gut or mouth and absorb nutrients from the host's alimentary tract through their specialised neodermal cuticle, or tegument, through which gas exchange also takes place. The tegument also protects the parasite from the host's digestive enzymes and allows it to transfer molecules back to the host. The body form of adult eucestodes is simple, with a scolex, or grasping head, adapted for attachment to the definitive host, a short neck, and a strobila, or segmented trunk formed of proglottids, which makes up the worm's body. Members of the subclass Cestodaria, the Amphilinidea and Gyrocotylidea, are wormlike but not divided into proglottids. Amphilinids have a muscular proboscis at the front end; Gyrocotylids have a sucker or proboscis which they can pull inside or push outside at the front end, and a holdfast rosette at the posterior end. The Cestodaria have 10 larval hooks while Eucestoda have 6 larval hooks. = Scolex = Scolex of Taenia solium with hooks and bothria present. The scolex, which attaches to the intestine of the definitive host, is often minute in comparison with the proglottids. It is typically a four-sided knob, armed with suckers or hooks or both. In some species, the scolex is dominated by bothria, or \\"sucking grooves\\" that function like suction cups. Cyclophyllid cestodes can be identified by the presence of four suckers on their scolices.\\"Flatworm.\\" Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Ultimate Reference Suite. Chicago: Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, 2010. Other species have ruffled or leaflike scolices, and there may be other structures to aid attachment. In the larval stage the scolex is similarly shaped and is known as the protoscolex. = Body systems = Circular and longitudinal muscles lie under the neodermis, beneath which further longitudinal, dorso-ventral and transverse muscles surround the central parenchyma. Protonephridial cells drain into the parenchyma. There are four longitudinal collection canals, two dorso-lateral and two ventro-lateral, running along the length of the worm, with a transverse canal linking the ventral ones at the posterior of each segment. When the proglottids begin to detach, these canals open to the exterior through the terminal segment. The main nerve centre of a cestode is a cerebral ganglion in its scolex. Nerves emanate from the ganglion to supply the general body muscular and sensory endings, with two lateral nerve cords running the length of the strobila. The cirrus and vagina are innervated, and sensory endings around the genital pore are more plentiful than in other areas. Sensory function includes both tactoreception (touch) and chemoreception (smell or taste). = Proglottids = Two proglottids of Taenia solium. This species has 7 to 13 branches of the uterus on each side (above and below in this micrograph). Once anchored to the host's intestinal wall, tapeworms absorb nutrients through their surface as their food flows past them. Cestodes are unable to synthesise lipids, which they use for reproduction, and are therefore entirely dependent on their hosts. The tapeworm body is composed of a series of segments called proglottids. These are produced from the neck by mitotic growth, which is followed by transverse constriction. The segments become larger and more mature as they are displaced backwards by newer segments. Each proglottid contains an independent reproductive tract, and like some other flatworms, cestodes excrete waste through flame cells (protonephridia) located in the proglottids. The sum of the proglottids is called a strobila, which is thin and resembles a strip of tape; from this is derived the common name \\"tapeworm\\". Proglottids are continually being produced by the neck region of the scolex, as long as the scolex is attached and alive. Mature proglottids are essentially bags of eggs, each of which is infective to the proper intermediate host. They are released and leave the host in feces, or migrate outwards as independent motile proglottids. The number of proglottids forming the tapeworm ranges from three to four thousand. Their layout comes in two forms: craspedote, meaning any given proglottid is overlapped by the previous proglottid, or acraspedote, indicating the proglottids do not overlap. Reproduction Cestodes are exclusively hermaphrodites, with both male and female reproductive systems in each body. The reproductive system includes one or more testes, cirri, vas deferens, and seminal vesicles as male organs, and a single lobed or unlobed ovary with the connecting oviduct and uterus as female organs. The common external opening for both male and female reproductive systems is known as the genital pore, which is situated at the surface opening of the cup-shaped atrium.Cheng, T.C. (1986). General Parasitology (2nd edn). Academic Press, Division of Hardcourt Brace & Company, USA, pp. 402‚Äì416. McDougald, L. R. (2003). \\"Cestodes and trematodes\\". In: Diseases of Poultry, 11th edn (Saif, Y. M; Barnes, H. J.; Fadly, A. M.; Glisson, J. R.; McDougald, L .R.; Swayne, D.E. eds). Iowa State Press, USA, pp. 396-404. Though they are sexually hermaphroditic and cross-fertilization is the norm, self-fertilization sometimes occurs and makes possible the reproduction of a worm when it is the only individual in its host's gut. During copulation, the cirri of one individual connect with those of the other through the genital pore, and then spermatozoa are exchanged. Life cycle Taenia: Inset 5 shows the scolex, a disk with hooks on the end. Inset 6 shows the tapeworm's whole body, in which the scolex is the tiny, round tip in the top left corner, and a mature proglottid has just detached. Diphyllobothrium latum relies on at least three hosts, crustaceans, fish, and humans. Other fish-eating mammals like bears can equally serve as definitive hosts. Cestodes are parasites of vertebrates, with each species infecting a single definitive host or group of closely related host species. All but amphilinids and gyrocotylids (which burrow through the gut or body wall to reach the coelom) are intestinal, though some life-cycle stages rest in muscle or other tissues. The definitive host is always a vertebrate but in nearly all cases, one or more intermediate hosts are involved in the lifecycle, typically arthropods or other vertebrates. Infections can be long-lasting; in humans, tapeworm infection may last as much as 30 years. No asexual phases occur in the lifecycle, as they do in other flatworms, but the lifecycle pattern has been a crucial criterion for assessing evolution among Platyhelminthes. Cestodes produce large numbers of eggs, but each one has a low probability of finding a host. To increase their chances, different species have adopted various strategies of egg release. In the Pseudophyllidea, many eggs are released in the brief period when their aquatic intermediate hosts are abundant (semelparity). In contrast, in the terrestrial Cyclophyllidea, proglottids are released steadily over a period of years, or as long as their host lives (interoparity). Another strategy is to have very long-lived larvae; for example, in Echinococcus, the hydatid larvae can survive for ten years or more in humans and other vertebrate hosts, giving the tapeworm an exceptionally long time window in which to find another host. Many tapeworms have a two-phase lifecycle with two types of host. The adult Taenia saginata lives in the gut of a primate such as a human, its definitive host. Proglottids leave the body through the anus and fall to the ground, where they may be eaten with grass by a grazing animal such as a cow. This animal then becomes an intermediate host, the oncosphere boring through the gut wall and migrating to another part of the body such as the muscle. Here it encysts, forming a cysticercus. The parasite completes its lifecycle when the intermediate host passes on the parasite to the definitive host, usually when the definitive host eats contaminated parts of the intermediate host, for example a human eating raw or undercooked meat. Another two-phase lifecycle is exhibited by Anoplocephala perfoliata, the definitive host being an equine and the intermediate host an oribatid mite. Diphyllobothrium exhibits a more complex, three-phase lifecycle. If the eggs are laid in water, they develop into free-swimming oncosphere larvae. After ingestion by a suitable freshwater crustacean such as a copepod, the first intermediate host, they develop into procercoid larvae. When the copepod is eaten by a suitable second intermediate host, typically a minnow or other small freshwater fish, the procercoid larvae migrate into the fish's flesh where they develop into plerocercoid larvae. These are the infective stages for the mammalian definitive host. If the small fish is eaten by a predatory fish, its muscles too can become infected. Schistocephalus solidus is another three-phase example. The intermediate hosts are copepods and small fish, and the definitive hosts are waterbirds. This species has been used to demonstrate that cross-fertilisation produces a higher infective success rate than self-fertilisation. Host immunity Hosts can become immune to infection by a cestode if the lining, the mucosa, of the gut is damaged. This exposes the host's immune system to cestode antigens, enabling the host to mount an antibody defence. Host antibodies can kill or limit cestode infection by damaging their digestive enzymes, which reduces their ability to feed and therefore to grow and to reproduce; by binding to their bodies; and by neutralising toxins that they produce. When cestodes feed passively in the gut, they do not provoke an antibody reaction. Evolution and phylogeny =Fossil history= Parasite fossils are rare, but recognizable clusters of cestode eggs, some with an operculum (lid) indicating that they had not erupted, one with a developing larva, have been discovered in fossil shark coprolites dating to the Permian, some 270 million years ago.\\"Tapeworm Eggs Discovered in 270-Million-Year-Old Fossil Shark faeces\\", ScienceDaily, 30 January 2013 =External= The position of the Cestoda within the Platyhelminthes and other Spiralian phyla based on genomic analysis is shown in the phylogenetic tree. The non-parasitic flatworms, traditionally grouped as the \\"Turbellaria\\", are paraphyletic, as the parasitic Neodermata including the Cestoda arose within that grouping. The approximate times when major groups first appeared is shown in millions of years ago. =Internal= Gyrocotylidea: body flatwormlike, not divided into proglottids Amphilinidea: body wormlike, not divided into proglottids \\"Tetraphyllidea\\": elaborate four- leaved scolex The evolutionary history of the Cestoda has been studied using ribosomal RNA, mitochondrial and other DNA, and morphological analysis and continues to be revised. \\"Tetraphyllidea\\" is seen to be paraphyletic; \\"Pseudophyllidea\\" has been broken up into two orders, Bothriocephalidea and Diphyllobothriidea. Hosts, whose phylogeny often mirrors that of the parasites (Fahrenholz's rule), are indicated in italics and parentheses, the life-cycle sequence (where known) shown by arrows as (intermediate host1 [‚Üí intermediate host2 ] ‚Üí definitive host). Alternatives, generally for different species within an order, are shown in square brackets. The Taeniidae, including species such as the pork tapeworm and the beef tapeworm that often infect humans, may be the most basal of the 12 orders of the Cyclophyllidea. Interactions with humans Advertisement offering \\"sanitized tape worms jar packed\\" under the heading \\"Fat! the enemy that is shortening your life - banished!\\", c. 1900. It promises \\"no ill effects\\", but side effects include diarrhoea and abdominal pain. =Infection and treatment= Like other species of mammal, humans can become infected with tapeworms. There may be few or no symptoms, and the first indication of the infection may be the presence of one or more proglottids in the stools. The proglottids appear as flat, rectangular, whitish objects about the size of a grain of rice, which may change size or move about. Bodily symptoms which are sometimes present include abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhea, increased appetite and weight loss. There are several classes of anthelminthic drugs, some effective against many kinds of parasite, others more specific; these can be used both preventatively and to treat infections. For example, praziquantel is an effective treatment for tapeworm infection, and is preferred over the older niclosamide. While accidental tapeworm infections in developed countries are quite rare, such infections are more likely to occur in countries with poor sanitation facilities or where food hygiene standards are low. =History and culture= In ancient Greece, the comic playwright Aristophanes and philosopher Aristotle described the lumps that form during cysticercosis as \\"hailstones\\". In Medieval times, in The Canon of Medicine, completed in 1025, the Persian physician Avicenna recorded parasites including tapeworms. In the Early Modern period, Francesco Redi described and illustrated many parasites, and was the first to identify the cysts of Echinococcus granulosus seen in dogs and sheep as parasitic in origin; a century later, in 1760, Peter Simon Pallas correctly suggested that these were the larvae of tapeworms. Tapeworms have occasionally appeared in fiction. Peter Marren and Richard Mabey in Bugs Britannica write that Irvine Welsh's sociopathic policeman in his 1998 novel Filth owns a talking tapeworm, which they call \\"the most attractive character in the novel\\"; it becomes the policeman's alter ego and better self. Mira Grant's 2013 novel Parasite envisages a world where people's immune systems are maintained by genetically engineered tapeworms. There are unproven claims that, around 1900, tapeworm eggs were marketed to the public as slimming tablets. A full-page coloured advertisement, purportedly from a women's magazine of that period, reads \\"Fat: the enemy .. that is banished! How? With sanitized tape worms. Jar packed. No ill effects!\\" When television presenter Michael Mosley deliberately infected himself with tapeworms he gained weight due to increased appetite. Dieters still sometimes risk intentional infection, evidenced by a 2013 warning on American television.

Biography  Pirjevec was born in a Slovene-speaking family in Gorizia, a town in the Austrian Littoral (now part of Italy). He studied Slavic philology at the University of Vienna. He graduated in 1913 with a thesis on Fran Levstik. During World War I he served in the Austro-Hungarian Army. After the demobilization in 1917, he taught Slovene and German language at a Slovene- language high school in Trieste. In 1920, he was fired by the new Italian authorities in the Julian March. In 1921, he moved to Ljubljana, in what was then the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, and became the chief librarian of the National Research Library. Between 1925 and 1927 he shortly worked at the Library of the National Museum. In the 1920s and 1930s, Pirjevec published several treatises on Slovene literature in the 19th century, especially the Romantic circle of France Pre≈°eren and Matija ƒåop. Together with Ivan Prijatelj and France Kidriƒç, Pirjevec was the main exponent of the positivist group of Slovenian literary historians of the interwar period. He was also important as a theoretician librarian; publishing numerous articles and monographs on the function and organization of libraries and library systems in modern societies. In addition, he wrote a cataloguing instruction manual for use by academic libraries. During the interwar period, Pirjevec maintained a position of a progressive and national liberal intellectual. He was critical of the absolute monarchy of King Alexander I of Yugoslavia and supported the idea of an autonomous United Slovenia within the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. During World War II, his son Du≈°an Pirjevec became an important resistance leader of the Yugoslav partisans in Slovenia; his daughter Ivica Pirjevec was active in the Liberation Front of the Slovenian People and was killed by the Nazis in 1944. Because of the anti-Fascist activities of his children, Pirjevec was arrested by the Nazi authorities of the Province of Ljubljana and sent to the Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp in autumn 1943. He died there in December 1944. After the war, a bust of Pirjevec was erected in the main entrance hall of the National and University Library of Slovenia.

The Black Power movement was prominent in the late 1960s and early 1970s, emphasizing racial pride and the creation of black political and cultural institutions to nurture, promote and advance what was seen by proponents of the movement as being the collective interests and values of Black Americans.Appiah, Anthony, & Henry Louis Gates Jr. (1999). Africana: The Encyclopedia of the African and African American Experience. New York: Basic Civitas Books, p. 262. The basis of Black Power is various ideologies, that aim at achieving self-determination for black people in the U.S. Black power dictates that blacks create their own identities despite being subjected to pre-existing societal factors. \\"Black Power\\" in its original political sense expresses a range of political goals, from militant self-defense against perceived racial oppression to the establishment of social institutions and a self-sufficient economy, including black-owned bookstores, cooperatives, farms, and media. However, the movement has been criticized for alienating itself from the mainstream civil rights movement, for its apparent support of racial segregation, and for constituting black superiority over other races. Etymology The earliest known usage of the term \\"Black Power\\" is found in Richard Wright's 1954 book Black Power. Yale Book of Quotations (2006), Yale University Press, edited by Fred R. Shapiro. New York politician Adam Clayton Powell Jr. used the term on May 29, 1966, during an address at Howard University: \\"To demand these God-given rights is to seek black power.\\" The first popular use of the term \\"Black Power\\" as a political and racial slogan was by Stokely Carmichael (later known as Kwame Ture) and Willie Ricks (later known as Mukasa Dada), both organizers and spokespersons for the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC). On June 16, 1966, in a speech in Greenwood, Mississippi, after the shooting of James Meredith during the March Against Fear, Stokely Carmichael said:\\"Matthew Duncan':Black Power salute by John Dominis-1968.\\" matthewduncan07 The Chateau Theme, 7 November 2013. Web. 7 November 2013 > This is the twenty-seventh time I have been arrested and I ain't going to > jail no more! The only way we gonna stop them white men from whuppin' us is > to take over. What we gonna start sayin' now is Black Power! Stokely Carmichael saw the concept of \\"Black Power\\" as a means of solidarity between individuals within the movement. It was a replacement of the \\"Freedom Now!\\" slogan of Carmichael's contemporary, the non-violence leader Martin Luther King Jr.. With his use of the term, Carmichael felt this movement was not just a movement for racial desegregation, but rather a movement to help end how American racism had weakened blacks. He said, Black Power' means black people coming together to form a political force and either electing representatives or forcing their representatives to speak their needs.\\"\\"Stokely Carmichael\\", King Encyclopedia, The Martin Luther King, Jr. Research and Education Institute, Stanford University. Accessed 20 November 2006. Variants Black Power adherents believed in black autonomy, with a variety of tendencies such as black nationalism, black self-determination, and black separatism. Such positions caused friction with leaders of the mainstream Civil Rights Movement, and thus the two movements have sometimes been viewed as inherently antagonistic. Civil Rights leaders often proposed passive, non-violent tactics while the Black Power movement felt that, in the words of Stokely Carmichael and Charles V. Hamilton, \\"a 'non-violent' approach to civil rights is an approach black people cannot afford and a luxury white people do not deserve.\\" \\"However, many groups and individuals‚Äîincluding Rosa Parks,Jeanne Theoharis, \\"'I Don't Believe in Gradualism': Rosa Parks and the Black Power Movement in Detroit\\". Paper presented at the annual meeting of the 96th Annual Convention of the Association for the Study of African-American Life and History. Robert F. Williams, Maya Angelou, Gloria Richardson, and Fay Bellamy Powell‚Äîparticipated in both civil rights and black power activism. A growing number of scholars conceive of the civil rights and black power movements as one interconnected Black Freedom Movement.Clayborne Carson, \\"Black Freedom Movement\\".Premilla Nadasen, \\"The Black Freedom Movement\\" , City University of New York.Barbara Ransby, Ella Baker and the Black Freedom Movement (University of North Carolina Press, 2003). Numerous Black Power advocates were in favor of black self determination due to the belief that black people must lead and run their own organizations. Stokely Carmichael is such an advocate and states that, \\"only black people can convey the revolutionary idea‚Äîand it is a revolutionary idea‚Äîthat black people are able to do things themselves.\\" However, this is not to say that Black Power advocates promoted racial segregation. Stokely Carmichael and Charles V. Hamilton write that \\"there is a definite, much-needed role that whites can play.\\" They felt that whites could serve the movement by educating other white people. Not all Black Power advocates were in favor of black separatism. While Stokely Carmichael and SNCC were in favor of separatism for a time in the late 1960s, organizations such as the Black Panther Party for Self-Defense were not. Though the Panthers considered themselves to be at war with the prevailing white supremacist power structure, they were not at war with all whites, but rather with those (mostly white) individuals empowered by the injustices of the structure and responsible for its reproduction. Bobby Seale, Chairman and Co-Founder of the Black Panther Party for Self-Defense, was outspoken about this issue. His stance was that the oppression of black people was more a result of economic exploitation than anything innately racist. In his book Seize the Time, he states that \\"In our view it is a class struggle between the massive proletarian working class and the small, minority ruling class. Working-class people of all colors must unite against the exploitative, oppressive ruling class. So let me emphasize again‚Äîwe believe our fight is a class struggle and not a race struggle.\\"Seale, Bobby. Seize the Time: The Story of the Black Panther Party and Huey P. Newton. New York: Black Classic Press, 1996, p. 72. Internationalist offshoots of black power include African Internationalism, pan-Africanism, black nationalism, and black supremacy. History The term \\"Black Power\\" was used in a different sense in the 1850s by black leader Frederick Douglass as an alternative name for the Slave Power‚Äîthat is the disproportionate political power at the national level held by slave owners in the South. Douglass predicted: \\"The days of Black Power are numbered. Its course, indeed is onward. But with the swiftness of an arrow, it rushes to the tomb. While crushing its millions, it is also crushing itself. The sword of Retribution, suspended by a single hair, hangs over it. That sword must fall. Liberty must triumph.\\" In Apartheid Era South Africa, Nelson Mandela's African National Congress used the call-and-response chant \\"Amandla! (Power!)\\", \\"Ngawethu! (The power is ours!)\\" from the late 1950s onward.Nelson Mandela, Long Walk to Freedom (Little, Brown, and Co., 1994), p. 318. The modern American concept emerged from the Civil Rights Movement in the early 1960s. Beginning in 1959, Robert F. Willams, president of the Monroe, North Carolina chapter of the NAACP, openly questioned the ideology of nonviolence and its domination of the movement's strategy. Williams was supported by prominent leaders such as Ella Baker and James Forman, and opposed by others, such as Roy Wilkins (the national NAACP chairman) and Martin Luther King Jr. In 1961, Maya Angelou, Leroi Jones, and Mae Mallory led a riotous (and widely covered) demonstration at the United Nations in order to protest against the assassination of Patrice Lumumba.Peniel Joseph, ed., Black Power Movement: Rethinking the Civil Rights-Black Power Era (Routledge, 2013), pp. 55‚Äì61.James Baldwin, \\"A Negro Assays the Negro Mood\\" The New York Times Magazine, March 12, 1961 Malcolm X, national representative of the Nation of Islam, also launched an extended critique of nonviolence and integrationism at this time. After seeing the increasing militancy of blacks in the wake of the 16th Street Baptist Church bombing, and wearying of Elijah Muhammad's domination of the Nation of Islam, Malcolm left that organization and engaged with the mainstream of the Civil Rights Movement. Malcolm was now open to voluntary racial integration as a long-term goal, but he still supported armed self- defense, self-reliance, and black nationalism; he became a simultaneous spokesman for the militant wing of the Civil Rights Movement and the non- separatist wing of the Black Power movement. An early manifestation of Black Power in popular culture was the performances given by Nina Simone at Carnegie Hall in March 1964, and the album In Concert which resulted from them. Nina Simone mocked liberal nonviolence (\\"Go Limp\\"), and took a vengeful position toward white racists (\\"Mississippi Goddamn\\" and her adaptation of \\"Pirate Jenny\\"). Historian Ruth Feldstein writes that, \\"Contrary to the neat historical trajectories which suggest that black power came late in the decade and only after the 'successes' of earlier efforts, Simone's album makes clear that black power perspectives were already taking shape and circulating widely...in the early 1960s.\\" Ruth Feldstein, \\"Nina Simone: The Antidote to the 'We Shall Overcome' Myth of the Civil Rights Movement\\", History News Network (George Mason University). By 1966, most of SNCC's field staff, among them Stokely Carmichael (later Kwame Ture), were becoming critical of the nonviolent approach to confronting racism and inequality‚Äîarticulated and promoted by Martin Luther King Jr., Roy Wilkins, and other moderates‚Äîand they rejected desegregation as a primary objective. King was critical of the black power movement, stating in an August 1967 speech to the SCLC: \\"Let us be dissatisfied until that day when nobody will shout 'White Power!' ‚Äî when nobody will shout 'Black Power!' ‚Äî but everybody will talk about God's power and human power.\\" In his 1967 book, Where Do We Go from Here: Chaos or Community?, King stated: SNCC's base of support was generally younger and more working-class than that of the other \\"Big Five\\"In addition to SNCC, the other \\"Big Five\\" organizations of the civil rights movement were the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, the Urban League, the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, and the Congress on Racial Equality. civil rights organizations and became increasingly more militant and outspoken over time. As a result, as the Civil Rights Movement progressed, increasingly radical, more militant voices came to the fore to aggressively challenge white hegemony. Increasing numbers of black youth, particularly, rejected their elders' moderate path of cooperation, racial integration and assimilation. They rejected the notion of appealing to the public's conscience and religious creeds and took the tack articulated by another black activist more than a century before, abolitionist Frederick Douglass, who wrote: > Those who profess to favor freedom, and yet depreciate agitation, are men > who want crops without plowing up the ground. They want rain without thunder > and lightning. They want the ocean without the awful roar of its many > waters. ... Power concedes nothing without demand. It never did and it never > will.Douglass, Frederick. Letter to an abolitionist associate (1857). In > Organizing for Social Change: A Mandate For Activity In The 1990s. Bobo, K.; > Randall, J.; and Max, S. (eds). Cabin John, Maryland: Seven Locks Press > (1991). Most early 1960s civil rights leaders did not believe in physically violent retaliation. However, much of the African-American rank-and-file, especially those leaders with strong working-class ties, tended to complement nonviolent action with armed self-defense. For instance, prominent nonviolent activist Fred Shuttlesworth of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (and a leader of the 1963 Birmingham campaign), had worked closely with an armed defense group that was led by Colonel Stone Johnson. As Alabama historian Frye Gaillard writes, ::...these were the kind of men Fred Shuttlesworth admired, a mirror of the toughness he aspired to himself‚Ä¶They went armed [during the Freedom Rides], for it was one of the realities of the civil rights movement that however nonviolent it may have been at its heart, there was always a current of 'any means necessary,' as the black power advocates would say later on.Frye Gaillard, Cradle of Freedom: Alabama and the Movement That Changed America (University of Alabama Press, 2004), pp. 82‚Äì83. During the March Against Fear, there was a division between those aligned with Martin Luther King Jr. and those aligned with Carmichael, marked by their respective slogans, \\"Freedom Now\\" and \\"Black Power.\\"Scott Saul, \\"On the Lower Frequencies: Rethinking the Black Power Movement\\", pp. 92‚Äì98, in Harper's, December 2006, p. 94. While King never endorsed the slogan, and in fact opposed the Black Power movement, his rhetoric sometimes came close to it. In his 1967 book Where Do We Go From Here?, King wrote that \\"power is not the white man's birthright; it will not be legislated for us and delivered in neat government packages.\\"Cited in Scott Saul, \\"On the Lower Frequencies\\", p. 95. = \\"Crisis and Commitment Statement\\" = The \\"Crisis and Commitment Statement\\" was a full-page ad taken out in the New York Times on October 14, 1966. The ad was written and signed onto by Civil Rights leaders, condemning the \\"extreme\\" measures used by groups such as the Black Power movement, while reaffirming the basic tenets of the Civil Rights Movement. The statement was signed by Dorothy Height, A. Philip Randolph, Bayard Rustin, Roy Wilkins, Whitney Young, and Hobson R. Reynolds. Impact Although the concept remained imprecise and contested and the people who used the slogan ranged from business people who used it to push black capitalism to revolutionaries who sought an end to capitalism, the idea of Black Power exerted a significant influence. It helped organize scores of community self-help groups and institutions that did not depend on Whites, encouraged colleges and universities to start black studies programs, mobilized black voters, and improved racial pride and self-esteem. One of the most well-known and unexpected demonstrations for Black Power occurred at the 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico City. At the conclusion of the 200m race, at the medal ceremony, United States gold medalist Tommie Smith and bronze medalist John Carlos wore Olympic Project for Human Rights badges and showed the raised fist (see 1968 Olympics Black Power salute) as the anthem played. Accompanying them was silver medalist Peter Norman, a white Australian sprinter, who also wore an OPHR badge to show his support for the two African Americans. =Black politics= Tommie Smith and John Carlos showing the raised fist on the podium after the 200 m race at the 1968 Summer Olympics. Though the Black Power movement did not remedy the political problems faced by African Americans in the 1960s and 1970s, the movement did contribute to the development of black politics both directly and indirectly. As a contemporary of and successor to the Civil Rights Movement, the Black Power movement created, what sociologist Herbert H. Haines refers to as a \\"positive radical flank effect\\" on political affairs of the 1960s. Though the nature of the relationship between the Civil Rights Movement and the Black Power movement is contested, Haines' study of the relationship between black radicals and the mainstream civil rights movement indicates that Black Power generated a \\"crisis in American institutions which made the legislative agenda of 'polite, realistic, and businesslike' mainstream organizations\\" more appealing to politicians. In this way, it can be argued that the more strident and oppositional messages of the Black Power movement indirectly enhanced the bargaining position of more moderate activists.Van DeBurg, William L. New Day in Babylon: The Black Power Movement and American Culture, 1965‚Äì1975, Chicago: The University of Chicago Press, 1992, p. 306. Black Power activists approached politics with vitality, variety, wit, and creativity that shaped the way future generations approached dealing with America's societal problems (McCartney 188). These activists capitalized on the nation's recent awareness of the political nature of oppression, a primary focus of the Civil Rights Movement, developing numerous political action caucuses and grass roots community associations to remedy the situation The National Black Political Convention, held March 10‚Äì12, 1972, was a significant milestone in black politics of the Black Power era. Held in Gary, Indiana, a majorly black city, the convention included a diverse group of black activists, although it completely excluded whites. The convention was criticized for its racial exclusivity by Roy Wilkins of the NAACP, a group that supported integration. The delegates created a National Black Political Agenda with stated goals including the election of a proportionate number of black representatives to Congress, community control of schools, national health insurance, etc. Though the convention did not result in any direct policy, the convention advanced goals of the Black Power movement and left participants buoyed by a spirit of possibility and themes of unity and self- determination. A concluding note to the convention, addressing its supposed idealism, read: \\"At every critical moment of our struggle in America we have had to press relentlessly against the limits of the 'realistic' to create new realities for the life of our people. This is our challenge at Gary and beyond, for a new Black politics demands new vision, new hope and new definitions of the possible. Our time has come. These things are necessary. All things are possible.\\"\\"American Experience  Eyes on the Prize  Milestones\\" PBS, 5 April 2009. Though such political activism may not have resulted in direct policy, they provided political models for later movements, advanced a pro-black political agenda, and brought sensitive issues to the forefront of American politics. In its confrontational and often oppositional nature, the Black Power movement started a debate within the black community and America as a nation over issues of racial progress, citizenship, and democracy, namely \\"the nature of American society and the place of the African American in it.\\"McCartney, John T. Black Power Ideologies: An Essay in African-American Political Thought, Philadelphia: Temple University Press, 1992. The continued intensity of debate over these same social and political issues is a tribute to the impact of the Black Power movement in arousing the political awareness and passions of citizens. =Other minorities= Though the aims of the Black Power movement were racially specific, much of the movement's impact has been its influence on the development and strategies of later political and social movements. By igniting and sustaining debate on the nature of American society, the Black Power movement created what other multiracial and minority groups interpreted to be a viable template for the overall restructuring of society.Joseph, Peniel E. Waiting 'til the Midnight Hour: A Narrative History of Black Power in America. New York: Henry Holt and Company, 2006, p. xiv. By opening up discussion on issues of democracy and equality, the Black Power movement paved the way for a diverse plurality of social justice movements, including black feminism, environmental movements, affirmative action, and gay and lesbian rights. Central to these movements were the issues of identity politics and structural inequality, features emerging from the Black Power movement.Joseph, Waiting 'til the Midnight Hour (2006), p. 294. Because the Black Power movement emphasized and explored a black identity, movement activists were forced to confront issues of gender and class as well. Many activists in the Black Power movement became active in related movements. This is seen in the case of the \\"second wave\\" of women's rights activism, a movement supported and orchestrated to a certain degree by women working from within the coalition ranks of the Black Power movement.Williams, Hettie V. We Shall Overcome to We Shall Overrun: The Collapse of the Civil Rights Movement and the Black Power Revolt (1962‚Äì1968). Lanham, MA: University Press of America, 2009, p. 92. The boundaries between social movements became increasingly unclear at the end of the 1960s and into the 1970s; where the Black Power movement ends and where these other social movements begin is often unclear. \\"It is pertinent to note that as the movement expanded the variables of gender, class, and only compounded issues of strategy and methodology in black protest thought.\\"Joseph, Waiting 'til the Midnight Hour (2006), p. 92. =African-American identity= raises his fist in black power salute, Ferguson, Missouri, 15 August 2014 Due to the negative and militant reputation of such auxiliaries as that of the Black Panther Party, many people felt that this movement of \\"insurrection\\" would soon serve to cause discord and disharmony through the entire U.S. Even Stokely Carmichael stated, \\"When you talk of Black Power, you talk of building a movement that will smash everything Western civilization has created.\\" Though Black Power at the most basic level refers to a political movement, the psychological and cultural messages of the Black Power movement, though less tangible, have had perhaps a longer-lasting impact on American society than concrete political changes. Indeed, \\"fixation on the 'political' hinders appreciation of the movement's cultural manifestations and unnecessarily obscures black culture's role in promoting the psychological well being of the Afro-American people,\\"Van DeBurg, New Day in Babylon (1992), p. 304. states William L. Van Deburg, author of A New Day in Babylon, \\"movement leaders never were as successful in winning power for the people as they were in convincing people that they had sufficient power within themselves to escape 'the prison of self-deprecation'\\" Van DeBurg, New Day in Babylon (1992), p. 306. Primarily, the liberation and empowerment experienced by African Americans occurred in the psychological realm. The movement uplifted the black community as a whole by cultivating feelings of racial solidarity and positive self- identity, often in opposition to the world of white Americans, a world that had physically and psychologically oppressed Blacks for generations. Stokely Carmichael stated that \\"the goal of black self-determination and black self- identity‚ÄîBlack Power‚Äîis recognition of the virtues in themselves as black people.\\" Through the movement, blacks came to understand themselves and their culture by exploring and debating the question, \\"who are we?\\" in order to establish a unified and viable identity.McCormack, Donald J. Black Power: Political Ideology? Diss. University of New York at Albany, 1970. Ann Arbor, MI: University Microfilms International, 1984, p. 394. And \\"if black people are to know themselves as a vibrant, valiant people, they must know their roots.\\" Black Lives Matter protest in September 2016 Throughout the Civil Rights Movement and black history, there has been tension between those wishing to minimize and maximize racial difference. W.E.B. Du Bois and Martin Luther King Jr. often attempted to deemphasize race in their quest for equality, while those advocating for separatism and colonization emphasized an extreme and irreconcilable difference between races. The Black Power movement largely achieved an equilibrium of \\"balanced and humane ethnocentrism.\\" The impact of the Black Power movement in generating discussion about ethnic identity and black consciousness supported the appearance and expansion of academic fields of American studies, Black Studies, and African studies, and the founding of several museums devoted to African-American history and culture in this period.Andrea Alison Burns. 2008. \\"Show me my Soul.\\": the evolution of the Black museum movement in postwar America. Dissertation, University of Minnesota. In these ways the Black Power movement led to greater respect for and attention accorded to African Americans' history and culture. =Britain= Black Power got a foothold in Britain when Carmichael came to London in July 1967 to attend the Dialectics of Liberation Congress. As well as his address at the Congress, he also made a speech at Speakers' Corner. At that time, there was no Black Power organization in Britain, although there was Michael X's Racial Adjustment Action Society (RAAS). However, this was more influenced by the Malcolm X's visit to Britain in 1964. Malcolm X also adopted Islam at this stage, whereas Black Power was not organized around any religious institution. The Black Power Manifesto was launched on 10 November 1967, published by the Universal Coloured People's Association. Obi Egbuna, the spokesperson for the group, claimed they had recruited 778 members in London during the previous seven weeks. In 1968 Egbuna published Black Power or Death. He was also active with CLR James, Calvin Hernton and others in the Antiuniversity of London, set up following the Dialectics of Liberation Congress. Black people in Britain who identified themselves as the British Black Power Movement (BBMP) formed in the 1960s. They worked with the U.S. Black Panther Party in 1967‚Äì68, and 1968‚Äì72.The Black Panthers in London, 1967‚Äì1972: A Diasporic Struggle Navigates the Black Atlantic. The On March 2, 1970, roughly one hundred people protested outside the U.S. embassy in Grosvenor Square, London, in support of the U.S. Black Panther founder Bobby Seale, who was on trial for murder in New Haven, Connecticut. They chanted \\"Free Bobby!\\" and carried posters proclaiming \\"Free, Free bobby Seale\\" and \\"You can kill a revolutionary but not a revolution.\\" London police arrested sixteen of the protestors that day, three women and thirteen men with threatening and assaulting police officers, distributing a flier entitled \\"the Definition of Black Power\\", intending to incite a breach of the peace, and willful damage to a police raincoat. The raincoat charge was dropped by the judge, but the judge found five of the accused guilty of the remaining charges. =Jamaica= A Black Power movement arose in Jamaica in the late 1960s. Though Jamaica had gained independence from the British Empire in 1962, and Prime Minister Hugh Shearer was black, many cabinet ministers (such as Edward Seaga) and business elites were white. Large segments of the black majority population were unemployed or did not earn a living wage. The Jamaica Labour Party government of Hugh Shearer banned Black Power literature such as The Autobiography of Malcolm X and the works of Eldridge Cleaver and Stokely Carmichael. Guyanese academic Walter Rodney was appointed as a lecturer at the University of the West Indies in January 1968, and became one of the main exponents of Black Power in Jamaica. When the Shearer government banned Rodney from re-entering the country, the Rodney Riots broke out. As a result of the Rodney affair, radical groups and publications such as Abeng began to emerge, and the opposition People's National Party gained support. In the 1972 election, the Jamaica Labour Party was defeated by the People's National Party, and Michael Manley, who had expressed support for Black Power, became Prime Minister. =Beauty= The cultivation of pride in the African-American race was often summarized in the phrase \\"Black is Beautiful.\\" The phrase is rooted in its historical context, yet the relationship to it has changed in contemporary times. \\"I don't think it's 'Black is beautiful' anymore. It's 'I am beautiful and I'm black.' It's not the symbolic thing, the afro, power sign‚Ä¶ That phase is over and it succeeded. My children feel better about themselves and they know that they're black,\\" stated a respondent in Bob Blauner's longitudinal oral history of U.S. race relations in 1986.Van DeBurg, New Day in Babylon (1992), p. 307. The outward manifestations of an appreciation and celebration of blackness abound: black dolls, natural hair, black Santas, models and celebrities that were once rare and symbolic have become commonplace. The \\"Black is beautiful\\" cultural movement aimed to dispel the notion that black people's natural features such as skin color, facial features and hair are inherently ugly.Some notes on the BLACK CULTURAL MOVEMENT John Sweat Rock was the first to coin the phrase \\"Black is Beautiful\\", in the slavery era. The movement asked that men and women stop straightening their hair and attempting to lighten or bleach their skin.Jamaica Says Black Is Beautiful The prevailing idea in American culture was that black features are less attractive or desirable than white features. =Arts and culture= The Black Power movement produced artistic and cultural products that both embodied and generated pride in \\"blackness\\" and further defined an African-American identity that remains contemporary. Black Power is often seen as a cultural revolution as much as a political revolution, with the goal of celebrating and emphasizing the distinctive group culture of African Americans to an American society that had previously been dominated by white artistic and cultural expressions. Black power utilized all available forms of folk, literary, and dramatic expression based in a common ancestral past to promote a message of self-actualization and cultural self- definition.Van DeBurg, New Day in Babylon (1992), p. 192. The emphasis on a distinctive black culture during the Black Power movement publicized and legitimized a culture gap between Blacks and Whites that had previously been ignored and denigrated. More generally, in recognizing the legitimacy of another culture and challenging the idea of white cultural superiority, the Black Power movement paved the way for the celebration of multiculturalism in America today. The cultural concept of \\"soul\\" was fundamental to the image of African-American culture embodied by the Black Power movement. Soul, a type of \\"in-group cultural cachet,\\" was closely tied to black America's need for individual and group self-identification.Van DeBurg, New Day in Babylon (1992), p. 195. A central expression of the \\"soulfulness\\" of the Black Power generation was a cultivation of aloofness and detachment, the creation of an \\"aura or emotional invulnerability,\\" a persona that challenged their position of relative powerlessness in greater society. The nonverbal expressions of this attitude, including everything from posture to handshakes, were developed as a counterpoint to the rigid, \\"up-tight\\" mannerisms of white people. Though the iconic symbol of black power, the arms raised with biceps flexed and clenched fists, is temporally specific, variants of the multitude of handshakes, or \\"giving and getting skin,\\" in the 1960s and 1970s as a mark of communal solidarity continue to exist as a part of black culture.Van DeBurg, New Day in Babylon (1992), p. 197. Clothing style also became an expression of Black Power in the 1960s and 1970s. Though many of the popular trends of the movement remained confined to the decade, the movement redefined standards of beauty that were historically influenced by Whites and instead celebrated a natural \\"blackness.\\" As Stokely Carmichael said in 1966, \\"We have to stop being ashamed of being black. A broad nose, thick lip and nappy hair is us and we are going to call that beautiful whether they like it or not.\\"Van DeBurg, New Day in Babylon (1992), p. 201. \\"Natural\\" hair styles, such as the Afro, became a socially acceptable tribute to group unity and a highly visible celebration of black heritage. Though the same social messages may no longer consciously influence individual hair or clothing styles in today's society, the Black Power movement was influential in diversifying standards of beauty and aesthetic choices. The Black Power movement raised the idea of a black aesthetic that revealed the worth and beauty of all black people.Van DeBurg, New Day in Babylon (1992), p. 194. In developing a powerful identity from the most elemental aspects of African-American folk life, the Black Power movement generated attention to the concept of \\"soul food,\\" a fresh, authentic, and natural style of cooking that originated in Africa. The flavor and solid nourishment of the food was credited with sustaining African Americans through centuries of oppression in America and became an important aid in nurturing contemporary racial pride.Van DeBurg, New Day in Babylon (1992), p. 204. Black Power advocates used the concept of \\"soul food\\" to further distinguish between white and black culture; though the basic elements of soul food were not specific to African-American food, Blacks believed in the distinctive quality, if not superiority, of foods prepared by Blacks. No longer racially specific, traditional \\"soul foods\\" such as yams, collard greens, and deep-fried chicken continue to hold a place in contemporary culinary life. Black Arts Movement The Black Arts Movement or BAM, founded in Harlem by writer and activist Amiri Baraka (born Everett LeRoy Jones), can be seen as the artistic branch of the Black Power movement.The Black Arts Repertory Theatre/School This movement inspired black people to establish ownership of publishing houses, magazines, journals and art institutions. Other well-known writers who were involved with this movement included Nikki Giovanni; Don L. Lee, later known as Haki Madhubuti; Sonia Sanchez; Maya Angelou; Dudley Randall; Sterling Plumpp; Larry Neal; Ted Joans; Ahmos Zu-Bolton; and Etheridge Knight. Several black-owned publishing houses and publications sprang from the BAM, including Madhubuti's Third World Press, Broadside Press, Zu-Bolton's Energy Black South Press, and the periodicals Callaloo and Yardbird Reader. Although not strictly involved with the Movement, other notable African-American writers such as novelists Ishmael Reed and Toni Morrison and poet Gwendolyn Brooks can be considered to share some of its artistic and thematic concerns. BAM sought \\"to link, in a highly conscious manner, art and politics in order to assist in the liberation of black people\\", and produced an increase in the quantity and visibility of African-American artistic production.Joseph, Waiting 'til the Midnight Hour (2006), p. 256. Though many elements of the Black Arts movement are separate from the Black Power movement, many goals, themes, and activists overlapped. Literature, drama, and music of Blacks \\"served as an oppositional and defensive mechanism through which creative artists could confirm their identity while articulating their own unique impressions of social reality.\\"Van DeBurg, New Day in Babylon (1992), p. 249. In addition to acting as highly visible and unifying representations of \\"blackness,\\" the artistic products of the Black Power movement also utilized themes of black empowerment and liberation.Van DeBurg, New Day in Babylon (1992), p. 280. For instance, black recording artists not only transmitted messages of racial unity through their music, they also became significant role models for a younger generation of African Americans.Van DeBurg, New Day in Babylon (1992), p. 208. Updated protest songs not only bemoaned oppression and societal wrongs, but utilized adversity as a reference point and tool to lead others to activism. Some Black Power era artists conducted brief mini-courses in the techniques of empowerment. In the tradition of cultural nationalists, these artists taught that in order to alter social conditions, Blacks first had to change the way they viewed themselves; they had to break free of white norms and strive to be more natural, a common theme of African-American art and music.Van DeBurg, New Day in Babylon (1992), p. 213. Musicians such as the Temptations sang lyrics such as \\"I have one single desire, just like you / So move over, son, 'cause I'm comin' through\\" in their song \\"Message From a Black Man,\\" they expressed the revolutionary sentiments of the Black Power movement.Van DeBurg, New Day in Babylon (1992), p. 212. Ishmael Reed, who is considered neither a movement apologist nor advocate, said: \\"I wasn't invited to participate because I was considered an integrationist\\" but he went on to explain the positive aspects of the Black Arts Movement and the Black Power movement: > I think what Black Arts did was inspire a whole lot of Black people to > write. Moreover, there would be no multiculturalism movement without Black > Arts. Latinos, Asian Americans, and others all say they began writing as a > result of the example of the 1960s. Blacks gave the example that you don't > have to assimilate. You could do your own thing, get into your own > background, your own history, your own tradition and your own culture. I > think the challenge is for cultural sovereignty and Black Arts struck a blow > for that.Black Arts Movement By breaking into a field typically reserved for white Americans, artists of the Black Power era expanded opportunities for current African Americans. \\"Today's writers and performers,\\" writes William L. Van Deburg, \\"recognize that they owe a great deal to Black Power's explosion of cultural orthodoxy.\\"Van DeBurg, New Day in Babylon (1992), p. 308. Criticism Bayard Rustin, an elder statesman of the Civil Rights Movement, was a harsh critic of Black Power in its earliest days. Writing in 1966, shortly after the March Against Fear, Rustin said that Black Power \\"not only lacks any real value for the civil rights movement, but [...] its propagation is positively harmful. It diverts the movement from a meaningful debate over strategy and tactics, it isolates the Negro community, and it encourages the growth of anti-Negro forces.\\" He particularly criticized the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) and SNCC for their turn toward Black Power, arguing that these two organizations once \\"awakened the country, but now they emerge isolated and demoralized, shouting a slogan that may afford a momentary satisfaction but that is calculated to destroy them and their movement.\\" The Black Power slogan was also criticized by Martin Luther King Jr., who stated that the black power movement \\"connotates black supremacy and an anti-white feeling that does not or should not prevail.\\" The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) also disapproved of Black Power, particularly Roy Wilkins, then the NAACP's executive director, who stated that Black Power was \\"a reverse Hitler, a reverse Ku Klux Klan...the father of hate and mother of violence.\\" The Black Power slogan was also met with opposition from the leadership of SCLC and the Urban League. Politicians in high office also spoke out against Black Power: in 1966, President Lyndon Johnson criticized extremists on both sides of the racial divide, stating \\"we are not interested in Black Power, and we're not interested in white power, but we are interested in American democratic power with a small 'd'\\". At a NAACP rally the next day, Vice President Hubert Humphrey argued \\"Racism is racism and we must reject calls for racism whether they come from a throat that is white or one that is black.\\" =Responses= Kwame Ture, formerly known as Stokely Carmichael, and Charles V. Hamilton, both activists with the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee and authors of the book, Black Power: The Politics of Liberation highlight that some observers and critics of the Black Power movement conflated \\"Black Power\\" with \\"Black Supremacy\\". They countered that Black Power advocates were not proposing a mirror-image of white supremacy and domination, instead they were working towards \\"an effective share in the total power of society\\".

An observer of this holiday would greet friends not with \\"Hello, everyone!\\" but with \\"Ahoy, maties!\\" or \\"Ahoy, me hearties!\\" The holiday, and its observance, springs from a romanticized view of the Golden Age of Piracy.  History  \\"Cap'n Slappy\\" and \\"Ol' Chumbucket\\", the founders of Talk Like a Pirate Day According to Summers, the day is the only known holiday to come into being as a result of a sports injury. During a racquetball game between Summers and Baur, one of them reacted to the pain with an outburst of \\"Aaarrr!\\", and the idea was born. That game took place on June 6, 1995, but out of respect for the observance of the Normandy landings, they chose Summers' ex-wife's birthday, as it would be easy for him to remember. At first an inside joke between two friends, the holiday gained exposure when Baur and Summers sent a letter about their invented holiday to the American syndicated humor columnist Dave Barry in 2002. Barry liked the idea and promoted the day, and later appeared in a cameo in their \\"Drunken Sailor\\" Sing Along A-Go-Go video.YouTube \\"Drunken Sailor: First Annual International Talk Like a Pirate Day Drunken Sailor Sing-Along a Go Go\\" September 11, 2011 (@ 3:25). Retrieved September 17, 2017. Growing media coverage of the holiday after Barry's column has ensured that this event is now celebrated internationally, and Baur and Summers now sell books and T-shirts related to the theme on their website. Part of the success for the international spread of the holiday has been attributed to non-restriction of the idea or non-trademarking, in effect opening the holiday to creativity and \\"viral\\" growth.Interview with the Founders, Andrew Warner, Sept. 19. 2008. For example, entertainer Tom Scott became the United Kingdom's first official organizer as \\"Mad Cap'n Tom\\", before the day was picked up by charities such as Marie Curie. The association of pirates with peglegs, parrots, and treasure maps, popularized in Robert Louis Stevenson's novel Treasure Island (1883), has had a significant influence on parody pirate culture. Talk Like a Pirate Day is celebrated with hidden easter egg features in many games and websites, with Facebook introducing a pirate-translated version of its website on Talk Like a Pirate Day 2008 and publisher O'Reilly discounting books on the R programming language to celebrate. In September 2014, Reddit added a pirate theme to their website.  Linguistic background  Pirates of the Caribbean loading area 2016 English actor Robert Newton is the \\"patron saint\\" of Talk Like a Pirate Day. He portrayed pirates in several films, most notably Long John Silver in both the 1950 Disney film Treasure Island and the 1954 Australian film Long John Silver, and the title character in the 1952 film Blackbeard the Pirate. Newton was born in Dorset and educated in Cornwall, and it was his native West Country dialect, which he used in his portrayal of Long John Silver and Blackbeard, that some contend is the origin of the standard \\"pirate accent\\". This was parodied in the 1950s and 1960s by British comedian Tony Hancock. The archetypal pirate word \\"Arrr!\\" (alternatively \\"Rrrr!\\" or \\"Yarrr!\\"), which in West Country parlance means \\"yes\\", first appeared in fiction as early as 1934 in the film Treasure Island starring Lionel Barrymore, and was used by a character in the 1940 novel Adam Penfeather, Buccaneer by Jeffery Farnol. However, it was Robert Newton's use of it in the classic 1950 Disney film Treasure Island that popularized the interjection and made it widely remembered. It has been speculated that the rolling \\"rrr\\", a distinctive element of the speech of the West Country of England, has been associated with pirates because of the West Country's strong maritime heritage, where for many centuries fishing was the main industry (and smuggling a major unofficial one), and where there were several major ports. As a result, West Country speech in general, and Cornish speech in particular, may have been a major influence on a generalized British nautical speech.\\"R!?\\". Language log, September 19, 2005.

Byrd. The teleplay by Jonathan Estrin is based on a true story and focuses on the aftermath of a crime in which three white men from the small town of Jasper, Texas, killed African American James Byrd Jr. by dragging him behind their pickup truck. The film was shown at the Philadelphia International Film Festival before being broadcast by Showtime on June 8, 2003. Plot In Jasper, Texas, in June 1998, three self-proclaimed white supremacists chain James Byrd Jr., to the back of their pickup truck and drag him to his death over three miles of country road. When the town is forced to deal with an onslaught of media coverage that thrusts it into the collective conscience of the entire country and the arrival of contentious members of the Ku Klux Klan, and the Black Panthers, the once peaceful relationship between its white and black citizens is subjected to tension. Trying to maintain peace in the community as the trial of the three perpetrators commences are black mayor R.C. Horn and white sheriff Billy Rowles, neither of whom is prepared to handle all the negative publicity. Justice is served when two of the men are condemned to death and the third is sentenced to life in prison. Cast *Jon Voight ..... Billy Rowles *Louis Gossett Jr. ..... R.C. Horn *Joe Morton .....

James Byrd Jr. *Neil Crone ..... Principal Critical reception David Wiegand of the San Francisco Chronicle said, \\"There's nothing fatally wrong with the film, but the muddled, overstuffed script and sometimes cheesy direction short-circuit the emotional potential of the treatment of James Byrd Jr.'s brutal dragging death five years ago in a small Texas town . . . The better TV films offer commentary and perspective subtly, through careful characterization and plot development. Jasper, Texas doesn't quite do that. Despite great performances from Voight and Gossett, the film trips over its own simplistic analysis of what 'getting along' between the races really means.\\"San Francisco Chronicle review Laura Fries of Variety called the film \\"an introspective but somewhat Hollywoodized treatment\\" and continued, \\"The director's focus is very personal. Although he doesn't linger on details of the court case, the murder is presented in full- color detail. It is handled almost clinically, but not without sensitivity. To dance around the facts would be too great a disservice. To exploit the sensational nature of the crime also would be wrong. Instead, Byrd puts his trust into his very capable cast.\\"Variety review Sam Adams of Philadelphia City Paper thought the film was \\"a standard-issue docudrama whose pat resolution doesn't dredge up anything like the national horror of Byrd's murder.\\"Philadelphia City Paper review Awards and nominations Screenwriter Jonathan Estrin was nominated for the Humanitas Prize.

These periods are referred to as ages or intervals (or stages when referring to the rock strata of that age) and were established using geographic place names where fossil materials were obtained. System The North American land-mammal-age system was formalized in 1941 as a series of provincial land-mammal ages. The system was the standard for correlations in the terrestrial Cenozoic record of North America and was the source for similar time scales dealing with other continents. The system was revised into a formal chronostratigraphic system. This approach is nominally justified by international stratigraphic codes; it holds that first appearances of individual species in particular sections are the only valid basis for naming and defining the land-mammal ages. The basic unit of measure is the first/last boundary statement. This shows that the first appearance event of one taxon is known to predate the last appearance event of another. If two taxa are found in the same fossil quarry or at the same stratigraphic horizon, then their age-range zones overlap. The utility of the system led to its expansion into the Cretaceous (formalized 1986) and the Holocene (formalized 2014). These additions have been used in research related to the Cretaceous‚ÄìPaleogene extinction event and the ensuing recovery, and to the Anthropocene debate, respectively.

Background In early 1982, Bijelo Dugme performed in Innsbruck, Austria, at a manifestation conceptualized as a symbolic passing of the torch whereby the Winter Olympic Games last host city (Innsbruck) makes a handover to the next one (Sarajevo). On their return to Yugoslavia, the band's equipment was seized by the customs, as it was discovered that they had put new equipment into old boxes. The band's record label, Jugoton decided to lend 150,000,000 Yugoslav dinars to Bijelo Dugme, in order to pay the penalty. In order to regain part of the money as soon as possible, Jugoton decided to release two compilation albums, Singl ploƒçe (1974-1975) and Singl ploƒçe (1976-1980).

Fed. 24 is intended to cross the Sierra Madre Occidental from the area of Hidalgo del Parral, Chihuahua, on the east, to the area of Culiac√°n, Sinaloa, on the west. A limited central section of about 40 to 50 km is not yet completed or graded. This section lies between the villages of Los Frailes, Durango, on the east, and Soyatita (also known as El Sabino), Sinaloa, on the west. Travel is possible through this area, where the road is not yet completed, on unimproved roads using high clearance two-wheel drive vehicles. The two unconnected segments that extend through Los Frailes and Soyatita are graded, but each segment is unpaved for about the last 75 km. The central gap in the highway is in the rugged mountains of the Sierra Madre Occidental. This uncompleted and unpaved portion of the road is not well signed, there are many intersections with other unimproved roads, and it is easy to get lost off the intended route of the highway. As noted later, getting lost may not be a safe proposition. Further, the unfinished segment on the west is at about 820 meters elevation at Soyatita. Just outside Los Frailes, the road coming from the east is at 2,750 meters elevation. The traveler crossing this gap will have to negotiate this dramatic change in elevation traveling a good deal of the way on unimproved dirt roads. Travel times in this central section can be quite slow. This central portion of the highway passes directly through the region known as Mexico's Golden Triangle, notorious for drug cultivation, drug trafficking, and related violent drug incidents. \\"Geographically, Badiraguato sits on the western edge of Mexico's \\"Golden Triangle,\\" a busy trafficking corridor with an imposing landscape, defined by a seemingly endless chain of mountains that joins the states of Sinaloa, Chihuahua and Durango. It is a region of few paved roads, but if you value your safety, you had better know where the ones that do exist are coming from and better yet, where they are going. Most locals advise foreigners against carrying a passport, saying they would be better off traveling with someone well known who can vouch for them and their intentions. In other words, this is no land for the faint of heart. You can walk for days without seeing another human being, then suddenly stumble into a field of poppies or marijuana, to be quickly followed by the rumbling of 4√ó4 vehicles. If that were to happen, you might not live to tell the story. Whatever is left of you might never be found.\\" \\"After some initial difficulty, Miguel Angel Vega, a writer for the Sinaloa-based paper, was able to gain access to the Sierra Madre Occidental Mountains located in the heart of the Golden Triangle, Mexico's key drug producing region. The region, which spans three of Mexico's 32 states, is known as the epicenter of marijuana and poppy production in the country.\\" \\"In Mexico's prime dope-growing region, known as the Golden Triangle, local farmers say the best cash crops are still the illegal ones.\\" \\"This south-western part of the state [of Chihuahua] forms part of the Western Sierra Madre physiographic region (see map linked to above), an area of rugged relief with limited highway connections where rivers have carved giant canyons (such as the Copper Canyon system) into the forested plateaus and mountains. The \\"culture of violence\\" in this region, sometimes called Mexico's \\"Golden Triangle\\", was analyzed by Carlos Mario Alvarado in \\"La [Sierra] Tarahumara, una tierra herida: an√°lisis de la violencia en zonas productoras de estupefacientes en Chihuahua\\" (The Tarahumara Sierra, a wounded land: analysis of the violence in narcotic drug production zones in Chihuahua) published by the state government in 1966. Alvarado found that between 1988 and 1993, in the southernmost municipality of Guadalupe y Calvo and in neighboring drug- growing municipalities, murders had a bimodal distribution each year, with peaks in April‚ÄìMay‚ÄìJune (when poppies and marijuana are planted) and September‚ÄìOctober‚ÄìNovember (when they are harvested). The four-year drug- violence death-rate for those municipalities in the early 1990s was significantly higher than the four-year drug war deaths ration shown on the map for 2006-2010.\\" \\"The mountain slopes and valleys in the part of southern Chihuahua state that's hugged by Sinaloa and Durango states are sometimes called Mexico's Golden Triangle ‚Äî after the opium-producing Golden Triangle of Southeast Asia ‚Äî because of their productivity. Illicit crops include not only marijuana but also poppy, the flowering plant that provides the white gummy latex that's later processed into opium and heroin. It's a dangerous area. Even the poorest farmers tote weapons. A third of the region's population is thought to earn its living from the illicit drug industry.\\" Northern terminus to Hidalgo del Parral, Chihuahua Fed24 starts in the north at an intersection with the Fed. 16D. This intersection is at a point on the Fed. 16D that is 66 km east of Ciudad Cuauht√©moc and 38 km southwest of Chihuahua City. Fed. 24 then extends in a southerly direction for 184 km to Hidalgo del Parral, Chihuahua. At Hidalgo del Parral Fed. 4 intersects with Fed. 45 which connects Parral with Jim√©nez to the east and Durango to the south. Hidalgo del Parral to the junction at Las Yerbitas (Aserradero Yerbites), Chihuahua From Hidalgo del Parral, the finished section of paved highway going west runs some 220 km in a southwesterly direction to a highway junction at Las Yerbitas (Aserradero Yerbites), passing through El Vergel. Along this stretch of Fed. 24, at a point 46 km west of Hidalgo del Parral there is an intersection with CHI-23. From this intersection, CHI-23 runs north through Guachochi and Creel to eventually intersect Fed. 16, west of La Junta, Chihuahua. Las Yerbitas (Aserradero Yerbites) to Los Frailes, Durango From the junction at Las Yerbitas (Aserradero Yerbites), Fed. 24 continues in a southerly direction for about 75 kilometers past the village of Atascaderos (Buenavista de Atascaderos), Chihuahua, to Los Frailes, Durango, located on the border of Chihuahua and Durango. The highway is graded in all of this section, and is paved for only about 20 km after leaving the junction at Las Yerbitas. From the Las Yerbitas junction, a paved highway runs west for 25 km to Guadalupe y Calvo. Highway gap from the village of Los Frailes, Durango to the village of Soyatita, Sinaloa From Hidalgo del Parral, Fed. 24 was intended to extend southwest to cross the Sierra Madre Occidental mountain range to the coastal area of Culiacan in Sinaloa. However, about 75 km of central section of Fed. 24 is not yet completed. The east end of the highway is graded beyond the village of Los Frailes, Durango (Lat. 25.640171¬∞, Long. -106.906229¬∞), but the last 75 km of this roadway is not paved. The west end of the highway is graded through the village of Soyatita, Sinaloa (Lat. 25.738929¬∞, Long. -107.305406¬∞), and the last 75 km of this stretch is also not paved. Between Los Frailes on the east and Soyatita on the west there is a gap of about 75 km. There is a distance of about 40 to 50 km in this section that has not been improved. Travelers can drive between these two points on a commonly used dirt road, but this roadway is neither graded or paved. In addition there are many places where other unmarked roads intersect with the highway. It is easy to lose one's way and get lost. There are no reliable maps detailing the road between the two ends of the graded road of Fed. 24\\\\. For orientation of those Fed. 24 travelers passing through this gap, about midway in this uncompleted section is the village of Huixiopa, Sinaloa (Lat. 25.755591¬∞, Long. -107.191204¬∞). The unfinished segment on the west is at about 820 meters elevation at Soyatita. Just outside Los Frailes, the road coming from the east is at 2,750 meters elevation. In crossing the last unfinished gap, the highway construction will have to complete an all-weather road that conveys vehicles over this 1,930 meter elevation change. Until then, the traveler crossing this gap will have to negotiate this very significant change in elevation on dirt roads. As noted above, because of the maze of unsigned roads in the central section, the traveler can get lost. Both Soyatita and Los Frailes have between 300 to 400 inhabitants. There are not any known overnight accommodations. Being caught by night in this area would increase travel risks. Getting lost in this area may not be a safe proposition. The unfinished gap in Fed. 24 lies in the heart of the rugged Sierra Madre Occidental, and the road passes within 1 km of the point where the borders of Chihuahua, Durango and Sinaloa meet. The general area surrounding this three-way junction of state borders is known as the \\"Golden Triangle of Mexico\\", a dangerous area which is well known for drug growing, drug trafficking, and violent drug related incidents. Soyatita to southern terminus near Pericos, Sinaloa The graded section of Fed. 24 in Sinaloa, the first 50 to 55 km of which is not yet paved, commences at the village of Soyatita and extends approximately 130 km in a southwesterly direction through Tameapa and Badiraguato to reach Fed. 15 in the vicinity of Pericos.

It stars David Morrissey and Spencer Leigh as two 16-year-old Liverpool boys from broken homes who escape from their grim lives by running away to Wales one summer. It also starred James Hazeldine and Ian Hart (credited in the series as Ian Davies). The series was shown in five 50-minute episodes on Channel 4 from 7 August to 4 September 1983. It was repeated on ITV in April 1985. Synopsis Sixteen-year-old Billy Rizley (Morrissey) comes from a broken home in Liverpool. His father is absent, his older sister despises him, and his mother suffers from depression and is unwilling to care for him. Billy and his slightly dimwitted friend Icky (Leigh) have truanted from school for some time and have fallen into a life of delinquency, regularly fighting with local gangs and getting into trouble with the police. Billy is already on probation and it seems only a matter of time before his life of crime and violence results in his incarceration. When the pair decide to go back into school in order to go on a school camping trip to Wales, they are rebuffed by their teacher. With no direction or prospects in life, the pair decide to run away to Wales by themselves, the last place Billy had any happy memories when he went away on a previous school trip some years earlier. Billy steals some money from his mother to facilitate their trip. They travel into Wales beyond the limit of their rail tickets, and when they attempt to bribe the train guards they are detained. They escape however by leaping from the train and continue their journey on foot (and on a stolen tractor). Billy eventually finds the location of the previous school camp, but his attempts to recreate the camp environment end in frustration. They try to spend the night in a barn at a secluded farm, but are caught by the farmer and his wife. Though they take pity on the two boys and let them spend the night in the house, in the morning Billy and Icky make a quick getaway from the farmhouse when the police arrive. Wandering through the Welsh countryside, they come across an old cottage which they initially believe is deserted. Hoping to find shelter inside, they come face to face with Kidder (Hazeldine), the man who lives there. Kidder lives the life of a hermit, preferring to keep himself to himself. Completely self-sufficient, he works as an artist, selling his paintings at a local market, and grows his own food. He reluctantly allows the boys to stay for a night but tells them they have to leave after that. Hoping to change Kidder's mind, the boys begin to do chores around the house and the grounds outside, but Icky breaks all of Kidder's plates in the river when he is supposed to be washing them. The boys set out to find replacement plates and end up stealing some from a nearby house. When they return they find a gang of local Welsh youths vandalising Kidder's house. They chase them off, and eventually Kidder agrees to let them stay, but Billy is later beaten up by the local gang. Meanwhile, Kidder discovers Icky is illiterate and, being a former schoolteacher, begins teaching him how to read. While Billy and Kidder are away at the local market, Icky goes out on his own and discovers the boys from his school at the camp site that he and Billy had come to Wales to find. However, when he brings the boys back to Kidder's house, they get drunk and wreck the house. One of the boys, Rabbit (Hart), steals Kidder's money from a drawer. Meanwhile, at the market, Billy meets Jo, a pretty, intelligent girl from a local middle-class family. Later, when Billy gets back to the house, he finds Icky sleeping off a hangover and Kidder's money gone. They go to the camp site and get the money back, threatening Rabbit not to reveal to anyone where they are living. Kidder gives the boys handmade books that he wrote for them about their adventures. One night, the three of them go to a local dance where Billy sees Jo again. As they begin a romantic relationship, Icky grows restless and decides to return to Liverpool alone. Back in Liverpool, Icky and the gang from school steal a car and drive to Southport. While there, they again come into conflict with a rival gang and Rabbit stabs one of them. Icky abandons the gang in Southport and tries to drive back to Wales, but he is chased by the police and is killed when he crashes the stolen car. Back in Wales, the local police come looking for Billy at Kidder's house. As Billy is hiding from them, he overhears their conversation and learns that Kidder is gay and once had an affair with an 18-year-old male student (a criminal offence at the time) at the school where he worked, and served a prison sentence for it. Distraught at what he hears, Billy runs away from Kidder's house and finds Jo. She reasons with him and dispels his homophobic thoughts about Kidder, and she and Billy then make love near a lake. When he later returns to Kidder's house, Billy sees two police officers from Liverpool who have come to take him back home because he has broken the conditions of his probation. The police officers begin assaulting Kidder to make him tell them where Billy is. Rather than run away, Billy comes to Kidder's defence and stops the police from hurting him further. Billy is then taken back to his grim life in Liverpool by the police officers, his summer in Wales over. Production Produced by Yorkshire Television, the series was filmed from April to October 1982 in Liverpool, Yorkshire and Wales. Scriptwriter Willy Russell initially had his name removed from the credits after disagreements with the producers, particularly taking umbrage to the casting of Morrissey and Leigh whom he considered too old to portray the 16-year-old lead characters. (The actors were 18 and 19 respectively at the time of filming.)Angelini, Sergio. \\"One Summer (1983)\\", Screenonline, British Film Institute. Retrieved on 11 December 2008. However, when the series was repeated on ITV in 1985, Russell's screen credit had been restored. In later years, Russell stated his intention to write a film adaptation of One Summer, though this never came to pass. Commercial release One Summer was released on DVD in 2006 by Network. The two-disc set includes all five episodes and commentaries and interviews with Morrissey, Leigh and Hart. The series was re- released by Network on Blu-ray in September 2020, remastered in high definition from the original film elements. Extras on this release include alternate scenes filmed for pre-watershed transmission. The series soundtrack, composed and performed by Alan Parker, was released in 2016 on vinyl and digital.

Their name is derived from carmina, which means ‚Äúsong‚Äù in Latin. Kelly and Kamille write, sing, produce and perform music that entwines their classical training and pop influences. Biography Kelly was born in Germany and Kamille in Hawaii where both girls were raised before moving with their family to San Francisco. When the girls were only eight and ten years old, their mother enrolled them in the San Francisco Conservatory of Music where they took classes that included music theory, composition and classical voice training. They have one sister, Petra Karmina Rudisill, born 1997. They named the band after the Latin word for \\"song,\\" also Petra's middle name. Kelly was a skilled soccer player and made it to an Olympic development team. Kamille was winning dance competitions and sang classically; David Foster teamed her with Josh Groban to perform at fund- raising events. Before long, Karmina was successfully competing in prestigious music competitions, among them, the John Lennon Songwriting Contest, ASCAP‚Äôs Lester Sill Songwriters‚Äô Workshop, the San Francisco Concerto Orchestra Competition and the California State Vocal competition, which they won twenty- seven times. Karmina's first national exposure came when they won Disney Channel's \\"Two Hour Tour‚Äù competition which led to Darren Hayes of Savage Garden mentoring the girls and selecting them to open for his band in San Francisco at the Fillmore Auditorium. After eight years in San Francisco, the girls moved to Los Angeles where they attended the Thornton School of Music at the University of Southern California, and earned bachelor of music degrees in music industry. Kelly went on to receive a master's degree in Music Education, as well as a teaching credential. Pre-Karmina, the duo also went by the names Kalabash and Kelly & Kamille. They ultimately settled on Karmina, which means ‚Äúsong‚Äù in Latin and is also the title of one of their favorite operas, ‚ÄúCarmina Burana‚Äù (or ‚ÄúSongs of Bayern‚Äù). Career Karmina's music education and hard work paid off when a copy of the band's demo found its way to an executive at the newly formed CBS Records. The record company's management team approached the duo in December 2006, laid out their vision for the new label and immediately offered Karmina a place on the roster. Karmina was one of the first acts signed to the newly inaugurated CBS Records. They released their d√©but album Backwards into Beauty (produced by Karmina and Guy Erez) in 2008. The title Backwards into Beauty comes from a lyric in the album's first track, ‚ÄúSatellites‚Äù, and it sums up the album's overall concept. The album also features engineers, Stewart Cararas and Brian Yaskulka. The group's first single ‚ÄúThe Kiss‚Äù deals with the theme of forbidden love which was influenced by Romeo and Juliet, and paraphrases Shakespeare in its lyrics. \\"The Kiss\\" reached number 24 on Billboard's Adult Contemporary chart. The music video for ‚ÄúThe Kiss‚Äù includes footage of real-life couples who have had to overcome bigotry, the judgement of their friends and family, and the pressures of society. The video also features comedian/actress/reality TV personality Amanda Ireton. The song has been released and was featured in several shows including 90210 and on the upcoming promo of CSI: NY which features the couple Danny Messer and Lindsay Monroe perhaps getting married. Also, Karmina's \\"The Whoa Song\\" was used where Danny and Lindsay had their first kiss at the end of season 2, but the scene was removed before the episode aired. The scene can be watched on-line, and is shown in a flashback when Danny and Lindsay get married. Several of the songs from their album have been featured on network TV, including NCIS, Cane and NUMB3RS on CBS, the CW's newly revamped hit 90210 and Life Is Wild. Karmina was also featured on-camera performing their song ‚ÄúWalk You Home‚Äù on A&E;'s hit series The Cleaner, starring Benjamin Bratt. They made their performing d√©but on national broadcast television December 21, 2007, appearing with Sheryl Crow, Fergie, Carole King, James Blunt and Reba McEntire on the CBS holiday special, A Home for the Holidays, playing a song they wrote at the request of the producers. Since then, Kelly and Kamille have toured the US, UK and EU (with Apple's help) and made a new record with composer John Powell, titled Queens of Heart.https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/8499573/karmina-wondrous- love Their original track \\"All the King's Horses\\" was included on an episode of Reign (season 2, episode 19).

The team was a member of what was referred to as the National Football League‚Äînot to be confused with the National Football League of today.Peterson, p. 34. The whole league was a curious mixture of football players as well as baseball players who adapted to playing football. The Phillies were owned and financed by baseball's Philadelphia Phillies just as the owners of the Philadelphia Athletics financed their team, the Philadelphia Athletics. The Pittsburgh Stars made up the third team and was suspected of being financed by the Pittsburgh Pirates baseball team.\\"Football Chronology II\\", p. 3 History =Origins= The Phillies began as the Philadelphia Athletic Club in 1901. The team was more commonly called throughout Philadelphia as the Philadelphia Professionals or the Philadelphia Pros. It was the region's first entirely professional football squad. Wilson Wright, a Penn graduate, was the team's manager and chief financial backer. The team, led by Penn's Blondy Wallace, was largely made up of former Penn players along with a few veterans of such teams as the Duquesne Country and Athletic Club and the Latrobe Athletic Association. 1901 Philadelphia opened its 1901 season with shut outs of the Conshohocken Tigers, the Orange Athletic Club, Susquehanna University and a tough squad from Lafayette College. Next Philadelphia had to play the 1901 Homestead Library & Athletic Club football team. Homestead was a successful team that gave up only seven points over a span of two seasons and was clearly the strongest of the many competitive teams of Western Pennsylvania. In fact Homestead was considered it the best professional team in the nation. This match-up was generally accepted as the professional championship of the United States. Both teams worked diligently to prepare for the game. However Philadelphia proved no match for the Homestead team and lost by a score of 18-0. The two teams then closed out their seasons in Pittsburgh the following Saturday. This time Philadelphia lost by a score of only 6-5. They held Homestead to a single touchdown and managed to score the only touchdown against the team in two seasons. =Phillies= Although still lacking the established fan base of college football, Philadelphia Athletic Club benefited from being built on a strong foundation of well known local college talent. Philadelphia's first experience with pro football left fans in anticipation for the next season. This gained the attention of John Rogers, the owner of baseball's Philadelphia Phillies. In 1902 the war between baseball's well established National League and the new American League was really heating up. In an effort to get the upper hand in the battle for fans, Rogers took over the professional football club and renamed them the Phillies, after his baseball team. Blondy Wallace, who was a captain of the 1901 Pros team, left the team to join its cross town rival, the Athletics football team owned by baseball's Ben Shibe. The Phillies baseball manager, Bill Shettsline became the team's manager, while Ben Roller became the team's coach. Both Rogers and Shibe knew that to lay claim to the \\"World Championship\\", they had to play a team from Pittsburgh, which was the focal point of football at the time. They called on pro football promoter Dave Berry and a Pittsburgh team was soon formed. These three teams are all that made up the first NFL. The league played all of its games on Saturdays, since there were no Sunday sports events according to Pennsylvania blue laws in 1902. The teams began playing various colleges and local football clubs before finally playing each other.Carroll p.5 1902 The Athletics had split on the 1902 season with the Phillies, as had the Pittsburgh Stars. However each team carried a record of 2-2 for league play, with a complete record of 8-3. Pittsburgh had by far the better point ratio, scoring 39 points to their opponents' 22. Both the Athletics and the Phillies gave up more points than they scored in their league games. This led to a championship game between the A's and Stars. After playing the first game to a scoreless tie, Pittsburgh finally won the second championship game late in the fourth quarter to give them a controversial championship win. The defeated A's then went home and defeat the Phillies 17-6 to give them the city championship and a second showing in the league.Carroll p.8 =World Series of Football= In late December the 1902 World Series of Football was held at Madison Square Garden in New York City.Peterson, p. 35. While neither the Phillies nor Athletics participated in this event, several members of both squads joined together on a team known variously as \\"New York\\", the \\"New Yorks\\" and the \\"New York Philadelphians\\". The New York team played in the first indoor football game against the Syracuse Athletic Club.\\"The First Football World Series\\" p. 3 Seasons *1901 Philadelphia Football Club season *1902 Philadelphia Phillies (NFL) season  Notes  References  National Football League (1902) teams Defunct American football teams in Pennsylvania Philadelphia Phillies American football teams in Philadelphia 1901 establishments in Pennsylvania American football teams established in 1901 1902 disestablishments in Pennsylvania Sports clubs disestablished in 1902  Athletic Club football teams and seasons ","title":"Philadelphia Phillies (NFL)"},{"id":"20648698","text":"Federal Highway 129 (Carretera Federal 129) is a Federal Highway of Mexico.

Core technology premise  The True Knowledge Answer Engine attempts to comprehend posed questions by disambiguating from all possible meanings of the words in the question to find the most likely meaning of the question being asked. It does this by drawing upon its database of knowledge of discrete facts. As these facts are stored in a form that the computer can understand, the answer engine attempts to produce an answer to what it comprehends to be the question by logically deducing from them. For example, if one were to type in \\"What is the birth date of George W. Bush?\\", True Knowledge would reason from the facts \\"George W. Bush is a president\\", \\"George W. Bush is a human being\\", \\"A president is a subclass of human being\\", \\"Date of creation is a more general form for birth date\\", and \\"the 6th of July is the date of creation for George W. Bush\\", to produce the simple answer, \\"the 6th of July\\". True Knowledge differs from competitors like Freebase and DBpedia in that they offer natural language access.

He was awarded five caps for Wales under union rules and was part of the Welsh side that won the 1931 Five Nations Championship. At Salford Day forged a reputation as the greatest hooker to play for the club, his record 488 appearances for the club went unbroken for over 35 years. Background Bert Day was born in Griffithstown, Monmouthshire, and he died aged 69 in Salford, Greater Manchester, England. Rugby career Day was first selected for Wales in the 1930 Five Nations Championship in a match against Scotland at Murrayfield. Day was one of two new caps in the Welsh squad alongside Swansea's Dai Thomas. Wales lost the match 9-12, but Day was reselected for the next game of the tournament in a win over Ireland, under the captaincy of Jack Bassett. The final game of the Championship was an away game to France. The match was notoriously bad tempered with the referee forced to make multiple stoppages to reproach both packs as fist fights broke out throughout the game. Day himself was kicked in the mouth and was forced to leave the pitch to have several stitches in his lip. Day played twice in the 1931 Five Nations Championship which Wales won after drawing against England and beating the remaining three teams. Day's final match was the second game in a victory over Scotland at the Cardiff Arms Park.

In this context actors in development can easily relate to other stakeholders, have selective access to information, produce and publish their own content and redistribute pieces of content released by others. They can integrate, combine, aggregate, generate, moderate and mediate content. In a typical Web2forDev scenario data and/or functionalities from a number of free/low cost online applications are combined and served as mashups thus ensuring a wide range of online services at low cost. History Web2forDev was first used as a term at the Web2forDev International Conference organised by CTA and other development partners in Rome at FAO in September 2007. The event was organised by The Association for Progressive Communications, The ACP Secretariat, Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research, Technical Centre for Agricultural and Rural Cooperation (CTA) ACP-EU, Euforic, Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, Deutsche Gesellschaft f√ºr Technische Zusammenarbeit GmbH, International Fund for Agricultural Development, International Institute for Communication and Development (IICD), University of British Columbia and Universit√© Cheikh Anta DIOP. Technology Overview Open source and proprietary, free or low-cost interactive user centered applications that promote communication, online collaboration, sharing information, user empowerment, and social networking. Considering the constraints which affect many developing countries, Web2forDev applications are usually low-bandwidth friendly. There's a revolution that is vitally transforming the way business and enterprise utilize the Web. Something like an enormous software upgrade for the entire Web and it's called Web 2.0. The web is shifting from just being an intermediate in which information is transmitted and consumed, into being a platform in which content is shaped, shared, remixed, repurposed, and passed along. Various companies have started understanding that the social side of change, including personal networks and developing trusting relationships, might prove to be the most powerful strategy for promotion. The new Web 2.0 Business ground rules include an increasing focus on knowledge, trust, relationships, and communities which in many senses is the true structure of today's organization. Web 2.0 applications are changing the way the world communicates allowing consumers to share opinions, wants, needs and motivations. Usage Web 2.0 applications are used in the development sector for a number of purposes and by different actors. Examples are ... * Internet/SMS gateways are being used to distribute development-related information to people with access to mobile phones but without access to internet. Similarly, these gateways enable mobile phone users to make their presence on the internet by posting to blogs and online databases via sms, etc. * Tagging systems and content aggregation enable users with access to only low-bandwidth to find quickly the information they are searching for, without having to navigate through many bandwidth-demanding websites. * Users with old computers can take advantage of some online applications which can process their computing tasks the way their computers never could (e.g. online version of Adobe Photoshop) * Users who don't own their own PCs are using online services to store all their data, such as emails, documents, photos, etc., thus having access to them from any computer connected to internet. That way, online storage spaces and related services substitute physical hard drive spaces (PCs) which in many regions are shared by many users.

The play is made of four one-part stories, by different authors, rather than the usual multi-part serial. All episodes use the Eighth Doctor as played by Paul McGann, and he is joined in each episode by a companion who originated in either the Doctor Who book or comic ranges. Benny's Story by Lance Parkin Benny is hired to recover a familiar artifact: the key to the TARDIS. *Bernice Summerfield - Lisa Bowerman *Klarner - Richard Earl *Venhella - Su Douglas Fitz's Story by Stephen Cole The Doctor and Fitz investigate an alien world's alien defense business. *Fitz Kreiner - Matt Di Angelo *Commander Hellan Femor - Fenella Woolgar *Michael Rond - Paul Thornley *Gem Weston - Su Douglas Izzy's Story by Alan Barnes Izzy asks the Doctor to look into the rarest comic book in history: 'Aggrotron!' *Izzy Sinclair - Jemima Rooper *Grubb/The Man - Steve Hansell *Grakk/Clerkie/The Camp Robot - Teddy Kempner *Courtmaster Cruel - Anthony Glennan *Foreman - Ian Hallard *Juror - Katrina Cooke *Captain Cannibal - Robert Forknall *Suits - Robert Forknall/Ian Hallard Mary's Story by Jonathan Morris Mary Shelley becomes inspired by events in Switzerland, 1816, at the Villa Diodati when she meets the two Doctors. *Mary Shelley - Julie Cox *Percy Shelley - Anthony Glennon *Lord Byron - Robert Forknall *John Polidori - Ian Hallard *Claire Clairmont - Katrina Cooke The Three Companions The Three Companions bonus feature, Part 4. Cremation Point by Marc Platt *Polly - Anneke Wills *The Brigadier - Nicholas Courtney *Gerry Lenz/Announcer - Russell Floyd Continuity * The chronological placement of these adventures is unclear, but it is fair to assume that they all occur soon after the Television Movie, earlier than any other main range drama. * Benny last appeared in the main Doctor Who range in 2003's The Dark Flame opposite the Seventh Doctor and Ace. Benny first met the Eighth Doctor in the novel The Dying Days. * Fitz appeared in the Eighth Doctor Adventures novels, starting with The Taint. How he parted company with the Doctor is uncertain, as he was also in the final book of the range, The Gallifrey Chronicles. * Izzy was the first companion given to the Eighth Doctor in the Doctor Who Magazine comics. She traveled with him from End Game until Oblivion. In this audio story, they visit Stockbridge, a town which has featured in many Doctor Who Magazine comics as well as audios such as Circular Time and The Eternal Summer. Located somewhere in Gloucestershire, is also Izzy's home. * Bernice, Fitz and Izzy have all been featured previously in Big Finish's Short Trips short story anthologies: Fitz in Zodiac, Izzy in Life Science and Benny in various collections. * There have been several references in Big Finish's Eighth Doctor stories to the incident in 1816, in Lake Geneva, Switzerland, with Mary Shelley, Percy Shelley, John Polidori and Lord Byron, which resulted in Mary writing Frankenstein. The first mention is in Big Finish's very first Eighth Doctor play, Storm Warning. At its very start, the Doctor picks up the aforementioned book and reads the preface, in which she recounted her version of the incident. The Doctor implies what she had written wasn't the entire truth. This scene was repeated in its entirety in Terror Firma. In Neverland, while dazed, the Doctor blurts out warnings to Byron about meddling with terrible forces and also warns Mary that that someone or something isn't really her brother. A similar moment occurs in Zagreus, where he laments Polidori as well as Mary. In the Shada remake, the Doctor mentions meeting up with his friend Professor Chronotis at Lake Geneva with Mary and Byron. And in the last Eighth Doctor story in the main range, The Girl Who Never Was, the Doctor is very excited when he stumbles across one of Mary's books. The Doctor mentions Mary one last time before the release of Mary's Story in The Beast of Orlok. A year after its release, he recalls being at the Villa Diodati in Nevermore. *In the 1996 TV Movie, during the first moments of the Eighth Doctor's life, the 1931 film adaptation of Mary's Frankenstein was playing on a nearby television, mirroring the creature's first moments of life. *Prior to the launch of the Big Finish range, clones of Mary and Percy Shelley and three clones of Byron had been featured in the Missing Adventures novel Managra by Stephen Marley, where it is implied that the originals were known to the Fourth Doctor. *The characters Samson and Gemma, who are waiting for the Doctor in Vienna, were previously heard in Terror Firma. They are waiting for him the on the same day as Mary's Story, in June, 1816. *Mary Shelley's adventures with the Doctor continue after this, starting with The Silver Turk, in which he attempts to reunite with Samson and Gemma. *The older Doctor recalls the \\"years\\" that Mary spent journeying in the TARDIS, mentioning Cybermen, Axons and \\"King Herold at The Battle of Hastings\\". The events with the Cybermen occur in her first trip, The Silver Turk. *The older Doctor also recalls many of his former companions, including Charley Pollard, Lucie Miller, Trix MacMillan, Ssard, Compassion, Destrii, Samson and Gemma. He also mentions Alex, which may be a reference to his great-grandson, who meets in An Earthly Child.

It was named after the German Surgeon, James Adolf Israel (1848-1926), who studied the organism for the first time in 1878. Pathogenesis Actinomycosis is most frequently caused by A. israelii. It is a normal colonizer of the vagina, colon, and mouth. Infection is established first by a breach of the mucosal barrier during various procedures (dental, gastrointestinal), aspiration, or pathologies such as diverticulitis. The chronic phase of this disease is also known as the \\"classic phase\\" because the acute, early phase is often missed by health care providers. This is characterized by slow, contiguous growth that ignores tissue planes and forms a sinus tract that can spontaneously heal and recur, leading to a densely fibrotic lesion.

Two engine types have been built to date: Draco and SuperDraco. The original Draco thruster is a small rocket engine for use on the Dragon spacecraft. SuperDraco is derived from Draco, and uses the same storable (non-cryogenic) hypergolic propellant as the small Draco thrusters, but is much larger and delivers over 100 times the thrust. SuperDraco engines are being used on the Crew Dragon spacecraft to provide launch-escape capability to low Earth orbit. Draco and SuperDraco combine the functions of a reaction control system and main propulsive engine. Draco Draco thrusters generate 400 newtons (90 pounds-force) of thrust using a storable propellant mixture of monomethyl hydrazine fuel and nitrogen tetroxide oxidizer. The Draco thrust is comparable to the Marquardt R-4D engine developed for the Apollo Service and Lunar Modules in the 1960s and used for apogee/perigee maneuvers, orbit adjustment, and attitude control. Sixteen Draco thrusters are used on the Dragon spacecraft for attitude control and maneuvering. SuperDraco On February 1, 2012 SpaceX announced that it had completed the development of a new, more powerful storable-propellant rocket engine, this one called SuperDraco. This high-thrust hypergolic engine‚Äîabout 200 times larger than the Draco RCS thruster hypergolic engine‚Äîoffers deep throttling ability and just like the Draco thruster, has multiple restart capability and uses the same shared hypergolic propellants. Its primary purpose is for SpaceX's LAS (launch abort system) on the Dragon spacecraft. According to the NASA press release, the engine has a transient from ignition to full thrust of 100 ms. During launch abort, eight SuperDracos fire for 5 seconds at full thrust. The development of the engine was partially funded by NASA's CCDev 2 program. SuperDracos are used on both the Crew Dragon and were used on the SpaceX DragonFly, a prototype low-altitude test article that was used for flight testing various aspects of the propulsive-landing technology. While the engine is capable of of thrust, during use for DragonFly testing, the engines were planned to be throttled to to maintain vehicle stability. First firing of all 8 Super Draco engines took place on 6 May 2015 at 9am EST at the SpaceX Crew Dragon Pad Abort Test. SuperDraco engines are capable of being restarted many times, and have the capability to deeply reduce their thrust providing precise control during propulsive landing of the Dragon capsule. SpaceX have since announced they will not be using propulsive landing on the Dragon 2. , SuperDraco is the third most powerful engine developed by SpaceX, approximately 200 times more powerful than the Draco RCS thruster engines, and only outmatched by the Raptor and Merlin. By comparison, it is more than twice as powerful as the Kestrel engine that was used in SpaceX's Falcon 1 launch vehicle second stage, and about 1/9 the thrust of a Merlin 1D engine. In addition to the use of the SuperDraco thrusters for powered-landings on Earth, NASA's Ames Research Center studied the feasibility of a Dragon-derived Mars lander for scientific investigation until 2017. Preliminary analysis indicated that the final deceleration needed would be within the retro-propulsion SuperDraco thruster capabilities.

George Leavitt subsequently founded his own publishing company, Leavitt & Allen, but it failed during a financial panic that swept the nation during the American Civil War. Leavitt later tried to reestablish himself as both publisher and fine arts auctioneers, founding one of the first upscale auction houses, and eventually retiring from the book industry entirely. George A. Leavitt was born in 1822, in Haverhill, Massachusetts, the son of Jonathan Leavitt,Fifty Years Among Authors, Books and Publishers, James Cephas Derby, G. W. Carleton & Co., New York, 1884 who lived in Andover, Massachusetts, where the former bookbinder's apprentice operated an early publishing firm devoted to turning out religious works connected with the Andover Theological Seminary. Shortly after his son George's birth, Jonathan Leavitt left Andover for New York City, where he launched into business with his brother-in-law Daniel Appleton, a former Boston dry goods merchant. Their partnership lasted a decade, after which Leavitt founded the publishing house of Leavitt & Trow, which published the complete works of Jonathan Edwards, and became one of the country's largest publishing houses through its dominance of religious publishing.Obituary, George Ayers Leavitt, The Publishers' Weekly, American Book-Trade Journal, Vol. XXXIV, July-December, 1888, Office of the Publishers' Weekly, New York, 1888 Helping Jonathan Leavitt build his business was his right-hand man, George Palmer Putnam, who eventually left for other better-paying opportunities. By 1842 George A. Leavitt, having graduated from Andover's Phillips Academy and worked for a time for the booksellers Robinson & Franklin, joined his father's publishing house. On his father Jonathan's death a decade later in 1851, Leavitt took over the firm and operated for year as a sole proprietorship, when he took on as partner his Andover classmate John K. Allen. The firm renamed itself Leavitt & Allen and eventually settled at 379 Broadway in Lower Manhattan. In 1856, Leavitt took the suggestion of his father-in-law James E. Cooley, one of New York's largest auctioneers, to open a trade book sale auction house.Although heir to one of earliest New York publishing houses, Leavitt eventually made his name as a bookseller and auctioneer, largely due to financial reverses. Until that year New York publishers had dealt with wholesalers in a system devoid of rules. Wearying of the inconsistencies, the publishers, including Leavitt, founded the New York Publishers' Association in an attempt to bring order to the topsy-turvy marketplace for books.One of the issues raised by the New York publishers was the role of itinerant booksellers who, the publishers complained, were able to sell their books directly to customers for far more than the New York publishers themselves could ask. On March 20, 1856, the Second Regular Trade Sale was held on the premises of the newly formed Leavitt, Delisser & Co., an auction house formed especially to handle the trade book sale. By this time Leavitt's publishing interests had blossomed. Aside from the new auction house on the first floor, Leavitt's building on Broadway Leavitt's publishing interests were contained at his building at Broadway and White Streets in Lower Manhattan. housed Leavitt's partner John F. Trow's printing operation on the building's upper floors. The publishing firm of Leavitt & Allen operated a store on the first floor, as well as occupying the building's basement. Leavitt had inherited a backstock of educational books from his father's firm, and he and his partner Allen continued to add to their stable of writers, which included Prof. John J. Owen, S.N. Sweet, Rev. Albert Barnes, Jonathan Edwards and others. Leavitt & Allen was particularly successful at sales of special occasion books and 'annuals', a category generating sales of up to 50,000 copies a year. Leavitt & Allen also published English poets, young people's books, writing and photograph albums. By 1860 Leavitt's fortunes were rising, and the firms of Leavitt & Allen, publishers and booksellers, as well as Geo. A. Leavitt & Co. relocated to larger quarters at 24 Walker Street. Leavitt's auction partner Delisser had retired, and was replaced by Leavitt's friend James M. Alden. A year later the Leavitt interests relocated to 21 and 23 Mercer Street in Lower Manhattan, which were to remain the firm's premises for many years, and where it conducted its trade book sales. In 1863, as the American Civil War raged, dragging many New York publishers into bankruptcy, George Leavitt became involved in a transaction that would change his business entirely. The publishing firm of Geo. A. Leavitt & Co. found itself holding a large volume of commercial paper that was not honored in the marketplace. Following the resolution of the credit matter, most of the business that Leavitt and his father had built was wiped out. Leavitt's father-in-law Cooley took over the auction business, and the profitable book company was sold to meet the demands of creditors of Leavitt's auction house. In the wake of the business failure, the partners dispersed. Leavitt became an auctioneer for James Cooley; James Alden left the industry; Leavitt's old partner Allen departed for the West Coast to start over. A chastened George Leavitt, publisher, became George Leavitt, auctioneer. By 1866 he had formed a partnership with his brother M.B. Leavitt and Robert M. Strebeigh in a new auction house called Leavitt, Strebeigh & Co. Three years later Strebeigh retired, and the house became known as the eponymous George A.

But within a couple of years, the exigencies of the publishing industry, roiled by the Civil War, proved too demanding, and Leavitt sold his stock and retired from the bookselling and publishing industry entirely, instead concentrating on his auction house,The Library & Art Collection of Henry de Pene Du Bois, of New York, George A.

Daniel Lysons, Samuel Lysons, London, 1813, p. 392 The Roman Catholic martyr, later sainted, Swithun Wells was a relation of the Perkins family; when interrogated in 1587, Wells stated that he had lived for three months at Ufton Court, then in possession of his nephew Francis Perkins; as a recusant, Perkins was fined the statutory ¬£20 a month for failing to attend the parish church, and had to rent Ufton to his cousin Thomas Perkins to pay the heavy fines. The house- which was raided by the authorities on at least two occasions- today retains signs of the family's secret adherence to their faith, including a chapel in the rafters, hiding places for priests, and an escape tunnel through woodland.A History of the Attwell Family 1200-1650, Bill Attwell, Lulu, 2014, p. 47 References English families People from Ufton Nervet English gentry families ","title":"Perkins family of Ufton"},{"id":"20649214","text":"U.S. Route 52 (US 52) is a north‚Äìsouth United States highway that runs for from the South Carolina state line, near McFarlan, to the Virginia state line, near Mount Airy. It serves as a strategic highway through the central North Carolina Piedmont. Because of its alignment in the state, US 52 does not follow the standard convention of an even U.S. route number going east‚Äìwest. Route description US 52 at the base of Pilot Mountain US 52 enters North Carolina at Mount Airy. A bypass around Mount Airy, which carries US 52 is designated as the Andy Griffith Parkway. It goes by Pilot Mountain one of the most distinctive natural features in North Carolina. Through the Piedmont Triad region, US 52 is mostly a limited-access freeway. The route joins Interstate 85 Business into Lexington, North Carolina and shares Interstate 85 around Salisbury, North Carolina. The segment of US 52 from Interstate 40 in Winston-Salem, North Carolina to Lexington is currently being upgraded to Interstate highway standards for the future Interstate 285 corridor. The segment from northern Winston-Salem to just south of Mount Airy is expected to form part of the Interstate 74 corridor through North Carolina. South of the Triad area after splitting from Interstate 85 in Salisbury, US 52 is typically a two-lane route linking some of the state's smaller cities and towns. Albemarle is the largest municipality along this segment of US 52 to the South Carolina state line. Between Salisbury and Albemarle in Northern Stanly county, US 52 bisects the campus of Pfeiffer University in Misenheimer. Misenheimer may be the only municipality in America whose only traffic light is not at an intersection of two or more streets, but at a crosswalk to accommodate pedestrian traffic (the crosswalk being across US 52 connecting the two parts of Pfeiffer's campus on opposite sides of the highway). =Andy Griffith Parkway= The Andy Griffith Parkway is an 11 mile (18 km) section of U.S. Route 52 in northern Surry County, North Carolina dedicated in honor of actor Andy Griffith. U.S. Route 52 through this stretch is a limited- controlled-access four-lane divided highway. Approximately of the 11 mile (18 km) section passes through the corporate limits of Griffith's hometown of Mount Airy, North Carolina. Background Due to its close proximity to Pilot Mountain State Park, in 1977 U.S. Route 52 through Surry County and Stokes County was dedicated as the Pilot Mountain Parkway by the North Carolina Department of Transportation. However, in March 2002, the North Carolina Department of Transportation was approached by a grassroots group of residents of Mount Airy that felt that a highway dedication for Griffith was long overdue. The group proposed to rename an 11 mile (18 km) section of the Pilot Mountain Parkway running from the Interstate 74 interchange north to the Virginia state line to the Andy Griffith Parkway.The Pilot Mountain Parkway designation would remain from the Interstate 74 intersection south through Stokes County. The group had the support of the dedication from several North Carolina state agency officials that included: Governor Mike Easley, State Treasurer Richard H. Moore and NCDOT Division 11 Board Member Sam Erby. Each of these officials played an integral role in expediting the renaming through the North Carolina Department of Transportation's Road and Bridge Naming Committee. The dedication also had the full support of Andy Griffith. The NCDOT Road and Bridge Naming Committee voted unanimously for the dedication at their July, 2002 meeting in Raleigh, North Carolina. Dedication ceremony A dedication ceremony was held on October 16, 2002 in the parking lot behind City Hall in Mount Airy. Andy Griffith accepted the invitation to attend the ceremony. It was Griffith‚Äôs first public appearance in his hometown in over 40 years. Also in attendance were: Griffith‚Äôs wife Cindi Griffith, Governor Mike Easley, former University of North Carolina President William C. Friday, Grandfather Mountain developer Hugh Morton, as well as many more State and local officials. More than 3000 Andy Griffith fans also attended to welcome Andy Griffith back to Mount Airy. =Dedicated and memorial names= US 52 features four additional dedicated stretches of highway. * George S. Coble Memorial Highway ‚Äì Official North Carolina name of US 52, from Old US 52 at the Davidson-Forsyth County line to US 29/70 south of Lexington. * John Gold Memorial Expressway ‚Äì Official North Carolina name of US 52 within the borders of Forsyth County. * J.D. Goins Memorial Highway ‚Äì Official North Carolina name of US 52, from Albemarle to NC 740. * Pilot Mountain Parkway ‚Äì Official North Carolina name of US 52, it originally went from King to the Virginia state line. In 2002, it was shortened to the I-74 interchange south of Mount Airy, for the Andy Griffith Parkway. History US 74, in Wadesboro US 52 was established in 1934 as a replacement of US 121/NC 66 from the Virginia state line, near Mount Airy, to Lexington and replacement of US 601/NC 80 from Lexington to the South Carolina state line, near McFarlan. In the mid-1930s, US 52 was placed on current routing between Rocky River- Norwood and Misenheimer-Gold Hill. In Wadesboro, US 52 was routed along Morgan-Washington-Martin Streets; while in Stokes County, US 52 was placed on new road between Pilot Mountain and King. In 1941, US 52 was removed from Salisbury Road and placed on its current routing, with US 29/70, south of Lexington. Between 1945-1949, US 52 was split in downtown Winston-Salem: northbound using the original Main Street route, southbound using Liberty Street and First Street. In 1949, US 52 was placed on a new bypass east of Pilot Mountain, leaving US 52A along the main street route. In 1952, US 52 was placed onto new northern bypass of Lexington, its old route through became part of US 29A/70A and NC 8\\\\. In 1953, US 52 was placed onto new western bypass of Mount Airy, its old route through became US 52A (today US 52 Business). In either 1956 or 1957, US 52 was placed on its current route through Wadesboro, via US 74; also around same time period, US 52 was removed from Old Fancy Gap Road near the Virginia state line. From 1960-1972, the next series of changes were in the Winston-Salem area; starting in 1960 with US 52 was removed from Main Street and onto Old Salem Road. In 1962, US 52 northbound was changed to Main Street, Fifth Street, and Liberty Street. By 1964, US 52 was placed onto new freeway from Winston-Salem, just south of East-West Expressway, to Pilot Mountain; this replaced the old route from Stanleyville to Pilot Mountain, becoming simply Old US 52\\\\. By 1973, US 52 was completed moved onto the completed North-South Expressway in Forsyth County, completely removing US 52 from all regular roads through the county. In 1971, US 52 was joined with I-85, from the Yadkin River to Salisbury, leaving the downtown area. In 1980, the freeway from Forsyth County extended into Davidson County at Midway. By 1982, New London was placed on a short bypass west of town. Between 1985-1987, US 52 was given its current Albemarle bypass routing; in October, 2010, the routing was rebuilt along its southern portion. Between 1991-1993, US 52 was extended further south onto new freeway from Midway to Welcome in north Davidson County; by 1995, the freeway connected with the Lexington bypass, completing US 52's move from rural road to freeway from Lexington to Mount Airy. Construction of replacement bridges over Liberty Street From 2010-2017, a series of road improvements have been made along US 52 in Winston-Salem, including replacement of bridges, interchanges and widening of lanes/shoulders. The initial change was a replacement of the Liberty Street bridges (built in 1964) over Liberty Street and the Norfolk Southern Railroad Switching Yard. The project included the permanent ramp closure of exit 111-B, on February 19, 2011; the entire project was completed on November 1, 2012. In 2012, exit 110-A to Third, Fourth, Fifth Street was permanently closed related to the widening of US 52 and extending new acceleration lanes to the neighboring interchanges. In 2013, construction began on the Salem Creek Connector (later becoming an extension of Research Parkway), at a cost of $68.9 million, it involved reconfiguring exit 108-B (replacing Vargrave Street with Research Parkway), the permanent closure of 108-C (Stadium Drive, later renamed Rams Drive), bridge replacements (including a truss flyover for Norfolk Southern) and the realignment of area roads. On January 6, 2014, exit 108-B was closed and Vargrave Street razed. On July 12, 2017, exit 108-B reopened to the public as Research Parkway, utilizing a diverging diamond interchange layout; exit 108-C to Rams Drive was then permanently closed, with bridge replacement to be completed in November. =U.S. Route 121= U.S. Route 121 (US 121) was an original US highway, established in 1926, and was completely overlapped with NC 66\\\\. Beginning north from Main Street (US 70/NC 10), in Lexington, it went through Welcome and Midway to Winston-Salem. Traversing through Winston-Salem on Waughtown Road and Main Street, it exits north along Patterson Avenue to Stanleyville. Continuing north through Rural Hall, King, and Pilot Mountain, it reached downtown Mount Airy, before continuing on north into Virginia, via Old Fancy Gap Road. By 1929, US 121 was rerouted south of Winston-Salem along Spur Street; its old alignment remained part of NC 77\\\\. In late 1934, both US 121 and NC 66 were replaced by US 52\\\\. Future Currently there are plans to widen US 52 between Wadesboro to NC 24/NC 27, in Albemarle, to four-lanes by around 2015 (STIP: R-2320). In the more distant future, US 52 between NC 65, in Winston-Salem, to I-74, near Mount Airy, is planned to be reconstructed to interstate-grade standards as part of I-74 (STIP: I-4404). Upgrades of US 52 to interstate grade, between I-85 and I-40/US 311 are estimated to cost $8.725 million. Property acquisition will start in June, 2012, with construction scheduled for May, 2013. Once completed, US 52 will be in concurrency with Interstate 285.

It is one of the organizations of the Ethiopian Defense Industry supporting the Ethiopian National Defense Force. History The complex was set up in 1987 as a heavy repair center for tanks and armored vehicles. The Derg regime had plans to eventually produce tanks, armored vehicles, aircraft missiles like air-to-air missiles and SCUD missiles at the complex. Operations The Ethiopian government is doing everything to transform the country's economy from its current dependency on rain fed agriculture. Although the country's economy is highly dependent on agriculture it is not farfetched to imagine an Ethiopian economy that is based on manufacturing and modern heavy industries like mining. While the mining Industry is still for most part in the preliminary stage of development the manufacturing sector is off to a good start. One among the few home grown manufacturing sectors is the huge Bishoftu Automotive Industry on the outskirts of Addis Ababa. I stopped by for a visit and to my surprise I found out the facility is manufacturing eight types of automotive and Defense Vehicles including Modern T-72 Tanks. Col. Gebremedhin Z/Selassie, GM of Bishoftu Automotive Industry, METEC, is a very young looking well- mannered and educated General Manager of this huge complex. He oversees the manufacturing of all products in the vast compound that employs over 3 thousands workers. The colonel confidently told me over 39% of the work force are women. In the few years of the operation of the facility he has managed he has transformed the company. Short of being a garage that repairs military vehicles and tanks it has now emerged to a well-managed production factory. The former government of Ethiopia established this facility to serve as garage and manufacturing of light armaments. The EPRDF government, credit to PM Meles, changed the facility to what it is today. The complex is structured in five departments as follows: * Tanks and armored vehicles manufacturing Rebuild of all tanks and armored vehicles used by Ethiopian forces. * Military Vehicles manufacturing Maintaining light and heavy trucks used by the Ethiopian ground forces. * Motor manufacturing and Mechanical workshop The department manufacturing engines and produces spare parts for tanks, armored vehicles and military trucks. * Medium and Heavy weapons manufacturing and electroplating section Repair and support of supply logistics by repairing and overhauling medium and heavy weapons. The electroplating shop is the largest both in its diversity and capacity in Ethiopia. * Communications Apparatus manufacturing and Maintenance Section Repair and maintain various communications apparatuses and electronic equipment in use with the Ethiopian forces. Other services In order to fully utilize its capacity and generate income, the center provides services to civilian customers through spare parts supply, electroplating services, and manufacturing machineries for various civilian industries.

(April 16, 2018) MAD Magazine BlogMad Magazine‚Äôs New Look Revealed at WonderCon 2018 (March 24, 2018) The FireWIre Blog In the planning stages the new publication was referred to as \\"EC‚Äôs Mad Mag\\" (\\"The title was my suggestion,\\" Al Feldstein once said) but was shorted by Kurtzman to just \\"Mad.\\" The phrase \\"Tales Calculated to Drive You\\" above the title Mad referenced radio's Suspense which often used the opening, \\"Tales well calculated to keep you in‚Ä¶ Suspense!\\" With wordplay on \\"jocular,\\" the vertical subtitle, \\"Humor in a Jugular Vein,\\" hinted at a sinister satirical edge.Stewart, Bhob. \\"Tuning in Mad,\\" Comic Book Marketplace no. 119, January 2005. Early artists thumb Written almost entirely by Harvey Kurtzman, the first issue also featured illustrations by Kurtzman himself, along with Wally Wood, Will Elder, Jack Davis and John Severin. Wood, Elder and Davis were the three main illustrators throughout the 23-issue run of the book; Severin, a mainstay of Kurtzman's EC war comics, left the comic book by the tenth issue. Kurtzman included his own finished art only sporadically, primarily on covers. However, he was known as an exceedingly \\"hands-on\\" editor and a visual master, and thus many Mad articles were illustrated in strict accordance with Kurtzman's detailed layouts.The Comics Journal Library: Harvey Kurtzman, Fantagraphics Publishing, 2006, A handful of other artists also contributed to the original run, including Bernard Krigstein, Russ Heath and most conspicuously among the non-regulars, Basil Wolverton.Cochran, Russ. Mad, volumes one, two, three and four. West Plains, MIssouri: Russ Cochran, Publisher, 1986. The first two issues of Mad spoofed only comic books and movie genres of romance, horror, sports and science fiction, without overtly specific references. However, with issue #3, Kurtzman turned to direct parodies, targeting two well-known radio programs with parodies of Dragnet and The Lone Ranger, and he soon began satirizing selected comic strips (\\"Little Orphan Melvin!\\"), comic books (\\"Superduperman!\\"), books (\\"Alice in Wonderland!\\"), films (\\"Hah! Noon!\\") and television programs (\\"Howdy Dooit!\\"). Expansion and evolution By mid-1953, William Gaines had made plans for expansion. After nine bi-monthly issues, Mad became a monthly with the April 1954 issue. At that same time, EC Comics launched another satirical bi- monthly, Panic, edited by Al Feldstein. Since this new title also used Kurtzman's core trio of artists (Davis, Elder, Wood), the peeved editor felt that Panic sapped and diminished the creative energy necessary to meet Mad's production schedule. In 1955, with issue 24, the comic book converted to a magazine format. According to popular myth, this was done to escape the strictures of the Comics Code Authority, which was imposed in 1955 following U.S. Senate hearings on juvenile delinquency. Actually, Kurtzman had received a lucrative offer from another publisher, and only stayed when Gaines agreed to upgrade Mad. In a 1983 interview with The Comics Journal, Gaines remembered: :\\"Harvey had come to me and said, ‚ÄúHow would you like to turn Mad into a slick magazine?‚Äù And I said I wouldn‚Äôt like to turn Mad into a slick magazine, I‚Äôm a comic publisher, I don‚Äôt know anything about slick magazines, it‚Äôs a whole different ballgame and I‚Äôm not interested‚Ä¶ And that was the end of it for six, eight, 10 months, until he was offered this job with Pageant‚Ä¶ as I recall, he was going to begin with a section of the book to do all by himself and also a good chunk of money, which was more than he was making with me. And I countered this by recalling that he had wanted to make Mad a slick. And I said, ‚ÄúHarvey, if you stay, I‚Äôll let you make Mad a slick. :And Harvey stayed, made Mad a slick, and didn‚Äôt even take as much money as he would have gotten at Pageant, because Harvey was never money-crazy. He could spend it like a maniac [laughter], but for himself, he was never demanding in that sense. So that‚Äôs how that happened.‚Äù In a 1992 interview, William Gaines related that Mad \\"was not changed [into a magazine] to avoid the Code\\" but \\"as a result of this [change of format] it did avoid the Code.\\" Gaines claimed that Kurtzman had at the time received \\"a very lucrative offer from...Pageant magazine,\\" and seeing as he, Kurtzman, \\"had, prior to that time, evinced an interest in changing Mad into a magazine,\\" Gaines, \\"not know[ing] anything about publishing magazines,\\" countered that offer by allowing Kurtzman to make the change. Gaines further stated that \\"if Harvey [Kurtzman] had not gotten that offer from Pageant, Mad probably would not have changed format.\\" In a 2016 interview with Gilbert Gottfried on his podcast, Al Jaffee remembered it slightly differently, stating that the original comic primarily focused on spoofing newspaper comics. By adopting the broader magazine format, they could lampoon and parody a wide variety of topics. The immediate practical result was that Mad acquired a broader range in both subject matter and presentation. Magazines had wider distribution than comic books, and a more adult readership.Ringgenberg, Steve. \\"William M. Gaines Interview II\\", 1991. However, the Comics Code Authority had proven fatal to most of Gaines's EC Comics line due to restrictions on title and content. Gaines suffered both financially and creatively from targeted industry censorship and the enmity of his fellow publishers. EC's national distributor, Leader News Co, was the nation's weakest and did not have the clout to withstand an undeclared industry boycott of EC product: the company's comics were frequently returned still in their original unopened bundles. These factors combined to drive all EC Comics from the stands, except for Mad, which was too profitable to ignore. The company's financial status grew shakier in 1956 when Leader News Co. declared bankruptcy, leaving EC over $100,000 in debt. Only the Gaines family's investment of capital and a fortuitous deal with the much stronger American News distributor kept Mad afloat. Al Feldstein's team After the bulk of EC's line was canceled in 1954‚Äì55, the company was completely reliant on the improving fortunes of Mad. In a creative showdown, Kurtzman insisted on a 51 percent share in the company or else he would quit.Go Antiques When Gaines rejected the demand, EC was without its dominant creative force, and Kurtzman was separated from the magazine that crystallized his talents. Al Feldstein returned to EC and oversaw Mad during its greatest heights of circulation. Taking over with issue #29 (September 1956), Feldstein set to work assembling a phalanx of humor writers and cartoonists. His first issue as editor coincided with the debut of Don Martin: crucial longtime contributors such as prolific writer Frank Jacobs and star caricaturist Mort Drucker quickly followed. Before the classic Mad staff was assembled, Feldstein also relied on celebrity guest contributions to attract attention and fill pages. Some of these pieces, attributed to Bob and Ray, were actually the work of their main writer Tom Koch, who would flourish in Mad for decades under his own byline. By the early 1960s, working with art director John Putnam and such notables as Antonio Prohias, Al Jaffee and Dave Berg well in hand, Feldstein had fully established the format that was to be a commercial success for decades. The Mad logo has remained largely unchanged since 1955, save for the decision to italicize the lettering beginning in 1997.http://i246.photobucket.com/albums/gg119/bugsnbeetles/MADlogoHist-2.jpg For many years, the mysterious letters \\"IND\\" appeared in small type within the logo, between the M and the A. Sometimes the Mad logo included cavorting centaurs within the lettering, one of whom would be pointing directly at the IND. Though some fans speculated about the secret meaning of the \\"M-IND\\" message, the truth was more prosaic: from 1957 on, the magazine was handled by Independent News Distribution.Jacobs, Frank. The Mad World of William M. Gaines, Lyle Stuart, 1972. Circulation peak Al Feldstein joined Mad in the same year that Time described it as a \\"short-lived satirical pulp\\". By the time he left 28 years later, the magazine was commonly cited as one of the three greatest publishing successes of the 1950s, along with Playboy and TV Guide. The magazine's circulation more than quadrupled during Feldstein's tenure, peaking at 2,132,655 in 1974, although it had declined to a third of this figure by the end of his time as editor.Slaubaugh, Mike. \\"Mad Magazine Circulation figures The highest-selling individual issue was #161 (September 1973), which sold over 2.4 million copies. Sales for the April 1974 issue depressed because of its cover illustrating a hand giving \\"the finger\\" gesture. Several newsstands refused to put the issue on stands and Mad offices had extra copies as a result.Michelle Nati, \\"12 More Of The Most Controversial Magazine Covers,\\" 'Oddee' website, May 21, 2014 For tax reasons, Gaines sold his company in the early 1960s to the Kinney Parking Company. Kinney was in the process of becoming a conglomerate, including acquiring National Periodicals (aka DC Comics) and Warner Bros. by the end of that decade. Though technically an employee for 30 years, the fiercely independent Gaines was named a Kinney board member, and was largely permitted to run Mad as he saw fit without corporate interference.Markstein, Don. Toonopedia: Mad By early 1978, Mad was obliged to include a UPC symbol on its covers. The magazine responded by devoting the entire front cover of issue #198 to a giant UPC bar code, saying they hoped it would \\"jam every computer in the country\\" for \\"forcing us to deface our covers with this yecchy UPC symbol from now on.\\" For more than two years, subsequent issues labeled the normal-sized symbol with a series of humorous captions, such as \\"Closeup of the gap in Alfred E. Neuman's teeth\\" or \\"Hair of man watching horror movie.\\" When Feldstein retired in 1984, he was replaced by the team of Nick Meglin and John Ficarra, who co-edited Mad for the next two decades. After Meglin retired in 2004, Ficarra continued to edit the magazine through 2017. In conjunction with the magazine's offices moving to Burbank, Bill Morrison assumed the editorship in 2018.  Later history  =1990s-2000s= Following Gaines' June 3, 1992 death, Mad became more ingrained within the Time Warner corporate structure, which did not share Gaines' idiosyncratic ideas about marketing Mad. Time Warner turned the magazine over to DC Comics' publishers Jenette Kahn and Paul Levitz, and DC Vice President Joe Orlando became the magazine's new associate publisher. Closely involved with DC licensing, Orlando had also been a staff artist with EC Comics in the 1950s, and a prolific contributor to Mad during the 1960s. Time Warner put a much stronger emphasis on Mad merchandising and licensing, including products for its chain of Warner Studio Stores. Orlando's Special Projects department at DC Comics hired Bhob Stewart to edit a new Mad Style Guide (1994), featuring artwork by Sergio Aragon√©s, Angelo Torres and George Woodbridge. Eventually, the magazine was obliged to abandon its longtime home at 485 Madison Avenue (printed as \\"MADison\\" Avenue in the masthead), and in the mid-1990s it moved into DC Comics' offices at the same time DC relocated to 1700 Broadway. Although Orlando retired from DC Comics in 1996, he continued to design cover layouts for Mad right up until the month of his death in 1998.Hinckley, David. \\"Diary of a Mad Man National Lampooner Joe Orlando Illustrated True Comic Genius,\\" New York Daily News, January 10, 1999. =2000s-2019= In 2001, the magazine broke its longstanding taboo and began running advertising. The outside revenue allowed for the introduction of color printing and improved paper stock. Some black-and-white material, however, remains in each issue.

It was directed by David Morrissey from a script by Tony Marchant and stars James Nesbitt as Joe Keyes, and Emily Bruni as Alice.  Plot  Joe Keys is a man who sees a young woman called Alice accosted by some men on a train one night. Alice looks to Joe for help but he ignores her predicament and gets off the train. A few days later, the police are seeking witnesses to a sexual assault against Alice. Joe unwillingly comes forward but, when giving evidence against the men in court, cannot bring himself to admit that he did nothing to save Alice.  Production  The film was commissioned by the BBC's director of serials Laura Mackie at the outline stage. Marchant did not want to extend the script to any more than two parts because he thought two was the right length. He previously worked with Morrissey and producer David Snodin on the 1997 television series Holding On.

Etymology  Frank R. Holmes, in his Directory of the Ancestral Heads of New England Families, 1600-1700, proposes two possible origins; the Gaelic , \\"instructor\\", or from the Saxon ed and ea, \\"backwards\\" and \\"water\\", a whirlpool or eddy, making the surname Eddy a place-name. Another possible origin is the Saxon root ead, \\"success\\" or \\"prosperity\\". Ead occurs in numerous commonly used names, as Edgar, Edmund, Edward, Edwin, and the outdated Edwy. John Eddy of Taunton spells the name Eddway in the earliest record so far found. Eddy could also be a diminutive of any one of these names. Robert Ferguson, in his work on English Surnames, believes that Eddy is a place-name: ‚ÄúEday, Eady, Eddy are from ead, prosperity. Hence the name of the rock Eddiston, on which the celebrated light house is built. From this word are compounded a great number of Anglo-Saxon names of which we have Edward, Edmund, Edgar, Edw Edwin.‚Äù  Early history  One of the first mentions that is close to the form of Eddy, is the name of the priest Eddi or Edde, Latinized into Eddius. He went to Northumbria from Canterbury with Bishop Wilfrid (or Wilfrith) in 669, and later took the name Stephanus. He taught the Roman method of chanting, and in 709 he was in the monastery of Ripon, where he wrote a life of Wilfrid in Latin. In the Domesday Book, the name Eddeu is used in a description of Little Abington, Cambridgeshire, and during the time of Edward the First there were a number of people named Ede, Edde, and Edwy on the tax collection rolls of Worcestershire. There is a record in Hertfordshire, of a William Edy, Gentleman, in 1486. Edie, Eddy, Eddye, Edshune and Edye are found in numerous records in Gloucestershire from 1545 onward. At Woodbridge, Suffolk, Eyde is found as a surname between 1599 and 1610. Starting from 1570 in the records of many parishes of the Archdeaconry Court of Cornwall, the following surnames are found: Edy, Eady, Eedy, Ede, Edye, Eddey, and Eddy. In Bristol, the town where William Eddye, the Vicar, was born, a number of wills from the late 16th century have the surname of Eddie, Eddye or Eddy. Ade, Adie, Addy, Eadie are common Scottish surnames. These may be forms of the name ‚ÄúAdam‚Äù. David Eadie of Moneaght, Scotland, was granted a coat of arms in 1672.  The surname in North America  In North America, the largest family group who bears the Eddy surname are descended from two brothers, John and Samuel, who immigrated to America on October 29, 1630 on a ship called Handmaid. Their father, William Eddye, was the Vicar of the church in Cranbrook, England, from 1586‚Äì1616 and was born in Bristol in the mid-16th century. Other Northern American \\"patriarchs\\" are John Eddy who lived in Taunton, Massachusetts in the late 17th century; John Eddy of Woodbridge, New Jersey, (Scottish) who immigrated in the early 18th century; James Eddy, born in Dublin, Ireland, around 1712, and immigrated in 1753; Thomas Eddy, immigrated in the late 18th century to Fort Ann, New York, from Ireland; brothers William and John Eddy, immigrated from Ireland to New York city in the mid 19th century; and William Dave Eddy, who came to the United States from Cornwall, England, in 1887.

The designation LE stood for \\"little engine\\". Used by over fifty British Police forces, the police riders became known as \\"Noddies\\" because they were required to nod to senior officers, and the LE was nicknamed \\"the Noddy Bike\\". Production ended in 1970 when the company ran into financial problems and went into voluntary liquidation. The Mk I LE Velocette's Director, Eugene Goodman, planned an innovative and radical design that would appeal to a new market that needed cheap, clean and reliable transport. Designer Charles Udall developed the Velocette LE as a \\"conceived-as-a-whole\\" design, with engine, gearbox, drive shaft and bevel box in a single unit to do a specific job. The Velocette LE was launched at the British International Motor Show at Earls Court in 1948 as the \\"Motorcycle for Everyman\\". With a 149 cc four-stroke, side-valve, water-cooled, horizontally opposed twin-cylinder engine, the LE also had a radiator and was fitted with coil ignition to help starting. The hand change three-speed gearbox, engine and clutch were contained in special castings, and final drive was by a shaft mounted in a swing frame with adjustable suspension. Aluminium leg shields were designed to keep the rain off, and footboards gave it a scooter feel. The only instrument was a speedometer. To reduce noise and vibration the pressed aluminium frame was lined with soundproofing felt. The water-cooled engine was well silenced, and riders reported that sometimes they only knew the engine was running by checking the ignition light. Carrying capacity was boosted by quickly detachable panniers and a glove compartment in front of the petrol tank. All this made the MkI LE expensive, however, at ¬£126 compared with the BSA Bantam at ¬£76. The odd looks also meant that it did not appeal to the usual motorcycle buyer. Mk II LE 1955 Mk II Launched in 1951 the Mk II had a engine, giving an extra , and strengthened bearings. Sales remained poor, however, and the company had to reduce the price. The clutch was upgraded, and an Amal 363 monobloc carburetor replaced the standard unit. The rear swinging arm was uprated with cast aluminium to improve rigidity, and the brakes were improved. The petrol tank capacity was also increased from . A breakthrough for Velocette was when over fifty British Police forces decided to use the LE for patrols and ordered more than half the production. Ex-police machines can be identified by the after market fittings for the police radio. These include the manufacturers data plate being moved to the headstock, the word 'POLICE' stamped under the generator cover and a distinctive V shaped pressing riveted in front of the seat. This was designed to keep rainwater out of the battery compartment. The Noddy name Metropolitan Police Officers of the time were trained to salute an Inspector or above, but when riding the Velocette LE this meant taking one hand from the handle bars, so it was agreed that instead they could nod to show respect. The police riders therefore became known as \\"Noddies\\", and the LE was nicknamed \\"the Noddy Bike\\"; this nickname does not appear to have had anything to do with Enid Blyton's eponymous character.\\"noddy, n.4\\".

With ten years' development, the Velocette LE was more reliable and practical, but on 3 February 1971, the company went into voluntary liquidation. The very last motorcycles made in the Veloce factory were LEs. Production of other motorcycles had been delayed or cancelled to produce the LE in various forms, and the lucrative police orders had dried up with the introduction of the \\"panda car\\" for patrol use by most forces.

Founded by Neville Smith, the railway opened in 1989 on the Ford and Etal estate. It operates over a route from Heatherslaw to Etal Village, a return trip of . The railway operates an hourly service with steam trains (subject to availability) from March to October and diesel trains in February half-term. Steam hauled Santa Specials run on selected weekends in December. The passenger coaches include facilities for transporting wheelchairs and buggies, and a typical summer season eight-coach train can convey up to 90 passengers.  Motive power  The railway's first locomotive from its opening was a steam engine named \\"The Lady Augusta\\". Lady Augusta was built nominally built by the Ravenglass & Eskdale Railway but was subcontracted to Kirklees Light Railway and entered service in 1989. Lady Augusta became the spare loco when Bunty (see below) arrived. Although it is expected that Lady Augusta would leave the railway at the end of 2015 she was retained for occasional use and to cover periods of maintenance on Bunty. The second locomotive was a diesel hydraulic locomotive named \\"Clive\\" is used for works train. This was built on site at Heatherslaw by Neville Smith and Sid Ford and was rebuilt in 2018 with a partial rebody. In 2010, a third locomotive partially built by Neville Smith and completed by Alan Keef. The loco has been named \\"Bunty\\", Neville's nickname for his wife, Bernice. A new build diesel locomotive 'Binky' was built in house during 2015 becoming the railway's fourth locomotive and entered service at the start of 2016, Bunty will remain the main locomotive hauling passenger trains. Binky is used for February half-term trains and as the 'Thunderbird' loco.  Stations  The station at Heatherslaw features an overall roof covering one concrete- slabbed platform; turntable, a third line serves as a locomotive release road for engines to run round trains; there are also storage sidings and sheds, as well as a ticket office and shop. The station at Etal Castle has a simple terminal run round loop and a turntable. The provision of turntables at both ends of the line allows for the locos to always run facing forwards whilst on passenger trains.

The use of a line operates on principles which are distinct from and not necessarily coincident with grammatical structures, such as the sentence or single clauses in sentences. Although the word for a single poetic line is verse, that term now tends to be used to signify poetic form more generally.http://www.poetryarchive.org/glossary/line A line break is the termination of the line of a poem and the beginning of a new line. The process of arranging words using lines and line breaks is known as lineation, and is one of poetry's defining features. A distinct numbered group of lines in verse is normally called a stanza. A title, in some poems, is considered a line. General Conventions in Western poetry Conventions that determine what might constitute line in poetry depend upon different constraints, aural characteristics or scripting conventions for any given language. On the whole, where relevant, a line is generally determined either by units of rhythm or repeating aural patterns in recitation that can also be marked by other features such as rhyme or alliteration, or by patterns of syllable-count.See, for example, the account in Geoffrey N Leech A Linguistic Guide to English Poetry, Longman, 1969. Section 7.3 \\"Metre and the Line of Verse\\", pp.111-19 in the 1991 edition. In Western literary traditions, use of line is arguably the principal feature which distinguishes poetry from prose. Even in poems where formal metre or rhyme is weakly observed or absent, the convention of line continues on the whole to be observed, at least in written representations, although there are exceptions (see Degrees of license). In such writing, simple visual appearance on a page (or any other written layout) remains sufficient to determine poetic line, and this sometimes leads to the suggestion that the work in question is no longer a poem but \\"chopped up prose\\".See for an example. A dropped line is a line broken into two parts, with the second indented to remain visually sequential. In the standard conventions of Western literature, the line break is usually but not always at the left margin. Line breaks may occur mid-clause, creating enjambment, a term that literally means 'to straddle'. Enjambment \\"tend[s] to increase the pace of the poem\\", whereas end-stopped lines, which are lines that break on caesuras (thought-pauses'Classroom synonym'.com often represented by ellipsis), emphasize these silences and slow the poem down. Line breaks may also serve to signal a change of movement or to suppress or highlight certain internal features of the poem, such as a rhyme or slant rhyme. Line breaks can be a source of dynamism, providing a method by which poetic forms imbue their contents with intensities and corollary meanings that would not have been possible to the same degree in other forms of text. Distinct forms of line, as defined in various verse traditions, are usually categorised according to different rhythmical, aural or visual patterns and metrical length appropriate to the language in question. (See Metre.) One visual convention that is optionally used to convey a traditional use of line in printed settings is capitalisation of the first letter of the first word of each line regardless of other punctuation in the sentence, but it is not necessary to adhere to this. Other formally patterning elements, such as end-rhyme, may also strongly indicate how lines occur in verse. In the speaking of verse, a line ending may be pronounced using a momentary pause, especially when its metrical composition is end-stopped, or it may be elided such that the utterance can flow seamlessly over the line break in what can be called run-on. Degrees of license In more \\"free\\" forms, and in free verse in particular, conventions for the use of line become, arguably, more arbitrary and more visually determined such that they may only be properly apparent in typographical representation and/or page layout. One extreme deviation from a conventional rule for line can occur in concrete poetry where the primacy of the visual component may over-ride or subsume poetic line in the generally regarded sense, or sound poems in which the aural component stretches the concept of line beyond any purely semantic coherence. At another extreme, the prose poem simply eschews poetic line altogether. Examples of line breaks The line break within 'must/n't' allows a double reading of the word as both 'must' and 'mustn't', whereby the reader is made aware that old age both enjoins and forbids the activities of youth. At the same time, the line break subverts 'mustn't': the forbidding of a certain activity‚Äîin the poem's context, the moral control the old try to enforce upon the young‚Äîonly serves to make that activity more enticing. While Cummings's line breaks are used in a poetic form that is intended to be appreciated through a visual, printed medium, line breaks are also present in poems predating the advent of printing. =Shakespeare= Examples are to be found, for instance, in Shakespeare's sonnets. Here are two examples of this technique operating in different ways in Shakespeare's Cymbeline: In the first example, the line break between the last two lines cuts them apart, emphasizing the cutting off of the head: In the second example, the text before the line break retains a meaning in isolation from the contents of the new line. This meaning is encountered by the reader before it being modified by the text after the line break, which clarifies that, instead of \\"I, as a person, as a mind, am 'absolute,'\\" it 'really' means: \\"I am absolutely sure it was Cloten\\": Metre In every type of literature there is a metrical pattern that can be described as \\"basic\\" or even \\"national\\". The most famous and widely used line of verse in English prosody is the iambic pentameter,Metre, prosody at Encyclopedia Britannica while one of the most common of traditional lines in surviving classical Latin and Greek prosody was the hexameter.Hexameter, poetry at Encyclopaedia Britannica. In modern Greek poetry hexameter was replaced by line of fifteen syllables. In French poetry alexandrineAlexandrine, prosody at Encyclopaedia Britannica is the most typical pattern. In Italian literature the hendecasyllable,Claudio Ciociola, Endecasillabo at Encyclopedia italiana. which is a metre of eleven syllables, is the most common line. In Serbian ten syllable lines were used in long epic poems. In Polish poetry two types of line were very popular, an 11-syllable one, based on Italian verse and 13-syllable one, based both on Latin verse and French alexandrine. Classical Sanskrit poetry, such as the Ramayana and Mahabharata, was most famously composed using the shloka. * English iambic pentameter: :Like to Ahasuerus, that shrewd prince, :I will begin ‚Äî as is, these seven years now, :My daily wont ‚Äî and read a History :(Written by one whose deft right hand was dust :To the last digit, ages ere my birth) :Of all my predecessors, Popes of Rome: :For though mine ancient early dropped the pen, :Yet others picked it up and wrote it dry, :Since of the making books there is no end. ::(Robert Browning, The Ring and the Book 10, Book The Pope, lines 1-9) * Latin hexameter: :Arma virumque can≈ç, Tr≈çiae quƒ´ prƒ´mus ab orƒ´s :ƒ™taliam, fƒÅt≈ç profugus, LƒÅvƒ´niaque vƒìnit :lƒ´tora, multum ille et terrƒ´s iactƒÅtus et alt≈ç :vƒ´ superum saevae memorem I≈´n≈çnis ob ƒ´ram; :multa quoque et bell≈ç pass≈´s, dum conderet urbem, :inferretque de≈çs Lati≈ç, genus unde Latƒ´num, :AlbƒÅnƒ´que patrƒìs, atque altae moenia R≈çmae. ::(Virgil, Aeneid, Book I, lines 1-7) * French alexandrine: :Comme je descendais des Fleuves impassibles, :Je ne me sentis plus guid√© par les haleurs : :Des Peaux-Rouges criards les avaient pris pour cibles, :Les ayant clou√©s nus aux poteaux de couleurs. ::(Arthur Rimbaud, Le bateau ivre, lines 1-4) * Italian hendecasyllable: :Per me si va ne la citt√† dolente, :per me si va ne l'etterno dolore, :per me si va tra la perduta gente. :Giustizia mosse il mio alto fattore; :fecemi la divina podestate, :la somma sap√Øenza e ‚Äôl primo amore. ::(Dante Alighieri, Divina commedia, Inferno, Canto III, lines 1-6) Pioneers of the freer use of line in Western culture include Whitman and Apollinaire. Characteristics Where the lines are broken in relation to the ideas in the poem it affects the feeling of reading the poetry. For example, the feeling may be jagged or startling versus soothing and natural, which can be used to reinforce or contrast the ideas in the poem. Lines are often broken between words, but there is certainly a great deal of poetry where at least some of the lines are broken in the middles of words: this can be a device for achieving inventive rhyme schemes. In general, line breaks divide the poetry into smaller units called lines, (this is a modernisation of the term verse) which are often interpreted in terms of their self-contained meanings and aesthetic values: hence the term \\"good line\\". Line breaks, indentations, and the lengths of individual words determine the visual shape of the poetry on the page, which is a common aspect of poetry but never the sole purpose of a line break. A dropped line is a line broken into two parts, in which the second part is indented to remain visually sequential through spacing. In metric poetry, the places where the lines are broken are determined by the decision to have the lines composed from specific numbers of syllables. Prose poetry is poetry without line breaks in accordance to paragraph structure as opposed to stanza. Enjambment is a line break in the middle of a sentence, phrase or clause, or one that offers internal (sub)text or rhythmically jars for added emphasis. Alternation between enjambment and end-stopped lines is characteristic of some complex and well composed poetry, such as in Milton's Paradise Lost. A new line can begin with a lowercase or capital letter. New lines beginning with lowercase letters vaguely correspond with the shift from earlier to later poetry: for example, the poet John Ashbery usually begins his lines with capital letters prior to his 1991 book-length poem \\"Flow-Chart\\", whereas in and after \\"Flow-Chart\\" he almost invariably begins lines with lowercase letters unless the beginning of the line is also the beginning of a new sentence. There is, however, some much earlier poetry where new lines begin with lowercase letters. Beginning a line with an uppercase letter when the beginning of the line does not coincide with the beginning of a new sentence is referred to by some as \\"majusculation\\". (this is an invented term derived from majuscule). The correct term is a coroneted verse. In T.S. Eliot's The Waste Land, where ambiguity abounds, a line break in the opening (ll. 5‚Äì7) starts things off. Because the lines start with capitalized letters, Eliot could be saying \\"Earth\\" as the planet or \\"earth\\" as the soil.

It is a Grade II* listed building. The manor of Whitwell was purchased in the 16th century by Sir John Manners of Haddon Hall ( second son of Thomas Manners, 1st Earl of Rutland). He was High Sheriff of Derbyshire in 1585 and rebuilt the old manor house. The garden front of two storeys has seven irregular bays and three gables. Although extended and altered in later centuries the house retains much of its 17th-century appearance. Sir Roger Manners (High Sheriff in 1618) died about 1650 although the house remained in the ownership of the Manners family of Haddon ( who in the 18th century inherited the Rutland Earldom) until 1813 when it was sold by exchange to the Duke of Portland. In the 19th century the house served as the local National School.

Fold-ins Every issue but two of Mad from 1964 to the present has featured a Fold-in, designed by artist Al Jaffee. They usually appear on the inside back cover, though one issue featured a Fold-in front cover and the year-end \\"Mad 20\\" issues move the feature to an interior page. In each Fold-in question is asked, often of a topical nature. The subject is illustrated by a picture taking up the bulk of the page, with a block of text underneath. When the page is folded inward, the inner and outer fourths of the picture combine to reveal an alternate answer in both picture and words. Jaffee's precise layouts sometimes include false visual cues designed to trick the reader's eye towards an incorrect solution. \\"The Lighter Side of‚Ä¶\\" '''' From 1961 to 2002, Dave Berg produced \\"The Lighter Side of‚Ä¶\\", which often satirized the suburban lifestyle, capitalism and the generation gap. Subjects commonly lampooned include medicine, office life, parties, marriage, psychiatry, shopping, school and other everyday activities. Although this feature eventually became notorious for its corny gags and garishly outdated fashion choices, the Mad editors reported that it was the magazine's most popular feature. \\"The Lighter Side\\" was more pointed in its early years, providing the sort of Americana-based humor that standups such as Shelley Berman and Alan King performed successfully onstage. The feature was retired with Berg's death. Four months after the last Berg artwork was published, his final set of gags, which Berg had written but not penciled, appeared as a tribute. These last \\"Lighter Side\\" strips were divided among 18 of the magazine's regular artists, including Jack Davis' last original work for Mad. In 2007, an occasional feature called \\"The Darker Side of the Lighter Side\\" debuted. These consist of reprinted Berg strips, with rewritten word balloons that change the gags to references about disease, sex offenders, corpse disposal and other unsavory, un-Berg-like topics. \\"Spy vs. Spy\\" Antonio Proh√≠as's wordless \\"Spy vs. Spy,\\" the never-ending battle between the iconic Black Spy and White Spy, ended up outlasting the Cold War that inspired it. Except for the respective black/white color of their clothing, the two spies were identical in appearance and intent. The strip was a silent parable about the futility of mutually-assured destruction, with various elaborate deathtraps designed in Proh√≠as' thick line. Typically, the trap would boomerang back on whichever spy had concocted it. There was no pattern or order dictating which spy would be killed in a particular episode. A female \\"Grey Spy\\" occasionally appeared; unlike her two adversaries, she always prevailed. Although Proh√≠as retired from doing the strip in the late 1980s, \\"Spy vs. Spy\\" continued in a series of different hands until 1997, when Peter Kuper took over as the full-time writer-artist. However, the original Morse Code byline \\"by Prohias\\" remains in each strip's title. Don Martin gags Don Martin, billed as \\"Mad's Maddest Artist\\", drew gag cartoons, generally one page but sometimes longer, featuring lumpen characters with apparently hinged feet. Martin's absurd sight gags were frequently punctuated by an array of onomatopoeic sound effects such as \\"GLORK\\" or \\"PATWANG-FWEEE\\", coined by Martin himself (or by frequent ghost writer Don Edwing).Martin, Don. The Completely Mad Don Martin, Running Press, 2007. Martin's wild physical comedy would eventually make him the signature artist of the magazine. When Martin first joined Mad, he employed a nervous, scratchy art style, but this developed into a rounder, more cartoony look. Many of his cartoons used similar titles (e.g., \\"One Exceedingly Fine Day at the Beach\\"), and these titles became increasingly elaborate (e.g., \\"One Night in the Acme Ritz Central Arms Waldorf Plaza Statler Hilton Grand Hotel\\", \\"One Hot Sunny Afternoon in the Middle of the Ocean\\", or \\"One Fine Day at the Corner of South Finster Boulevard and Fonebone Street\\"). Martin's 31-year association with Mad ended in some rancor over the ownership of his original artwork. Not long after leaving Mad, Martin ended up working at Mad's competitor Cracked, which, unlike Mad, allowed creators to keep their pages. In 1994, Martin left Cracked and published a handful of issues of his own self-titled publication.Chisholm Trail Bookstore (Duncan, Oklahoma) \\"A Mad Look at‚Ä¶\\" and \\"Drawn-Out Dramas\\" Sergio Aragon√©s has written and drawn his \\"A Mad Look At‚Ä¶\\" feature for 49 years. Each is a series of gag strips with a common theme. Aragon√©s' Mad cartooning is notable for almost never using word balloons; when they occur at all, they will most often feature a drawing of whatever is being discussed. Aragon√©s will periodically bend this rule for a store window sign, a stray \\"Gesundheit\\", or some other dialogue vital to the punchline. Aragon√©s also provides the \\"Mad Marginals\\" or \\"Drawn-out Dramas\\", which are small gag images that appear throughout the magazine in its corners, margins or the narrow spaces between panels. Aragon√©s debuted the feature in Mad #76 (January 1963), and it has appeared in every issue of the magazine since, except for Mad #111. According to Aragon√©s, his work for that issue was lost in the mail.Evanier, Mark. News from ME, March 17, 2007. Movie and TV show parodies A typical issue will include at least one full parody of a popular movie or television show. The titles are changed to create a play on words; for instance, The Addams Family became The Adnauseum Family. The character names are generally switched in the same fashion. These articles run for several pages, and are presented as a sequential storyline with caricatures and word balloons. The opening page or two-page splash usually consists of the cast of the show introducing themselves directly to the reader. In some parodies, the writers sometimes attempt to circumvent this convention by presenting the characters without such direct exposition. Many parodies end with the abrupt deus ex machina appearance of outside characters or pop culture figures who are thematically tied into the nature to the movie or TV series being parodied, or who comment satirically on the theme. For example, Dr. Phil arrives to counsel the psychologically damaged Desperate Housewives; in another spoof, the former cast of Sex and the City are hired as the new hookers for another HBO series, Deadwood. The parodies frequently make comedic use of the fourth wall, breaking character, and meta-references. Within an ostensibly self-contained storyline, the characters may refer to the technical aspects of filmmaking, the publicity, hype or box office surrounding their project, their own past roles or real-life circumstances, and critical analysis of clich√©s. In the final panel of \\"The $ound of Money\\", the magazine's 1966 parody of The Sound of Music, Julie Andrews sings a parody of the song \\"Climb Ev'ry Mountain\\". The rewritten lyrics reference both the producers' decision to create scarcity and maximize box office profits by running the film in just one theater per city at inflated ticket prices (\\"Charge high admissions; / Let people wait; / That will make them think they're / Seeing something great!\\"), as well as Warner Brothers' decision to replace Andrews with Audrey Hepburn in its movie adaptation of My Fair Lady. Andrews had been a great success as Eliza Doolittle in the original Broadway production, but she was passed over for the film role. Despite the high- profile snub, Andrews made an Oscar-winning debut in Mary Poppins ‚Äì released four months before My Fair Lady ‚Äì and solidifying her big screen success with The Sound of Music. Concluding the Mad parody, Andrews gleefully sings: :\\"With all these profits, :Things will be fine! :When we top \\"Fair Lady\\", :Ven- geance... will... be... mine!\\" Several show business stars have been quoted to the effect that the moment when they knew they'd finally \\"made it\\" was when they saw themselves thus depicted in the pages of Mad. Many celebrities parodied by the magazine have posed for photographs which were printed in Mad's letters column, generally holding the copy of the magazine they appeared in, and frequently, reacting in some comical way. After the magazine depicted the main cast of L.A. Law on a 1987 cover, the actors responded with a photo in which the actors mimicked their caricatured poses and placement, with series creator Steven Bochco blacking out a tooth and taking the place of Alfred E. Neuman.http://www.bleedingcool.com/wp- content/uploads/2011/06/mega_watermark_ugc1213191.jpg Guns N' Roses guitarist Slash told Mojo, \\"The magazine cover that has meant the most to me was probably when I appeared in Mad Magazine, as a caricature of Alfred E. Neuman (#330, 1994). That was when I felt that I'd arrived.\\"Mojo, June 2008, pg. 58. Film critic Roger Ebert said that being parodied by Mad was \\"the ultimate honor.\\"http://www.suntimes.com/news/metro/17320958-418/roger-ebert-dies- at-70-after-battle-with-cancer.html In an appearance on The Tonight Show, Michael J. Fox told Johnny Carson that he knew he had made it in show business \\"when Mort Drucker drew my head.\\" Howard Stern has often talked about what the magazine meant to him, as in January 2009 when he said, \\"My greatest career highlight was being on the cover of Mad Magazine.\\"Howard Stern broadcast on Sirius Radio, 1-20-09 He revisited the topic in October 2013, saying, \\"It really was the pinnacle of success for me, that I could be on the cover of MAD Magazine, with Alfred E. Neuman plunging my head into a toilet bowl. I was just so thrilled and happy... I couldn't believe it.\\"Howard Stern Show broadcast on Sirius, October 22, 2013 Monroe Monroe was an ongoing storyline about an angst-filled teenaged loser. It depicted the title character's travails in school, his dysfunctional home and his relentless troubles elsewhere. Written by Anthony Barbieri, it was illustrated by Bill Wray from 1997 to 2006. The previously black-and-white feature was colorized in 2005, and went on hiatus for much of 2006. When it returned, it was drawn by Tom Fowler with Barbieri remaining the writer. It last appeared in January 2010. Irregular recurring features Several Mad premises have been successful enough to warrant additional installments, though not with the regularity of the above. These include: * The Mad Academy Awards for  ‚Äì typically written by Stan Hart, these would mimic the Oscar telecast by showing nominated \\"performance clips\\" in non-film areas of life (such as parenting or small business ownership). * Advertising parodies ‚Äì too numerous to catalog, though many have been written by Dick DeBartolo; these have ranged from TV ad spoofs to national print campaigns to home marketing and have long provided one of the most durable sources of the magazine's humor. A separate paperback of original material titled Madvertising was published in 1972, and an extensive reprint collection appeared with the same title in 2005. * Alfred's Poor Almanac ‚Äì written by Frank Jacobs, this text-heavy page featured quick one-liners, puns, faux anniversaries and other arcana, supposedly matched to each day of that month. * Badly-Needed Warning Labels for Rock Albums ‚Äì written by Desmond Devlin, this series of articles mocked both the ongoing Parental Advisory labelling controversy, as well as the musicians of the day, with specifically written warning labels for particular recordings. * Behind the Scenes at  ‚Äì written and illustrated by various, these frequently take a bird's eye view of a scene, such as a television studio or office. Various vignettes and conversations play out simultaneously, showing the reader how the participants \\"really\\" think and behave. * Believe It Or Nuts! ‚Äì written and illustrated by various (though most often drawn by Wally Wood or Bob Clarke), this parody of the print version of Ripley's Believe It Or Not! depicted alleged marvels and mundanities of the world. In the late 1950s, Mad also published regular installments of \\"Kovacs' Strangely Believe It!\\", another Ripley's parody written by Ernie Kovacs. * Celebrity Cause-of- Death Betting Odds ‚Äì written by Mike Snider, this long-running feature listed and \\"ranked\\" possible methods of future death for one well-known person at a time. It usually contained a tombstone with a caricature of the celebrity (usually drawn by Hermann Mejia). A shorter version later ran in the \\"Fundalini\\" section, illustrated by Rick Tulka. * Celebrity Wallets ‚Äì usually written by Arnie Kogen, this was a series of peeks at the notes, photographs and other memorabilia being carried around in the pockets of the famous. * Cents-less Coupons ‚Äì written by Scott Maiko, these imitate the giveaway coupon packets found in Sunday newspapers but promote ludicrous products such as \\"Inbred Valley Imitation Squirrel Meat\\". * Chilling Thoughts ‚Äì written by Desmond Devlin and illustrated by Rick Tulka or Evan Dorkin, these feature observations or predictions about both the culture and everyday life that have supposedly dire implications. * A Day in the Life of... ‚Äì written by Scott Maiko, these articles depict the purported hour-by-hour activities of a particular celebrity, such as George Lucas, Dick Cheney, Adam Sandler, or Dane Cook. * Mad Deconstructs Talk Shows ‚Äì written by Desmond Devlin, these take on one show at a time and purport to reveal the minute-by-minute format breakdown of America's not too spontaneous chat programs. * Do-It-Yourself Newspaper Story ‚Äì written by Frank Jacobs, these are short text news items containing a number of blank spaces. Each space has a corresponding list of numbered fill- in-the-blank options, which grow increasingly absurd. The premise is that with appropriate mixing and matching, the article can be read in a vast number of permutations. The same format has also been applied by Jacobs to other areas as poetry, press releases, or speechmaking. * Duke Bissell's Tales of Undisputed Interest ‚Äì written and illustrated by P.C. Vey, these absurdist one-page strips presented a series of non sequiturs and bizarre references in the guise of a linear storyline. * 15 Minutes of Fame ‚Äì written by Frank Jacobs, it consists of short poems about lesser celebrities and news figures. * The 50 Worst Things About  ‚Äì written and illustrated by various, this is an annual article format which has thus far dealt with large catch-all topics such as \\"TV,\\" \\"comedy,\\" \\"cartoons\\", \\"food\\" or \\"sports.\\" * The Mad Guide to Man Boobs ‚Äì written by Ryan Pagelow and illustrated by Drew Friedman, these one- page articles depict an assortment of topless men whose breasts are uniquely misshapen or unsightly, with an official descriptive name given to each configuration, such as \\"Stalacteats\\" or \\"Belt Sniffers.\\" * The Mad Hate File ‚Äì written and illustrated by Al Jaffee, these contained a series of observational one-liners about common irritations. * Hawks & Doves ‚Äì written and illustrated by Al Jaffee during the Vietnam War era, this was a series of cartoons in which the autocratic Major Hawks is exasperated by the rebellious Private Doves, who keeps finding unexpected ways to create the peace symbol on his military base. * Horrifying Clich√©s ‚Äì illustrated by Paul Coker Jr. and often written by Phil Hahn, these articles visually depicted florid turns of phraseology such as \\"tripping the light fantastic\\", \\"racking one's thoughts\\" or \\"laboring under a misconception\\"; the verbs are taken literally, and all the nouns are characterized as bizarre horned, scaled or otherwise unusual creatures; Mad also published a separate paperback of these. * The Mad Library of Extremely Thin Books ‚Äì written by Frank Jacobs, these two-page articles were laid out to look like a bookshelf in which only the spines of the books were visible. The various titles would suggest books that could not possibly contain much content, such as \\"Making It On Your Own\\" by Nancy Sinatra, \\"Wonderful Things That a Nickel Will Still Buy\\", \\"Out-Spoken Feminists in the Arab World\\", or \\"Prominent Black Yachtsmen\\". * Mads  of the Year ‚Äì written and illustrated by various, these four-to-six-page articles would enact an interview with a fictional representative of a particular practice or element of society (i.e. \\"MAD's Summer Camp Owner of the Year\\"; \\"MAD's Movie Producer of the Year\\"). * Melvin and Jenkins' Guide to _ ‚Äì written by Desmond Devlin and illustrated by Kevin Pope, these \\"guides\\" present the behavioral or attitudinal \\"do's and don'ts\\" on a variety of topics, as demonstrated by the titular pair (Jenkins doing the proper thing, while Melvin does not). An abbreviated version runs in the \\"Fundalini\\" section. * Movie Outtakes ‚Äì these are screen captures of upcoming films (generally taken from the movie trailer), given new word balloons; MAD typically times these pieces to coincide with the movie's general release, either in advance of the full parody or in lieu of it. * The Mad Nasty File ‚Äì typically written by Tom Koch and illustrated by Harry North or Gerry Gersten, these insult articles caricatured a variety of public figures and proceeded to abuse them verbally. * Obituaries for  Characters ‚Äì generally written by Frank Jacobs, these alleged newspaper clippings detail the appropriate demises for fictional characters from a genre such as comic strips, advertising, or television. * People Watcher's Guide to  ‚Äì often written by Mike Snider and illustrated by Tom Bunk, these articles used a scenario such as \\"the mall\\" or \\"a cemetery\\" to mock specific observed behaviors. * Planet Tad!!!!! ‚Äì written by Tim Carvell and illustrated by Brian Durniak, this purports to be the LiveJournal- like webpage of teenaged loser Tad's blog, which inadvertently reveals his various personal traumas and general idiocy. * Pop-Off Videos ‚Äì written by Desmond Devlin and illustrated with music video screen captures, these one- page articles mimicked the VH1 series \\"Pop-Up Video,\\" which enhanced music videos with small bits of information. Mad also published a separate standalone special issue of these. * The Mad _ Primer ‚Äì written and illustrated by various, Mad Primers mimicked the writing style of Dick and Jane and dealt with a wide variety of subjects from bigotry to hockey to religion; Mad also published a Cradle to Grave Primer as a separate paperback, showing the complete misery-filled life of one man. *  Revisited ‚Äì \\"conceived\\" by Max Brandel according to his credit, these photographic pieces would take a long-established piece of text, such as the Preamble to the U.S. Constitution, or the Ten Commandments, and systematically illustrate the text with ironically-chosen photo images. * Scenes We'd Like to See ‚Äì written and illustrated by various, these were generally one-page vignettes which inverted the common conventions of moviemaking, advertising, or the culture at large, ending with a clich√©d character in a clich√©d setting, acting cowardly or saying something atypically honest. * Six Degrees of Separation Between Anyone and Anything ‚Äì written by Mike Snider and illustrated by Rick Tulka, this feature exploited the Kevin Bacon-based game of links to humorously connect various items or people in thematic or painstakingly phrased ways rather than proximity. * Snappy Answers to Stupid Questions ‚Äì written and illustrated by Al Jaffee, this long-running series reproduces unnecessary questions (i.e., \\"Is that an octopus?\\" \\"Are you a jogger?\\") and supplies three sarcastic responses for each, along with a blank box for the reader to supply their own snappy answer. A mini-version of this feature occasionally appears in the magazine's \\"Fundalini\\" section, consisting of just one question. Mad has also published several separate, standalone paperbacks of these. * Seven Periods Closer to Death ‚Äì written and illustrated by Ted Rall, this one-page strip takes a satirical look at life in high school. * What Is A ? ‚Äì written by Tom Koch, these text-heavy articles would describe the characteristics of a personality type, such as an introvert, a \\"big man on campus\\", or a party- pooper. * When  Go Bad ‚Äì written and illustrated by John Caldwell, each article depicts the outrageous behavior allegedly found within the worst element of a certain culture or profession (i.e. \\"When Nuns Go Bad\\"; \\"When Clowns Go Bad\\"; \\"When The Morbidly Obese Go Bad\\"; \\"When Minions Go Really, Really Bad\\"). * The Year in Film ‚Äì written by Desmond Devlin, these ironically juxtaposed movie titles of the past calendar year with photographs of topical news events or celebrities. * You Know You're Really _ When... ‚Äì written and illustrated by various, these took a common condition (\\"You're Really Overweight When‚Ä¶\\") and presented several one-liners on the theme. Besides the above, Mad has returned to certain themes and areas again and again, such as fullblown imaginary magazines, greeting cards, nursery rhymes, Christmas carols, song parodies and other poetry (including several versions of \\"Casey at the Bat\\"), comic strip takeoffs and others. Table of Contents The first page of each issue lists all the articles to follow, including their \\"Department\\" headings, which are plays on words. For example, a parody of a pizza chain's menu appeared under \\"The Passion of the Crust Department\\", while an article entitled \\"William Shakespeare, Sports Commentator\\" was part of \\"The Play-By-Play's the Thing Department\\". Long-running features had equally long- running headers: Spy vs. Spy is filed under the \\"Joke and Dagger Department\\", Dave Berg's \\"Lighter Side of...\\" always ran within the \\"Berg's Eye View Department\\", and many of Frank Jacobs' articles come under the \\"Frank on a Roll Department\\". Don Martin's crazy cartoons were simply labelled \\"Don Martin Department\\", with further fanfare presumably being unnecessary. Dick DeBartolo's articles occasionally are headed under the \\"Dick DePartment\\", while some of Duck Edwing's articles were labeled as the \\"Tales from The Duck Side\\" Dept. Most of the magazine's other recurring features have had their own continuing \\"Department\\". Each Table of Contents cites one article that does not actually exist. Examples of these imaginary listings have included \\"Santa Claus, Porn Star\\"; \\"What if Cap'n Crunch Was Brought Before a Military Tribunal?\\"; \\"If Bobby Knight Coached the Special Olympics\\"; \\"Only the Assistant Undersecretary of Transportation Would Possibly Believe...\\"; \\"What if Daffy and Donald Duck Went To Prison?\\"; and \\"Snappy Answers to Stupid Questions During the Bombing of Belgrade\\". In one instance, the fake title listed, \\"If Chickens Could Time Travel\\", showed up as a genuine article in the next issue. Each Table of Contents also includes a quote or aphorism attributed to Alfred E. Neuman. With a handful of exceptions, this is the only time the character ever \\"speaks\\". Letters and Tomatoes Dept. An esoteric version of the standard \\"Letters to the Editors\\", this section of the magazine includes correspondence from readers, reader drawings or craft projects, celebrity photos, references to Mad in other media, and so forth. In recent years, all letters are typically answered in a snide and insulting manner, and always include a pun or twist on the sender's name. The first \\"Letters\\" section (then called \\"Mad Mumblings\\") appeared in MAD #3 (January‚ÄìFebruary 1953). The first letter printed came from a Marine Corps corporal named Eugene F. Shanlin, who said he \\"had never heard people laugh out loud at a comic magazine before!\\"http://www.genealogybuff.com/fl/fl-citrus-obits17.htm There have been a few recurring sub-departments, including the \\"Make a Dumb Wish Foundation\\" which promised to make readers' stupid requests come true (a parody of the Make a Wish Foundation); \\"Antiques Freakshow with Hans Brickface\\", in which photographs of readers' bizarre household items were appraised by the slightly psychotic Hans; absurd one-sentence observations called \\"MAD Mumblings\\", which were typically non sequiturs posted online by the readers; and celebrity \\"Two-Question Interviews\\" which were essentially over before they began, thus revealing nothing. The magazine solicits reader photos of famous people posing with a copy of Mad. Once a year, Mad publishes \\"The Nifty Fifty\\", listing 50 famous people they hope to see in upcoming \\"Celebrity Snaps\\". A reader who successfully gets one of the fifty to pose in a photo gets a free three-year subscription (provided that the celebrity is touching the issue). Some celebrities send in photos of themselves, typically in response to the magazine having targeted them in a previous issue. The magazine was delighted to publish a photo of Dan Quayle unwittingly holding the \\"PROOFREADER WANTED\\" cover of Mad #355, on which the magazine's logo appeared as MAAD. During a photo op in 1992, the then-Vice President had incorrectly \\"corrected\\" an elementary school student on the way Quayle thought the word \\"potato\\" should be spelled. The Fundalini Pages Beginning with its February 2004 edition, Mad has led off its issues with this catch-all section of various bits, which are far shorter or smaller than normal Mad articles. They often appear as many as three to six per page. Some of these pieces are produced in-house; others are the work of freelancers. All contributors for each month were credited en masse, as \\"Friends of Fundalini\\". For this reason, it is not always apparent which contributor is responsible for which item, particularly the writers. Beginning with issue number 500 (June 2009), writers and artists (except editorial staff members) have been given credit for individual contributions. Most Fundalini features are one- shot gags that never appear again, some have appeared multiple times, and a few have become regular features. Among the recurring elements in the Fundalini section are: =Created for Fundalini= * Bitterman, a short comic strip by Garth Gerhart about a hateful slacker; * Classified ads; these frequently deal in absurdity and non sequiturs; * The Cover We Didn't Use, purporting to be the \\"second choice\\" for that issue's front cover; * The Fast 5, a Top 5 list similar to David Letterman's Top 10 lists; * Foto News, in which topical photographs are given word balloons (similar to fumetti, though without that genre's narrative storyline aspect); * Gag panels by cartoonists such as Tom Cheney (\\"Pull My Cheney!\\"), or P.C. Vey (\\"Vey to Go!\\", later called Oy Vey!). * The Godfrey Report, a small 3x 3 grid showing three classes of objects and their current cultural status, which is arbitrarily rated as \\"In\\", \\"Five Minutes Ago\\", or \\"Out\\". (e.g. Stoolies: In, Squealers: Five Minutes Ago, Turncoats: Out); * Graphic Novel Review, written by Desmond Devlin, which analyzes fictional comic collections and graphic novels such as The Anally Complete Peanuts or Tintin in Fallujah; * The Kitchen Sink, a lengthy barrage of spoof titles for topics such as \\"Reality Shows Currently Under Development\\" or \\"Proposed Star Wars Sequel Titles\\"; * Monkeys Are Always Funny, by Evan Dorkin, showing famous news photographs with the image of a monkey Photoshopped in (e.g. the raid on Elian Gonzalez's closet, or the Hindenburg explosion); * The NFL's Ref Report, written by Kiernan P. Schmitt, which illustrates a topic by using generic drawings of a referee's hand signals; * The Puzzle Nook, a multiple choice fill-in-the-blank phrase; * Saddam Sez, which reused the same photograph of Saddam Hussein speaking at his 2006 trial. A word balloon was added, making a random reference having nothing to do with Hussein or Iraq. The March 2007 issue of Mad contained a statement that \\"Due to circumstances beyond our control\\" the Saddam Sez feature would be put on \\"indefinite hiatus\\". Fidel Castro later replaced Saddam with \\"Castro Comments\\"; A Wikipedia parody has appeared twice, first called \\"Wonkypedia\\", and then \\"Wakipedia\\". Both entries featured a convoluted assortment of unrelated facts, in the style of an inaccurate or vandalized Wikipedia page (e.g. the \\"article\\" on Pearl Harbor discussed Mao Tse-Tung's surprise attack and how it led to the bombing of Chernobyl). Wonkypedia is now an actual website.Wonkypedia Truncated versions of two pre-existing features, *Celebrity Cause of Death Betting Odds\\" and *Melvin and Jenkins' Guide to...\\" have been moved to Fundalini. The Strip Club An assortment of short gag comic strips drawn by various artists, it has appeared roughly every other month since its debut in the July 2005 issue. It typically runs three pages, and is a combination of one-shot gags and recurring features. Among the repeated strip characters are an omnipotent superhero called Fantabulaman; a hero robot named Santon; Rob, the Evil Backstabbing Robot Temp; Father O'Flannity, a priest who conducts celebrity interviews in a hot tub; Trigger McBride, a horse cop; the unnamed protagonists who use \\"The Machine that Travels Through Time\\"; Jeff, a man whose roommate is oblivious to the fact that he is a serial killer despite obvious evidence; and Patience Man, a superhero who takes too long to stop crimes. Go Fetch! Blurring the line between advertising and content was Go Fetch!, a 2005-06 list of newly released media products such as videogames, DVD releases, music albums and books. Each product listing had The Hype and The Snipe, in which its good and bad qualities were expounded. Each Go Fetch! also promoted \\"the Must Have\\", an idiosyncratic (but real) product which no Mad reader should be without, such as cold galvanizing spray, or a pneumatic jackhammer. Go Fetch! was an odd cross between the wise-ass Mad mentality and the sort of product ratings generally associated with Rolling Stone. It was an overtly commercial feature, with some one-liners thrown in with the apparent hope of making it more palatable. As such, Go Fetch! was heavily criticized by many of the magazine's loyal readers as a betrayal of the magazine's original satiric mission. In its year of existence, Go Fetch! appeared in eight of 12 issues, but the feature has been defunct since June 2006. \\"The Mad 20\\" Since 1998, in every January issue, Mad has commemorated the \\"20 Dumbest People, Events and Things\\" of the year. These emphasize the visual motif above all else, parodying such things as movie posters, famous paintings, or magazine covers, though one or two text-heavier takeoffs are usually sprinkled into each year's assortment. The feature is reminiscent of the old Spy Magazines \\"Spy 100\\" list, which purported to catalogue \\"Our Annual Census of the 100 Most Annoying, Alarming, and Appalling People, Places and Things\\". Though the \\"20 Dumbest People, Events and Things\\" are numbered 1-20, the \\"rankings\\" appear to be essentially random. The \\"20th dumbest\\" slot of 2001 was awarded to Mad itself for its \\"slide down the slippery slope of greedy commercialism\\" in finally permitting advertising in its pages. Keeping in mind the indiscriminate positioning, these were the \\"#1\\" selections for the various years: * 1998: \\"Starr Wars\\", a movie poster parody of the partisan Kenneth Starr investigation, depicting Starr as Darth Vader, and Bill Clinton holding a cigar instead of a light saber; * 1999: \\"Y2K Panic\\", a chaotic cartoon showing a crashing airplane displacing the Times Square New Year's Ball, sending it careening into a terror-stricken crowd; * 2000: A rewritten Presidential oath of office. The issue went to press one week after the disputed 2000 election; the editors had thought they would be able to plug in the winner, but were obliged to publish two versions of the image, one with Al Gore being sworn in, the other depicting George W. Bush; * 2001: \\"A.I. Asinine Ideology\\", a movie poster parody of the Steven Spielberg film A.I. highlighting Jerry Falwell's placing blame on the 9/11 attacks on gays, feminists, abortionists and the ACLU; * 2002: \\"Martha Stewart Lying\\", a magazine spoof of Martha Stewart's insider trading scandal; * 2003: \\"Term Eliminator\\", a movie poster parody of the third Terminator film mocking Arnold Schwarzenegger's victory in the California recall election; * 2004: \\"Donny Rumsfeld and the Prisoners of Abu Ghraib\\", a book cover in the style of the third Harry Potter jacket, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban; * 2005: \\"Where's W?\\", a book parody in the style of the Where's Waldo? series. The cover shows a tableau of the crowded, flooded streets of New Orleans in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, with George W. Bush completely impossible to find; * 2006: \\"The Iraqi Quagmire Chess Set\\", in the style of a Franklin Mint collectable. Literal chess pieces were sculpted and photographed, depicting such figures as Dick Cheney, Joseph Lieberman, Abu-Musab al-Zarqawi and Muqtada al-Sadr; * 2007: \\"Michael & Me\\", A parody of the book Marley and Me and ostensibly written from the perspective of one of Michael Vick's illegal fighting pit bulls. The book cover depicts Vick strangling a dog; * 2008: \\"Clueless\\", a parody of the board game Clue featuring losing Vice Presidential candidate Sarah Palin. It included rules of play which mimicked Palin's rhetoric and speaking style. The rooms, weapons, characters were also changed to reflect her persona and associations. * 2009: \\"The Canonization of Michael Jackson\\", a religious icon which poked fun at media, fans and other hangers-on who spent the weeks following Jackson's death ignoring or whitewashing the child molestation accusations, his eccentric habits and his penchant for self- glorification. (Jackson's personal physician, who is widely blamed for causing the singer's death by overdose, was given his own entry at #20: a parody of Jackson's \\"Thriller\\" album, renamed \\"Killer\\"); * 2010: \\"Creators of the Black Lagoon\\", a poster parody of the 1954 monster movie satirizing the malfeasance before and after the BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. * 2011: \\"The Walking Debt\\", a parody of the AMC series The Walking Dead mocking the partisan battle over the previously perfunctory adjustment to the U.S. debt ceiling. President Obama, Nancy Pelosi, Harry Reid, John Boehner, Eric Cantor and Mitch McConnell are among the politicians shown as shuffling, mindless zombies. * 2012: \\"Paint Misbehavin' \\", a parody of the 1960 Norman Rockwell painting \\"Triple Self- Portrait\\"http://arthistory.about.com/od/from_exhibitions/ig/american_chronicles/aonr_dia_09_18.htm which was changed to satirize Cecilia Gimenez's botched \\"restoration\\" of the religious Ecce Homo fresco in Borja, Zaragoza. * 2013: \\"National Buffoons' Abysmal House\\", a parody of the movie poster for the 1978 comedy film Animal House, mocking John Boehner and the Republican Party-led House of Representatives for triggering the government shutdown. * 2014: \\"GoodellFellas\\", a parody of the movie poster for the 1990 gangster film Goodfellas, mocking NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell for the league's lack of punishment against Ray Rice for beating his wife in an elevator, and Adrian Peterson's abuse of his son with a tree branch. * 2015: \\"The Great Gasbag\\", a parody of the movie poster for the 2013 film The Great Gatsby, mocking Donald Trump's abusive \\"verbal diarrhea\\" towards Jeb Bush, Megyn Kelly and others during his bombastic campaign for the Republican Presidential nomination. Mad had previously used the title \\"The Great Gasbag\\" for its parody of the 1974 Robert Redford-Mia Farrow film adaptation. * 2016: \\"The Toxic Contender\\", a parody of the movie poster for the 1984 film The Toxic Avenger, mocking Donald Trump's \\"name-calling\\", \\"fact-free\\", \\"soul-crushingly noxious\\" campaign. It was the first of four Trump entries, the most for any target in any \\"MAD 20\\" issue (the other three were about Trump's team of advisors, his sexist remarks, his paying no taxes, and investigations of the Trump Foundation). * 2017: \\"Russkie Business\\", a parody of the movie poster for the 1983 film Risky Business, mocking Donald Trump's association with the ongoing investigation into collusion and Russian involvement in the 2016 Presidential election. It was the first of a full dozen Trump-related entries, though Trump only had a supporting role in some of them, such as Vice President Mike Pence, Kathy Griffin's much-criticized photo of a beheaded Trump, the reactions to quarterback Colin Kaepernick's civil rights protest, or the racist white supremacist/Nazi rally in Charlottesville. * 2018: \\"Infamous Monsters of Movieland,\\" a parody of the 1960s/70s horror/sci-fi magazine Famous Monsters of Filmland, mocking the various celebrities accused or convicted of sexual misconduct or rape, including Bill Cosby, Harvey Weinstein, Kevin Spacey, Les Moonves, Matt Lauer, Roger Ailes, Bill O'Reilly, Charlie Rose and Louis CK. A woman is holding the magazine with a look of horror, and her hair sticking up in fright. Running gags and recurring images The Mad Style Guide (1994), showing several of the magazine's repeated images. Mad has made frequent use of esoteric words, including potrzebie, furshlugginer, veeblefetzer, Moxie, ganef, halavah, and axolotl. Many, but not all of these words are of Yiddish or Jewish origin. Favored humorous names included Melvin, Bitsko, Kaputnik, Cowznofski, and Fonebone. Mad used the word \\"ecch\\" or its cousins \\"blecch\\" and \\"yecch\\" as an all-purpose expression of disgust so often that even The Simpsons later made passing references to the practice, showing Mad covers with the unseen parodies \\"Beauty and the Blecch\\" and \\"NYPD Blecch\\". The word \\"hoohah\\" was an early running gag, often exclaimed by excited characters in the comic book issues written by Harvey Kurtzman; the first story in the first issue of Mad was titled \\"Hoohah!\\".Index of MAD's first two years Its Eastern European feel was a perfect fit for the New York Jewish style of the publication. The precise origin of \\"hoohah\\" is unknown, although it may have sprung from the Hungarian word for \\"wow\\", which is h≈±ha. \\"It's crackers to slip a rozzer the dropsy in snide\\" was a non sequitur-ish phrase that found its way into Mad on several occasions in the 1950s; this was dated British slang meaning \\"It's madness to bribe a policeman with counterfeit money.\\" (The phrase originated in Margery Allingham's mid-thirties detective novel, The Fashion in Shrouds).Allingham, Margery. The Fashion in Shrouds, New York: Felony & Mayhem Press, 2008, p. 58. The speaker is Albert Campion's \\"male person's gentleman\\", Magersfontein Lugg, a former burglar with aspirations of bettering himself. He has been increasing his education by way of reading \\"a small dictionary of quotations\\", and tosses the sentence out as a possible entry in his own work of that sort. Some of the magazine's visual elements are whimsical, frequently appearing in the artwork without context or explanation. Among these are a potted avocado plant named Arthur (reportedly based on art director John Putnam's personal marijuana plant); a domed trashcan wearing an overcoat; a pointing six-fingered hand; the Mad Zeppelin (which more closely resembles an early experimental non-rigid airship); and an emaciated long- beaked creature who went unidentified for decades before being dubbed \\"Flip the Bird\\". In late 1964, Mad was tricked into purchasing the \\"rights\\" to an optical illusion already in the public domain, featuring a sort of three- pronged tuning fork whose appearance defies physical possibility. The magazine dubbed it the \\"Mad poiuyt\\" after the six rightmost letter keys on a QWERTY keyboard in reverse order, not realizing that the existing image was already known to engineers and usually called a blivet. Mad cartoonists have regularly drawn themselves, fellow contributors and editors, and family members into the articles, most famously Dave Berg's self-caricature \\"Roger Kaputnik\\". Al Jaffee sometimes incorporates a self-caricature into his signature, most notably in his fold-ins. The magazine's photo spreads have typically featured Mads own staff. Originally, the magazine tried hiring models for its photo shoots, but found that many were unwilling to make the exaggerated faces the magazine wanted. While trying to prompt the reluctant outsiders with demonstrations, the magazine staff soon decided that they were better suited for foolish posing than the professionals, and more cost-effective. In the 1990s and 2000s, the magazine has made periodic references to \\"the monkey juice\\", generally in the context of over-imbibing with same. Many letter column responses are punctuated with the breezy interjection \\"Fa fa fa!\\". The mysterious name \\"Max Korn\\" has popped up for years; reader requests to clarify Korn's true identity have been greeted with increasingly outlandish explanations. Regardless of the amount, the changing cover price of Mad has long been followed by the word \\"Cheap!\\". Variants have occasionally appeared; following an increase from 25 to 30 cents, the successive issues claimed to be \\"Cheap\\" (but X'd out), \\"Cheap?\\", and \\"Kinda Cheap\\". A rise to 40 cents sparked almost a year's worth of variations: \\"Ouch!\\", \\"Outrageous!\\", \\"No Laughing Matter\\", \\"Relatively Cheap\\", \\"Cheap (Considering)\\", and again, \\"Cheap?\\". Other price increases were billed as \\"Almost Cheap\\", \\"Inflated!\\", and for a cover featuring Bonnie and Clyde, \\"Highway Robbery\\".

Education Raysman was born in New York City, the son of Victor Raysman, a businessman, and Irene Davies Raysman, a professor. He grew up in Valley Stream, New York, a suburb of New York City, attending Valley Stream North High School. Raysman received a B.S. in 1968 from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he majored in Industrial Management at the MIT Sloan School of Management and minored in computer science. Career After graduation from MIT, Raysman worked for the IBM Corporation as a systems engineer for six years, based in New York City. In that capacity he guided the information technology departments of major corporations in implementing new computer systems and upgrading to more advanced hardware. He programmed in computer languages such as Assembler, Cobol, IBM RPG and Fortran. While working for IBM Raysman attended Brooklyn Law School at night. During that time he joined the U.S.Army Reserve, where he served in the Military Police for six years, doing his basic training at Fort Gordon, in Augusta, Georgia. Being a systems engineer as well as a lawyer, Raysman realized that the law relating to the purchase and use of computer hardware and software was as yet undeveloped. Although academic articles relating to computer law were starting to appear in law reviews, there were no law firms professing to practice in it. Since the use of computers in a business context was increasing exponentially, Raysman decided, in 1978, to start his own firm in New York City specifically to counsel companies in those transactions. As part of his effort to distinguish the acquisition of software and hardware as an area of the law requiring specific knowledge and expertise, in the following years Raysman wrote articles for the New York Times,\\"Of Computers and the Law,\\" New York Times, September 14, 1980 the Harvard Business Review,\\"Manager Involvement Needed in Computer Selection\\" (1981) and \\"Don't Rush to Court When Your Computer Fails,\\" (1984), Harvard Business Review and the New York Law Journal, where in 1981 he became \\"co-author\\" of the first monthly column on Computer Law, written by associates under his byline. The New York Times twice cited Raysman as a legal expert on patents and software .Teresa Riordan,\\"Prodigy's patent is being debated,\\" Feb. 5, 1996; and \\"Borland gets a patent for making graphs from spreadsheets\\" Nov. 13, 1995. During the last two decades of the 20th century computer law expanded to include issues relating to software licensing, protection of intellectual property on the internet, eCommerce law and information technology employment issues such as outsourcing. These areas of the law are now encompassed in the term Intellectual Property Law. Raysman's firm, known as Brown, Raysman & Millstein, ultimately grew to 250 lawyers with offices in New York, Los Angeles, Silicon Valley, Hartford and Toronto. In 2006 Brown Raysman Millstein Felder & Steiner, as it was then known, merged with the San Francisco law firm of Thelen and became known as Thelen Reid Brown Raysman & Steiner, having 650 attorneys and offices worldwide. In 2008 Raysman left Thelen, when the firm disbanded. He now practices at the New York office of Holland & Knight. Raysman concentrates his practice in international outsourcing transactions. Raysman has litigated numerous reported cases for the New York State and Federal courts. He has been selected by Chambers as one of America's leading outsourcing lawyers.\\"Chambers USA\\", Chambers and Partners, 2008 Raysman continues to publish extensively on the topic of Intellectual Property Law, including three ghost-written treatises as well as newsletters and the monthly column that appears under his byline in the New York Law Journal. He is also a regular speaker in this field at numerous conferences, including those sponsored by the International Bar Association, the Outsourcing Interests Group and the Intellectual Technology Law Forum in Europe.

Bass grew up in rural Tennessee, in the small town of Rogersville. A tall, right-handed pitcher, Bass attended Miami University in Ohio, where he was named to the All-Buckeye baseball teams during his junior and senior years. He signed with the St. Louis Cardinals organization, and made his pro debut with Shawnee, Oklahoma in 1930; he wound up in Louisville by 1932 and pitched parts of six seasons with the Louisville Colonels of the American Association, winning 17 games in 1934. After winning 19 games with the Chattanooga Lookouts of the Southern Association in 1939, Bass got the call to the majors, starting for the Washington Senators on September 21, 1939. Most of Bass' start (from the fourth inning onwards) can still be heard today; it was part of the WJSV broadcast day, which was preserved for posterity. Bass and the Cleveland Indians' Al Milnar battled through six scoreless innings, before Washington's Charlie Gelbert hit a two-run homer in the bottom of the seventh, giving the Nats a 2-0 lead. But Bass fell apart in the eighth, giving up singles to Roy Weatherly, Ben Chapman and Odell Hall. After hitting Bruce Campbell with a pitch to load the bases, Ken Keltner doubled to give Cleveland a lead they would never relinquish; Cleveland would win, 6-3, ruining Bass' major league debut. It would be Bass' only game in the majors. Already 33 years old, he would return to Chattanooga, then enlist in World War II. (Instead of heading overseas, however, Bass remained in Ohio, employed as a purchasing agent by an aluminum company in Dayton. He also managed the local amateur baseball team to four city championships and the World's Amateur Championship at Youngstown, Ohio in 1944.) After the war, he pitched for and managed Class D clubs in Gainesville, Florida and Kingsport, Tennessee, not far from his old hometown. In 1948, when Bass was fired by Kingsport, he took another managerial job, coaching not men but women: the Fort Wayne Daisies of the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League.

The instrumentation ranged from traditional Galician bagpipes (gaitas) to synthesizers, saxophones, keyboard, electric guitars, and bass. According to Jos√© Colmeiro, their works present a postmodern, heterogeneous mix of ‚Äútradition and modernity‚Äù, ‚Äúintegrating the rural and the urban‚Äù. They were the among the first bands to popularize the use of Galician in a rock song. Their most recognizable hit was \\"Fai un Sol de Carallo\\" (1986), a folk- inflected politic-danceable rock song that would become an anthem for the Movida viguesa. Due to its success, it was also translated into English and Basque. Other famous songs included \\"Galicia Sitio Distinto\\" and \\"Galicia Express\\", criticizing the state of Galicia with comical and irreverent lyrics.

Over the portals are four large ogival mullioned windows and an elaborated rose window in brickwork. The bell tower, dating to c. 1450, has numerous friezes and a triple mullioned window with marble columns.

Froude's travelogue attacked the British West Indian colonies for wanting to establish self-government, arguing that if the majority black population were allowed to vote on leaders they would choose leaders that would repress the white population. Like many of his West Indian contemporaries, Thomas was outraged at the inaccuracies of Froude's text as well as the racist arguments that Froude uses as justification for his beliefs. He decided that writing a refutation to Froude was his patriotic dutyThomas 16 and that it would act as self-vindicationThomas 15 for West Indian blacks. Froudacity was Thomas' last and most significant work. Thomas finished writing it shortly before succumbing to pneumonia.  Background  From the middle of the 17th century to 1866, Jamaica had a self-ruling mode of government referred to as the 'Old Representative System'. However, after an outbreak of rebellion Jamaica was put under the crown colony system of government in 1866. A number of other West Indian colonies such as Trinidad and Dominica were established as crown colonies in the late 18th and early 19th century. Crown colonies had governors appointed to rule them from the Colonial Office in London. From the inception of crown colony rule, natives of crown colonies began to protest the Crown Colony form of government because they felt that the foreign-appointed governors did not hold the natives' best interests in mind.Benn 65 Natives of Trinidad and Jamaica repeatedly petitioned the Colonial Office to establish home rule in the colonies, but they were ignored until the early 20th century. James Anthony Froude, a well- known English intellectual, was an apologist for imperial rule.Benn 67 In 1886, he published Oceana, another one of Froude's works attacking the desire for self-rule in Australia. Like English in the West Indies, it was criticized for its superficial coverage of colonial affairs and Froude's lack of exposure to the native countries which he discussed. His next travelogue, The English in the West Indies, detailed his travels in the West Indies and his political opinions on the benefits of the Crown Colony form of government. Froude argued that if the West Indian colonies were allowed home rule, the large black population in those colonies would vote for black leaders who would strip away whites' rights. Froude attacked blacks as being racially inferior, and argued that slavery was not as bad as it was commonly believed to be. Froude's work initially received good reviews in English newspapers and journals;Thompson 174-175 however, it caused an outrage in the West Indian colonies. West Indian journals and newspapers immediately denounced Froude for his racist beliefs, and the incorrect sweeping generalizations and statements that Froude makes throughout English in the West Indies. In 1888 Charles Spencer Salmon published The Caribbean Confederation and Nicholas Darnell Davis published Mr. Froude's Negrophobia or Don Quixote as a Cook's Tourist, both refuting Froude's arguments.Thompson 175-176 Though both of these books were important, Thomas' response became the most renowned and was considered the finest refutation of The English in the West Indies.Cudjoe 305 As a response to The English in the West Indies, \\"Although Salmon and Davis had responded to Froude, Thomas' response became the most celebrated.\\". Thomas was relatively unknown in England outside of certain intellectual circles, and being able to publish Froudacity in London was an important achievement for Thomas. Synopsis Froudacity is split into four books, each addressing specific topics that Froude brings. Thomas begins the preface by attacking the overarching claims that Froude uses to argue against self-governance. Thomas ridicules Froude's assertion that if blacks in West Indian countries were given the right to vote, they would elect a candidate that would strip away the rights of whites due to racial animosity.Thomas 6-9 He also attacks the notion that West Indian blacks harbor animosity against whites by pointing out that as many blacks owned slaves as whites,Thomas 13 and that most people who were alive during slavery have since died.Thomas 14 In Book I Thomas addresses Froude's claims in the early portions of The English in the West Indies. Froude's tendency to state incorrect assumptions as fact is roundly assaulted. Thomas criticizes Froude for making sweeping generalizations about the condition of blacks on multiple islands without ever talking or interacting with the people he was writing about. Thomas points out that Froude comments extensively on the lifestyles of the natives of Grenada when his only experience among the natives was peering into their houses as he rode past in a carriage.Thomas 49 Thomas attacks many other different factual inaccuracies in Froude's work.Thomas 31-32 In Book II Thomas begins to directly address Froude's criticism of giving colonies self-rule. When Froude claims that leaders of the reform movements \\"did not complain that their affairs had been ill-managed\\"Thomas 56 Thomas spends over two dozen pages detailing the gross abuses of power and corruption that many of the appointed governors of Trinidad have participated in.Thomas 57-73 Thomas also debunks Froude's claim that the reformers pushed for reform in the hope that they would be elected and allowed to draw a handsome government salary.Thomas 73-75 Thomas also points out that contrary to Froude's claims the reform movement has been active for decades.Thomas 79 Thomas finishes the second book by refuting Froude's assertion that West Indian blacks were incredibly well taken care off by \\"the beneficent despotism of the English Government\\"Thomas 83 The 3rd book takes up half of Froudacity. It begins with Froude alleging that there are few black intellectuals.Thomas 119 Thomas responds by accusing the West Indian governments of suppressing blacks and noting that many black intellectuals sprang up in America shortly after Emancipation because they were integrated into society.Thomas 119-123 Thomas uses the examples of Fredrick Douglass and Chief Justice William Conrad Reeves extensively in his arguments about race and intelligence. Both men are black and highly successful. Thomas uses these men as examples of successful black intellectuals, who succeeded despite racism. Thomas convincingly counters Froude's cheerful view of slavery.Thomas 152, 163 Thomas continues to contest Froude's multiple accusations about the results of black ruling over whites and what the ideal governance situation is for the West Indies. When Froude brings up the old stereotypes of blacks being lazy,Thomas 203 or being cannibals or devil-worshipers,Thomas 208 Thomas quickly counters all of the accusations. Thomas goes on to note the rising prominence of ChristianityThomas 212-213 among blacks, and engages in a discussion on the limits of science and religion. In the final 4th book, Thomas discusses the history of blacks instead of analyzing The English in the West Indies. Thomas discusses the history of the development slavery in America and in the West Indies. Thomas details how slave owners in the West Indies became god-parents to their slaves through the Catholic Church, and through this process developed personal relationships with slaves devoid of cruelty. The institutions of slavery developed very differently in America and the West Indies.Thomas 241-242 Thomas lists the great accomplishments achieved by the \\"Negro Race\\",Thomas 257 predicting that these accomplishments will continue growing. Thomas encourages \\"African descendants now dispersed in various countries of the Western Hemisphere ... at sufficient peace to begin occupying themselves about matters of racial importance\\".Thomas 259 Reception Froudacity received mostly good reviews by London newspapers, occasionally being criticized because of its style and diction.Smith 63 Ironically, English in the West Indies received mostly positive reviews in London newspapers when it was published as well.Thompson 175 In the West Indies Froudacity \\"was launched to an ocean of publicity and pronounced a success\\", but \\"when the news reached Trinidad that he had died ... the whole country went into mourning.\\". Criticism Denis Benn notes that Thomas defends against Froude's attacks on West Indian blacks and home rule reform movements, but he does not positively assert West Indian political rights.Benn 69 Without strongly asserting West Indian political rights, Froudacity is a refutation that does not move the readership towards the cause of the abolition of the crown colony management. In her overview of Thomas' life and works, Bridget Brereton brings up a number of important criticisms of Froudacity. First she notes that \\"Thomas' essential charity and lack of prejudice led him to play down the depth of race prejudice and ill-feeling West Indian society .... Gordon Rohlehr is surely right to point out the unreality of Thomas' fairly placid picture of post-Emancipation Trinidad\\".Brereton 34Rohlehr, Gordon. ‚ÄúFroudacity, a Re-examination.‚Äù New World, Black Power Special Issue (1971): 36. She asks the pertinent question: Did Thomas intentionally lie as matter of political convenience for the Reform movement? It is impossible to judge Thomas' thoughts, but it is a reasonable explanation for why Thomas would make such an outlandish statement. Brereton continues to note that like many of his contemporaries Thomas did not believe in universal suffrage, but instead he believed that property qualifications should be necessary for voting.Brereton 36 In the 19th century universal suffrage was not as great an issue as it grew to be, but it still shows that Thomas believed in the rule of the elite, not in true democratic rule. Finally, Brereton notes that \\"Thomas does not show that he understood the links between Christianity and slavery and imperialism in the Caribbean\\".Brereton 37 Thomas might have understood the ties and ignored discussing them for political expediency, or as a devout Christian he might simply have dismissed the idea that religion could do harm.

Madoff founded a penny stock brokerage in 1960 which eventually grew into Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities. He served as its chairman until his arrest on December 11, 2008. The firm was one of the top market maker businesses on Wall Street, which bypassed \\"specialist\\" firms by directly executing orders over the counter from retail brokers. At the firm, he employed his brother Peter Madoff as senior managing director and chief compliance officer, Peter's daughter Shana Madoff as the firm's rules and compliance officer and attorney, and his now deceased sons Mark and Andrew. Peter was sentenced to 10 years in prison and Mark committed suicide by hanging exactly two years after his father's arrest. Andrew died of lymphoma on September 3, 2014. On December 10, 2008, Madoff's sons told authorities that their father had confessed to them that the asset management unit of his firm was a massive Ponzi scheme, and quoted him as saying that it was \\"one big lie\\". The following day, FBI agents arrested Madoff and charged him with one count of securities fraud. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) had previously conducted multiple investigations into his business practices but had not uncovered the massive fraud. On March 12, 2009, Madoff pleaded guilty to 11 federal felonies and admitted to turning his wealth management business into a massive Ponzi scheme. The Madoff investment scandal defrauded thousands of investors of billions of dollars. Madoff said that he began the Ponzi scheme in the early 1990s, but federal investigators believe that the fraud began as early as the mid-1980s and may have begun as far back as the 1970s. Those charged with recovering the missing money believe that the investment operation may never have been legitimate. The amount missing from client accounts was almost $65 billion, including fabricated gains. The Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC) trustee estimated actual losses to investors of $18 billion. On June 29, 2009, Madoff was sentenced to 150 years in prison, the maximum allowed. Early life Madoff was born on April 29, 1938, in Queens, New York, to Jewish parents Ralph Madoff, a plumber and stockbroker, and Sylvia Muntner. Madoff's grandparents were emigrants from Poland, Romania, and Austria. He is the second of three children; his siblings are Sondra Weiner and Peter Madoff.. \\"Ruth, who grew up in Laurelton, Queens, with Bernie became his steady at Far Rockaway High School. She had attributes that intrigued Bernie: She had a ‚Äúshiksa‚Äù look, but was Jewish; she was social and outgoing; she had a shrewd accountant father, and she was a whiz at one particular subject ‚Äì math ‚Äì all the right stuff for a future Master of the Universe in the gilded canyons of Wall Street. Married in 1959, Bernie would later cheat on her like he cheated his clients.\\" Madoff graduated from Far Rockaway High School in 1956. He attended the University of Alabama for one year, where he became a brother of the Tau Chapter of the Sigma Alpha Mu fraternity, then transferred to and graduated from Hofstra University in 1960 with a Bachelor of Arts in political science. Madoff briefly attended Brooklyn Law School, but founded the Wall Street firm Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC and remained working for his own company. Career At the time of his arrest on December 11, 2008, Madoff was the chairman of Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC. The firm started in 1960 as a penny stock trader with $5,000 ($ today) that Madoff earned from working as a lifeguard and sprinkler installer. He further secured a loan of $50,000 from his father-in-law which he also used to set up the firm. His business grew with the assistance of his father-in-law, accountant Saul Alpern, who referred a circle of friends and their families. Initially, the firm made markets (quoted bid and ask prices) via the National Quotation Bureau's Pink Sheets. In order to compete with firms that were members of the New York Stock Exchange trading on the stock exchange's floor, his firm began using innovative computer information technology to disseminate its quotes. After a trial run, the technology that the firm helped to develop became the NASDAQ. After 41 years as a sole proprietorship, the Madoff firm incorporated in 2001 as a limited liability company with Madoff as the sole shareholder. The firm functioned as a third-market provider, bypassing exchange specialist firms by directly executing orders over the counter from retail brokers. At one point, Madoff Securities was the largest market maker at the NASDAQ, and in 2008 was the sixth-largest market maker on Wall Street. The firm also had an investment management and advisory division, which it did not publicize, that was the focus of the fraud investigation. Madoff was \\"the first prominent practitioner\\" of payment for order flow, in which a dealer pays a broker for the right to execute a customer's order. This has been called a \\"legal kickback.\\" Some academics have questioned the ethics of these payments. Madoff argued that these payments did not alter the price that the customer received. He viewed the payments as a normal business practice: Madoff was active in the National Association of Securities Dealers (NASD), a self-regulatory securities-industry organization. He served as chairman of its board of directors, and was a member of its board of governors. Government access From 1991 to 2008, Bernie and Ruth Madoff contributed about $240,000 to federal candidates, parties and committees, including $25,000 a year from 2005 through 2008 to the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. The Committee returned $100,000 of the Madoffs' contributions to Irving Picard, the bankruptcy trustee who oversees all claims, and Senator Charles E. Schumer returned almost $30,000 received from Madoff and his relatives to the trustee. Senator Christopher J. Dodd donated $1,500 to the Elie Wiesel Foundation for Humanity, a Madoff victim. Members of the Madoff family have served as leaders of the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (SIFMA), the primary securities industry organization. Bernard Madoff served on the board of directors of the Securities Industry Association, a precursor of SIFMA, and was chairman of its trading committee. He was a founding board member of the DTCC subsidiary in London, the International Securities Clearing Corporation. Madoff's brother Peter served two terms as a member of SIFMA's Board of Directors. He and Andrew received awards from SIFMA in 2008 for \\"extraordinary leadership and service\\". He resigned from the Board of Directors of SIFMA in December 2008, as news of the Ponzi scheme broke. From 2000-08, the Madoff brothers donated $56,000 directly to SIFMA, and paid additional money as sponsors of industry meetings. Bernard Madoff's niece Shana Madoff was a member of the Executive Committee of SIFMA's Compliance & Legal Division, but resigned shortly after the arrest. Madoff's name first came up in a fraud investigation in 1992, when two people complained to the SEC about investments they made with Avellino & Bienes, the successor to his father-in-law's accounting practice. For years, Alpern and two of his colleagues, Frank Avellino and Michael Bienes, had raised money for Madoff, a practice that continued after Avellino and Bienes took over the firm in the 1970s. Avellino returned the money to investors and the SEC closed the case. In 2004, Genevievette Walker-Lightfoot, a lawyer in the SEC's Office of Compliance Inspections and Examinations (OCIE), informed her supervisor branch chief Mark Donohue that her review of Madoff found numerous inconsistencies, and recommended further questioning. However, she was told by Donohue and his boss Eric Swanson to stop work on the Madoff investigation, send them her work results, and instead investigate the mutual fund industry. Swanson, Assistant Director of the SEC's OCIE, had met Shana Madoff in 2003 while investigating her uncle Bernie Madoff and his firm. The investigation was concluded in 2005. In 2006 Swanson left the SEC and became engaged to Shana Madoff, and in 2007 the two married. A spokesman for Swanson said he \\"did not participate in any inquiry of Bernard Madoff Securities or its affiliates while involved in a relationship\\" with Shana Madoff. While awaiting sentencing, Madoff met with the SEC's Inspector General, H. David Kotz, who conducted an investigation into how regulators had failed to detect the fraud despite numerous red flags. Madoff said he could have been caught in 2003, but that bumbling investigators had acted like \\"Lt. Colombo\\" and never asked the right questions: Madoff said in the June 17, 2009, interview that SEC Chairman Mary Schapiro was a \\"dear friend\\", and SEC Commissioner Elisse Walter was a \\"terrific lady\\" whom he knew \\"pretty well\\". After Madoff's arrest, the SEC was criticized for its lack of financial expertise and lack of due diligence, despite having received complaints from Harry Markopolos and others for almost a decade. The SEC's Inspector General, Kotz, found that since 1992, there had been six investigations of Madoff by the SEC, which were botched either through incompetent staff work or by neglecting allegations of financial experts and whistle-blowers. At least some of the SEC investigators doubted whether Madoff was even trading. Due to concerns of improper conduct by Inspector General Kotz in the Madoff investigation, Inspector General David C. Williams of the United States Postal Service was brought in to conduct an independent outside review. The Williams Report questioned Kotz's work on the Madoff investigation, because Kotz was a \\"very good friend\\" with Markopolos. Investigators were not able to determine when Kotz and Markopolos became friends. A violation of the ethics rule would have taken place if the friendship were concurrent with Kotz's investigation of Madoff. Investment scandal In 1999, financial analyst Harry Markopolos had informed the SEC that he believed it was legally and mathematically impossible to achieve the gains Madoff claimed to deliver. According to Markopolos, it took him four minutes to conclude that Madoff's numbers did not add up, and another minute to suspect they were likely fraudulent. After four hours of failed attempts to replicate Madoff's numbers, Markopolos believed he had mathematically proven Madoff was a fraud. He was ignored by the SEC's Boston office in 2000 and 2001, as well as by Meaghan Cheung at the SEC's New York office in 2005 and 2007 when he presented further evidence. He has since co-authored a book with Gaytri Kachroo (the leader of his legal team) titled No One Would Listen. The book details the frustrating efforts he and his legal team made over a ten- year period to alert the government, the industry, and the press about Madoff's fraud. Although Madoff's wealth management business ultimately grew into a multibillion-dollar operation, none of the major derivatives firms traded with him because they did not believe his numbers were real. None of the major Wall Street firms invested with him, and several high-ranking executives at those firms suspected his operations and claims were not legitimate. Others contended it was inconceivable that the growing volume of Madoff's accounts could be competently and legitimately serviced by his documented accounting/auditing firm, a three-person firm with only one active accountant. The Central Bank of Ireland failed to spot Madoff's gigantic fraud when he started using Irish funds and had to supply large amounts of information, which would have been enough to enable Irish regulators to uncover the fraud much earlier than late 2008 when he was finally arrested in New York. The Federal Bureau of Investigation report and federal prosecutors' complaint says that during the first week of December 2008, Madoff confided to a senior employee, identified by Bloomberg News as one of his sons, that he said he was struggling to meet $7 billion in redemptions. For years, Madoff had simply deposited investors' money in his business account at JPMorganChase and withdrew money from that account when they requested redemptions. He had scraped together just enough money to make a redemption payment on November 19. However, despite getting cash infusions from several longtime investors, by the week after Thanksgiving it was apparent that there was not enough money to even begin to meet the remaining requests. His Chase account had over $5.5 billion in mid-2008, but by late November was down to $234 million‚Äînot even a fraction of the outstanding redemptions. On December 3, he told longtime assistant Frank DiPascali, who had overseen the fraudulent advisory business, that he was finished. On December 9, he told his brother about the fraud. According to the sons, Madoff told Mark Madoff on the following day, December 9, that he planned to pay out $173 million in bonuses two months early. Madoff said that \\"he had recently made profits through business operations, and that now was a good time to distribute it.\\" Mark told Andrew Madoff, and the next morning they went to their father's office and asked him how he could pay bonuses to his staff if he was having trouble paying clients. They then traveled to Madoff's apartment, where with Ruth Madoff nearby, Madoff told them he was \\"finished,\\" that he had \\"absolutely nothing\\" left, and that his investment fund was \\"just one big lie\\" and \\"basically, a giant Ponzi scheme.\\" According to their attorney, Madoff's sons then reported their father to federal authorities. Madoff had intended to wind up his operations over the remainder of the week before having his sons turn him in; he directed DiPascali to use the remaining money in his business account to cash out the accounts of several family members and favored friends. However, as soon as they left their father's apartment, Mark and Andrew immediately contacted a lawyer, who in turn got them in touch with federal prosecutors and the SEC. On December 11, 2008, Madoff was arrested and charged with securities fraud. Madoff posted $10 million bail in December 2008 and remained under 24-hour monitoring and house arrest in his Upper East Side penthouse apartment until March 12, 2009, when Judge Denny Chin revoked his bail and remanded him to the Metropolitan Correctional Center. Chin ruled that Madoff was a flight risk because of his age, his wealth, and the prospect of spending the rest of his life in prison. Prosecutors filed two asset forfeiture pleadings which include lists of valuable real and personal property as well as financial interests and entities owned or controlled by Madoff. Madoff's lawyer, Ira Sorkin, filed an appeal, which prosecutors opposed. On March 20, 2009, an appellate court denied Madoff's request to be released from jail and returned to home confinement until his sentencing on June 29, 2009. On June 22, 2009, Sorkin hand-delivered a customary pre-sentencing letter to the judge requesting a sentence of 12 years, because of tables from the Social Security Administration that his life span was predicted to be 13 years. On June 26, 2009, Chin ordered forfeiture of $170 million in Madoff's assets. Prosecutors asked Chin to sentence Madoff to 150 years in prison. Bankruptcy Trustee Irving Picard indicated that \\"Mr. Madoff has not provided meaningful cooperation or assistance.\\" In settlement with federal prosecutors, Madoff's wife Ruth agreed to forfeit her claim to $85 million in assets, leaving her with $2.5 million in cash. The order allowed the SEC and Court appointed trustee Irving Picard to pursue Ruth Madoff's funds. Massachusetts regulators also accused her of withdrawing $15 million from company-related accounts shortly before he confessed. In February 2009, Madoff reached an agreement with the SEC. It was later revealed that as part of the agreement, Madoff accepted a lifetime ban from the securities industry. Picard sued Madoff's sons, Mark and Andrew, his brother Peter, and Peter's daughter, Shana, for negligence and breach of fiduciary duty, for $198 million. The defendants had received over $80 million in compensation since 2001. =Mechanics of the fraud= According to the SEC indictment against Annette Bongiorno and Joann Crupi, two back office workers who worked for Madoff, they created false trading reports based on the returns that Madoff ordered for each customer. For example, when Madoff determined a customer's return, one of the back office workers would enter a false trade report with a previous date and then enter a false closing trade in the amount required to produce the required profit, according to the indictment. Prosecutors allege that Bongiorno used a computer program specially designed to backdate trades and manipulate account statements. They quote her as writing to a manager in the early 1990s, \\"I need the ability to give any settlement date I want.\\" In some cases, returns were allegedly determined before the account was even opened. On a daily basis, DiPascali and his team on the 17th floor of the Lipstick Building‚Äîwhere the scam was based (Madoff's brokerage was based on the 19th floor, while the main entrance and conference room were on the 18th floor)‚Äîwatched the closing price of the S&P; 100\\\\. They then picked the best-performing stocks and used them to create bogus \\"baskets\\" of stocks as the basis for false trading records, which Madoff claimed were generated from his supposed \\"split-strike conversion\\" strategy, in which he bought blue-chip stocks and took options contracts on them. They frequently made their \\"trades\\" at a stock's monthly high or low, resulting in the high \\"returns\\" that they touted to customers. On occasion, they slipped up and dated trades as taking place on weekends and federal holidays, though this was never caught. Over the years, Madoff admonished his investors to keep quiet about their relationship with him. This was because he was well aware of the finite limits that existed for a legitimate split-strike conversion. He knew that if the amount he \\"managed\\" became known, investors would question whether he could trade on the scale he claimed without the market reacting to his activity, or whether there were enough options to hedge his stock purchases. At least as early as 2001, Harry Markopolos discovered that for Madoff's strategy to be legitimate, he would have had to buy more options on the Chicago Board Options Exchange than actually existed. Additionally, at least one hedge fund manager, Suzanne Murphy, revealed that she balked at investing with Madoff because she did not believe there was enough volume to support his purported trading activity. Madoff admitted during his March 2009 guilty plea that the essence of his scheme was to deposit client money into a Chase account, rather than invest it and generate steady returns as clients had believed. When clients wanted their money, \\"I used the money in the Chase Manhattan bank account that belonged to them or other clients to pay the requested funds,\\" he told the court. Madoff maintained that he began his fraud in the early 1990s, while prosecutors believed it was underway as early as the 1980s. DiPascali, for instance, told prosecutors that he knew the investment advisory business was a sham at some point in the late 1980s or early 1990s. An investigator charged with reconstructing Madoff's scheme believes that the fraud was well underway as early as 1964. Reportedly, Madoff told an acquaintance soon after his arrest that the fraud began \\"almost immediately\\" after his firm opened its doors. Bongiorno, who spent over 40 years with Madoff‚Äìlonger than anyone except Ruth and Peter‚Äìtold investigators that she was doing \\"the same things she was doing in 2008\\" that she did when she first joined the firm. =Affinity fraud= Madoff targeted wealthy American Jewish communities, using his in-group status to obtain investments from Jewish individuals and institutions. Affected Jewish charitable organizations considered victims of this affinity fraud include Hadassah, the Women's Zionist Organization of America, the Elie Wiesel Foundation and Steven Spielberg's Wunderkinder Foundation. Jewish federations and hospitals lost millions of dollars, forcing some organizations to close. The Lappin Foundation, for instance, was forced to close temporarily because it had invested its funds with Madoff. =Size of loss to investors= David Sheehan, chief counsel to trustee Picard, stated on September 27, 2009, that about $36 billion was invested into the scam, returning $18 billion to investors, with $18 billion missing. About half of Madoff's investors were \\"net winners,\\" earning more than their investment. The withdrawal amounts in the final six years were subject to \\"clawback\\" (return of money) lawsuits. In a May 4, 2011, statement, trustee Picard said that the total fictitious amounts owed to customers (with some adjustments) were $57 billion, of which $17.3 billion was actually invested by customers. $7.6 billion has been recovered, but pending lawsuits, only $2.6 billion is available to repay victims. If all the recovered funds are returned to victims, their net loss would be under $10 billion. The Internal Revenue Service ruled that investors' capital losses in this and other fraudulent investment schemes will be treated as business losses, thereby allowing the victims to claim them as net operating losses to reduce tax liability more easily. The size of the fraud was stated as $65 billion early in the investigation. Former SEC Chairman Harvey Pitt estimated the actual net fraud to be between $10 and $17 billion. One difference between the estimates concerns the method of calculation. One method calculates losses as the total amount that victims thought they were owed, but will never receive. The smaller estimates use a different method, subtracting the total cash received from the scheme from the total cash paid into the scheme, after excluding from the calculation persons accused of collaborating with the scheme, persons who invested through \\"feeder funds,\\" and anyone who received more cash from the scheme than they paid in. Erin Arvedlund, who publicly questioned Madoff's reported investment performance in 2001, stated that the actual amount of the fraud might never be known, but was likely between $12 and $20 billion. Jeffry Picower, rather than Madoff, appears to have been the largest beneficiary of Madoff's Ponzi scheme, and his estate settled the claims against it for $7.2 billion. Entities and individuals affiliated with Fred Wilpon and Saul Katz received $300 million in respect of investments in the scheme. Wilpon and Katz \\"categorically reject[ed]\\" the charge that they \\"ignored warning signs\\" about Madoff's fraud. On November 9, 2017, the U.S. government announced that it would begin paying out $772.5 million to more than 24,000 victims of the Ponzi scheme. Plea, sentencing, and prison life On March 12, 2009, Madoff pleaded guilty to 11 federal felonies, including securities fraud, wire fraud, mail fraud, money laundering, making false statements, perjury, theft from an employee benefit plan, and making false filings with the SEC. The plea was the response to a criminal complaint filed two days earlier, which stated that over the past 20 years, Madoff had defrauded his clients of almost $65 billion in the largest Ponzi scheme in history. Madoff insisted he was solely responsible for the fraud. Madoff did not plea bargain with the government. Rather, he pleaded guilty to all charges. It has been speculated that Madoff pleaded guilty instead of cooperating with the authorities in order to avoid naming any associates and co-conspirators who were involved with him in the scheme. In November 2009, David G. Friehling, Madoff's accounting front man and auditor, pleaded guilty to securities fraud, investment adviser fraud, making false filings to the SEC, and obstructing the IRS. He admitted to merely rubber- stamping Madoff's filings rather than auditing them. Friehling extensively cooperated with federal prosecutors and testified at the trials of five former Madoff employees, all of whom were convicted and sentenced to between 2 and a half and 10 years in prison. Although he could have been sentenced to more than 100 years in prison, because of his cooperation, Friehling was sentenced in May 2015 to one year of home detention and one year of supervised release. His involvement made the Madoff scheme by far the largest accounting fraud in history, dwarfing the $11 billion accounting fraud masterminded by Bernard Ebbers at WorldCom. Madoff's right-hand man and financial chief, Frank DiPascali, pleaded guilty to 10 federal charges in 2009 and (like Friehling) testified for the government at the trial of five former colleagues, all of whom were convicted. DiPascali faced a sentence of up to 125 years, but he died of lung cancer in May 2015, before he could be sentenced. In his plea allocution, Madoff stated he began his Ponzi scheme in 1991. He admitted he had never made any legitimate investments with his clients' money during this time. Instead, he said, he simply deposited the money into his personal business account at Chase Manhattan Bank. When his customers asked for withdrawals, he paid them out of the Chase account‚Äîa classic \\"robbing Peter to pay Paul\\" scenario. Chase and its successor, JPMorgan Chase, may have earned as much as $483 million from his bank account. He was committed to satisfying his clients' expectations of high returns, despite an economic recession. He admitted to false trading activities masked by foreign transfers and false SEC filings. He stated that he always intended to resume legitimate trading activity, but it proved \\"difficult, and ultimately impossible\\" to reconcile his client accounts. In the end, Madoff said, he realized that his scam would eventually be exposed. On June 29, 2009, Judge Chin sentenced Madoff to the maximum sentence of 150 years in federal prison. Madoff's lawyers initially asked the judge to impose a sentence of 7 years, and later requested that the sentence be 12 years, because of Madoff's advanced age of 71 and his limited life expectancy. Madoff apologized to his victims, saying, He added, \\"I know that doesn't help you,\\" after his victims recommended to the judge that he receive a life sentence. Judge Chin had not received any mitigating factor letters from friends or family testifying to Madoff's good deeds. \\"The absence of such support is telling,\\" he said. Judge Chin also said that Madoff had not been forthcoming about his crimes. \\"I have a sense Mr. Madoff has not done all that he could do or told all that he knows,\\" said Chin, calling the fraud \\"extraordinarily evil\\", \\"unprecedented\\", and \\"staggering\\", and that the sentence would deter others from committing similar frauds. Judge Chin also agreed with prosecutors' contention that the fraud began at some point in the 1980s. He also noted that Madoff's crimes were \\"off the charts\\" since federal sentencing guidelines for fraud only go up to $400 million in losses. Ruth did not attend court but issued a statement, saying \\"I am breaking my silence now because my reluctance to speak has been interpreted as indifference or lack of sympathy for the victims of my husband Bernie's crime, which is exactly the opposite of the truth. I am embarrassed and ashamed. Like everyone else, I feel betrayed and confused. The man who committed this horrible fraud is not the man whom I have known for all these years.\\" =Incarceration= FCI Butner Medium, where Madoff is incarcerated Madoff's attorney asked the judge to recommend that the Federal Bureau of Prisons place Madoff in the Federal Correctional Institution, Otisville, which is located from Manhattan. The judge, however, only recommended that Madoff be sent to a facility in the Northeast United States. Madoff was transferred to the Federal Correctional Institution Butner Medium near Butner, North Carolina, about northwest of Raleigh; he is Bureau of Prisons Register #61727-054. Jeff Gammage of The Philadelphia Inquirer said \\"Madoff's heavy sentence likely determined his fate.\\" Madoff's projected release date is November 14, 2139. The release date, described as \\"academic\\" in Madoff's case because he would have to live to the age of 201, reflects a reduction for good behavior. On October 13, 2009, it was reported that Madoff experienced his first prison yard fight with another inmate, also a senior citizen. When he began his sentence, Madoff's stress levels were so severe that he broke out in hives and other skin maladies soon after. On December 18, 2009, Madoff was moved to Duke University Medical Center in Durham, North Carolina, and was treated for several facial injuries. A former inmate later claimed that the injuries were received during an alleged altercation with another inmate. Other news reports described Madoff's injuries as more serious and including \\"facial fractures, broken ribs, and a collapsed lung\\". The Federal Bureau of Prisons said Madoff signed an affidavit on December 24, 2009, which indicated that he had not been assaulted and that he had been admitted to the hospital for hypertension. In his letter to his daughter-in-law, Madoff said that he was being treated in prison like a \\"Mafia don\\". After an inmate slapped Madoff because he had changed the channel on the TV, it was reported that Madoff befriended Carmine Persico, boss of the Colombo crime family since 1973, one of New York's five American Mafia families. It was believed Persico had intimidated the inmate who slapped Madoff in the face. On July 29, 2019: Bernie Madoff had asked Donald Trump for a reduced sentence/pardon on his sentence for the Ponzi Scheme, to which the White House and Donald Trump made no comment. In February 2020 his lawyer filed for compassionate release from prison on the claim that he was suffering from chronic kidney failure, a terminal illness and had less than 18 months to live. He was hospitalized for this condition in December 2019. The request was denied due to the severity of Madoff's crimes. Personal life On November 28, 1959, Madoff married Ruth Alpern, whom he had met while attending Far Rockaway High School. The two eventually began dating. Ruth graduated from high school in 1958, and earned her bachelor's degree at Queens College. She was employed at the stock market in Manhattan before working in Madoff's firm, and she founded the Madoff Charitable Foundation. Bernard and Ruth Madoff had two sons: Mark (March 11, 1964 ‚Äì December 11, 2010), a 1986 graduate of the University of Michigan, and Andrew (April 8, 1966 ‚Äì September 3, 2014), a 1988 graduate of University of Pennsylvania's Wharton Business School. Both sons later worked in the trading section alongside paternal cousin Charles Weiner. Several family members worked for Madoff. His younger brother, Peter, an attorney, was Senior Managing Director and Chief Compliance Officer, and Peter's daughter, Shana Madoff, also an attorney, was the firm's compliance attorney. On the morning of December 11, 2010 ‚Äî exactly two years after Bernard's arrest ‚Äî his son Mark was found dead in his New York City apartment. The city medical examiner ruled the cause of death as suicide by hanging. Over the years, Madoff's sons had borrowed money from their parents, to purchase homes and other property. Mark Madoff owed his parents $22 million, and Andrew Madoff owed them $9.5 million. There were two loans in 2008 from Bernard Madoff to Andrew: $4.3 million on October 6, and $250,000 on September 21. Andrew owned a Manhattan apartment and a home in Greenwich, Connecticut, as did his brother Mark prior to his death. Following a divorce from his first wife in 2000, Mark withdrew money from an account. Both sons used outside investment firms to run their own private philanthropic foundations. In March 2003, Andrew Madoff was diagnosed with mantle cell lymphoma and eventually returned to work. He was named chairman of the Lymphoma Research Foundation in January 2008, but resigned shortly after his father's arrest. Peter Madoff (and Andrew Madoff, before his death) remained the targets of a tax fraud investigation by federal prosecutors, according to The Wall Street Journal. David Friehling, Bernard Madoff's tax accountant, who pleaded guilty in a related case, is reportedly assisting in the investigation. According to a civil lawsuit filed in October 2009, trustee Irving Picard alleges that Peter Madoff deposited $32,146 into his Madoff accounts and withdrew over $16 million; Andrew deposited almost $1 million into his accounts and withdrew $17 million; Mark deposited $745,482 and withdrew $18.1 million. Bernard Madoff lived in Roslyn, New York, in a ranch house through the 1970s. After 1980, he owned an ocean-front residence in Montauk. His primary residence was on Manhattan's Upper East Side, and he was listed as chairman of the building's co-op board. He also owned a home in France and a mansion in Palm Beach, Florida, where he was a member of the Palm Beach Country Club. Madoff owned a sportfishing yacht named Bull. All three homes were auctioned by the U.S. Marshals Service in September 2009. Sheryl Weinstein, former chief financial officer of Hadassah, disclosed in a memoir that she and Madoff had had an affair more than 20 years earlier. As of 1997, when Weinstein left, Hadassah had invested a total of $40 million. By the end of 2008, Hadassah had withdrawn more than $130 million from its Madoff accounts and contends its accounts were valued at $90 million at the time of Madoff's arrest. At the victim impact sentencing hearing, Weinstein testified, calling him a \\"beast\\". According to a March 13, 2009 filing by Madoff, he and his wife were worth up to $126 million, plus an estimated $700 million for the value of his business interest in Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC. Other major assets included securities ($45 million), cash ($17 million), half-interest in BLM Air Charter ($12 million), a 2006 Leopard yacht ($7 million), jewelry ($2.6 million), Manhattan apartment ($7 million), Montauk home ($3 million), Palm Beach home ($11 million), Cap d' Antibes, France property ($1 million), and furniture, household goods, and art ($9.9 million). During a 2011 interview on CBS, Ruth Madoff claimed she and her husband had attempted suicide after his fraud was exposed, both taking \\"a bunch of pills\\" in a suicide pact on Christmas Eve 2008. In November 2011, former Madoff employee David Kugel pleaded guilty to charges that arose out of the scheme. He admitted having helped Madoff create a phony paper trail, the false account statements that were supplied to clients. Bernard Madoff suffered a heart attack in December 2013, and reportedly suffers from end-stage renal disease (ESRD). According to CBS New York and other news sources, Madoff claimed in an email to CNBC in January 2014 that he has kidney cancer but this was unconfirmed. In court filing from his lawyer in February 2020, it was revealed Madoff was suffering from chronic kidney failure. Philanthropy and other activities Madoff was a prominent philanthropist, who served on boards of nonprofit institutions, many of which entrusted his firm with their endowments. The collapse and freeze of his personal assets and those of his firm affected businesses, charities, and foundations around the world, including the Chais Family Foundation, the Robert I. Lappin Charitable Foundation, the Picower Foundation, and the JEHT Foundation which were forced to close. Madoff donated approximately $6 million to lymphoma research after his son Andrew was diagnosed with the disease. He and his wife gave over $230,000 to political causes since 1991, with the bulk going to the Democratic Party. Madoff served as the chairman of the board of directors of the Sy Syms School of Business at Yeshiva University, and as Treasurer of its Board of Trustees. He resigned his position at Yeshiva University after his arrest. Madoff also served on the Board of New York City Center, a member of New York City's Cultural Institutions Group (CIG). He served on the executive council of the Wall Street division of the UJA Foundation of New York which declined to invest funds with him because of the conflict of interest. Madoff undertook charity work for the Gift of Life Bone Marrow Foundation and made philanthropic gifts through the Madoff Family Foundation, a $19 million private foundation, which he managed along with his wife. They donated money to hospitals and theaters. The foundation has also contributed to many educational, cultural, and health charities, including those later forced to close because of Madoff's fraud. After Madoff's arrest, the assets of the Madoff Family Foundation were frozen by a federal court. In the media * On May 12, 2009, PBS Frontline aired The Madoff Affair, and subsequently ShopPBS made DVD videos of the show and transcripts available for purchase by the public at large. * Imagining Madoff is a 2010 play by Deb Margolin that tells the story of an imagined encounter between Madoff and his victims. The play generated controversy when Elie Wiesel, originally portrayed as a character in the play, threatened legal action, forcing Margolin to substitute a fictional character, \\"Solomon Galkin\\". The play was nominated for a 2012 Helen Hayes Award. * A documentary, Chasing Madoff, describing Harry Markopolos' efforts to unmask the fraud, was released in August 2011. * Woody Allen's 2013 film Blue Jasmine portrays a fictional couple involved in a similar scandal.

His paintings were known for their feeling of spaciousness, with large areas of the canvas that had little but land, sea, or clouds. During his peak, he was considered a master of his art, earning praise from such luminaries as John Spargo, Bliss Carman, Benjamin De Casseres, Edwin Markham, and Anatole Le Braz. His brother, Scott Dabo, was also a noted painter.  Early life  Flowers in a Green Vase, Pastel Dabo, the eldest of three brothers (he also had five sisters), was possibly born in Paris, FranceIgnatius Schott family, The 1880 U.S. Census, Detroit, Wayne County, Michigan, p.64ASweeney, J. Gray (1987). Artists of Michigan from the Nineteenth Century. Muskegon Museum of Art. p.155 but recently available documents state he was born in Saverne. His father Ignace Scott Dabo was a professor of aesthetics and a classical scholar, who moved the family to Detroit, Michigan in 1870 to escape the Franco-Prussian War.Ignatius Schott family, The 1870 U.S. Census, Detroit, Wayne County, Michigan, p.37-38 He supplemented Leon's formal education with Latin, French, and drawing. After his father's death in 1883, the Dabo family moved to New York City, whereupon he found a job as an architectural designer, working to support the family so that his younger brother Scott, who was considered the talented one, could focus on his art. He then became a student of John LaFarge, and the two of them would remain close friends until LaFarge's death. When Dabo decided to pursue studies in Paris, LaFarge wrote letters of introduction, enabling Dabo to meet Pierre Puvis de Chavannes, who would become his mentor, and to gain entry to the √âcole nationale sup√©rieure des arts d√©coratifs. He also studied part-time at the Acad√©mie Colarossi and the √âcole des Beaux-Arts. Although Impressionism was gaining hold at this time, Dabo did not find that movement to his taste.Narodny, p. 34 Dabo also studied briefly at the Academy of Fine Arts Munich, but the nascent form of German Expressionism did not appeal to him and he moved on to Italy, where he stayed for three years. This was followed by a year in Nancy, France, studying color with √âmile Lauge, a physicist. Finally, he spent some time in London around 1886, where he made the acquaintance of James Abbott McNeill Whistler, who also apparently was a fellow student of Marc-Charles-Gabriel Gleyre with Dabo's father. Whistler would have a profound influence on Dabo's style. While in London, Dabo met Mary Jane \\"Jennie\\" Ford, they married in 1889 and the couple had two children: Madeleine Helen (b. 1891) and Leon Ford \\"George\\" (b. 1892), Leon and Jennie would separate in the 1920s. After Jennie's death in 1945, Dabo officially married his \\"wife\\" since the 1930s, Stephanie Ofenthal.  Artistic success  He returned in New York in 1890 and began his career as a muralist, but by the beginning of the 20th century had turned to painting landscapes instead. For years, Dabo's paintings were rejected for exhibition by the major juries of the United States, until respected French painter Edmond Aman-Jean recognized his talents and began showing Dabo's work in France, whereupon he became a major success. His work was on display in museums all around the world, including Mus√©e du Luxembourg, the National Gallery of Canada, the National Gallery of Art in Washington, the Metropolitan Museum of Art in Manhattan, and the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston. Noted critics such as Sadakichi Hartmann, Royal Cortissoz and J. Nilson Laurvik showered praise on his paintings. Evening on the Hudson (1909), oil on canvas. This painting won a prize from the National Arts Club. Leon Dabo in his Brooklyn studio, ca. 1910, from the Archives of American Art As Dabo's success grew, it was met with by jealousy on the part of Scott. By all accounts, Leon consistently championed his brother's work and the two of them often exhibited together. He even held power of attorney to act as Scott's representative with prospective buyers in Europe. When Scott went to study in Paris in 1902, Leon wrote letters of introduction on his behalf. However, reviews in the press were usually more favorable to Leon, buyers were more interested in Leon's work, and it sold for more as well. Finally at one point, the youngest brother Louis returned from Europe with a new power of attorney statement placing himself in charge of Scott's work, charging that Leon had imitated Scott's style, undermined him with buyers, and misappropriated the proceeds from the sales of Scott's work. Although the Dabo sisters sided with Louis and Scott, Leon simply refuted the charges and The New York Times did not put much stock into Louis' statements. Aligning himself with the insurgents of the art world, Dabo participated in the \\"Exhibition of Contemporary Art\\" at the National Arts Club in 1908.\\"ART EXHIBITS AT THE CLUBS,\\" The Evening Mail (January 6, 1908) p.6 Later that year he showed with the Allied Artists' Association, a newly organized artist group in London mounting non-juried exhibitions.\\"THE LONDON SALON,\\" The Queen (July 18, 1908) p.137 In 1909 he curated and participated in an art exhibition for the Rand School of Social Science\\"NOTES OF THE ART WORLD\\" The New York Herald (May 14, 1909) p.9 and in 1910, he participated in the \\"Exhibition of Independent Artists\\" held by members of the Ashcan School.\\"WITH THE INDEPENDENT ARTISTS,\\" The Evening Mail (April 4, 1910) p.7 In that same year Dabo became the leader of The Pastellists, a somewhat radical artist exhibition society.\\"PASTELLISTS,\\" American Art Annual (1911) p.210 He was an initial exhibitor at the MacDowell Club in their non-juried exhibitions, the brainchild of the Ashcan School's Robert Henri.\\"A NEW TYPE OF EXHIBITION,\\" The New York Times (October 29, 1911) 5:15 A charter member of the Association of American Painters and Sculptors, Dabo was a principal organizer of the International Exhibition of Modern Art in 1913, better known as the Armory Show. He hosted several of its earliest meetings in his studio, but he was back in Europe before the show opened.  World War I  Silver Light Hudson River (1911), oil on canvas. Brooklyn Museum. During World War I, the multilingual Dabo went to France and offered his services to Prime Minister Georges Clemenceau. He ended up serving as an officer in the French and British Armies successively and exposed a number of German spies, using his ear for dialect and accent. He even played the role of spy once, going behind German lines to gain information. For the U.S., he was part of a commission that investigated alleged atrocities that happened in France during the course of the war, and reported that they were indeed true. He was commissioned as a captain in the United States Army and served as an interpreter for the American Expeditionary Force as well as an aide-de-camp to Major General Mark L. Hersey of the 4th Infantry Division.  Later life  After the war, his artistic output decreased. He began to feel that American men had become too materialistic, but women, he felt, were of a more spiritual nature, and could \\"save\\" art from indifference. As a result, he became a popular lecturer, often speaking to as many as fifteen women's clubs a month on art all around the country. In the 1920s, he taught and painted in various artists' colonies in the Litchfield Hills of Connecticut. Starting in 1933, he began to exhibit flower paintings and pastels, a departure from the landscapes with which he had become associated. They were well received, with The New York Times saying the works were \\"a distinct contribution to be associated with the flower harmonies of Odilon Redon and of Fantin-Latour.\\" In 1937, he returned to France and established a studio there, where he painted French landscapes. With war approaching, Dabo helped artists such as Walter Sickert and Fernand L√©ger transport their works out of the country to avoid their being confiscated. He escaped the German occupation of France in late 1940, through Portugal. After the war, he returned to France in 1948 and painted more landscapes, most notably of Montagne Sainte-Victoire. These paintings were highly received and he was invited to exhibit them at the \\"Painters of Mont Ste. Victoire: Tribute to C√©zanne\\" show in 1951. That year, he returned the United States for the last time. Dabo died in Manhattan in 1960 at the age of 96. He is buried in Long Island National Cemetery. Today his works are still getting attention and praise. A great deal of interest has been made on his late modern landscapes and floral still life.

After delivering a series of performances that won him the first prize in dozens of fiddle contests across Southern Appalachia in the early 1920s, Bowman toured and recorded with several string bands and vaudeville acts before forming his own band, the Blue Ridge Music Makers, in 1935. In his career, he would be associated with country and bluegrass pioneers such as Uncle Dave Macon, Fiddlin' John Carson, Roy Acuff, Charlie Poole, and Bill Monroe.Bob Cox and James Bowman, \\"Charlie Bowman: East Tennessee Old-time Fiddler -- A Biographical Sketch . Retrieved: 11 December 2008. Early life Bowman was born July 30, 1889, in Gray Station, Tennessee, a small community approximately north of Johnson City. He first learned to play banjo at the age of 12, and purchased his first fiddle for $4.50 shortly thereafter. According to family tradition, Bowman actually made his first recording on a neighbor's Edison cylinder phonograph in 1908. In his teen years, he and his brothers (who had each learned a different instrument) collected pocket change by playing at square dances and other local events around Washington County. Congressman B. Carroll Reece was one of several politicians to hire the Bowmans to play at political rallies in the early 1920s, and Reece remained a lifelong friend of the Bowman family. In the early 1920s, a local businessman sponsored Bowman in the United Commercial Travelers' fiddle contest in nearby Johnson City. After placing second and collecting a $25 prize, Bowman, realizing he could make money by playing in fiddle contests, spent several months traveling back and forth to contests around the region. He captured first prize in an astonishing 28 out of the 32 contests he entered. At one point, when several people had become skeptical of Bowman's success, the judges were placed so they couldn't see who was playing, yet Bowman still placed first.

The band then relocated to Washington, D.C. where they played regularly on D.C.-area radio station WLS, and in 1928, performed at a White House social hosted by President Calvin Coolidge. Later that year, the band played in the Al Jolson motion picture, The Singing Fool. In Fall 1928, Bowman left the band and returned to Gray Station.Archie Green, \\"Hillbilly Music: Source & Symbol .\\" Originally published in Journal of American Folklore vol. 78 (July/September 1965), pp. 204-228. Retrieved: 11 December 2008. In October 1928, Bowman and several family members made several recordings at the Johnson City sessions, a recording audition held by Columbia Records in Johnson City. The following year, Columbia invited Bowman to New York, where he and his brother, Walter (on banjo), recorded \\"Forked Deer\\" and \\"Moonshiner and His Money.\\" Around 1930, Bowman and several family members joined the vaudeville group, the \\"Blue Ridge Ramblers\\", with whom they toured the Loew's vaudeville circuit until 1935. Later career After leaving the Blue Ridge Ramblers, Bowman formed his own string band, the Blue Ridge Music Makers, and played on various radio stations throughout the Southeastern United States. In the 1940s, Bowman traveled west, sometimes as far as California, playing at different venues and with various makeshift bands and line-ups. He played in 20 different states before he finally gave up performing in 1957. In the early 1960s, at the height of the folk revival movement in the United States, Bowman was interviewed by several magazines and music collectors, including Dorsey Dixon and Pete Seeger. His recollections of the Johnson City sessions, his years with the Hill Billies, and numerous other memories provided an invaluable first-hand account of the development of Old- time music and country music in the 1920s and 1930s. Bowman died on May 20, 1962. Bowman wrote and adapted dozens of songs and fiddle tunes throughout his career. His most well-known include railroad songs such as \\"Nine Pound Hammer,\\" \\"Roll On, Buddy,\\" and \\"Fogless Bill.\\" \\"Reece Rag\\" was written for his friend, Congressman B. Carroll Reece. Often, Bowman's performances involved musical skits, such as with \\"Moonshiner and His Money.\\" Bowman's repertoire of traditional songs included \\"Forked Deer\\" and \\"Turkey in the Straw.\\"Charles Wolfe, Notes in Rural String Bands of Tennessee (p. 1-4) [CD liner notes].

The worst of the violence took place in the Gal Oya valley, where local majority Sinhalese colonists and employees of the Gal Oya Development Board commandeered government vehicles, dynamite and weapons and massacred minority Tamils. It is estimated that over 150 people lost their lives during the violence. Although initially inactive, the police and army were eventually able to bring the situation under control. Background information In British Ceylon, most civil service jobs (roughly 60%) were held by minority Tamils who comprised approximately 15% of the population. This was due to the availability of Western style education provided by American missionaries and others in the Tamil dominant Jaffna peninsula. The overrepresentation of Tamils was used by populist Sinhalese politicians to come to political power by promising to elevate the Sinhalese people. The pro-Sinhalese nationalist Freedom Party came to power in 1956 promising to make Sinhala, the language of the majority Sinhalese people, the sole official language.Vittachi, T. Emergency '58: The Story of the Ceylon Race Riots , pp. 6-8 The so-called Sinhala only policy was opposed by the Tamil Federal party which conducted a nonviolent sit-in protest on June 5, 1956, in front of the parliament in Colombo, the capital city. About 200 Tamil leaders and politicians took part in this protest. Gal Oya settlement scheme Gal Oya settlement scheme was begun in 1949 to settle landless peasants in formerly jungle land. Gal Oya river in the Eastern province was dammed and a tank was created with of irrigated land. In 1956 the settlement had over 50 new villages where over 5,000 ethnic Tamil, Muslim, Indigenous Veddha and Sinhalese were settled. The Sinhalese were approximately 50% of the settlers. Sinhalese and others were spatially separated from each other as Sinhalese were settled at the more productive headwaters of the Gal Oya tank and the Tamils and Muslims at the down rivers closer to their former native villages. Settlement of large number of Sinhalese peasants in what Tamil nationalists considered their traditional Tamil homeland, was a source of tension within the settlement area.Tambiah, Stanley.

Over 150 Tamil owned shops were looted and many people were hospitalized for their injuries. But these disturbances were quickly brought under control by the police.Vittachi, T.

Tigers of Lanka: From Boys to Guerrillas, p. 23 =Gal Oya= As information about disturbances in the capital Colombo reached the outlying area, the riots began on the evening of June 11, 1956, when agitated mobs began roaming the streets of Gal Oya valley looking for Tamils. Properties owned by Tamils, including those of Indian Tamils, were looted and burned down. In the following days a number of rumors began to spread. The chief amongst them was that a Sinhalese girl had been raped and made to walk naked down the street in Batticaloa by a Tamil mob. Although this was later proved to be false, the rumor inflamed the passions of the mob and led to further massacres and property destruction.Tambiah, Stanley. Leveling Crowds: Ethnonationalist Conflicts and Collective Violence in South Asia , p. 89 On the morning of June 13, a truck arrived with Sinhalese refugees from Bakiela who had been attacked by Tamil colonists. By noon of that day, there were further rumors that an army of 6,000 Tamils armed with guns were in the process of approaching the Sinhalese settlements in the Gal Oya valley. This led local groups of Sinhalese men to commandeer government vehicles to travel to outlying Tamil villages while Sinhalese officials and settlers fled.Tambiah, Stanley. Leveling Crowds: Ethnonationalist Conflicts and Collective Violence in South Asia , p. 91 According to historian James Manor, over one hundred Tamils were massacred by the mob.

Getty began making music at age 11, learning to play the classical guitar; at 12 years old he began playing the flute. During school, Getty was influenced by classical music, Irish music, and church music of all kinds. As a young adult, he studied Music at St Chad's College, Durham University, graduating with his Bachelor of Arts in 1995. As a student, Getty completed special conducting opportunities at the Canford Summer School of Music and the Tanglewood Music Center in Massachusetts.

They released it on the Kingsway album New Irish Hymns, featuring vocalists M√°ire Brennan, Margaret Becker, and Joanne Hogg. The song gained popularity, and by 2005 it was named by a BBC Songs of Praise survey as the ninth best loved hymn of all time, and in their 2010 survey was named second best hymn of all time. It hit number one on the United Kingdom CCLI charts by 2006, and in January 2009, it was still number one in the UK, number two in Australia, number seven in Canada, and number 15 in the United States.Previously reported data from CCLI.com The British Hymn Society nominated \\"In Christ Alone\\" as one of the top five hymns of all time, and BBC One's \\"Songs of Praise\\" nominated \\"In Christ Alone\\" as a top 10 hymn in 2012. = Keith & Kristyn Getty = Influences and composition technique The Gettys melodies have strong similarity to Irish folk songs, Keith Getty has said 'Most of our best hymns are based on folk melodies' and We write melodies that borrow their structure more from classic music or traditional folk music that can be sung apace, in response to an interview observation \\"So why do they sound so much like something that‚Äôs always been around. You hear it and you think 'I heard that before I don‚Äôt know where, but I heard that'? \\"There‚Äôs two reasons: one could be the songs are stolen, but as far as I know they‚Äôre not stolen! But I think that really boils down to melody, especially folk melody style. There are influences of folk music... While some of the melodies are virtually identical to their influence for example 'My Heart is Full of Thankfulness' is extremely akin to the Robert Burns' song 'My Love is like a Red Red Rose' other Getty melodies appear to be more subtle 're-workings' of well known songs. These include 'Across The Lands' which draws from the well known Folk Song 'Wild Mountain Thyme' the melodic structure namely the first 8 notes are identical, the verses of 'Hear the Call of the Kingdom' draws from 'Battle of the Royal Republic', 'In Christ Alone' appears as a re-working of the Hymn 'Before the Throne of God' and 'Over Fields of Green' being very similar to 'Dawning of the Day/Raglan Road' however set to an alternative time signature. These amongst other examples have prompted many to conclude that The Gettys do not 'create' new melodies but Keith Getty has mastered reworking existing melodies in new and fresh approaches. Awards and honours Keith Getty received the O.B.E. Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) from Queen Elizabeth II, becoming first church musician of the modern era to be given the award for contribution to music and hymn writing. Keith has received honorary doctorates from Lancaster Bible College and Dallas Baptist University. He has been awarded the Freedom of the City of Lisburn. He is Honorary President and founder of the New Irish Arts. He is a Steinway artist. Theology In 2012, Getty's hymn \\"In Christ Alone\\" was involved in a controversy with the Presbyterian Church (USA) hymnal committee in the creation of their new hymnal \\"Glory to God\\". The committee requested permission from Getty and Stuart Townend to use an alternative lyric to the phrase \\"Till on that cross as Jesus died/the wrath of God was satisfied\\", changing \\"wrath of God was satisfied\\" to \\"the love of God was magnified.\\"Presbyterians' decision to drop hymn stirs debate at USA Today; by Bob Smietana; published 5 August 2013; retrieved 16 October 2015 Getty and Townend rejected this lyric change, and the hymnal committee barred the hymn from the book. Mary Louise Bringle, committee chair, defended their decision saying: \\"The song has been removed from our contents list, with deep regret over losing its otherwise poignant and powerful witness.\\" The decision to change the text arose when members of the committee found the alternate text in the Celebrating Grace Hymnal published in 2010. They assumed the songwriters had agreed to this change, but upon request of the hymn, found that the text used in the Celebrating Grace Hymnal had not been approved by the writers. Capitol CMG Publishing, managers of the song, said it is working with the Celebrating Grace Hymnal's publisher to fix the problem.Spoiling the wrath at The Economist ; by B.C.; published 12 August 2013; retrieved 16 October 2015 The controversy was covered by several major news outlets, including USA Today, The Washington Post, and The Economist, and sparked a theological discussion in the church centered on the subject of atonement and the doctrine of propitiation.

In 1927/28 Bolton Wanderers finished 7th in Division 1.\\"Bolton Wanderers FC - The Official History 1877-2002\\" Simon Marland After a poor start to 1928-9 he moved to inside-right. Although his goals dried up, he was an important member of the side that won the FA Cup beating Portsmouth 2-0 in the final. McClelland made 39 league appearances, scoring 1 goal. He appeared in all 8 games of the FA Cup run and scored 1 goal (in the 5-2 victory against Liverpool in the 4th Round Replay at Burnden Park). In 1928/29 Bolton finished 14th in Division 1. In 1929/30 Wanderers finished 15th in Division 1. McClelland made 8 league appearances, scoring 1 goal. He then left Bolton Wanderers to join Preston North End. Preston North End In October 1929, McClelland moved to Preston North End, for a ¬£5,000 fee, and scored 22 goals in 53 games before returning to the First Division with Blackpool in February 1931. Blackpool McClelland made his debut for Harry Evans' Blackpool late in the 1930‚Äì31 season, in a 3‚Äì3 draw against his former club, Bolton Wanderers, at Bloomfield Road on 21 February 1931. He scored the Seasiders' second goal. He went on to make a further 12 league appearances that season, scoring three more goals (including two in a 5‚Äì1 victory at home to his future club, Manchester United, on 21 March).Calley, Roy (1992).

Manchester United McClelland joined Manchester United at the start of the 1936‚Äì37 campaign, making his debut in the 3‚Äì1 defeat at Huddersfield Town on 2 September. Unable to gain a regular place in the United first team, McClelland only made five appearances in his one season at the club, and only registered one goal (in a 2‚Äì1 win over Stoke City in March) in only his second match. After his career with Manchester United ended, he was given a coaching role with the club, looking after the MUJAC (Manchester United Junior Athletic Club) players from the beginning of the 1938‚Äì39 season. He remained in a coaching role with Manchester United until the outbreak of the Second World War. Death He died in Manchester in 1976 at the age of 73.

The population recorded in the 2001 Census was 157. At the time of the 2011 Census the population was recorded under Ilam. This article describes the location, some of the main features of the village, and a number of places of historical or general interest in or near the village. These include Long Low, Wetton, a prehistoric burial site unique to England. Because the post town is Ashbourne, Derbyshire, many sources of tourist information wrongly describe Wetton as being in Derbyshire. Location Wetton is a small village in the Staffordshire Peak District. It is about 2 miles west of Alstonfield and 8¬Ω miles east of Leek. It stands high above the Manifold valley and contains mostly stone-built properties. The village has an inn, and a church, part of which dates back to the 14th century. The church is unusual in that it has an external staircase to its belfry. Wetton village Sketch of Wetton Village with main features Wetton village viewed from Wetton Low with Wetton Hill in background Wetton village is primarily a collection of farmhouses, with the gaps filled in by cottages and a few larger houses. Towards the centre of the village are the village green, Ye Olde Royal Oak public house, the church, and the former vicarage. The village gives its name to Wetton Mill (or Wettonmill), a nearby hamlet on the River Manifold, and Wetton Hill (), which are both in the care of the National Trust. There are many burial chambers or mounds in the area, including those on Wetton Hill itself, at Wetton Low, south of the village, and Long Low, to the south-east. =St Margaret's Parish Church= (1) on sketch plan. The parish Church of St Margaret is the most obvious public building in the village. It is now in the Benefice of Alstonefield, in the Diocese of Lichfield. The present building was rebuilt in 1820, but the tower dates from the 14th century.Wetton on A Church Near You web site =Reading Room= (6) on sketch plan. The Reading Room, by the churchyard gate opposite the village green, has not been in use for many decades. This may have been the \\"Club House\\" referred to by Rev. J B Dyson in his 1853 history of Methodism in the Leek Circuit as an early venue for Methodist meetings.Available on Rewlach Methodist history books archive =School= (2) on sketch plan. The village school closed because of falling pupil numbers. The building is now in use as the Village Hall and also houses a tea room. The old village hall, situated on the road to Wetton Mill, was a corrugated iron construction which was unusable by the 1960s.Former resident and school pupil Children from Wetton now travel to Ilam or Warslow, along with those from nearby Alstonefield. =Methodist Chapel and Manse= (8) (9) on sketch plan. The former Chapel and Manse are next to Town End Farm, which is the last farm on the north-east of the village. =The Old Police House= The village police house, with its cell, is now a residential home. It is between the village green and the former Methodist Chapel. Staffordshire Police rented the property from the Duke of Devonshire from 1876 for use as a Police Station. The cell was added in 1889, and the station was closed in 1941. The Charge Book is held in Staffordshire records office and this indicates that between 1890 and 1941 some 28 persons were detained overnight for various alleged offences. The adjoining property is the former schoolmistress's house. =The Royal Oak= (4) on sketch plan.

History The various tumuli point to prehistoric Stone Age and Bronze Age settlements. Many local caves and cave-shelters have been excavated and have yielded evidence of inhabitation stretching far back into prehistory. For instance, items found in Thor's Cave, and now in the museum at Buxton, show evidence of early cave dwellers at the site. Wetton is not recorded in the Norman Domesday Book, unlike neighbouring Alstonefield, Warslow and Stanshope. The earliest reference is to Wetindona in a document from the late 12th century. The name may derive from Old English meaning 'wet hill'. The English Heritage listing document for Wetton church has: \\"Early 14th century [tower, on which] ... gargoyles at belfry stage ... parapet band with gargoyles\\". The remains of an Anglo-Saxon settlement, with earlier evidence of Roman occupation, were found in nearby Borough Fields by the geologist Samuel Carrington in the mid-18th century, and excavated by his friend Thomas Bateman who was then the leading local antiquary. A full account of their excavations was given in Bateman's book Ten years‚Äô diggings (1861).Thomas Bateman, Ten years‚Äô diggings in Celtic and Saxon grave hills, in the counties of Derby, Stafford, and York, from 1848 to 1858, George Allen & Sons, 1861, pages 193-203. Carrington and Bateman were enshrined in literature some years later as the leading characters \\"Hornblower\\" and \\"Flaxdale\\" in Eliza Meteyard's novel Dora and her Papa (1869), by which time Carrington was the Schoolmaster and Parish Clerk at Wetton.Notes and Queries, 10 February 1900, page 103. =Industry= With the advent of the Mill at Wetton Mill, there was a surge in corn-growing along the valley tops. The number of disused lead mines in the area point to a range of other industries circa the 16th and 17th centuries. In the late Victorian period the most significant heavy industry was related to the construction of the Leek and Manifold Light Railway and mining at Ecton. =Methodism= When the Wetton and Longnor Wesleyan Methodist Circuit was formed in 1870, Wetton was chosen for the Manse. In 1932, the Circuit incorporated various Primitive Methodist Chapels. The Circuit was disbanded in 1969.Rewlach Methodist history Circuit history diagram The first Wesleyan Methodist building was opened in 1828Dyson, op. cit. The Primitive Methodists held meetings in Wetton, but did not establish a Chapel there. However, the Methodist Chapel at Ecton was Primitive Methodist, resulting from the industrial mission work from Ramsor and later the Leek Primitive Methodist Circuit.Minutes of a Quarterly Meeting held at Leek 10 March 1862 After the completion of the railway in 1904, a building at Ecton became the Methodist Chapel there. Places of interest As a tourist destination, Wetton has a number of places of interest within the Parish. =Manifold Valley= The main tourist destination is the Manifold Valley. Several places may be noted (starting upstream). Ecton At the northern end of Wetton Parish, Ecton is most famous for the copper mine. Swainsley A little downstream from Ecton, this is the site of the only tunnel on the former railway. This was built because one of the owners of the railway lived there and did not want to be disturbed by passing trains.Lindsay Porter, Leek & Manifold Light Railway, Wetton Mill The bridge over the river Manifold at Wetton Mill Wetton Mill was a water mill for grinding corn, and the remains of a mill stream, along with a grindstone, may still be seen. The mill is long since disused, but the Tea Room is popular with tourists. There is ample parking by the mill, on the site of the old halt, and the caf√© is a popular stopping point for walkers using the Manifold Way and the many other rural walks that can incorporate parts of it. Immediately downstream from the mill are several \\"swallow holes\\" where the River Manifold begins to flow underground to Ilam. The 14th-century chivalric romantic poem Sir Gawain and the Green Knight depicts its conclusion as taking place in the district. This is partly due to the fact that the dialect in which the poem is written is now accepted by scholars as closely resembling that of the district, and also partly due to the extensive local work of R.W.V. Elliot in the 1970s.The essays of R.W.V. Elliot are collected in The Gawain Country: Essays on the Topography of Middle English Alliterative Poetry, Leeds Texts and Monographs 8, Leeds, 1984. See also Elliott‚Äôs later \\"Landscape and Geography\\" chapter in A Companion to the Gawain-poet, D.S.Brewer, 1998. This has led some to try to identify precisely the actual location of the story's climax. Mabel Day (1940)Mabel Day, \\"Introduction to Sir Gawain and the Green Knight\\", EETS 210, 1940, page xx. proposed Nan Tor Cave, \\"at the bottom of the valley where the Hoo Brook runs into the Manifold at Wetton Mill\\" (near the site of the Wetton Mill train station), as a candidate for the Green Chapel. Her idea was later examined in detail by Robert Kaske (1972).Robert Kaske, \\"Gawain‚Äôs Green Chapel and the Cave at Wetton Mill\\", Medieval Literature and Folklore Studies: Essays in Honor of Francis Lee Utley, 1972. Thor's Cave Thor's Cave Thor's Cave is a prominent landmark, both in the valley, and for some distance around. The cave is clearly visible from the moorland above Warslow. The main cave is near the top of a cliff overlooking the river. But the base has a number of small caves only just above river level, which may be reached when the river bed is dry. The Weags The bridge where the road from Wetton to Grindon crosses the river is known as Weags Bridge. The valley sides are steep at this point, and the road has hairpin bends on both sides. As with much of the Manifold valley, the road is unsuitable for coaches. Beeston Tor Beeston Tor is a prominent rock face opposite the confluence of the River Hamps. This is popular with rock climbers. Leek and Manifold Light Railway Wetton was served by a railway station which was opened by the narrow gauge (2' 6\\") Leek and Manifold Valley Light Railway on 27 June 1904, whilst being entirely operated by the North Staffordshire Railway. The main purposes of the railway were (1) to provide more rapid transport for milk and dairy products from farms around the valley to customers in Leek and The Potteries, and (2) easier transport for the copper being mined at Ecton. The village of Wetton was a good mile from the station, and the fact that the line followed the valley bottom whereas the settlements served by the railway were mostly on the hill-tops above was a contributary factor in its demise. The line closed in 1934, but in 1937 the route was reopened as the Manifold Way, a fully tarmacked 8-mile walk- and cycle-path which runs from Hulme End in the north to Waterhouses in the south. =Hills and other features= Wetton Hill View near Wetton Hill With a peak at 1221 feet above sea level, Wetton Hill is a prominent landmark. Views from the summit include Rugeley power station, some 25 miles south. Wetton Low Wetton Low is another peak, almost due south of the village. The name Low comes from its use as a burial ground, with several tumuli. There are also a number of disused lead mines in this area, some in the form of adits. At one time a wooded area of the valley side near the Low was designated as a nature reserve. Long Low Long Low is a Neolithic and Bronze Age burial site of a rare form, unique to Britain. It is about a mile south east of the village, with Wetton Low about mid-way from Long Low to the village.

It cautioned young men of well-to-do families against the dangerous influence of bad company and consequent loose morals. Pariksha Guru reflects the inner and outer world of the newly emerging Middle class. The characters are caught in the difficulty of adapting to colonial society while preserving their cultural identity. Although it was apparently written purely for the 'pleasure of reading'. The world of colonial modernity seems both frightening and irresistible. The novel tries to teach the reader the 'right way' of living and expects all sensible men to be worldly wise and practical, to remain rooted in the values of their own tradition and culture, and to live with dignity and honor. The characters attempt to bridge two different worlds through their actions; they take to new agricultural technology, modernize trading practices, change the use of Indian languages making them capable of adopting both Western sciences and Indian wisdom. The young are urged to cultivate the healthy habit of reading newspapers. All this must be achieved without sacrificing traditional values.

He served as the first prime minister of Autonomous Mongolia in the government of the Bogd Khan from 1912 until 1915, when the office of prime minister was abolished. He was then appointed minister of the army. Namnans√ºren, who allegedly could trace his heritage directly back to Genghis Khan, was born in 1878 in present-day Uyanga district of √ñv√∂rkhangai Province. In 1896 he became prince, or \\"khan\\", of Sain Noyon Khan Province, one of the four Khalkh Mongol provinces established by the Manchurians during the Qing dynasty. He married in 1900. In 1911, Namnans√ºren persuaded Mongolia's religious leader Bogd Khan to call a congress of Mongolian princes and high-ranking lamas in Kh√ºree to initiate independence from China. The Bogd Khan then dispatched him to Saint Petersburg in July 1911 as part of a delegation to seek Russian and West European support for Mongolian independence.Sanders, Alan J. K., Historical Dictionary of Mongolia, 1996, . p 37 The Bogd Khan appointed Namnans√ºren prime minister of Autonomous Mongolia in July 1912, replacing Da Lam Tserenchimed who, as minister of internal affairs, had acted as de facto head of government since the elevation of the Bogd Khan as national leader in December 1911.Baabar, B., History of Mongolia, 1999, , . p. 138 Other members of the Bogd Khan's government included the Da Lam Tserenchimed (minister for internal affairs), Mijiddorjiin Khanddorj (minister for foreign affairs), Dalai-Van Gombosuren (defense minister), Dambyn Chagdarjav (finance minister), and Erdene Van Namsrai (minister of justice). Namnans√ºren's delegation in St. Petersburg From November 1913 to January 1914 Namnans√ºren lead another delegation to St. Petersburg, this time to represent Mongolian interests during negotiations between Russia and China surrounding the tripartite Kyakhta treaty that would define the border between Russian Siberia and the Qing territories of Mongolia and Manchuria. Mongolian hopes for international recognition of its independence and support for a union between Inner and Outer Mongolia were ultimately dashed when the agreement re-confirmed the country's status as an autonomous region within China.Baabar 1999, pp. 156-157 While in Russia, Namnans√ºren attempted to contact ambassadors from several western countries (United States, Great Britain, France, and Germany) and to organize a trip to Western Europe to gain international support for Mongolia's independence but was prevented from doing so by Russian officials.Baabar 1999, p. 160 Having failed to obtain any of his objectives, Namnans√ºren found his political influence to have diminished upon his return to Mongolia in 1914. In 1915 the Bogd Khan abolished the office of prime minister and Namnans√ºren was appointed minister of war. In June 1918, faced with increased threats from the Chinese who were demanding Mongolia renounce its Pan-Mongolia ambitions and sign a decree ‚Äúvoluntarily‚Äù relinquishing autonomy, Namnans√ºren again traveled to Russia, this time to Irkutsk, to seek Russian assistance. There he met with two Bolshevik representatives in what is believed to be the first meeting between Soviet and Outer Mongolian officials. The Bolsheviks, preoccupied with the revolution and the ongoing civil war in Russia, failed to offer much in the way of assistance. Not long after his return home, Namnans√ºren fell seriously ill and died sometime in April 1919. Many suspected he was assassinated (poisoned) along with many others involved in the revival of Mongolia‚Äôs independence who died premature deaths. Shortly thereafter the Chinese warlord Xu Shuzheng occupied Niislel Kh√ºree and installed the more pliable Gonchigjalzangiin Badamdorj as prime minister.Baabar 1999, p. 189 In 1914 the Mongolian Namnans√ºren is known to have brought some films from Russia to show at the residence of the Bogd Khan.

She worked in film, television, and the stage, appearing in over 160 film and television productions. She was discovered, without formal training, by Rainer Werner Fassbinder who cast her in many of his films. She was awarded the Deutscher Filmpreis for playing Irmgard Epp in Fassbinder's The Merchant of Four Seasons, and again for appearing as Else Gebel, a woman in prison with Sophie Scholl, in Percy Adlon's F√ºnf letzte Tage.  Life  Born in Munich, Hermann became a publishing clerk after finishing school and worked as a secretary for ADAC. She met Rainer Werner Fassbinder in 1966, who convinced her to quit her job to work with him although she lacked formal training as an actress. The same year, Hermann made her debut in Fassbinder's short film The City Tramp ('), and then went on to play in 19 of Fassbinder's films, including Die bitteren Tr√§nen der Petra von Kant (The Bitter Tears of Petra von Kant, 1972). She was usually cast as a frustrated, stuffy (spie√üig) woman. Her one leading role in his films, Irmgard Epp in the 1971 H√§ndler der vier Jahreszeiten (The Merchant of Four Seasons), won her the Deutscher Filmpreis award. She was a member of Fassbinder's complicated professional and personal entourage, and became one of his confidantes, but the relationship also involved abusive behaviour by Fassbinder towards her; after his death, she said he had been physically abusive. In the mid-1970s, Hermann broke with Fassbinder and moved to Berlin, where her career developed. She played in numerous film and television productions with directors such as Tankred Dorst, Werner Herzog, Hans W. Gei√üend√∂rfer and Christoph Schlingensief. Her performance as Else Gebel, a woman in prison with the resistance fighter Sophie Scholl, in Percy Adlon's 1982 ' (Last Five Days) was again honoured with a Deutscher Filmpreis in 1983. She liked to play in comedies such as Loriot's 1991 Pappa Ante Portas, Hape Kerkeling's 1996 Willi und die Windzors (as a fictionalized version of Queen Elizabeth II) and Rudolf Thome's 1999 Paradiso ‚Äì Sieben Tage mit sieben Frauen. Paradiso won a Silver Bear at the 2000 Berlinale for artistic achievement (k√ºnstlerische Leistung). Overall, she appeared in over 160 film and television productions until 2018. She played on stage at the Berlin Volksb√ºhne and with the Berliner Ensemble. Hermann was married to Dietmar Roberg, an author of children's books. Together, they had two sons (Franz Tizian and Fridolin). She died on 26 May 2020 in Berlin. She was 77, and had been suffering from a ‚Äúshort, serious illness‚Äù, according to her agent.

He used to play as a prop. He first played for Auckland, in 1971, and went on to play 122 matches for them including captaining them between 1977 and 1981. Johnstone had 13 caps for New Zealand, from 1976 to 1979, scoring 2 tries, 8 points in aggregate. During the 1978 New Zealand rugby union tour of Britain and Ireland, he completed a \\"Grand Slam\\" with the four Home Nations. He attended Takapuna Grammar where he played in the first XV in 1965/66. In 1971, as a fresh-faced 20-year-old, Johnstone debuted as a loose-head prop for Auckland. Just one year later, he was in the New Zealand Junior team. In 1973, this, ambitious and gutsy team caused a sensation by beating the All Blacks. Johnstone continued to develop as a prop, earning a spot on the North Island team in 1975. In 1976 Johnstone was selected to play for the All Blacks on their tour of South Africa. From 1977 until 1980 he was a regular member of the team, gaining respect as a \\"compelling scrummager\\" and for being \\"extremely mobile with great ball skills\\". He was an outstanding member of the first All Blacks team to complete the Grand Slam, beating all the home nations in 1978. In total, Johnstone earned 13 caps for New Zealand and played a total of 44 games between 1976-1980. He also captained them on three occasions. Johnstone continued to play for Auckland throughout his All Black career, playing. 122 matches over a decade. In 1977, like his father before him, he took over the captaincy. During this period he led his team to Ranfurly Shield glory when Auckland beat North Auckland in 1979. He was captain of Auckland for five years. Johnstone played for North Shore for a staggering 17 years, from 1969-1986. During this time he played 176 games, scored 10 tries, for a total of 37 points. After retiring from playing, Johnstone took up coaching. He coached North Shore to two championships before transferring offshore. First stop was Italy, where he coached L'Aquila before moving to Fiji. Under his stewardship, the Fijian national team gave France an almighty scare in the quarterfinals before going down in the 1999 Rugby World Cup. Johnstone was the named top coach of the 1999 World Cup. He was the head coach of Fiji at the 1999 Rugby World Cup finals. He was assigned subsequently to Italy, where he stayed from 2000 to 2002. The team won his very first match in the new Six Nations, inaugurated in 2000 with the admission of Italy into the previous Five Nations, against Scotland; however, Italy failed to score a victory in the following 14 matches.

Kealy was the commander of a nine-member SAS squad, which came under attack from hundreds of PFLOAG guerillas during the Dhofar Rebellion in Oman. Death Kealy died of hypothermia in February 1979 when he joined SAS candidates on a selection march in the Brecon Beacons in deteriorating weather conditions. He was found alive (but in poor condition) by a two-man search party‚Äîone of whom stayed with him and attempted to keep him warm. It was later acknowledged by the coroner that one of the major contributory factors in his death was the delay in retrieving him from the hillside‚Äîa delay of some 19 hours due to inclement weather. Another factor was that Kealy had not packed cold weather gear, instead carrying bricks in his Bergen pack to increase its weight to 50 pounds. When offered warm clothing by the search party, he refused‚Äîand even threw a warm blanket away. A combination of Kealy's bloody-minded stubbornness and the effects of hypothermia clouding his judgement seems to have been the tipping point. As a direct result of this and similar incidents, those attempting SAS selection are now allowed to carry only useful items in their bergens when marching. In fiction Sir Ranulph Fiennes turns the real Mike Kealy into a fictional character in his book The Feather Men. In the novel, Mike Kealy is murdered by a group of contract killers called \\"The Clinic\\" in revenge for his role in Oman that had resulted in the killing of a sheik's son. Rather than succumbing to the extreme weather conditions while on an endurance march, as actually happened, the fictional character dies after going into diabetic shock following him being injected with insulin by \\"The Clinic\\".

It was founded in the High Middle Ages but rebuilt in the late 15th century, with the fa√ßade completed in 1517. It is the seat of the Bishop of Lugano. History The church is known on this site from 818. In 1078 it was made a collegiate church, becoming a cathedral in 1888. The original Romanesque building was oriented the opposite way to the present church, as is shown by remains of the apse discovered under the current parvise. In the 15th century the church was expanded and the entrance moved to the present position, while the open roof was covered by a groin vaulted ceiling. There were extensive renovations in 1905-1910, when some Baroque chapels were demolished and the interior received frescoes by Ernesto Rusca. Architectural details The church's main feature is its facade, which was inspired by Giovanni Antonio Amadeo's Certosa di Pavia. It is made of white stone from Saltrio and Viggi√π and of Carrara marble, and is divided in three sectors by four false columns supporting the entablature. In the middle sector is the main portal and a large rose window with decoration of cherubs executed after 1578. The decorations of the portals' frames are of high quality, with figures of puttoes, birds and lion-protomes. The central portal, called the \\"Saints Portal\\", has five medallions with reliefs, depicting four saints and, in the middle, the Virgin with Child. Between the portal's frame and the entablature are two angels carrying torches, resembling the decoration of the Roman triumphal arches. Between the portals, inside square frames, are busts of the Four Evangelists and of the Kings Solomon and David. The entablature frieze has 17 figures, including biblical characters and the Sibyls. Also present are animal figures, while a restoration in 2002 showed traces of a fresco. The main portal of the Romanesque church is now moved to the sacristy. The bell tower dates, in its lower part, to the Romanesque church. The two upper storey are in the Baroque style with an octagonal lantern covered by a cupola, designed by Costante Tencalla.

He is remembered for publishing editions and translations of medieval Arabic mathematical manuscripts and for his research on the propagation of the Hindu-Arabic numeral system in the medieval era. Woepcke was born in Dessau in Germany. He studied mathematics at the University of Berlin, gaining his doctorate in 1847. With astronomer Johann Franz Encke and archaeologist Ernst Heinrich T√∂lken as his academic advisors, he penned his dissertation involving sundials of antiquity (Archaeologico-mathematicae circa solaria veterum).Mathematics Genealogy Project Franz Woepcke Afterwards he studied Arabic language at the University of Bonn, where in 1850 he obtained his habilitation. Woepcke spent much of his subsequent career studying and working outside of Germany, particularly in Paris. Most of his output was written in French. In 1856 he returned to Berlin and taught classes at the Franz√∂sischen Gymnasium until 1858. He died in Paris on March 25, 1864 at the age of 37.

It is long. Its source is at the town of Fontaine-de-Vaucluse (Vaucluse department) and is the biggest spring in France and the fifth biggest in the world. The Sorgue divides into two river courses at L'Isle-sur-la-Sorgue, at a point on the river called the , then further downstream it divides into dozens of separate waterways with different names, such as Sorgue de l‚ÄôIsle, Sorgue de Velleron, Sorgue de Monclar, Sorgue de la Faible. All these arms of the Sorgue flow along the plain of the Sorgues, between L'Isle-sur-la-Sorgue and Avignon. The two largest streams, the Sorgue of Velleron and the Sorgue d'Entraigues, rejoin with one another and enter the Ouv√®ze at B√©darrides. The , which is the third-largest river course, joins with the Ouv√®ze at Sorgues, and flows into the Rh√¥ne at Avignon.  History  At the source of the Sorgue is the biggest spring in France. The river Sorgue divides at L'Isle-sur-la-Sorgue, where one of its many weirs can be seen. =Middle Ages = In the mid-fourteenth century, the Italian humanist, poet and scholar Petrarch visited the region of Vaucluse,\\"The department of Vaucluse was created in 1793 and is so-named from Fontaine de Vaucluse, a spring that is the source of the river Sorgue\\" climbing Mont Ventoux in 1336. Notable as the eternal lover of Laura de Noves, Petrarch returned repeatedly to the Fontaine de Vaucluse to listen to the \\"voice of the waters\\". The poet expresses his happiness: \\"The beautiful source of the river Sorgue, famous in her own right since time immemorial, is celebrated once more by my own extended stay and by my songs.\\" (La tr√®s illustre source de la Sorgue, fameuse par elle-m√™me depuis longtemps, est devenue plus c√©l√®bre encore par mon long s√©jour et par mes chants).Petrarca, Senil, X, 2.  Economy  The management and upkeep of the waterways that make up the river Sorgue is not conducted directly by the State. Local towns have delegated the management of the river to three Unions of Local Rivers, which are federated within the Mixed Union of the Pool of the Sorgues. The Sorgue has historically provided power and water for many paper mills along its course, as well as many watermills. The river is now used extensively by fishermen. It is a tourist destination and is photographed and traveled on by those wishing to enjoy its beauty. Along its course, especially near its source, several canoeing centres provide boats for rent.  Weirs  More than one hundred weirs are used for the management of this river, as it makes its journey from the source at Fontaine-de-Vaucluse, through its bifurcation at L'Isle-sur-la-Sorgue and subsequent splitting into streams and courses that run into the rivers Ouv√®ze and Rhone.

This History went into many editions and during the 19th century became the standard reference work on its subject among British imperialists. Genesis James Mill began his History of British India in 1806, expecting it to take him about seven years, but its completion proved to take instead twelve years, with three substantial volumes at last being published early in 1817.Mill, James. 1817. The History of British India, XV. London; Ball, Terence. September 2004. \\"Mill, James (1773‚Äì1836).\\" In Oxford Dictionary of National Biography. Oxford University Press. . The work was immediately successful among British imperialists and secured for Mill for the first time a degree of prosperity. It led, with the support of David Ricardo and Joseph Hume, to Mill's appointment in 1819 in United Kingdom as assistant (later chief) examiner of correspondence at the imperial East India Company at an annual salary of ¬£800. By 1836, when he died, this income had become ¬£2,000. Mill's biographer Bruce Mazlish takes a practical view of Mill's purpose in beginning the History, stating Summary The History of British India purports to be a study of India in which James set out to attack the history, character, religion, literature[3]re, arts, and laws of India, also making claims about the influence of the Indian climate.The History of British India at alibris.com He also aimed to locate the attacks on India within a wider theoretical framework.Marriott, John, The Other Empire: Metropolis, India and Progress in the Colonial Imagination (Manchester University Press, 2003, ), p. 133 at http://books.google.com The book begins with a preface in which Mill tries to make a virtue of having never visited India and of knowing none of its native languages. To him, these are guarantees of his objectivity, and he boldly claims ‚Äì However, Mill goes on in this preface to say that his work is a \\"critical history,\\" encompassing singularly harsh attacks on Hindu customs and a \\"backward\\" culture which he claims to be notable only for superstition, ignorance, and the mistreatment of women. His work was influential in the eventual banning by the British of the Hindu tradition of a widow immolating herself after her husband's death, known as Sati, in 1829. From the historical perspective, Mill tells the story of the English and, later, British acquisition of wide territories in India, severely criticising those involved in these conquests and in the later administration of the conquered territories, as well as illuminating the harmful effects of commercial monopolies such as that of the imperial East India Company. As a philosopher, Mill applies political theory to the description of the civilisations of India. His interest is in institutions, ideas, and historical processes, while his work is relatively lacking in human interest, in that he does not seek to paint memorable portraits of Robert Clive, Warren Hastings, and the other leading players in the history of British India, nor of its famous battles. Indeed, the History has been called \\"a work of Benthamite 'philosophical history' from which the reader is supposed to draw lessons about human nature, reason and religion.\\"Summary at The History of British India page of Online Library of Liberty web site. Despite the fact that Mill had never been to India, his work had a profound effect on the British imperial system of governing the country, as did his later official connection with India. The Orientalist Horace Hayman Wilson edited later editions and extended the history to 1835 with a continuation entitled The History of British India from 1805 to 1835. He also added notes to Mill's work, based on his own knowledge of India and its languages. The History of British India is still in print.The History of British India (4th ed.) title details at books.google.com In his introduction to Ungoverned Imaginings: James Mill's The History of British India and Orientalism, Javed Majeed argues against \\"colonialist discourse\\" approaches to Mill's History,Grewal, Inderpal. 1993. \\"Ungoverned Imaginings: James Mill's The History of British India and Orientalism by Javed Majeed\\" (review). The Journal of Asian Studies 52(4):1060‚Äì61 while in his forthcoming James Mill and the Despotism of Philosophy (2009), David McInerney considers how Mill's History of British India relates to Enlightenment historiography, and especially William Robertson's Historical Disquisition Concerning the Knowledge the Ancients had of India. He argues that Mill first published his theory of government in The History of British India, and that in the work Mill's use of history is not rationalist but entails an empirical conception of how historical records relate to the improvement of government.Majeed, Javed. 2009. James Mill and the Despotism of Philosophy. . Lay summary. Criticism According to Thomas Trautmann, \\"James Mill's highly influential History of British India (1817) ‚Äì most particularly the long essay 'Of the Hindus' comprising ten chapters ‚Äì is the single most important source of British Indophobia and hostility to Orientalism.\\" In the chapter titled \\"General Reflections in 'Of the Hindus'\\", Mill wrote \\"under the glosing exterior of the Hindu, lies a general disposition to deceit and perfidy.\\" According to Mill, \\"the same insincerity, mendacity, and perfidy; the same indifference to the feelings of others; the same prostitution and venality\\" were the conspicuous characteristics of both the Hindus and the Muslims. The Muslims, however, were perfuse, when possessed of wealth, and devoted to pleasure; the Hindus almost always penurious and ascetic; and \\"in truth, the Hindoo like the eunuch, excels in the qualities of a slave.\\" Furthermore, similar to the Chinese, the Hindus were \\"dissembling, treacherous, mendacious, to an excess which surpasses even the usual measure of uncultivated society.\\" Both the Chinese and the Hindus were \\"disposed to excessive exaggeration with regard to everything relating to themselves\\". Both were \\"cowardly and unfeeling.\\" Both were \\"in the highest degree conceited of themselves, and full of affected contempt for others.\\" And, above all, both were \\"in physical sense, disgustingly unclean in their persons and houses.\\"Dharampal, The Beautiful Tree.

Robbins at Congressional Cemetery. Warren Murray Robbins (September 4, 1923 ‚Äì December 4, 2008) was an American art collector, whose collection of African art led to the formation of the National Museum of African Art at the Smithsonian Institution. Robbins was born in Worcester, Massachusetts, on September 4, 1923, to Jewish immigrants from Ukraine. He attend the University of New Hampshire where he earned a bachelor's degree in English in 1945. He was awarded a master's degree from the University of Michigan in 1949, majoring in history. After graduating from college, he taught briefly at Nurnberg American High School \\"Warren Robbins, dead at 85,\\" NAA Trichter, Vol 21, No 1, spring 2009, p 1. and then became a cultural affairs officer for the Department of State.Hevesi, Dennis. \\"Warren Robbins, Whose Collection Led to a Smithsonian, Dies at 85\\", The New York Times, December 10, 2008. Accessed December 11, 2008. While working as a cultural attach√© for the State Department at the United States Embassy in Bonn, he was walking the streets of Hamburg in the late 1950s or early 1960s with future United States Senator S. I. Hayakawa when he impulsively entered into an antiques shop and spent $15 on a carved-wood figure of a man and woman, the work of the Yoruba people of Nigeria. Back in Hamburg a year later, he spent $1,000 on 32 African masks, textiles and other pieces in a different shop. Returning to the United States, Robbins purchased a home in Washington, D.C. which he decorated with the 33 items he had brought back from Europe, and adorned the rooms with tropical plants to evoke the jungles of Africa. After an article was printed about his collection in The Washington Post, he invited in curious visitors who started appearing at his door to take a look. He created this informal museum in his basement as part of an effort to promote cultural communication during the Civil Rights Movement. Robbins was unapologetic in the face of complaints that he was a white man operating a museum of African art, noting that \\"I make no apologies for being white. You don't have to be Chinese to appreciate ancient ceramics, and you don't have to be a fish to be an ichthyologist.\\" He established the beginnings of a freestanding museum near Capitol Hill in 1963, raising $13,000 and taking a mortgage to purchase for $35,000 half of a home at 316-18 A Street Northeast that had been the residence of abolitionist Frederick Douglass from 1871 to 1877. When it opened in May 1964, it was the first museum in the United States dedicated to African art exclusively. The Frederick Douglass Institute of Negro Arts and History was established in 1966.Lemov, Penelope; and Werner, Gail. \\"African Art Museum and Douglass Institute Are Booming\\", The New York Times, June 29, 1969. Accessed December 12, 2008. In addition to Robbins' existing collection, the museum also displayed items borrowed from Life magazine photographer Eliot Elisofon and items on loan from the University of Pennsylvania Museum. In succeeding years, Robbins raised money to acquire the remaining half of the Douglass house, naming it the Museum of African Art. As the collection grew, he purchased adjoining residences, with his museum ultimately including nine townhouses, 16 garages and two carriage houses. His first visit to Africa was in 1973, by which time his museum's collections had grown to 5,000 pieces with a staff of 20. Robbins had raised funds to purchase from a Manhattan art gallery a bearded icon called Afo-A-Kom, considered sacred by the Kom people of West Africa, which had been taken from a hill-top village in Cameroon in 1966. Returning the figure, Robbins was welcomed by Nsom Nggue, then king of the Kom people, greeted by men and women in tribal dress. Robbins lobbied his friends in Congress to have the Smithsonian Institution assume management of the collection, which took place in 1979.Staff. \\"Smithsonian to Acquire Museum of African Art\\", The New York Times, August 14, 1979. Accessed December 12, 2008. He was the museum's first director, remaining in the position until 1983 when he was named founding director emeritus and a Smithsonian senior scholar, and replaced as director by Sylvia H. Williams. The museum was relocated to the National Mall in 1987 and renamed the National Museum of African Art. By the time of his death in 2008, the Museum included more than nine thousand objects from Africa, including headdresses, pottery, copper reliefs, musical instruments, baskets, and ceremonial objects, as well as more than 30 thousand volumes on African art, culture and history. Robbins died at age 85 on December 4, 2008 at George Washington University Hospital from complications resulting from a fall at his home a month before his death.Holley, Joe. \\"Museum of African Art Founder Warren Robbins\\", The Washington Post, December 5, 2008.

He was a member of the first Kentucky Senate. He was the brother of William Short; he married the daughter of John Cleves Symmes, and was a brother-in-law of future President William Henry Harrison. Early life Peyton Short was born December 17, 1761 to William and Elizabeth (Skipwith) Short at Spring Garden, their estate in Surry County, Virginia.Hamlin, p. 3 He received his early education under the tutelage of his brother William.Shackelford, p. 3 He followed his brother to The College of William and Mary where he was a member of Phi Beta Kappa Society.Shackelford, p. 4 The society was struggling to retain membership, and Short was frequently absent from meetings with poor or no excuse given. His attendance improved as his fines for tardiness and absenteeism grew. He graduated from William and Mary in 1780.Clark, p. 52 Though many sources refer to him as \\"Major\\" Peyton Short, no documentation of his rank has been discovered. If the rank was legitimate, it was most likely earned in either the Virginia or Kentucky militia. Upon his father's death, Short and his brother William became co-executors of their father's estate. Because of a scarcity of money in the family, they defied their father's request to immediately pay off all debts and instead decided to hold the majority of his assets for later investment. Short eventually merged much of his brother's inheritance with his own, with no explanation given.Shackelford, p. 9‚Äì10, 135 As a young lawyer, Short boarded with a widow in Harrodsburg, Kentucky. While there, he became acquainted with Rachel Donelson Robards, who would eventually become the wife of President Andrew Jackson. At the time, Robards was married to Lewis Robards, the son of the widow with whom Short was boarding. On one occasion, Robards came home to find his wife and Short having a conversation on the porch. He opined that Short was much too attentive to his wife. A heated argument ensued, and though Robards's mother took her daughter-in-law's side, Robards ordered Rachel never to show her face in the house again.Patterson, p. 19 Though they briefly reconciled, Robards accused Short of breaking up their marriage.Merrill, p. 170 Life in Kentucky Short came to Kentucky with future Governor of Kentucky Charles Scott.Speed, p. 78 Rather than cross the wilderness from Virginia, the pair traveled down the Ohio River and landed at the Falls of the Ohio. From there, Short journeyed to Lincoln County, settling in Danville. While there, he was invited to become a member of the Danville Political Club, a debating society that was active in that city from 1786 to 1790.Speed, p. 101 In 1788, he married Maria Symmes, the daughter of John Cleves Symmes, who he had met at James Wilkinson's house two years earlier. He moved to Greenfield, his estate in Woodford County about 1790. The couple had three children: Charles, John, and Anna. His son, John married Betsey Basset Harrison, the daughter of Peyton's brother-in-law, William Henry Harrison. That year, he partnered with Wilkinson in opening a general store.Merrill, pp. 170‚Äì171 Short took an active part in the early political and economic life of Kentucky. In 1789, he became the first collector of the port at Louisville. In 1791, he was elected one of the trustees of the city of Lexington, but resigned the post the following year.Staples, pp. 70, 78 He was one of the electors chosen to elect the first governor of Kentucky and its first state senators.Speed, p. 77 The other electors chose him to represent Fayette County in the first Kentucky Senate from 1792 to 1796. In 1793, Short became president of the Transylvania Company (a fund-raising organization for Transylvania Seminary, not the land speculation company).Peter, p. 45 In this capacity, he managed a lottery to raise funds for the school, which was later known as Transylvania University.Wilkinson, p. 51 He also served on the board of trustees for the seminary. He voted in the minority against elevating Harry Toulmin, a Unitarian, to the presidency of the historically Presbyterian institution. Short, Caleb Wallace, and Christopher Greenup resigned their positions on the board in protest.Peter, pp. 49‚Äì52 Short's wife Maria died in 1802. About 1803, he married Jane Churchill, widow of Armistead Churchill. Together, they had three daughters, Jane, Elizabeth, and Sarah. Jane Churchill-Short died in 1808 or 1809. Short engaged in land speculation and incurred severe financial losses. In 1809, he traveled through Mississippi Territory trying to recover his fortune.Merrill, p. 171 His attempt was futile, however, and by 1813 the only thing he owned was his own home.Shackelford, p. 140 Eventually, he had to sell the estate and relocated to Christian County, settling near Hopkinsville.

Lee Davis (born October 11, 1945) is a retired basketball player who played for eight seasons in the American Basketball Association (ABA). A center and forward during his career, he played for five different ABA teams and played in an ABA All-Star Game in 1970. Early life Davis was born in Raleigh, North Carolina. He also attended Ligon High School in Raleigh. After graduating, he enrolled at North Carolina Central University. In his four years at the college, Davis scored over 1,000 points and averaged over 15 points per game. New Orleans Buccaneers In 1968, Davis was selected by the National Basketball Association's Phoenix Suns in the 10th round of the NBA Draft. He was also drafted by the American Basketball Association's New Orleans Buccaneers in a separate draft that same year. Davis opted to play for the Bucs, where he became a role player for the Babe McCarthy-coached club. He played sparingly in his first two seasons with the club. During the 1969‚Äì1970 season, however, he was selected to the West Division's All-Star team at the ABA's 3rd Annual All-Star Game despite appearing in only sixteen games overall for the season. McCarthy was his coach in the game. His nine minutes played and three points scored in the game were higher than his regular season averages that year. Memphis Pros and Memphis Tams The Buccaneers moved to Memphis for the 1970‚Äì71 season and became the Memphis Pros. Davis remained with the franchise and played for two seasons with the Pros. During the 1970‚Äì71 season, he played in twelve minutes per game and averaged six points per game, season bests at the time. His playing time regressed the following season and his numbers dropped accordingly. The Pros were renamed the Memphis Tams in time for the 1972‚Äì73 season, and Babe McCarthy was replaced as head coach by Bob Bass. Under Bass, Davis' playing time increased and his numbers followed suit; he set new season highs by averaging thirteen points per game and eight rebounds per game. His playing time diminished slightly in the 1973‚Äì74 season, one which saw Bass be replaced by Butch van Breda Kolff, and he averaged over five fewer points and two-and-a-half rebounds per game fewer than he did the previous year. San Diego Conquistadors and San Diego Sails Davis left the Tams as a free agent and went on to join the San Diego Conquistadors for the 1974‚Äì75 season. He shot 52.8% from the field in his first season, finishing among the league's top ten in field goal percentage, while averaging nearly twelve points and six-and-a-half rebounds per game. The following season, the Conquistadors were sold to new ownership, who renamed the team the San Diego Sails. Davis was one of only three players, along with Bo Lamar and Caldwell Jones, who were retained by the Sails for the 1975‚Äì76 season. The Sails would only last 11 games before folding; Davis played in only fifty-one minutes in seven games with the Sails. These were the final games of his professional career. He retired having scored over 3,500 points and having grabbed over 2,000 rebounds in his eight-season career.

His death without heirs or a will led to the Old Z√ºrich War. Death of Friedrich VII in Feldkirch, 1436 Born at Solavers Castle near Gr√ºsch in the district of Pr√§ttigau/Davos in the Swiss canton of Graub√ºnden, he was the son of Diethelm and Katharina von Werdenberg-Heiligenberg. After 1387 he was at the head of the line of succession for the family. In 1391 he married Elisabeth von Matsch. He was only loosely involved in the daily operations of his lands, but was very involved in military affairs. He was a member of a small group of very successful military leaders in the region. Until 1406 he was a condottiero for the Austrians for which he received rights to the cities of Sargans, Windegg, Freudenberg and Nidberg. He then made peace with his enemies which protected his old and new estates. On 21 January 1407 Fridrich von Toggenburg, Herr zu Brettengow und Tafas donated to his own and the salvation of his ancestors who were buried (at the R√ºti church) and where he also expects to be buried, the church rights of Wangen in der March to the R√ºti Abbey, sealed by Fridrich and the knights Herman von Landenberg, Johans von Bonstetten from Ustra and Herman von der Hochenlandenberg. In 1417 he acquired the rights over the city of Feldkirch and in 1424 added Rheineck and Altst√§tten. Following his successful invasion of Appenzell, in 1428 at the end of the Appenzell Wars, he had acquired almost all the Austrian possessions from Rheineck to Montafon as well as the county of Werdenburg from Sargans to the upper regions of Lake Zurich. While he did have at least one illegitimate son, Johannes, he died without heirs or a will on 30 April 1436 and was buried in the R√ºti Abbey respectively R√ºti Church.

Plans specified not only the general layout of the house and garage, but the specific dimensions of each stone and its location, using a technique of \\"built by detail\\". The comfort station is located at the intersection of Rim Rock Drive and the Saddlehorn Loop, named after a distinctive nearby rock formation.

Born in Mansfield, England in 1886, Martin emigrated to the US as a boy and lived out the remainder of his life as an American.

An autoguider is an automatic electronic guidance tool used in astronomy to keep a telescope pointed precisely at an object being observed. This prevents the object from drifting across the field of view during long-exposures which would create a blurred or elongated image. Usage Imaging of dim celestial targets, usually deep sky objects, requires exposure times of many minutes, particularly when narrowband images are being taken. In order for the resulting image to maintain usable clarity and sharpness during these exposures, the target must be held at the same position within the telescope's field of view during the whole exposure; any apparent motion would cause point sources of light (such as stars) to appear as streaks, or the object being photographed to appear blurry. Even computer-tracked mounts and GoTo telescopes do not eliminate the need for tracking adjustments for exposures beyond a few minutes, as astrophotography demands an extremely high level of precision that these devices typically cannot achieve, especially if the mount is not properly polar aligned.note: This can be accomplished by manually adjusting the orientation of one or both axes of an equatorial mount to hold either the target itself or a nearby guide star at a certain position, but such a method is difficult and time-consuming. To accomplish this automatically an autoguider is usually attached to either a guidescope or finderscope, which is a smaller telescope oriented in the same direction as the main telescope, or an off-axis guider, which uses a prism to divert some of the light originally headed towards the eyepiece. The device has a CCD or CMOS sensor that regularly takes short exposures of an area of sky near the object. After each image is captured, a computer measures the apparent motion of one or more stars within the imaged area and issues the appropriate corrections to the telescope's computerized mount. Some computer controlled telescope mounts have an autoguiding port that connects directly to the autoguider (usually referred to as an ST-4 port, which works with analog signals).http://www.themcdonalds.net/richard/index.php?title=Astrophotography_Equipment:_Autoguiding#Mount_with_Autoguider_Connector An autoguider need not be an independent unit; some high-end CCD imaging units (such as those offered by SBIG) have a second, integrated CCD sensor on the same plane as the main imaging chip that is dedicated to autoguiding. Astronomical video cameras or modified webcams can also serve as an autoguiding unit when used with guiding software such as Guidedog or PHD Guiding, or general-purpose astronomical programs such as MaxDSLR. However, these setups are generally not as sensitive as specialized units. Since an image of a star can take up more than one pixel on an image sensor due to lens imperfections and other effects, autoguiders use the amount of light falling on each pixel to calculate where the star should actually be located. As a result, most autoguiders have subpixel accuracy. In other words, the star can be tracked to an accuracy better than the angular size represented by one CCD pixel. However, atmospheric effects (astronomical seeing) typically limit accuracy to one arcsecond in most situations. To prevent the telescope from moving in response to changes in the guide star's apparent position caused by seeing, the user can usually adjust a setting called \\"aggressiveness\\".

Reviewing for the Xbox, GameSpot's reviewer Matthew Gallant said \\"It's not a stunningly accurate sim, it doesn't provide the sort of overview of Mercedes- Benz cars that you'd expect, and its graphical presentation has more than a few flaws.\\" IGN's reviewer Justin Thompson said \\"The ability to leave the game's tracks and explore its massive environments, however, gives it a relaxing quality that's surprisingly refreshing.\\" Official Xbox Magazine said \\"With 110 cars, seven stupidly gigantic courses, amazing (if arcadey) graphics, and staggering freedom of movement (once you unlock free roam modes), it's hard not to recommend this.\\" A European reviewer on Xbox, Tom Bramwell, who was reviewing at the time for Eurogamer, said \\"It's too hard, it's a bit feebly constructed in places, and it plays too much like real driving, which, for a game laden with UFOs, is a bit of a contradiction.\\" Reviewing for the PlayStation 2, PlayStation 2 Mag gave it a 5/10, and PlayStation 2 Max gave the game 5.2/10, giving the game mixed reviews. However, Play UK was very negative and gave it 28%. Reviewing for the GameCube, N-Europe gave the game 5/10.

Origin(s)  The theory of a division of consciousness was touched upon by Carl Jung in 1935 when he stated, \\"The so-called unity of consciousness is an illusion... we like to think that we are one but we are not.\\"(Review: Dissociationism Revived, Matthew Hugh Erdelyi, Science, New Series, Vol. 200, No. 4342 (May 12, 1978), pp. 654-655; Published by: American Association for the Advancement of Science) Ernest Hilgard believed that hypnosis causes a split in awareness and a vivid form of everyday mind splits.(Myers, David G. Psychology: Eighth Edition in Modules. New York, NY: Worth Publishers, 2007) Drawing themes from Pierre Janet, Hilgard viewed hypnosis from this perspective as a willingness to divide the main systems of consciousness into different sectors. He argued that this split in consciousness can not only help define the state of mind reached during hypnosis, but can also help to define a vast range of psychological issues such as multiple personality disorder. In Hilgard's Divided Consciousness Reconsidered, he offers a great many examples of \\"dissociated\\" human behavior. With regard to theory, he does state that it is useful to assign two modes of consciousness, a receptive mode and an active mode‚Äîthat is, a bimodal consciousness. In other places he mentions the concept of coconsciousness, wherein two or more states of consciousness may be equally receptive or active, as, for example, in some types of multiple personality.Huebner, B. (1979). Distributing cognition: A defense of collective mentality, Journal of Psycholinguistic Research, 8 (6),591; Retrieved from Many psychological studies assume a unity of consciousness. Doubt is cast on this assumption by psychophysical studies in normal subjects and those with blindsight showing the simultaneous dissociation of different modes of report of a sensation, and by clinical studies of anosognosic patients showing dissociations of awareness of their own states. These and other phenomena are interpreted to imply two kinds of division of consciousness: the separation of phenomenal experience from reflexive consciousness and the non-unity of reflexive consciousness. Reflexive consciousness is taken to be necessary for report and is associated with the self as the subject of experience and agent of report. Reflexive consciousness is operative only when we attend to our own states. When we are involved in the world reflexivity intervenes less and our consciousness is more unified.Hebb, D, Juzyck, P, Klein R.,(1983). The Nature of Thought, Medical Research Council, Applied Psychology Unit, Cambridge, UK.

Others, such as one performed on 169 undergraduate students, some of whom performed tasks in selective attention and divided attention conditions being correlated with scores on the Harvard Group Scale of Hypnotic Susceptibility refute Hilgard‚Äôs findings.Some operationalizations of the neodissociation concept and their relationship to hypnotic susceptibility. Stava, Lawrence J.; Jaffa, Melvyn. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology. Vol 54(6), Jun 1988, 989-996.) New trends in psychology and cognitive neuroscience suggest that applications of nonlinear dynamics, chaos and self-organization seem to be particularly important for research of some fundamental problems regarding mind-brain relationship. Relevant problems among others are formations of memories during alterations of mental states and nature of a barrier that divides mental states, and leads to the process called dissociation. This process is related to a formation of groups of neurons which often synchronize their firing patterns in a unique spatial manner. The central theme of this study is the relationship between level of moving and oscillating mental processes and their neurophysiological substrate. This presents a question about principles of organization of the conscious experience and how the experiences happen in the brain. Chaotic self-organization provides a unique theoretical and experimental tool for deeper understanding of dissociative phenomena and enables to study how dissociative phenomena can be linked to epileptiform discharges which are related to various forms of psychological and somatic manifestations. Organizing principles that constitute human consciousness and other mental phenomena from this point of view may be described by analysis and reconstruction of underlying dynamics of psychophysiological measures.Chaos, brain and divided consciousness.

In 1874 James Bennett Wilder built a home on farm acreage he called Bashford Manor. In 1887 George Long purchased Bashford Manor and developed it into a leading Thoroughbred horse farm which bred three Kentucky Derby winners. To stock his new breeding operation. George Long acquired horses from the Erdenheim Stud of Norman W. Kittson. Following the May 1888 death of Norman W. Kittson, in November his estate auctioned the bloodstock and Long purchased the sire Alarm and two of his broodmare daughters, Luminous and Albia. The then nineteen- year-old Alarm had notably been the sire of Himyar and Panique. Alarm died at Bashford Manor in 1895 and was buried in the farm's equine cemetery. The stable bred and raced Azra who won the 1892 Derby and Sir Huon who won it in 1906. Under Long's name, he raced homebred Hindus who won the 1900 Preakness Stakes. As well, George Long bred Manuel who won the 1899 Derby for Alfred & Dave Morris. The Thoroughbred operation continued until 1922 when the bloodstock was sold. The home remained in Long's family until being sold in 1951. The property was annexed by the City of Louisville in 1953. The barns were torn down in 1970 and the house in 1973.

Description Acanthurus dussumieri is a deep-bodied, laterally-compressed oval fish with a maximum length of . The head is small, with slightly prominent eyes, a small beak-like mouth and inflated, pale lips. The body is smooth, being covered with small scales, but like other surgeon-fish, it has a pair of scalpel-like, modified scales on the caudal peduncle; these can either be folded flat or raised in defence. Both dorsal and anal fins are long, and the pectoral fins are used for locomotion and balance. The throat is blue, and the rest of the head has a dense network of blue or grey-blue lines, which are wider than the fine grey- blue, wavy, longitudinal lines on the pale brownish body. There is a broad orange bar above the eyes and a narrow orange band borders the base of the dorsal fin. The scalpel-like scales are white and are surrounded by a black blotch. The caudal fin is crescent-shaped, dark blue speckled with black apart from a pale base. Along with Acanthurus mata and Acanthurus xanthopterus, it is one of the largest species of surgeonfish. Juvenile fish are greyish with yellow and black caudal fins at first, but the body colour becomes dark brown later.

He was named head of the Department of Mathematics in 2014 and held that position for 3 years. A prior Sloan fellow and Young Presidential Investigator, in 1994 he was an invited speaker at the International Congress of Mathematicians (ICM) in Zurich. In 2007, he received the Oswald Veblen Prize in Geometry from the AMS jointly with Peter Kronheimer, \\"for their joint contributions to both three- and four-dimensional topology through the development of deep analytical techniques and applications.\\" He was named a Guggenheim Fellow in 2010, and in 2011 received the Doob Prize with Peter B.

Research  Mrowka's work combines analysis, geometry, and topology, specializing in the use of partial differential equations, such as the Yang-Mills equations from particle physics to analyze low-dimensional mathematical objects. Jointly with Robert Gompf, he discovered four- dimensional models of space-time topology. In joint work with Peter Kronheimer, Mrowka settled many long-standing conjectures, three of which earned them the 2007 Veblen Prize. The award citation mentions three papers that Mrowka and Kronheimer wrote together. The first paper in 1995 deals with Donaldson's polynomial invariants and introduced Kronheimer‚ÄìMrowka basic class, which have been used to prove a variety of results about the topology and geometry of 4-manifolds, and partly motivated Witten's introduction of the Seiberg‚ÄìWitten invariants. The second paper proves the so-called Thom conjecture and was one of the first deep applications of the then brand new Seiberg‚ÄìWitten equations to four-dimensional topology. In the third paper in 2004, Mrowka and Kronheimer used their earlier development of Seiberg‚ÄìWitten monopole Floer homology to prove the Property P conjecture for knots. The citation says: \\"The proof is a beautiful work of synthesis which draws upon advances made in the fields of gauge theory, symplectic and contact geometry, and foliations over the past 20 years.\\" In further recent work with Kronheimer, Mrowka showed that a certain subtle combinatorially-defined knot invariant introduced by Mikhail Khovanov can detect ‚Äúknottedness.‚Äù References External links * Mrowka's website at MIT * Living people 20th-century American mathematicians 21st-century American mathematicians American people of Polish descent University of California, Berkeley alumni 1961 births Massachusetts Institute of Technology faculty Topologists Differential geometers Mathematicians from Pennsylvania Stanford University Department of Mathematics faculty California Institute of Technology faculty People from State College, Pennsylvania ","title":"Tomasz Mrowka"},{"id":"20652011","text":"Maebongsan is a mountain in the county of Yeongwol, Gangwon-do in South Korea.

She is a member of the Legislative Assembly of Alberta for Edmonton-Strathcona, and leader of the Alberta New Democratic Party. The daughter of former Alberta NDP leader Grant Notley, she was a lawyer before entering politics; she focused on labour law, with a specialty in workers' compensation advocacy and workplace health and safety issues. Notley was first elected to the Legislative Assembly in the 2008 provincial election, succeeding former NDP leader Raj Pannu. Six years later on October 18, 2014, Notley won the Alberta New Democratic Party leadership election on the first ballot with 70% of the vote and went on to lead the party to a majority victory in the 2015 provincial election, ending 44 years of rule by the Progressive Conservative Association of Alberta. In the 2019 provincial election, the NDP government was defeated by the United Conservative Party, making Notley the Leader of the Opposition.  Background  Notley was born on April 17, 1964,Legislative Assembly of Alberta Library in Edmonton, Alberta, and was raised outside of the town of Fairview, Alberta, the daughter of Sandra Mary \\"Sandy\\" (Wilkinson) and Alberta NDP Leader and MLA Grant Notley.Legislative Assembly of Alberta She is the first Alberta Premier to be born in Edmonton. Notley is the sister of Paul Notley and Stephen Notley, author and illustrator of Bob the Angry Flower. Her mother, a devout Anglican, was born in Concord, Massachusetts, and moved to Alberta as an adult. Notley was unafraid to challenge older political leaders as a college student, even asking her father at an Alberta NDP public meeting on poverty and student debt for his advice to a \\"poor student whose parents made too much money for her to get a loan while at the same time being too cheap to give her enough money to buy food.\\" Notley credits her mother Sandy with getting her involved in activism, taking Notley to an anti-war demonstration before she was even ten years old. She remained unsure about whether or not to enter public office until she was in her 30s. Alongside her own family background, Notley has also cited her high school social studies teacher Jim Clevette as having made a lasting impact when it comes to her interest in politics. She has also claimed Jack Layton as being a personal hero. Notley was a twenty- year-old undergraduate at the University of Alberta when her father died on October 19, 1984. After attending a large party she received a call at four in the morning from Tom Sigurdson, her father's executive assistant, stating that there had been a plane crash and that she should return home. This was not the first accident her father had been in; as part of his frequent trips across the province he had already been in several other plane accidents as well as an automobile collision with an elk. Fellow NDP MLA and future Alberta NDP leader Ray Martin later called to confirm to Notley that her father was indeed dead. It was then left up to Notley to inform her mother of the news. A day after her election as Alberta NDP leader, she would lead the 30th anniversary memorial of her father's death. Notley earned a Bachelor of Arts (BA) in Political Science at the University of Alberta, and a law degree at Osgoode Hall Law School. While at Osgoode Hall she became active in the 1989 Federal NDP leadership convention where she endorsed second-place finisher and former B.C. Premier Dave Barrett. She is married to Lou Arab, a Communications Representative for the Canadian Union of Public Employees and a campaign strategist for the party. She lives with him and their two children in the historic district of Old Strathcona located in south-central Edmonton. Notley is a cyclist, jogger, and skier, as well as a reformed smoker. Activism After law school, Notley articled for Edmonton labour lawyer Bob Blakely, and went on to work for the Alberta Union of Provincial Employees representing members with Workers' Compensation cases. In 1994, Notley moved to Vancouver, British Columbia, where she worked for the Health Sciences Association of BC as their occupational health and safety officer.The Report: Newsletter of the Health Sciences Association of BC Safety concerns in your workplace? See your Safety Steward! During her time in BC, she worked for one year as a ministerial assistant to Attorney General Ujjal Dosanjh. In this role, she was part of the team that first expanded the application of BC's family relations laws to same sex couples, several years before the Government of Canada took similar initiatives. Notley acted as a representative of the provincial labour movement in the negotiation and drafting of new workplace health and safety standards. During her time in Vancouver, Notley was active with \\"Moms on the Move\\", an organization that advocated for the rights of special needs children. She is also a past board member of the Vancouver Community College. Notley returned to Edmonton in 2002. She worked for a short time for the National Union of Public and General Employees (NUPGE),NUPGE website Nationwide campaign targets Liberal inaction on medicare worked at Athabasca University,Athabasca University 2004/05 Calendar' acted as volunteer co- ordinator for the Friends of Medicare \\"Romanow Now\\" campaign, and finally as a labour relations officer for the United Nurses of Alberta. Notley did volunteer work with the Strathcona Community League in 2006, assisting with a drive to garner support for the installation of sidewalks in east Strathcona.  Early political career  = Entry into provincial politics = Rachel Notley as an MLA in 2009 Notley headed the election-planning subcommittee for the Alberta NDP in 1991, two years before the 1993 provincial election which shut the party out of the legislature. She became involved again with Alberta provincial politics in 2000 following the resignation of Pam Barrett as both Alberta NDP leader and the MLA for Edmonton-Highlands. Notley traveled to Edmonton to help Brian Mason successfully retain the seat for the Alberta NDP in the face of a concerted effort by the Alberta Liberal Party to take it back. In October 2006, she was nominated by acclamation as the Alberta NDP candidate in the provincial constituency of Edmonton-Strathcona, succeeding former Alberta NDP leader Raj Pannu. The event was attended by then Federal NDP leader Jack Layton. Notley had previously considered running in the 2004 provincial election, but had refrained from doing so because her two children were still toddlers at the time. She was subsequently elected as an MLA in the 2008 Alberta provincial election. She was re-elected in the 2012 Alberta provincial election with the highest share of the vote of any MLA in Alberta at that time. One month after her election in 2008 two Greenpeace protesters sneaked into the Shaw Conference Centre in Edmonton during a fundraising dinner for then Progressive Conservative premier Ed Stelmach to unfurl a banner that read \\"Stelmach: The Best Premier Oil Money Can Buy\\" in protest of his government's environmental policies. One of the protesters, a woman by the name of Denise Ogonoski, worked two days a week in Notley's constituency office. Notley described the issue as being a \\"personnel matter\\", saying that it was something she was \\"going to discuss with her in person and not through the media.\\" During her early days in office, Alberta NDP leader Brian Mason found her to be quick on her feet with an outgoing and warm personality. He also described her as being very nervous immediately after she was first elected as an MLA, not wanting to be left alone as the party's sole member in the legislature even when Mason was only leaving to go to the washroom. Despite these initial problems, Mason said she would go on to become \\"an articulate and passionate politician, a parliamentarian and a very, very effective communicator.\\" On October 18, 2014, Notley won the leadership of Alberta's New Democratic Party with 70% support, succeeding Brian Mason and becoming the 9th leader of the party. She defeated fellow MLA David Eggen and union leader Rod Loyola on the first ballot. In addition to serving as party leader, Notley was critic for Health, International and Intergovernmental Relations, Status of Women, Justice, and Executive Council. =2015 election= Notley's first leadership test was in the May 5, 2015 provincial election. Following the reveal of a budget that slashed social spending, raised taxes and fees, and held the line on low corporate taxes, the incumbent Progressive Conservative premier, Jim Prentice, called the election. With the Official Opposition Wildrose Party reeling from a series of floor crossings and mass defections, most pundits and commentators felt that the PCs had a good shot at winning their thirteenth consecutive majority in the Legislature. With strong polling in Edmonton, some felt the Alberta NDP would form the official opposition. By the middle of the campaign, however, pollsters began predicting a three-way race between the Progressive Conservatives, the Alberta NDP, and the Wildrose Party. Notley had managed to capitalize on the unpopularity of the PCs' budget, stating that she would instead raise corporate taxes and rollback fees and cuts. The sole televised leaders' debate proved to be a turning point, with Notley largely viewed as having the best performance. Jim Prentice also came under fire for saying \\"I know math is difficult\\" to Notley, in reference to the embarrassing miscalculation in the proposed NDP budget released two days prior, a remark which was widely seen as sexist and patronizing. Despite her strong performance, Notley herself admitted to having been extremely nervous leading up the event. By the final week, the NDP emerged as the front runner. Notley herself said that she first realized she would be Alberta's next premier when she took a break in her hotel room a week before the election to read a credible poll that put the NDP solidly in first place. While she initially planned a whirlwind schedule to close out the campaign, she realized that this would have not only left her looking extremely haggard during her victory speech, but also would have left her without time to make plans for a transition. On election night, the NDP won 54 seats, re-electing their four incumbents as well as 50 new members to the Legislative Assembly. The NDP had been expected to make a strong showing in Edmonton, which has traditionally been much friendlier to centre-left candidates than the rest of Alberta. However, they took every riding in the capital, all by very large margins‚Äîa result that exceeded even the most optimistic NDP projections. Even more surprisingly, the NDP took 15 seats in Calgary, long reckoned as the power base for both the provincial and federal Tories. This was mainly due to massive vote splitting between the Tories and Wildrose‚Äîa phenomenon which allowed the NDP to sweep Red Deer. The NDP also swept the city of Lethbridge in its own right and won 16 seats in the rest of Alberta, mostly in the northern and central parts of the province.  Premiership  Notley held her first caucus meeting as Premier-designate on May 9, 2015. Three days later, Notley announced that she would be retaining the previous head of the Alberta public service, Richard Dicerni, as well as appointing NDP party strategists Brian Topp and Adrienne King as her chief of staff and deputy chief of staff, respectively.Alberta Government. \\"Premier Designate Notley retains the current head of the Alberta public service\\", May 12, 2015. She also met with outgoing Premier Jim Prentice that same day, in addition to extending the deadline for the province's school boards to submit their budgets, her first major deviation from the previous PC government's financial commitments as Premier-designate. On May 22, 2015, Notley suspended Calgary-Bow MLA Deborah Drever from the Alberta NDP caucus after a series of controversial postings by Drever were discovered on social media websites such as Instagram and Facebook.\\"Here's the image that finally got NDP MLA Deborah Drever suspended from caucus\\". Calgary Herald, May 22, 2015. Notley had previously announced that she had directed Drever, as a result of the media attention, to create a plan to improve education on violence against women, particularly outreach to groups working with vulnerable young women.\\"MLA Deborah Drever, under fire for 'highly inappropriate' photo, to work with outreach groups\\". Metro, May 20, 2015. This was before a later image surfaced which was considered to be homophobic, something which Notley apologized for on behalf of the party. =Swearing-in= Rachel Notley after being sworn in as the 17th Premier of Alberta alongside her cabinet on the steps of the Alberta Legislature Building Notley was sworn-in as the 17th Premier of Alberta along with her cabinet on May 24, 2015.\\"Rachel Notley sworn in as Alberta premier, reveals cabinet,\\" CBC News May 24, 2015. When she took office she ended an 80-year streak of centre-right governments in Alberta (Social Credit from 1935 to 1971 and the Tories from 1971 to 2015). Her twelve-member cabinet was the smallest in the country, containing only 14% of the legislature's members. The slimmed down cabinet was met with a mixed response from pundits; some said it showed the NDP's lack of experienced people while others felt that it brought a much needed sense of economy and individual importance to the various positions. The swearing-in ceremony was an unusually public event, held on the steps of the Alberta Legislature Building in front of a large crowd of spectators while a folk band played the national anthem and free popsicles and food were distributed from food trucks. The Alberta NDP was criticized, though, for using the event as a part of its party fundraising, for which they later apologized. The ceremony cost $19,298; more expensive than the swearing-in ceremonies of the previous two premiers, but still less than the expenditure for the swearing-in of Alison Redford in 2011. =Speech from the Throne= The government's first throne speech was read by newly appointed Lieutenant-Governor Lois Mitchell on June 15, 2015. The speech announced three bills intended to ban corporate and union donations to political parties and to increase taxes on large corporations and high income earners, ending the flat tax rate that had been in place since the premiership of Ralph Klein. Both of these proposals were promised as part of the Alberta NDP's election platform. That same day Notley also announced the creation of a seventeen-member all-party committee tasked to look into ways to improve government accountability in areas such as whistleblower protection, electioneering, and conflicts of interest. The government also reached out to the Opposition benches by having the committee be initiated through a joint motion with Wildrose Party leader Brian Jean, with Liberal leader David Swann also being tasked with helping conduct a review of provincial mental health policy along with NDP MLA Danielle Larivee. =Aboriginal relations= On June 22, 2015, Notley apologized to the Aboriginal community of Alberta for a long history of neglect by prior governments. In particular she apologized for the province not addressing the issue with decades of abuse at government- and church-operated residential schools. Notley pledged that her government would engage and improve living conditions of Alberta's Aboriginal community. Notley joined the chorus of Canadian premiers demanding a federal inquiry into the issue of missing and murdered Aboriginal women. The inquiry is intended to prevent abductions with early intervention and investigations of root issues affecting high-risk Aboriginal females. On December 8, 2015, Notley tweeted out her support of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's announcement that a national inquiry into missing and murdered indigenous women and girls would be immediately launched. On December 15, 2015, Notley expressed her support for the recommendations outlined in the Truth and Reconciliation Committee's final report. The budget of 2017 included $100 million to upgrade the provincial and federal waterworks facilities that provide drinkable water for Albertan First Nations Communities. Thirteen communities have endured chronic boil water advisory conditions for two decades.Ramsay, C (March 17, 2017) 'Alberta Budget 2017:$100M committed for clean drinking water on First Nations', Metronews:Edmonton. Retrieved from http://globalnews.ca/news/3318328/alberta- budget-2017-100m-committed-for-clean-drinking-water-on-first-nations/, Retrieved on March 20, 2017. In 2018, the Albertan government sold 150 hectares of land to the Fort McKay First Nation for $1.6 million. The dealing was a precedent-setting event for the M√©tis. = Climate change and environment= On November 22, 2015, Notley unveiled Alberta's updated climate change strategy, in time for the COP 21 conference in Paris. In doing so, Notley acted upon one of the NDP's central campaign promises: for years, the NDP had criticized the former PC government's inaction on the climate change file. The plan was described in multiple media outlets as bold and far- reaching. This policy shift came about partly because of the characterization of Alberta oil as 'some of the dirtiest in the world' by US President Barack Obama, which the Premier likened to a \\"kick in the teeth\\". The plan includes an economy-wide carbon tax starting in 2017 and a cap on emissions from the oil sands. The plan also includes a phase out of coal-fired electricity by 2030, a 10-year goal to halve methane emissions, as well as incentives for renewable energy. The plan won plaudits from both environmental groups and oil executives, who were present behind Notley at the announcement in Edmonton. The Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers also applauded the plan, saying it \\"provides direction that will allow the oil and natural gas industry to grow, further enhance its environmental performance through technological innovation, and is expected to improve market access to allow Canadian oil to reach more markets.\\" The carbon tax is expected to raise $3 billion annually by 2018. Although Notley initially indicated that the carbon tax would be revenue neutral, similar to the structure imposed in neighbouring British Columbia, the plan did not cut any personal taxes, bringing into doubt Notley's assertion of revenue neutrality. Notley acted on the recommendations of a five-member panel appointed by Shannon Phillips, the Minister of Environment. In November 2016, $1.4 billion was paid to compensate three major Albertan power producers: ATCO, Capital Power, and Transalta to expedite the transition caused by the closure of six coal fired power plants. The compensation will be derived from the Carbon Tax and will be paid over a period of 14 years. In 2017, The Notley government resumed to address the proliferation of abandoned wells by budgeting $235 million for the Orphan Well Association to begin land reclamation and rehabilitation of thousands of abandoned wells in the province.

The revisions were the first overhaul of Alberta's labour laws in three decades. In 2017, Saskatchewan Premier Brad Wall's government instigated a moratorium on vehicles with Albertan licence plates at government project sites in Saskatchewan. The Saskatchewan government initially said the ban was in response to reports that vehicles with Saskatchewan plates were being barred from Alberta sites, but did not provide evidence for these claims. Wall later claimed the ban was due to what he described as a \\"disturbing pattern of protectionist behaviour\\", citing, among other things, Alberta's $1.25-per-litre mark-up on beer prices in 2016. Notley's government responded by enacting the arbitration clause of the New West Partnership inter-provincial trade agreement. In January 2018, Saskatchewan rescinded the 'plate wars' moratorium in what it called a measure of good faith in advance of a decision on Alberta's beer prices by the Agreement on Internal Trade appeal panel. In early 2018, an inter-provincial trade dispute between the British Columbian NDP and Albertan NDP hampered the export of resources. Alberta's AGLC ceased to export wine produced in BC. Notley's government chose this as retaliation for Hogan's government decision to limit export of Bitumen from Alberta as protest to ongoing discussion of the proposed Trans Mountain Pipeline expansion. In 2017, Alberta imported $72 million of BC wine. However hospitality service businesses in Alberta worry their industry could be harmed with a prolonged embargo.Heidenreich,P.(Feb 6, 2018)'B.C.

The government's Bill 31 of 2017 'A Better Deal for Consumers and Businesses Act' enacted a number of reforms to enhance consumer protections. Such as the abolition of purchasing bots to purchase blocks of online tickets for popular demanded events to prevent their inflated resale by the operators of such applications. The abolition of purchasing bots was enacted in August 2018. Consumers are empowered to sue the operators of bots if they have been financially injured should sellers and promoters of shows inadvertently fail to detect clandestine online bots.Parrish, J (August 1, 2018) 'Alberta's ban on ticket scalper bots in effect', CTV News: Edmontonretrieved from https://edmonton.ctvnews.ca/alberta-s-ban-on-ticket-scalper-bots-in- effect-1.4036696, retrieved on August 9, 2018 The act also requires auto repair mechanics to provide a warranty for repair services, an estimate for the work. Consumers will also be empowered to litigate violators of consumer rights. High interest lenders and money transaction services will be regulated. In 2019, the Albertan government agreed to lease 4,400 oil cars from Canadian Pacific rail and Canadian National rail. The service will resume in the summer of 2019 with an initial capacity of 20,000 barrels per day. The potential revenue expected is $6 billion over three years.Bellefontaine, M.(Feb, 19, 2019).'

The freeze was initially meant to last two years, but it was extended until 2018. The NDP government also reversed a 1.4 per cent cut to post-secondary institutions and instead increased base funding by two per cent. In 2016, to fulfill her campaign promise Notley's government implemented a pilot program aimed at providing Alberta's neediest children with nutritious sustenance lunch programs. The program is expected to expand in coming years. Key events in Premiership In 2016, a wild fire devastated Fort McMurray. In October 2016 Notley visited the construction site of the first rebuilt house. She rededicated an overpass crossing Highway 63, where first responders had welcomed residents home, as 'Responders Way Bridge'. Notley welcomed former PC MLA Sandra Jansen into her party in November 2016. Jansen withdrew her membership and party leadership candidacy which she took to challenge the candidacy of Jason Kenney. She claimed that she was harassed over her position on human rights issues such as LGBTQ rights and abortion by Kenney's supporters. She warned of a hostile take over of democratic values by Kenney's campaign. Notley granted Jansen with a security detail as reports of vulgar death threats threatened Jansen. Notley and Ma Xingrui, governor of Guangdong Province of China signed a provincial sistering agreement in 2017 during an economic trade mission to Asia.Bartko, K.(April 24, 2017)'Alberta and China's Guangdong become sister provinces'.'Global News, retrieved on April 26, 2017. Retrieved from http://globalnews.ca/news/3399909/alberta-and-chinas-guangdong-become-sister- provinces/, = Oil curtailments = On December 2, 2018 Notely announced the Alberta government would be instating oil production curtailments. The curtailments were meant to minimize lost revenue due to oil being sold at a lower market value as a bottleneck in transportation. The Alberta government rarely utilized this power, the last time was during the National Energy Program to limit federal revenues. Curtailments took affect in January 2019, under the Oil and Gas Conservation Act with the Alberta Energy Regulator monitoring the program. =Opiate Fentanyl epidemic= Since 2016, Notley's government was tasked with a fatal opiate epidemic as Fentanyl emerged on the street narcotic market. Notley's government responded with harm reduction counter measures such as the distribution of Naloxone injection kits and Naloxone spray for Edmontonian and Calgarian police and EMS. Alberta Liberal Party leader David Swann petitioned the Notley government to issue a state of emergency. Neighbouring province British Columbia issued a state of emergency as did the Blood Tribe and Nakota nations as frequent and close succession fatal overdoses on these First Nations communities as well throughout Alberta. However, as of November 2016 the Notley government views the measure inappropriate as Albertan medical facilities were already established and gained experience through epidemics such as SARS. However the health ministry is showing great interest in the prospect of establishing safe sites in Edmonton and is reviewing the data for the harm reduction approach. Associate health minister NDP MLA Brandy Payne granted $230K to the 'Access to Medically Supervised Injection Services Edmonton' to apply for permission to establish a 'safe site' in Edmonton. Increased funding was allocated to treatment and for the communities to explore the prospect of operating 'safe sites'. However, Fentanyl is usually ground and inhaled or ingested and not injected. To further compound and aggravate the situation more potent Opiates such as W-18 and Carfentanil are emerging on the menu of illicit narcotics in Alberta. These compounds may be resistant to harm reduction counter measures such as the antidote Naloxone. =Threats against Notley= After becoming Alberta's 17th premier, Notley started to encounter abuse from Albertans who did not align with her values. As stated by the Edmonton Sun, \\"The statistics show that from 2003 to 2015, Alberta sheriffs recorded 55 security incidents involving six premiers. Nineteen of those came in the last half of 2015, which happened to be current Premier Rachel Notley's first months in office. At least three of those incidents required police intervention.\\" Most of the threats against Notley proliferated online with photos and posts, encouraging violence against the premier. According to statistics in 2016 from Alberta Justice, Notley is the Alberta premier with the most death threats. She was the subject of 412 harassment communiques, of which 26 were investigated by law enforcement. A professor argued that there have been growing trends of violence against female politicians. Most of these threats had been attributed to the NDP government's controversial farm safety legislation, Bill 6, which made Worker Compensation Board coverage mandatory on Alberta farms with paid, non-family employees, leading to thousands of protesters. Official Opposition leader and Wildrose Party Leader Brian Jean, despite criticizing Bill 6, made a call for the abuse directed at Notley to cease or else he would alert authorities. In late August 2016, Jean joked \\"I've been beating this drum for 10, 11 years. I will continue to beat it, I promise. But it's against the law to beat Rachel Notley\\", for which he apologized immediately for what he called ‚Äúan inappropriate attempt at humour.‚Äù Defeat Following Notley's win in the 2015 provincial election, the opposition Wildrose Party and third-place Progressive Conservative Association of Alberta, both right-of-centre, began contemplating forming a united right-wing party. Following referenda in both parties, they merged in 2017 into the United Conservative Party (UCP), with former federal minister and former PC leader Jason Kenney elected as leader later that year. Since the merger, the UCP had led the NDP in polls by wide margins. In the 2019 provincial election, the UCP won a majority of seats and about 55% of the popular vote. While the NDP retained all but one of their seats in Edmonton, significant losses in Calgary and rural Alberta reduced them to Official Opposition status. Notley pledged on election night to continue serving as Leader of the Opposition. The NDP government's defeat was the first time a governing party in Alberta had been defeated after a single term in office. The NDP opposition caucus with 24 seats will be the largest in Alberta since Laurence Decore's Liberals won 32 seats in 1993. Notley will be the first New Democrat to serve as Leader of the Official Opposition since Ray Martin (1984‚Äì1993). Her father, Grant Notley, held the same office from 1982 until his death in 1984. In December 2019, Notley announced that she intended to lead the Alberta NDP into the next general election, due no later than May 2023.

Androcydes received a commission from the city of Thebes to paint the battle scene on site. During this period (382‚Äì379 BC), the Theban oligarchy had allied with Sparta. When the Spartans were defeated in 379, the work remained unfinished. It was confiscated and dedicated to commemorate a minor skirmish at Plataea, probably in 370, before the battle of Leuctra. Originally, the work was to have honored Pelopidas and Epaminondas, but through the efforts of a certain Menecleides, the name of the Theban commander Charon was substituted, either directly in the painting or on a separate dedicatory plaque. This repurposing indicates that battle scenes might be depicted so generically that the ostensible subject of the work could be changed simply by giving it a new title and name labels. Although no longer extant, it is the only painting of a cavalry battle known to predate that of Euphranor.H.F. Mussche, Monumenta graeca et romana (Brill, 1980), vol. 3, p. 52 online. Indicative of an interest also in genre painting, Athenaeus reportsAthenaeus, Deipnosophistae 341A; also Plutarch, Quaestionum Convivalium 4.4.2 (Moralia 665D). that Androcydes' gourmet passion for seafood prompted him to devote inordinate attention to painting the fish around a central figure of Scylla in one of his works.J.J.

The agency is a division of the New York City Police Department Community Affairs Bureau, and is one of the largest school-based law enforcement agencies in New York City and the United States with approximately 5,000 school safety agents and 200 police officers. History The New York City Police Department School Safety Division was formed in 1998 when the School Safety force was transferred from the New York City Department of Education to the New York City Police Department. Since then, the School Safety force has expanded in duties and in number of officers. In 2006, NYPD school safety agents were classified Civil Service Status with the first DCAS Civil Service exam given on June 9, 2007. Power and authority School safety agents are designated as New York City special patrolmen. School safety agents can make warrant-less arrests, carry and use handcuffs, and use physical force or deadly force, if necessary, to keep students, teachers, staff and fellow agents safe. Uniform and vehicles School safety agents wear French blue uniform shirts with dark blue pants, almost identical to the NYPD's traffic enforcement agents (TEAs) with the exception of their eight-point uniform caps. SSAs use the dark blue caps just as uniformed police officers do. Their badge is oval with an eagle on top, in contrast to the shield worn by police officers. Vehicles are either dark blue with white decals or white with light blue decals.School Safety Police Vehicles A NYPD School Safety vehicle in current white livery. A NYPD School Safety vehicle in the formerly used dark blue livery. Fallen officers Since the establishment of the New York City Police Department School Safety Division, two officers have died while on duty, one in 1999 and one in 2005. Both deaths were caused by heart attack.New York City Police Department - Division of School Safety, New York, Fallen Officers. Officer Down Memorial Page, Inc.. Retrieved on 2013-08-16.  Official duties  School safety agents are often seen on the perimeters of the city's schools and inside the halls of all middle and high schools. SSA's may have only one agent in the school or many depending on the size of the school and the student population. SSD separates agents by \\"levels\\" with a civilian assistant commissioner of the New York City Police Department overseeing the administrative functions of the division. Agents may promote via examinations administered by the New York City Department of Citywide Administrative Services, the city agency charged with civil service examinations. This division is not to be confused with the NYPD school crossing guards, which are civilian employees with no police or peace officer powers. However, the two divisions often work hand in hand to provide both safe travel to and from school, as well as safety inside the facilities and classroom operated by the city's public school system.

He was also the first person to complete a successful powered aircraft crossing of the Alps in 1913, following a 1910 attempt by his friend Jorge Ch√°vez that ended in a fatal crash landing. He established the first aviation school in South America in Lima, Peru. Bielovucic became a colonel of the Peruvian Aviation Corps (PAC) in 1911, joined the Service A√©ronautique of the French Army as a volunteer in 1914 and earned the Legion of Honour for his service in World War I. He retired from active aviation in 1920 and returned to Peru where he became the lieutenant commander of the PAC Reserve. He was also active with the French Resistance during World War II. In Croatia, he is regarded as the first Croatian aviator. Early life Juan Bielovucic Juan Bielovucic was born on 30 July 1889 in Lima, Peru to Croat father Miho Bjelovuƒçiƒá (Juan Miguel Bielovucic) and French mother Adriana Cavali√©. The couple had moved to Peru after Bielovucic's father, originally from Moko≈°ica in Rijeka Dubrovaƒçka area, retired from his position as a merchant navy captain. When Bielovucic was eight, his father fell ill and moved to Dubrovnik where he died shortly afterwards. After his death, Bielovucic and his mother moved to live with her relatives in France. Bielovucic attended school and university in Paris where he graduated with degrees in philosophy and literature. He was nicknamed \\"Bielo\\". Aviation career In 1908, Bielovucic enrolled in the Voisin brothers' flying school and was awarded flying licence number 87 by the A√©ro-Club de France on 10 June 1910. He took part in the first Budapest airshow on 1‚Äì15 June 1910, registering under his Croatian name as Ivan Bjelovuƒçiƒá. On 1‚Äì3 September, he flew a new aircraft from Paris to Bordeaux with four stopovers: he reached Orl√©ans, away, on 1 September, continued the next morning to distant Poitiers; and completed the third leg of the journey to Angoul√™me. The final part of the trip was completed at noon on 3 September, when he landed in Bordeaux. The distance was covered in six hours and fifteen minutes of flying, representing a world record. The new type became known as the Voisin Type Bordeaux. In 1910 he entered Circuito Internationale Aereo Di Milano flying a Voisin aircraft. He took part in Le Bourget Air Show and completed the Paris‚ÄìNancy flight in 1911, setting a new record of two hours and fifty minutes for the route. On 15 January 1911, Bielovucic returned to Peru, bringing with him an airplane and the technical staff requested by the Peruvian Aviation League. In Santa Beatriz, he took off piloting the first aircraft flight in Peru, flying over Lima, Callao and above the Pacific Ocean coast. The flight was witnessed by the President of Peru Augusto B. Legu√≠a and other dignitaries. On 29 January he completed a 20-minute flight from Lima to Anc√≥n, a day before he became a flight instructor in the first flying school in South America. In early 1911 he became Peruvian Aviation Corps (PAC) colonel and returned to France as an air force envoy. On 12 May 1911 his aircraft caught fire as he took off from Issy airfield, but Bielovucic survived by jumping from the aircraft at a low altitude. On 28 May, he took part in the Paris‚ÄìRome‚ÄìTurin air race, and in August joined the 2nd Military Competition in France flying a Hanriot monoplane. In late 1912 he set a climb rate record in a Bl√©riot monoplane, climbing to in 12 minutes. That year, Le Matin readers voted Bielovucic the best French aviator. In 1913 Bielovucic was the first to successfully cross the Alps by airplane, flying a Hanriot monoplane powered by an engine, completing the crossing first attempted by his late countrymate Jorge Ch√°vez on 23 September 1910. Ch√°vez had almost completed his flight, but lost control of his final descent, crashed from an altitude of , and sustained fatal injuries. Bielovucic chose to cross the Alps in winter because he noted that the Alpine winds were less frequent then. His first attempt of 14 January failed, and he returned to the starting airfield. He made a second attempt to cross on 25 January, taking off from Brig-Glis, Switzerland at noon, and successfully landed in Domodossola in Italy at 12:25. During the flight, he reached an altitude of , setting another record. Later that year, he set another climb rate record, climbing in 150 seconds in a Le Rh√¥ne engine- powered Ponnier monoplane. In 1914, as World War I began, he joined the Service A√©ronautique of the French Army as a volunteer, being assigned to the Escadrille les Cigognes as a French and Peruvian officer. He flew numerous reconnaissance flights over Belgium until he was wounded. Bielovucic was awarded the Legion of Honour, as well as the Croix de guerre with a bronze palm and a number of Belgian and Peruvian medals. Later on he worked as the head of an engine testing team in Bellanger and then as the principal of an aviation school in Reims. Bielovucic retired from active piloting in 1920, and returned to Peru where he became lieutenant commander of the PAC Reserve, regarded as a national hero. Later life and legacy During World War II, while posted in Paris as Peruvian air attach√©, Bielovucic actively cooperated with the French Resistance. At the age of 57, he parachuted from the Eiffel Tower. Bielovucic died in Paris on 14 January 1949 and was buried at the Cimetiere nouveau de Neuilly in the Nanterre commune of Paris. His biography was written by Lieutenant General Jos√© Zlatar Stambuk of the Peruvian Air Force and published in 1990. In Croatia, he is regarded as the first Croatian aviator because of his paternal ethnic origin. He is known as Ivan Bjelovuƒçiƒá there, while most sources refer to him as Jean Bielovucic or Juan Bielovucic Cavali√©. In late September 1910 Bielovucic took Filippo Tommaso Marinetti, founder of the Futurist movement, over Milan as a passenger in a Voisin biplane during the International Air Week. Marinetti stated that the experience moved him to his new concept of art.

He is depicted as a limbless humanoid with floating appendages, which he can throw at enemies to attack them. Since his first appearance in Rayman in 1995, Rayman has been the subject of several video games, as well as a short-lived animated television series. With his trademark lack of limbs and helicopter hair, Rayman has become a popular and recognisable video game character, and the series has continued to grow and develop across numerous platforms up to the present day.  Design  Rayman was originally designed to simply be an athletic character with a full body, but because of complications rendering on game consoles, he was left without arms, legs and a neck ‚Äì his hands, feet and head float around his body. The manual of Rayman Origins gives out a new explanation for Rayman's limblessness: the lack of Lums had the consequence of preventing the creation of his limbs. He has a huge round nose, and strawberry-blonde hair which he divides into two fronds (three in the original game). He has the ability to use his hair as a helicopter, which lets him glide across large spaces and make soft landings. His eyes are dark blue in colour, though in most official artwork they are coloured black; two pictures in the original game showed him with lighter blue eyes. While Rayman is unique in most of the games, other members of his unknown species are seen in the original game, notably the Magician, Tarayzan, the Musician and the Musician's wife and child. Rayman is almost always seen in white gloves and a purple torso with a mysterious white ring on the chest, through which he gains new powers from Betilla the Fairy. The symbol can also absorb the Silver Lums created by the fairies, and magically open the pillars containing the Four Masks of Polokus in Rayman 2. Up until Rayman 3, he wore a red neckerchief, which was then replaced with a red hood. He also wears shoes that are typically yellow and white, though the actual designs have changed throughout the series. Rayman Raving Rabbids is where he is seen wearing different clothing that has raised a few questions about his ‚Äòlimblessness‚Äô, as he sometimes looks as if he has knees, such as the disco costume with its trousers/pants. In Rayman Origins, his Rayman 3 attire was used, but his hood and shoes are a little different. In Rayman Adventures, he wears a new attire. He wears a red bandanna around his hair, a sleeveless brown coat unbuttoned around the bottom alongside his red hood, revealing a white shirt, and has a brown belt around his waist with a gold buckle. His gloves are now brown and fingerless, and his shoes are the same kind Assassin Ray wears.  Physical  Rayman is a very laid-back character, as he is often seen snoozing either on a hammock or up against a tree, but he is also very athletic and shows great gymnastic skills (able to scale wall sides, and in the Game Boy Advance version of Rayman 3 he is able to do a \\"body shot\\", kick enemies and can do monkey bars), especially since being given the power to run in the original game, and then get noticeably better from Rayman 2. He is also strong enough to carry things such as baby Globoxes, Magic Spheres, plums and kegs. He can run while carrying an object in Rayman Revolution if he purchases an optional upgrade at the Magic Well. Rayman is also right-handed. Some of Rayman's gymnastic skills include handstands, somersaults and back flips. Rayman begins as a very poor swimmer; in the original game, he loses a life the instant he falls into any body of liquid. By the time of Rayman 2, he has developed this new skill ‚Äì although all he can do in this game is a simple dog-paddle. In Rayman Revolution, he is taught to swim by Murfy and a baby Globox at the beginning of the game. In Rayman 3, he is a far more capable swimmer; he can now use his helicopter hair to propel himself through the water, he can perform athletic underwater backflips, and he no longer seems to require any Blue Lums or air bubbles to breathe beneath the surface. In both Rayman Origins and Rayman Legends, he can swim without needing any air like in Rayman 2, and without use of his helicopter hair like in Rayman 3. Rayman also appears to like several sports, such as basketball. In Rayman 2 he will sometimes take his body off and play with it like a basketball whenever he is left idle. Also, in the Game Boy Advance version of Rayman 3 if the player decided to continue at the \\"Game Over\\" screen, Rayman would throw his body through a basketball net and catch it. In Rayman 3 he seems to also show interest in football, as when he is left idle, he kicks his body around and can also kick turtles and plums. Other sports that Rayman appears to like are golf, bowling and karting, as Rayman Golf, Rayman Bowling and Rayman Kart suggest. One of Rayman's hobbies is painting, which was revealed at a later point in the original game and in Rayman Junior.  Personality  Rayman's true personality is not explored deeply in the series, though most of the time he is a cheerful character with a good sense of humour. He is also very helpful, and is willing to take on whatever challenges face him for the sake of the safety and harmony of his world. Sometimes he can be a little childish, especially in the original game, as he often pulls grimaces as a form of defence. According to the now-defunct Rayman's World website, he is brave, funny and also highly close to nature. In one interview, developer Natalie Paccard discusses the development of Rayman's personality between the two games: 'the original Rayman was a platform game, Rayman 2 is an action game. The universe has also evolved a lot, and so has the character. Rayman 2 is a bit older, able to do more things, and loves a good fight. He is less childish. The game itself includes more action and more tricks.‚Äô In later games, Rayman becomes somewhat self-absorbed, especially in Rayman Raving Rabbids, as the Rabbids start to treat him like a celebrity during his captivity, though he is seen remembering and worrying about the baby Globoxes that he left behind. That however seems to be put behind him as the Rabbids continue to harass him in Rayman Raving Rabbids TV Party. It is revealed through interviews with Michel Ancel that Rayman was meant to be a bit of a show-off who does not take himself too seriously. This aspect of the character was supposedly overlooked during Rayman 2 because of Ubisoft's focus on the environments of the game. It was in Rayman 3 that Ubisoft tried to show Rayman's true personality, giving him an updated look to match his newfound attitude and charisma. A Rayman 3 press release stated that ‚ÄòLike his core gaming audience, Rayman as a character has matured and now has a wilder edge, only hinted at in the earlier games. However, in Rayman Origins, Rayman seems to have recovered part of his childish personality; he bears a more joyful, careless and impulsive attitude, though he keeps the heroic spirit that characterized him in previous games. While the trailers and other commercial media described him as a \\"New Crazy\\", Michel Ancel explains Rayman and Globox's personality: 'They're the kind of characters who look... stupid, really, but they're not stupid, just simple. And all they really want to do is just focus on doing their job, no matter what.' When Rayman Origins was still developed as a prequel, the newborn Rayman was intended to bear a more immature, confused and unintelligent personality, blowing Betilla's skirt with his propeller hair and annoying the magic people; the game was initially focused on Rayman and Globox's personalities and how they evolved over time to become the heroes of the Glade of Dreams; the concept was changed when the game became a sequel. In Rayman Legends, he is seen with a mostly unchanged personality from Rayman Origins, although it is presented in a more serious tone, it is seen that Rayman was born to be limbless in the franchise and, because so many problems were happening, the creators had no choice but to let the main protagonist be limbless he looks like a bird-like humanoid. History An early sketch of Rayman. Rayman is the creation of French video game developer Michel Ancel, who was born in 1972. Around 1980, the eight- year-old Ancel began playing video games. Five years later, he began to create his own simple logic games, featuring characters that he invented himself. He often sketched character concepts on table corners, and around 1992, he came up with his favourite character so far: Rayman. Ancel left Rayman without any arms, legs or neck, making the character very easy to animate, as well as opening up unique gameplay possibilities, such as the telescopic fist. Ancel worked as a graphic artist and programmer on a string of Lankhor and Ubi Soft games in the late 1980s and early 1990s. In 1992, he and a small team of developers began production on a Super Nintendo game starring his Rayman character. Eventually it was decided to scrap this project, and rework it into an Atari Jaguar game, which was eventually released in 1995. By the end of the game's development cycle, the team had grown to contain dozens of members. Inspiration A number of interviews with Ubisoft developers were posted on official websites in the period leading up to the release of Rayman 2. In one interview, Rayman creator Michel Ancel revealed the inspirations behind the character. He states Rayman 2 was inspired by Russian, Chinese and Celtic stories that he read as a child. These elements form the ‚Äòfantastic background‚Äô which comprises the Glade of Dreams, but ‚Äòa more contemporary and cartoonish touch‚Äô has been added.[3] Ancel goes on to say that the concept of the game's world is similar to that of The Dark Crystal, which shares ‚Äòits magic and its Celtic universe‚Äô. The cartoonish aspects were inspired by the works of Tex Avery. Ancel states that ‚ÄòRayman is a true high-performance hero who keeps a good sense of humour like Indiana Jones. Rayman is a rebel, fighting against mighty bad guys like in Star Wars or Robin Hood‚Äô. This suggests that the villains of Ancel's Rayman games ‚Äì Mr Dark and Admiral Razorbeard ‚Äì may have been inspired by the likes of Darth Vader and the Sheriff of Nottingham. The character of Indiana Jones is also referenced by Rayman's co-creator Fr√©d√©ric Houde and the original game co-designer Serge Hasco√´t. According to a 2011 interview with the director of the Pix'n Love magazine (which has published numerous Rayman-related articles), Ancel took the name ‚ÄòRayman‚Äô from the ray-tracing software which Ubisoft happened to be using during the development of the original game. Rayman's origins Several conflicting accounts have been given for Rayman's origins. During the development of the original game, the developers considered a story in which a ten-year-old boy named Jimmy created a world called Hereitscool inside his computer, and became Rayman once he was sucked into it. This idea was quickly abandoned. When the original game was released in 1995, Rayman's backstory was left ambiguous, although he already appears to be an established hero within his world by the beginning of the game. The manual states that he is \\"the guardian of this world\\". The manual of Rayman 2 does however contain a different account of Rayman's origins. It tells of Rayman's first appearance in the Glade of Dreams, sometime before the events of the original game. In this version of the story, he is discovered by fishermen, who for some reason does not seem to have encountered his species before. A revised origin story for Rayman was revealed at the E3 expo of 2010, when Ubisoft showed a trailer for the upcoming game Rayman Origins. The trailer showed the creation of Rayman by Betilla the Fairy. At this point in its development, Rayman Origins was intended as a two-player episodic downloadable prequel to the series, but it was eventually retooled into a four-player sequel with a retail release. A final, slightly modified version of Rayman's origin story was eventually offered on the official Rayman Origins website in November 2011, and can also be found in the game's manual. It is not specified whether this story is intended to replace or complement the one from the Rayman 2 manual. The PlayStation Vita version of the game contains two mosaics which can be viewed when the player collects enough relics. One of these mosaics tells a story about Rayman's past. Long ago, Rayman was completely bald, and had a wife or girlfriend of his own species. One night, as they slept together in a forest, a colony of tiny blonde hair creatures crept up on Rayman and fused themselves into his head. Rayman's female companion, frightened by this strange turn of events, attempted to cut Rayman's hair with a pair of scissors. The terrified hairs pulled at Rayman's head, forcing him to flee, and he fell over the edge of a cliff, apparently to his doom; however, he was saved by his new hair, which gave him the ability to fly like a helicopter.  Reception  Since Rayman debuted on the Atari Jaguar in 1995, he has become a popular video game character, along with his trademark helicopter hair and lack of limbs. In video games When Rayman was released in 1995, Rayman's backstory was left ambiguous, although he already appears to be an established hero within his world by the beginning of the game. The manual of the game states that he is \\"the guardian of this world\\". However, the manual for Rayman 2 states that Rayman was found by fishermen, having washed up on the shore of the Sea of Lums, and won the trust of the people of the Glade of Dreams by defeating Mr Dark. Upon collecting all 1,000 Lums in the game, the player is told that Rayman is the only being in the Glade not to be dreamt into existence by Polokus, and that his origins and the identity of his parents are a mystery. It is speculated (in the game) that Rayman could be a \\"chosen one\\" selected by all the gods of all the worlds, destined to fight against evil. A different account is provided by Rayman Origins: the launch trailer shows him being created from moonbeams by Betilla the Fairy in the Primordial Forest, destined from creation to protect the Glade of Dreams from Dark forces. The game's manual states that Rayman was created by the nymphs, who dropped a sack of Lums when distracted by some \\"zombie chickens\\" on the way to perform the ritual, resulting in Rayman's incomplete, limbless form. Throughout his adventures, Rayman has accumulated a number of allies. The original game introduces the Magician, Tarayzan, the Musician, and Joe the Extra- Terrestrial, Bzzit the Mosquito, and Betilla the Fairy. Meanwhile, Rayman 2 introduces a largely new cast including the bumbling Globox, the helpful flying greenbottle Murfy, the numerous Teensies, and the mystical Ly the Fairy. Rayman appears in Tonic Troubles Ski Slope level and end credits. In Beyond Good And Evil, another Ubisoft game developed by Michel Ancel, there is a hidden reference to the Rayman games: a distinctive pink mosquito can be found on the nose of a dead cow in the factory level named \\"Aedes Raymanis\\". Rayman, Globox and Barbara appear as skin costume for the Xbox 360 version of Minecraft He also appears as a collectible trophy in Super Smash Bros. for Wii U, appearing as a fully rendered model sent to the developers by Ubisoft themselves along with Globox and Barbara. Rayman appear as a playable character in Brawlhalla.https://twitter.com/Brawlhalla/status/1036401501655244800 Rayman appears in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate as a spirit.

A stretcher- bearer is a person who carries a stretcher, generally with another person at its other end, especially in a war or emergency times when there is a very serious accident or a disaster.Litter-bearer was more acute In case of military personnel, for example removing wounded or dead from a battlefield, the modern term is combat medic who will have received considerable training. Stretcher-bearers would have received basic first-aid training.The wounded soldier had to wait until the stretcher-bearers arrived or simply the stretcher-bearers will find them. Origin This term appears between 1875 and 1880. It is largely used before and up to the Second World War and is derived from the British English verb to stretcher means \\"to carry someone on a stretcher\\". A stretcher-bearer party, sometimes a stretcher party or company, is a group or a band of people temporarily or regularly associated which have to carry injured persons with stretchers. In the army stretcher- bearers were a kind of specific soldiers who work with military ambulances and medical services. A famous stretcher-bearer and ambulance driver during the First World War was the young Ernest Hemingway. In the arts, painting, figure or figurine sculpture or photography, it is a common topic as well as the couple of stretcher-bearers or the stretcher-bearer alone.

Life He received his Ph.D. from Northwestern University in 1984 under the direction of Mark Mahowald. In 1984 he also received his D.Phil. from the University of Oxford under the supervision of Ioan James. He has been professor of mathematics at Harvard University since 2005, after fifteen years at MIT, a few years of teaching at Princeton University, a one-year position with the University of Chicago, and a visiting lecturer position at Lehigh University. He gave invited addresses at the 1990 Winter Meeting of the American Mathematical Society in Louisville, Kentucky, at the 1994 International Congress of Mathematicians in Zurich, and was a plenary speaker at the 2002 International Congress of Mathematicians in Beijing. He presented the 1994 Everett Pitcher Lectures at Lehigh University, the 2000 Namboodiri Lectures at the University of Chicago, the 2000 Marston Morse Memorial Lectures at the Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton, the 2003 Ritt Lectures at Columbia University and the 2010 Bowen Lectures in Berkeley. In 2001 he was awarded the Oswald Veblen Prize in Geometry from the AMS for his work in homotopy theory, 2012 the NAS Award in Mathematics and 2014 the Nemmers Prize in Mathematics. Work Hopkins' work concentrates on algebraic topology, especially stable homotopy theory. It can roughly be divided into four parts (while the list of topics below is by no means exhaustive): =The Ravenel conjectures= The Ravenel conjectures very roughly say: complex cobordism (and its variants) see more in the stable homotopy category than you might think. For example, the nilpotence conjecture states that some suspension of some iteration of a map between finite CW- complexes is null-homotopic iff it is zero in complex cobordism. This was proven by Ethan Devinatz, Hopkins and Jeff Smith (published in 1988). The rest of the Ravenel conjectures (except for the telescope conjecture) were proven by Hopkins and Smith soon after (published in 1998). Another result in this spirit proven by Hopkins and Douglas Ravenel is the chromatic convergence theorem, which states that one can recover a finite CW-complex from its localizations with respect to wedges of Morava K-theories. =Hopkins‚ÄìMiller theorem and topological modular forms= This part of work is about refining a homotopy commutative diagram of ring spectra up to homotopy to a strictly commutative diagram of highly structured ring spectra. The first success of this program was the Hopkins‚ÄìMiller theorem: It is about the action of the Morava stabilizer group on Lubin‚ÄìTate spectra (arising out of the deformation theory of formal group laws) and its refinement to A_\\\\infty-ring spectra ‚Äì this allowed to take homotopy fixed points of finite subgroups of the Morava stabilizer groups, which led to higher real K-theories. Together with Paul Goerss, Hopkins later set up a systematic obstruction theory for refinements to E_\\\\infty-ring spectra. This was later used in the Hopkins‚ÄìMiller construction of topological modular forms. Subsequent work of Hopkins on this topic includes papers on the question of the orientability of TMF with respect to string cobordism (joint work with Ando, Strickland and Rezk). =The Kervaire invariant problem= On 21 April 2009, Hopkins announced the solution of the Kervaire invariant problem, in joint work with Mike Hill and Douglas Ravenel. This problem is connected to the study of exotic spheres, but got transformed by work of William Browder into a problem in stable homotopy theory. The proof by Hill, Hopkins and Ravenel works purely in the stable homotopy setting and uses equivariant homotopy theory in a crucial way. =Work connected to geometry/physics= This includes papers on smooth and twisted K-theory and its relationship to loop groups and also work about (extended) topological field theories, joint with Daniel Freed, Jacob Lurie, and Constantin Teleman.

It is widely cultivated as an ornamental plant in tropical and subtropical gardens throughout the world, and has become naturalized in many places. It is considered an invasive species in Australia, South Asia, China, South Africa and on several Pacific Islands. Common names include golden dewdrop, pigeon berry, and skyflower. Description Duranta erecta Duranta erecta is a sprawling shrub or (infrequently) a small tree. It can grow to tall and can spread to an equal width. Mature specimens possess axillary thorns, which are often absent on younger specimens. The leaves are light green, elliptic to ovate, opposite, and grow up to long and broad, with a 1.5 cm petiole. The flowers are light-blue or lavender, produced in tight clusters located on terminal and axillary stems, blooming almost all year long. The fruit is a small globose yellow or orange berry, up to diameter and containing several seeds.Huxley, A., ed. (1992). New RHS Dictionary of Gardening 2: 117. Macmillan . The leaves and unripened berries of the plant are toxic, and are confirmed to have killed children, dogs and cats. However, songbirds eat the fruit without ill effects. Taxonomy The genus name is in honor of Castore Durante, a fifteenth-century Italian botanist. The specific epithet erecta means \\"upright\\" in Latin. The plant is also known as D. repens, from the Latin for \\"creeping\\". The latter name was originally used to identify smaller-leaved varieties of the species. Ecology Duranta erecta Duranta erecta is native to the Americas, from Mexico and the Caribbean south to Brazil and Argentina. There is some debate about whether the plant is also native to the southern United States, in Florida, Louisiana, Texas, Arizona and California, or is an introduced species there. In its natural state, it commonly grows in rocky or sandy coastal areas with full sun, or moister, disturbed sites inland. Prior to maturity, the plant will grow at a rate of up to half a meter per year. Cultivation Golden dewdrop is widely grown as an ornamental plant throughout tropical and warm subtropical regions. Its showy flowers and fruit make it a desirable addition to gardens, and the blossoms attract butterflies and hummingbirds. There are a wide variety of cultivars available, including 'Alba', 'Aurea', 'Aussie Gold', 'Gold Mound', 'Geisha Girl', 'Sapphire Showers', and 'Variegata'. =Invasive potential= The plant has been identified as an environmental weed in Australia, South Africa, and China, and is described as invasive in Hawaii, Fiji and French Polynesia. It has been introduced to other habitats but has not become invasive.  Research  Antioxidative coumarinolignoids called repenins have been isolated from Duranta erecta.

Although Cynthia Hesdra spent a portion of her life as a slave, at the time of her death in 1879, she was quite wealthy. She operated businesses in Nyack, New York and in the city of New York. She also owned several properties in Nyack, New York City, and Bergen County, New Jersey. Her heirs, including her husband Edward, fought over the ex-slave's fortune, in a series of precedent setting court cases. Cynthia Hesdra's father, John Moore, was well known in Rockland County. He too was one of the wealthiest men of his town. He owned and operated several businesses, including a mill in Sparkill, New York. The mill wheels he designed were said to have produced blankets for soldiers fighting in the American Civil War and used widely throughout Rockland County. Very little is known about Cynthia Hesdra's mother, Jane. She may have been a slave which might explain how Cynthia Hesdra became enslaved. Cynthia eventually met and married a man by the name of Edward D. Hesdra. Edward Hesdra, a Hebrew mulatto, was the son of a white Virginia planter and a free black woman from Haiti. After their marriage, the couple purchased Cynthia's freedom. The two settled on Amity Street in New York City. Cynthia operated a successful laundry business in New York City and she owned several properties there too. Eventually, she took her trade to Nyack, New York where she also accumulated property and operated her businesses. Among the many properties was a house that was part of the historic underground railroad in Nyack. A historical marker at Main Street and Route 9W now stands on the place where the historic house once stood. On February 9, 1879, Cynthia D Hesdra died. The New York Times and other sources reported that she was worth more than $100,000 or more than $3 million in contemporary dollars. At first, there was no indication that Cynthia had a will. Her husband eventually produced a will that he alleged left everything to him. Cynthia D Hesdra's relatives argued that the will was fraudulent and that the signatures had been forged. The battle over Cynthia D Hesdra's fortune went to court. The dispute over her estate included the first application of a new law in New York State that allowed for comparisons between known and disputed signatures. Many people testified during the trials, including several expert witnesses. Ultimately, the courts decided that Cynthia's will was legitimate and awarded the estate to her husband. Ironically, when Edward Hesdra died, there was a dispute concerning his will. Much of Cynthia D Hesdra's fortune was lost in all of the litigation and much of what was left went to several charities and to the state. On Monday, May 18, 2015, the Toni Morrison Society's Bench by the Road project honored Cynthia D Hesdra in Nyack, New York with the dedication of a bench in Nyack's Memorial Park. Toni Morrison was present for the dedication. The Nyack Bench is one of the first twenty benches dedicated by the Toni Morrison Society to honor the contributions of individuals and organizations of the African Diaspora in the U.S. and beyond.

(Chilean newspaper, in Spanish) It depicts five human fingers partially emerging from sand and is located on Parada 1 at Brava Beach in Punta del Este, a popular tourist town in Uruguay. It is also known as either Los Dedos (The Fingers), or Hombre emergiendo a la vida (Man Emerging into Life). In English, its popular name is The Hand. It is a famous sculpture \\\\- Puntadeleste.com (Uruguayan website, in Spanish) that has become a symbol for Punta del Este since its completion in February 1982 Punta del Este: para extasiarse de belleza - La Capital (Argentinian newspaper, in Spanish) and in turn has become one of Uruguay's most recognizable landmarks. History Of Sculpture The sculpture was made by Chilean artist Mario Irarr√°zabal during the summer of 1982, while he was attending the first annual International Meeting of Modern Sculpture in the Open Air in Punta del Este. There were nine sculptors, and he was the youngest one. There was a fight for the places assigned on a public square, so he decided to make his sculpture on the beach. He was inspired to make a sculpture of a hand \\"drowning\\" as a warning to swimmers, as the waters at La Barra up the beach had rougher waves which were better for surfing, while the other way, waters at Solanas were much more suited for swimming practices and windsurfing activities. While Irarr√°zabal had the entire summer to complete the project, he managed to finish in the first six days, despite facing minor delays due to the strong southeast wind which is common in Punta del Este. The concrete and plastic fingers were reinforced with steel bars, metal mesh, and a degradation-resistant solvent covering the plastic on the outside. Throughout that summer, sculptors from around the world worked on their creations at the beach, but only Irarr√°zabal's continues to sit on the beach today, not having left its original spot, and remaining largely untouched. It gained Irarr√°zabal worldwide acclaim and is popularized by tourist photographs and reproductions on postcards. He later made near or exact replicas of the sculpture for the city of Madrid (in 1987), the Mano del Desierto (Hand of the Desert) in the Atacama Desert in Chile (1992), and in Venice (1995).

Generally it consists of peppermint candy pieces, such as candy canes, in white chocolate on top of dark chocolate, but peppermint bark can refer to any chocolate with peppermint candy pieces in it. It is especially popular around the Christmas season. Companies known for selling it seasonally include Williams Sonoma, Ghirardelli, and Dove. Though they do not label it as peppermint bark, Hershey's also sells peppermint Hershey's kisses. In the United States, peppermint bark is also sold by some Girl Scout troops as part of an expanded range of items other than cookies. Jelly Belly also sells a combination of its dark chocolate and candy cane jelly beans as a \\"Peppermint Bark Recipe Mix\\". Recipes and ingredients The recipe for peppermint bark uses few ingredients, with only chocolate and mint candies required. Some recipes also add peppermint flavoring. The candies used may be candy canes. The candies should be broken up, and the chocolate is melted. These two ingredients are combined on a baking sheet and then chilled until firm. The bark is then removed from the sheet and broken into pieces in a similar way to peanut brittle. Variations on peppermint bark can include a two-toned layered type, where a bottom layer of dark chocolate is covered with the white chocolate and crushed mint layer on top. This particular variation also includes Ghirardelli's Peppermint Bark Squares.

(presumably metamorphic rocks) Earth science or geoscience includes all fields of natural science related to the planet Earth. This is a branch of science dealing with the physical and chemical constitution of the Earth and its atmosphere. Earth science can be considered to be a branch of planetary science, but with a much older history. Earth science encompasses four main branches of study, the lithosphere, the hydrosphere, the atmosphere, and the biosphere, each of which is further broken down into more specialized fields. There are both reductionist and holistic approaches to Earth sciences. It is also the study of Earth and its neighbors in space. Some Earth scientists use their knowledge of the planet to locate and develop energy and mineral resources. Others study the impact of human activity on Earth's environment, and design methods to protect the planet. Some use their knowledge about earth processes such as volcanoes, earthquakes, and hurricanes to plan communities that will not expose people to these dangerous events. The Earth sciences can include the study of geology, the lithosphere, and the large-scale structure of the Earth's interior, as well as the atmosphere, hydrosphere, and biosphere. Typically, Earth scientists use tools from geology, chronology, physics, chemistry, geography, biology, and mathematics to build a quantitative understanding of how the Earth works and evolves. Earth science affects our everyday lives. For example, meteorologists study the weather and watch for dangerous storms. Hydrologists study water and warn of floods. Seismologists study earthquakes and try to understand where they will strike. Geologists study rocks and help to locate useful minerals. Earth scientists often work in the field‚Äîperhaps climbing mountains, exploring the seabed, crawling through caves, or wading in swamps. They measure and collect samples (such as rocks or river water), then they record their findings on charts and maps.  Fields of study  The following fields of science are generally categorized within the Earth sciences: * Geology describes the rocky parts of the Earth's crust (or lithosphere) and its historic development. Major subdisciplines are mineralogy and petrology, geomorphology, paleontology, stratigraphy, structural geology, engineering geology, and sedimentology. *Physical geography focuses on geography as an Earth science. Physical geography is the study of earth's seasons, climate, atmosphere, soil, streams, landforms, and oceans. Physical geography can be divided into several branches or related fields, as follows: geomorphology, biogeography, environmental geography, palaeogeography, climatology, meteorology, coastal geography, hydrology, ecology, glaciology. *Geophysics and geodesy investigate the shape of the Earth, its reaction to forces and its magnetic and gravity fields. Geophysicists explore the Earth's core and mantle as well as the tectonic and seismic activity of the lithosphere. Geophysics is commonly used to supplement the work of geologists in developing a comprehensive understanding of crustal geology, particularly in mineral and petroleum exploration. Seismologists use geophysics to understand plate tectonic shifting, as well as predict seismic activity. * Geochemistry is defined as the study of the processes that control the abundance, composition, and distribution of chemical compounds and isotopes in geologic environments. Geochemists use the tools and principles of chemistry to study the composition, structure, processes, and other physical aspects of the Earth. Major subdisciplines are aqueous geochemistry, cosmochemistry, isotope geochemistry and biogeochemistry. * Soil science covers the outermost layer of the Earth's crust that is subject to soil formation processes (or pedosphere).Elissa Levine, 2001, The Pedosphere As A Hub broken link? Major subdivisions in this field of study include edaphology and pedology. * Ecology covers the interactions between organisms and their environment. This field of study differentiates the study of Earth from the study of other planets in the Solar System, Earth being its only planet teeming with life. * Hydrology, oceanography and limnology are studies which focus on the movement, distribution, and quality of the water and involves all the components of the hydrologic cycle on the Earth and its atmosphere (or hydrosphere). \\"Sub- disciplines of hydrology include hydrometeorology, surface water hydrology, hydrogeology, watershed science, forest hydrology, and water chemistry.\\" * Glaciology covers the icy parts of the Earth (or cryosphere). * Atmospheric sciences cover the gaseous parts of the Earth (or atmosphere) between the surface and the exosphere (about 1000 km). Major subdisciplines include meteorology, climatology, atmospheric chemistry, and atmospheric physics.  Earth's interior  A volcanic eruption is the release of stored energy from below Earth's surface.Encyclopedia of Volcanoes, Academic Press, London, 2000 Plate tectonics, mountain ranges, volcanoes, and earthquakes are geological phenomena that can be explained in terms of physical and chemical processes in the Earth's crust. Beneath the Earth's crust lies the mantle which is heated by the radioactive decay of heavy elements. The mantle is not quite solid and consists of magma which is in a state of semi-perpetual convection. This convection process causes the lithospheric plates to move, albeit slowly. The resulting process is known as plate tectonics. Plate tectonics might be thought of as the process by which the Earth is resurfaced. As the result of seafloor spreading, new crust and lithosphere is created by the flow of magma from the mantle to the near surface, through fissures, where it cools and solidifies. Through subduction, oceanic crust and lithosphere returns to the convecting mantle. Areas of the crust where new crust is created are called divergent boundaries, those where it is brought back into the Earth are convergent boundaries and those where plates slide past each other, but no new lithospheric material is created or destroyed, are referred to as transform (or conservative) boundaries Earthquakes result from the movement of the lithospheric plates, and they often occur near convergent boundaries where parts of the crust are forced into the earth as part of subduction. Volcanoes result primarily from the melting of subducted crust material. Crust material that is forced into the asthenosphere melts, and some portion of the melted material becomes light enough to rise to the surface‚Äîgiving birth to volcanoes.  Earth's atmosphere  The magnetosphere shields the surface of Earth from the charged particles of the solar wind. (image not to scale.) The troposphere, stratosphere, mesosphere, thermosphere, and exosphere are the five layers which make up Earth's atmosphere. 75% of the gases in the atmosphere are located within the troposphere, the lowest layer. In all, the atmosphere is made up of about 78.0% nitrogen, 20.9% oxygen, and 0.92% argon. In addition to the nitrogen, oxygen, and argon there are small amounts of other gases including CO2 and water vapor. Water vapor and CO2 allow the Earth's atmosphere to catch and hold the Sun's energy through a phenomenon called the greenhouse effect. This allows Earth's surface to be warm enough to have liquid water and support life. In addition to storing heat, the atmosphere also protects living organisms by shielding the Earth's surface from cosmic rays‚Äîwhich are often incorrectly thought to be deflected by the magnetic field. The magnetic field‚Äîcreated by the internal motions of the core‚Äîproduces the magnetosphere which protects Earth's atmosphere from the solar wind. As the Earth is 4.5 billion years old, it would have lost its atmosphere by now if there were no protective magnetosphere.  Earth's magnetic field  An electromagnet is a magnet that is created by an electric current. The Earth has a solid iron inner core surrounded by a fluid outer core that convects; therefore, Earth is an electromagnet. The motion of fluid convection sustains the Earth's magnetic field.  Methodology  Methodologies vary depending on the nature of the subjects being studied. Studies typically fall into one of three categories: observational, experimental, or theoretical. Earth scientists often conduct sophisticated computer analysis or visit an interesting location to study earth phenomena (e.g. Antarctica or hot spot island chains). A foundational idea in Earth science is the notion of uniformitarianism, which states that \\"ancient geologic features are interpreted by understanding active processes that are readily observed.\\" In other words, any geologic processes at work in the present have operated in the same ways throughout geologic time. This enables those who study Earth's history to apply knowledge of how Earth processes operate in the present to gain insight into how the planet has evolved and changed throughout long history.  Earth's spheres  Earth science generally recognizes four spheres, the lithosphere, the hydrosphere, the atmosphere, and the biosphere;Earth's Spheres . ¬©1997‚Äì2000. Wheeling Jesuit University/NASA Classroom of the Future. Retrieved November 11, 2007. these correspond to rocks, water, air and life. Also included by some are the cryosphere (corresponding to ice) as a distinct portion of the hydrosphere and the pedosphere (corresponding to soil) as an active and intermixed sphere. = Partial list of the major Earth science topics =  Atmosphere  * Atmospheric chemistry * Geography ** Climatology ** Meteorology * Hydrometeorology * Paleoclimatology  Biosphere  * Biogeochemistry * Biogeography * Ecology ** Landscape ecology * Geoarchaeology * Geomicrobiology * Paleontology ** Palynology ** Micropaleontology  Hydrosphere  * Hydrology ** Hydrogeology * Limnology (freshwater science) * Oceanography (marine science) ** Chemical oceanography ** Physical oceanography ** Biological oceanography (marine biology) ** Geological oceanography (marine geology) *** Paleoceanography  Lithosphere (geosphere)  * Geology ** Economic geology ** Engineering geology ** Environmental geology ** Historical geology *** Quaternary geology ** Planetary geology and planetary geography ** Sedimentology ** Stratigraphy ** Structural geology * Geography ** Physical geography * Geochemistry * Geomorphology * Geophysics ** Geochronology ** Geodynamics (see also Tectonics) ** Geomagnetism ** Gravimetry (also part of Geodesy) ** Seismology * Glaciology * Hydrogeology * Mineralogy ** Crystallography ** Gemology * Petrology * Speleology * Volcanology  Pedosphere  * Geography * Soil science ** Edaphology ** Pedology  Systems  * Earth system science * Environmental science * Geography ** Human geography ** Physical geography * Gaia hypothesis * Systems ecology * Systems geology  Others  * Geography ** Cartography ** Geoinformatics (GIS) ** Geostatistics ** Geodesy and Surveying ** NASA Earth Science Enterprise ** Remote Sensing  See also  * Earth sciences graphics software * Environmental geoscience * GEO-LEO (GEO Library Experts Online) * Glossary of geology terms * List of geoscience organizations * List of Russian Earth scientists * List of unsolved problems in geoscience * Making North America (2015 PBS film) * Nanogeoscience * Science tourism * Structure of the Earth  References  =Sources=  *  Further reading  * Allaby M., 2008.

Historically, it was often sung as a sea chanty. The song portrays an Irish worker working on a railroad. There are numerous titles of the song including, \\"Pat Works on the Railway\\" and \\"Paddy on the Railway\\" and \\"Fillimiooriay\\". \\"Paddy Works on the Erie\\" is another version of the song.  History  Navvies working on the railway in 1854 In The American Songbag, the writer Carl Sandburg claims that the song has been published in sheet music since the early 1850s.Sandburg, Carl (1927). The American Songbag. New York : Harcourt, Brace & Co. The earliest confirmed date of publication is from 1864 from a manuscript magazine.Cohen, Norm & Cohen, David (2000). Long Steel Rail: The Railroad in American Folksong. University of Illinois Press. . Ernest Bourne recorded the first version, released in 1941, by Alan Lomax for the Library of Congress in 1938. = As a chanty = \\"Paddy on the Railway\\" is attested as a chanty in the earliest known published work to use the word \\"chanty,\\" G.E. Clark's Seven Years of a Sailor‚Äôs Life (1867). Clark recounted experiences fishing on the Grand Banks of Newfoundland, in a vessel out of Provincetown, Mass. ca.1865-6. At one point, the crew is getting up the anchor in a storm, by means of a pump-style windlass. One of the chanties the men sing while performing this task is mentioned by title, \\"Paddy on the Railway.\\"Clark, George Edward. Seven Years of a Sailor‚Äôs Life, Adams & Co. (1867) p. 312. The song was next mentioned as a chanty in R.C. Adams' On Board the Rocket (1879), in which the sea captain tells of experiences in American vessels out of Boston in the 1860s. Adams includes an exposition on sailors' chanties, including their melodies and sample lyrics. In this discussion he quotes \\"Paddy, Come Work on the Railway\\": :In eighteen hundred and sixty- three, :I came across the stormy sea. :My dung'ree breeches I put on ::Chorus: To work upon the railway, the railway, ::To work up-on the railway. ::Oh, poor Paddy come work on the railway.Adams, Captain R.C. On Board the Rocket, D. Lothrop & Co. (1879) p. 321 Although these are among the earliest published references, there is other evidence to suggest that the chanty was sung as early as the 1850s. A reminiscence from the 1920s, for example, claims its use at the windlass of the following verse, aboard a packet ship out of Liverpool in 1857: :In 1847 Paddy Murphy went to Heaven :To work on the railway, the railway, the railway, :Oh, poor Paddy works upon the railway.Chatterton, Edward Kemble, The Mercantile Marine, W. Heinemann (1923) p. 158 Several versions of this chanty were audio-recorded from the singing of veteran sailors in the 1920s‚Äì40s by folklorists like R.W. Gordon, J.M. Carpenter, and William Main Doerflinger. Capt. Mark Page, whose sea experience spanned 1849‚Äì1879, sang it for Carpenter in the late 1920s.  Background  During the mid-19th century, Irish immigrants worked to build railways in the United States. The song reflects the work that thousands of Irish section crews did as track layers, gaugers, spikers, and bolters. The song begins in 1841, during the time of the Irish diaspora.  Melody  For a number of versions, the melody of the first lines of each stanza resembles the song \\"Johnny I Hardly Knew Ye\\" and \\"When Johnny Comes Marching Home\\". Oftentimes, the song becomes faster progressively.  Appearances  This song has been performed by numerous musicians and singers, including Ewan MacColl, The Weavers, Brass Farthing, Authority Zero, Luke Kelly of The Dubliners, The Wolfe Tones, The Tossers, The Kelly Family, Shane MacGowan, The Pogues and Ferocious Dog. In the Shining Time Station episode \\"Impractical Jokes,\\" two versions of this song were sung. One was sung by Tom Callinan, Matt, and Tanya, and the other was sung by Tex and Rex.

Flying over or overpassing the 'reality' may be the one and only way to catch the holistic view of it.

In terms of fiction creative writing techniques, he has found himself a very idiosyncratic way of expression with a lengthy and press-like narrative. If you cannot realise an awesomely brilliant genius in his intermingled appraisals that seem accidental at times, you may be supposed that he is writing newspaper articles or, compiling materials. Consequently, some people might stop reading his while others cannot go with the track or understand his works at all. There should be one way to ‚Äúdecode‚Äù him: you can first underline sentences and paragraphs you really like, then you can gradually perceive what this writer of immense genius with enormous ideas and materials really wants. Dang Than needs a pretty number of concubines who would rearrange his belongings and clean up all the trash he leaves behind in the rooms he sleeps each night. I am of the view that he is looking for ways to rearrange himself, forming a prestigious literary estate. Certainly, he cannot leave out this mammoth ‚Äúcarpeting‚Äù style as he is uniquely brilliant and overwhelmed in so many ideas he makes, connects or interrelates.

He also served as the Subahdar of Bengal, succeeding Fidai Khan, from 1628 to 1631. He is most notable for the capture of Hugli off the Portuguese firingis. Background Qasim Khan originated from Sabzevar (in present-day Afghanistan) which was historically part of greater Joveyn. His father was Mir Murad Juwaini, a renowned Syed of the town. Murad spent much of his life in the Deccan (giving rise to the name Mir Murad Dakhini) before being appointed by Akbar as 5-year old Shah Jahan's archery trainer. In 1602, Murad passed away while serving office as Bakshi (paymaster) and military administrator of Lahore. Life Qasim Khan first served in Bengal as Khazanchi (treasurer) during the reign of Islam Khan Chishti. Chishti was known to have treated Qasim and his brother, Hashim, very well. Qasim married Princess Manija Begum, the sister of Empress Nur Jahan. This marriage led to Qasim being given the title of Amir and receiving of a drum and flag. Consequently, he was sometimes in jest called by the officers of the court Qasim Khan Manija. Qasim Khan was an established poet, known to have written a diwan. Qasim had a good relationship with Jahangir. The Emperor once requested Qasim to give him a glass of freshwater. As the earthen cup was so very fragile, it could not stand the weight of the water and broke. The Emperor looked towards Qasim Khan and said a verse: The cup was delicate, the water could not repose. Qasim Khan immediately spoke out the second half of the verse: He (or she) saw my condition, and could not restrain his (or her) tears. Jahangir later appointed him the Subahdar of Agra. Qasim built a grand house for himself in Agra city, which is now in ruins. =Governor of Bengal= He became the Subahdar of Bengal in the first year of Shah Jahan's reign in 1628, replacing Fidai Khan. He was promoted to the rank of mansabdar with 5,000 soldiers and horses. At this time, the Portuguese (Firingi) settlers had a provocative hold of the port-town of Hugli, taking part in immoral activities, slavery and forced conversions of Bengalis into Christianity. Shah Jahan wished in restricting the acts of the Portuguese in Bengal. In February 1632, Qasim Khan sent an army led by his son, Inayatullah Khan. The Mughals finally took possession of Hugli in September for three months. They slew about 10,000 Firingi men and women and drove the rest out from the town. This brought about the end of the Portuguese slave trade and forced conversions in Bengal. He died three days afterwards in 1632.

The creation of the museum was spearheaded by Harry Wu, a well-known Chinese dissident who himself served 19 years in laogai prisons; it was supported by the Yahoo! Human Rights Fund. It opened to the public on 12 November 2008, and Wu's non-profit research organization (the Laogai Research Foundation) calls it the first museum in the United States to directly address the issue of human rights in China. Overview The Chinese penal system includes numerous components such as prisons (formerly referred to as laogai), re-education through labor or laojiao camps, ankang mental health facilities, and juvenile detention centers. p. 16. The Laogai Museum focuses mainly on the laogai component, which Wu's non-profit research organization calls \\"the most extensive system of forced labor camps in the world.\\". Prisoners in these camps are said to undergo forced labor and thought reform, and the system has attracted widespread criticism from the international community. In 1994, the government abandoned the term laogai and renamed the facilities \\"prisons\\" (jianyu), but the Laogai Research Foundation and others claim that forced labor continues and prison conditions have not improved. Translated from Chinese, original source was The purpose of the Laogai Museum, according to Wu, is both to educate the public about the laogai and to memorialize the victims of the laogai. The museum documents the \\"history and structure of the laogai,\\" and displays laogai-related materials such as uniforms, photographs, government documents, and products manufactured by prisoners--including such items as Christmas lights, tea bags, and plastic flowers; many of the items were donated by laogai survivors, and others come from Wu's own archives. The museum also has a large archive of prison-made products, victims' testimonies, and Chinese government documents. The museum appeared to have closed in early 2017 following the death of its founder in April 2016, who had been criticised for excessive spending on the museum, rather than on human rights activists themselves. The museum reopened in October 2018. Funding The museum was funded in part by the Yahoo! Human Rights Fund, a fund established by Yahoo! after the company attracted criticism for helping Chinese police locate and detain internet dissidents. The fund, headed by Yahoo! co-founder Jerry Yang was part of Yahoo!'s apology, and funding the museum was one of its first public projects. Criticism A spokesman for the Chinese embassy has criticized the museum, calling it an attack on China's reputation and suggesting that Wu's motivation behind opening the museum was \\"to vilify the Chinese legal system and mislead the American public.\\" In response, Wu said that the Chinese authorities \\"always dismiss me as a morally corrupt and dangerous criminal. Their second argument is that criminals have to work in some American prisons, too. But I can tell you that it's not the same thing at all.\\" References External links *Laogai Museum *VOA Covers grand opening of New Museum (video) *Voice of America Covers Opening of Laogai Museum (video) *News relating to Laogai Museum from ObserveChina 2008 establishments in Washington, D.C.

US 61 in Minnesota is in length. The highway connects the cities of La Crescent, Winona, Wabasha, Lake City, Red Wing, Hastings, Cottage Grove, Saint Paul, Forest Lake, and Wyoming. Route description US 61 enters the state of Minnesota at the city of La Crescent on the River Bridge over the Mississippi River between the cities of La Crosse and La Crescent. US 61 runs concurrently with US 14 and State Highway 16 (MN 16) as it enters the state. The four-lane divided highway continues north through La Crescent. US 61 follows the Mississippi River through southeast Minnesota; through the cities of Winona, Wabasha, Lake City, and Red Wing. US 61 is a two-lane roadway between Wabasha and Red Wing. US 61 crosses the Mississippi River at Hastings over the new Hastings Bridge and joins US 10 at Cottage Grove. US 61 and US 10 run concurrently as a freeway between Cottage Grove and the city of Saint Paul. Within the city of Saint Paul, US 61 follows I-94 for a short distance, and then follows Mounds Boulevard, East 7th Street, and Arcade Street through the east side of St. Paul. US 61 then proceeds north to Maplewood, where it becomes a four-lane highway named Maplewood Drive to White Bear Lake. Between I-694 and the central business district of White Bear Lake, the road serves one of the Twin Cities region's major car dealership areas. After leaving White Bear Lake, US 61 is a two-lane roadway again to Forest Lake and then to its northern terminus at the city of Wyoming. US 61 closely parallels I-35E and I-35 from Saint Paul to Wyoming. Approximately of US 61 from La Crescent to Cottage Grove in southeast Minnesota is officially designated the Disabled American Veterans Highway. Legally, the Minnesota section of US 61 is defined as unmarked legislative routes 3, 104, 102 and 1 in the Minnesota Statutes. US 61 is not marked with these legislative numbers along the actual highway. History US 61 in Minnesota is an original U.S. Highway, established on November 26, 1926. It originally extended north to the Canadian border at Grand Portage, but it was cut back to its present terminus in 1991. The portion between Duluth and Grand Portage is now MN 61\\\\. Segments of the old alignment that parallel MN 61 and I-35 have been designated County Road 61 (CR 61). In 1929, the only unpaved portions were from Hastings to Wabasha and from Winona to the state line. It was completely paved by 1940. The expressway sections south of Wabasha were built in the 1960s and the 1970s. The four lane divided highway section between Red Wing and MN 316 near Miesville was completed in 1997. The freeway section of US 61 between Cottage Grove and I-494 at Newport was completed in 2007. The US 61 Hastings High Bridge received considerable attention from increased bridge inspections in 2008 following the August 1, 2007, I-35W Bridge collapse in nearby Minneapolis. The Hastings High Bridge, a steel arch structure built in 1951, is structurally deficient and shows considerable deterioration. It is also a notorious traffic bottleneck because it has only one lane each way and dumps southbound US 61 traffic into downtown Hastings.

He was a professor of mathematics at the Einstein Institute of Mathematics, Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Israel.Professors emeriti, Einstein Institute of Mathematics, http://www.math.huji.ac.il/#news Biography Joram Lindenstrauss was born in Tel Aviv. He was the only child of a pair of lawyers who immigrated to Israel from Berlin. He began to study mathematics at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem in 1954 while serving in the army. He became a full-time student in 1956 and received his master's degree in 1959. In 1962 Lindenstrauss earned his Ph.D. from the Hebrew University (dissertation: Extension of Compact Operators, advisors: Aryeh Dvoretzky, Branko Gr√ºnbaum).Joram Lindenstrauss at Mathematics Genealogy He worked as a postdoc at Yale University and the University of Washington in Seattle from 1962 - 1965. He was appointed senior lecturer at the Hebrew University in 1965, associate professor on 1967 and full professor in 1969. He became the Leon H. and Ada G. Miller Memorial Professor of Mathematics in 1985. He retired in 2005. Lindenstrauss was married to theoretical computer scientist Naomi Lindenstrauss. Two of their children, Ayelet Lindenstrauss and Fields Medallist Elon Lindenstrauss, are also mathematicians (providing a rare example of father, mother, son and daughter all having papers listed in Mathematical Reviews). Joram was also the cousin of Micha Lindenstrauss. Research Lindenstrauss worked in various areas of functional analysis and geometry,A biographical sketch from the book \\"Classical Banach Spaces\\" particularly Banach space theory, finite- and infinite-dimensional convexity, geometric nonlinear functional analysis and geometric measure theory. He authored more than 100 papers as well as several books in Banach space theory. Among his results is the Johnson‚ÄìLindenstrauss lemma which concerns low-distortion embeddings of points from high-dimensional into low-dimensional Euclidean space. Another of his theorems states that in a Banach space with the Radon‚ÄìNikodym property, a closed and bounded set has an extreme point; compactness is not needed.: Awards In 1981 Lindenstrauss was awarded the Israel Prize, for mathematics. In 1997, Lindenstrauss was the first mathematician from outside Poland to be awarded the Banach Medal of the Polish Academy of Sciences.

He is a leader of Literatura Marginal (Marginal Literature) that started in the late 1990s and early 2000s in the outskirts of S√£o Paulo. His writings are notable for descriptions of graphic violence and the stark reality of individuals living on the margins of society. He emphasizes his writings are addressed to the youth that live in the slums, that they feel a sense of pride in reading literature that reflects their reality and experiences.http://www.ferrez.blogspot.com  Life  Ferr√©z, whose real name is Reginaldo Ferreira da Silva, was born in the Favela of Valo Velho on the southern outskirts of S√£o Paulo in 1975. He was nicknamed after two Brazilian folk heroes: the widely known Lampi√£o (actually Virgulino Ferreira) from the northeast part of Brazil and Zumbi, the legendary slave leader. Ferr√©z started making attempts to write poems and raps at the age of seven. Despite lacking any formal education, he unsuccessfully tried to become familiar with works of literature of several Brazilian writers such as Carlos Drummond de Andrade. After leaving school, he worked as a broom-seller, temporary worker in many different positions and archivist. He has since considered a literary representative of the Brazilian slums.http://www.literaturfestival.com/bios1_3_6_1242.html  Writing Style  Ferr√©z's writing style reflects the oral culture of the urban periphery and of hip hop culture from S√£o Paulo. Slangs are extremely prevalent in his books as well as inaccurate language use, even the spelling he uses reflects the colloquial speaking patterns of individuals from the favelas.  Debates  Ferrez was involved in a polemic discussion with Luciano Huck, a TV presenter. Luciano was mugged while he was in a traffic jam and wrote an article complaining about public security in Brazil. By contrast, Ferrez tried to support the behaviour of the criminal, stating that \\"how come someone could wear something as valuable as a couple of houses in the slums\\". On account of this article, Ferrez was charged and found guilty of crime apology. The debate between the two went on in the media, up to a point which Luciano said to some close friends: \\"typical behaviour of those who envy others and who does not have the courage and skills to succeed in life\\".  Main Works  = Fortaleza da Desilus√£o = Fortress of Disillusionment - 1997 His first book, Fortaleza da Desilus√£o is a collection of concrete poems and was published with the financial support of his then-employer. = Cap√£o Pecado - 1999= His first novel, the story revolves around the young man Rael who lives in the favela of Cap√£o Redondo attempting to overcome the social stigma of living in the urban periphery. = Manual pr√°tico do √≥dio = The Practical Manual of Hate - 2003 Ferr√©z's second novel, the story revolves around a group of criminals or bandits who live in S√£o Paulo. The complexity in the novel is the overlapping and intersecting of each individual criminal's history to the present moment where the reader finds the group involved in activities ranging from robbery, hanging out at the club to intimate relationship with others. = Amanhecer Esmeralda - 2005= Ferr√©z's first children's book, this literary work demonstrates the author's first project into children's literature and education. The story focuses on a little girl named Amanhecer who also lives in the favela.

Although the building is recorded as the last intact ballroom of the multiple Detroit dance halls that hosted big bands in the 1930s-50s, such claims ignore the abandoned yet still standing Grande Ballroom on Grand River Avenue. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. History The Vanity Ballroom was designed in 1929 by Charles N. Agree as a flamboyant venue in which to socialize, dance and hear music. The ballroom was a major venue for bands of the 1930s and 1940s, such as those of Tommy Dorsey, Jimmy Dorsey, Duke Ellington, Benny Goodman, Red Nichols, Russ Morgan, Art Mooney, Woody Herman, and Pee Wee Hunt. The Vanity billed itself as \\"Detroit's most beautiful dance rendezvous\\". http://historicdetroit.org/building/vanity-ballroom/ The ballroom was closed in 1958, but reopened in 1964 for one night a week. It was eventually completely shuttered, and although it played a bit part in the Eminem feature film 8 Mile in 2002, it remains closed and dilapidated. Description Dance floor of the Vanity Ballroom The Vanity Ballroom is a two-story building originally containing five retail shops on the first floor and a ballroom on the second. It is built in the Art Deco style with an Aztec or Mayan Revival theme and measures . Vanity Ballroom Building from the state of Michigan It is constructed of steel and reinforced concrete and faced with brick. The bulk of the brickwork uses orange brick; this is complemented with darker brick and cast stones. There is a three-sided entrance pavilion at the corner of the structure, and the fa√ßades to either side (along both Jefferson Avenue and Newport Street) are nearly identical. These fa√ßades terminate in smaller entrance pavilions; all three pavilions are slightly taller than the rest of the fa√ßades and contain a geometric stone pattern near the top. The multi- paned windows on the second floor are flanked by pilasters and topped with Art Deco geometric designs echoing those of the Aztecs. The ballroom was built to accommodate 1,000 couples, and has a maple dance floor, a stage or bandstand, and a promenade on three sides. The dance floor was built on springs which intentionally compressed under the weight of the people who danced on it, giving the dancers a bounce as they moved. The backdrop of the stage features a scene representing Chichen Itza. Three of the retail shops on the first floor also had interiors designed by Agree; their interiors echo the Art Deco Aztec theme of the exterior. Within the retail spaces, Agree used elements such as wood and marble trim and terrazzo floors. The exteriors of these first-floor stores have been substantially changedVanity Ballroom Building from the city of Detroit with many of the Mayan flavored elements torn off the fa√ßade.

Oishei Children's Hospital (viewed from Ellicott Street) Kaleida Health, founded in 1998, is a not-for-profit healthcare network that manages five hospitals in the Buffalo-Niagara Falls metropolitan area. Facilities Kaleida Health runs the Buffalo General Medical Center, a hospital on the premises of the Buffalo Niagara Medical Campus. It was founded on its current site in the mid-19th century and has undergone expansions ever since, including one in 1986 that added a 16-story tower to the main complex. The hospital had 24,000 inpatient visits in 2016. The interior lobby was remodeled and the exterior of the building was repainted in 2018 to match the color scheme of newer facilities on the campus at a cost of $2 million. Kaleida also runs the John R. Oishei Children's Hospital, a children's hospital that opened in November 2017, replacing Women and Children's Hospital of Buffalo and cost $270 million and nearly three years to build. There are 185 beds, including 64 neonatal units, 14 operating rooms, an indoor garden and skyway connections to both Buffalo General Medical Center and Conventus. The hospital broke ground in early 2015 and was designed by Shepley Bulfinch and built by Turner Construction. Gates Vascular Institute (viewed from East North Street) Kaleida and the State University of New York at Buffalo jointly built the Gates Vascular Institute building, which was completed in 2012, replacing Millard Fillmore Gates Circle Hospital, which was demolished in October 2015; the lower floors house a clinical facility run by Kaleida that includes an emergency room, outpatient, inpatient and medical imaging facilities. As of 2017, Kaleida Health oversees Upper Allegheny Health System, which comprises Brooks Memorial Hospital, Lakeshore Hospital, Olean General, Bradford Regional Medical Center and Cuba Memorial Hospital. Patient Safety Concerns A report produced by Consumer Reports in July 2015 on the prevalence of hospital-acquired infections gave Kaleida hospitals a below average ranking in all but one category. The ranking was based on hospital-reported data provided to federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention between October 2013 and September 2014. Kaleida Health was also cited by Medicare for having high rates of infections and other patient-safety problems. The Hospital Acquired Conditions Reduction Program, which was created as part of the Affordable Care Act, seeks to incentivize hospitals to improve patient safety by measuring rates of hospital-acquired infection and other patient safety metrics and then penalizing hospitals that perform poorly. As a result of this program Kaleida Health has been penalized more than $1 million in 2016 through reduced Medicare payments.

The original village, one of the oldest in the area, is perched on S√∏ller√∏d Hill on the south side of S√∏ller√∏d Lake. It merged with the neighbouring village of √òver√∏d to the north and the modern district of Holte to the southwest in the middle of the 20th century and now forms part of the Greater Copenhagen area. Most of the local landmarks are concentrated in a well-preserved village environment centred on the old village pond and on S√∏ller√∏dvej (S√∏ller√∏d Road). They include the medieval S√∏ller√∏d Church, with a scenic cemetery, the famous S√∏ller√∏d Inn, now a one-star Michelin restaurant, the old country house Mothsg√•rden, now a local history museum, and a number of other 18th and 19th-century landmarks. History S√∏ller√∏d Lake seen from √òver√∏d with S√∏ller√∏d Church in the background (c. 1895) The name S√∏ller√∏d, originally Sylueruth (1321-23), is derived from the male name Sylfa and -r√∏d, meaning clearing (rydning). S√∏ller√∏d Church was built on the top of S√∏ller√∏d Hill in about 1175, showing that a village was already present at the site at that time. The extensive parish reached all the way from Fures√∏ Lake in the west to the √òresund coast in the east. S√∏ller√∏d Inn was opened by the pastor of S√∏ller√∏d Church after he had obtained a license from the king in 1677. Due to its proximity to Copenhagen, S√∏ller√∏d, together with other localities in the area, became a popular location for well-to-do citizens from Copenhagen to acquire a country estate. The four largest properties in the village were S√∏ller√∏dg√•rd, Fogedg√•rden, Carlsminde and Mothsg√•rden. The old well next to the village pond. The current brick structure is from 1919 The villagers originally got their water supply from S√∏ller√∏d Lake or for superior quality from Suhm's Spring in √òver√∏d. S√∏ller√∏dgaard had its own well from 1740 and a well was dug at the rectory in 1848, catering also to the school, which was located between the church and the rectory. In 1867, the owners of S√∏ller√∏dgaard, Fogedg√•rden, Carlsminde and Mothsg√•rden constructed a new public water well next to the village pond. S√∏ller√∏d's first waterworks opened on Fogedg√•rdens's land to the east of the village in 1907. The village gradually developed into a suburban area and grew together with N√¶rum to the east. Vangebo School opened in 1958 to a design by Henning Larsen. S√∏ller√∏d Municipality existed until 2007 when it was merged with Birker√∏d Municipality to form Rudersdal Municipality. Landmarks S√∏ller√∏d Church S√∏ller√∏d Church stands on the top of S√∏ller√∏d Hill. The Medieval church was a small flat-roofed structure built in chalk ashlar from Stevns Klint. It was later expanded with a chancel to the east and a porch to the north. The tower was built in 1450. The church was expanded with two cross arms in the 18th century. The smaller one, attached to the porch, is known as K√∏benhavnerlogen, a name that dates from the time when the church was often frequented by visitors from Copenhagen on Sundays. S√∏ller√∏d Rectory S√∏ller√∏d Rectory is located next to the church. The thatched, half- timbered complex consists of a main wing, barns and stables. S√∏ller√∏d Sogneg√•rd was designed by Inger and Johannes Exner and completed in 1993. S√∏ller√∏d Inn, one of the best restaurants in Denmark, was established in the 1980s. It has maintained a star in the Michelin Gude since 2001. Mothsg√•rden was from the 1680s until 1711 owned by Mathias Moth, who was Minister of Interior Affairs and the brother of Christian V's official mistress. The building now houses a local history museum operated by Rudersdal Municipality. S√∏ller√∏d Manor. Another house with royal associations is S√∏ller√∏dgaard, now known as S√∏ller√∏d Slot. It was originally built by Frederik Danneskiold- Sams√∏e, a grandson of Christian V, between 1740 and 1743. Over the following decades, the property changed hands several times. Later residents included Frederick, Hereditary Prince of Denmark. The original house was replaced by a more modest one in 1784. The current house is from 1915. The property features a section of the original rough iron fence from the Odd Fellows Mansion in Bredgade, Copenhagen, which was dismantled when the house was expanded and converted into a concert venue in 1884. Carlsminde Carlsminde (S√∏ller√∏dvej 30) is a Rococo-style mansion from 1751. It now houses the headquarters of the Venstre Party. The building was listed in 1918. Fogedg√•rden (S√∏ller√∏dvej 38) and Ilufsh√∏j (S√∏ller√∏dvej 40) are also listed.

Mass School Shooting Plot Foiled  On January 26, 2017, two male students at The Villages Middle School, a 13-year-old and a 14-year-old, were escorted from lunch by the police then arrested at their homes and charged with conspiracy to commit murder. Law enforcement and school officials had followed up on rumours and discovered that some students had been warned not to come to school on Friday. In interviewing the 13-year-old suspect, officials learned of the 14-year-old's involvement. The 14-year-old student acknowledged his involvement in conversations with the 13-year-old student while referencing the Columbine High School shooting. The student informed officials that the two students had planned an attack which included what they would use as a signal to begin shooting.

Mrs. Lee was a loyal citizen of the United States whose flock of sheep was sold by the Confederate army, as the Confederates considered Mrs. Lee an 'alien enemy'. Mr. Knox purchased the sheep from the Confederate army, and Mrs. Lee brought suit for trespass and conversion. The Court instructed the jury that whatever amount they awarded could be paid with legal tender notes of the United States. Mr. Knox appealed, as he contended that this instruction was equivalent to telling the jury to add a premium for the discount of paper currency relative to specie. The case of Parker v. Davis was resolved in the same decision where Davis wished to compel specific performance requiring Parker to convey a lot to Davis in return for payment of money. The Court decreed that Davis should pay money into the Court and Parker was to execute a deed to Davis.

Author  The Safvat as-safa was written by Ebn Bazzaz (; d. 1391-2), a disciple of Safi ad-Din's son and successor, Sadr al- Dƒ´n M≈´sƒÅ, who prompted him to write the work. He probably completed it in 1358. Little else is known of his life.B. Nikitine, \\"Essai d'analyse du Safvat-us-safa,\\" Journal Asiatique 245 (1957), 385E. Glassen, \\"Ibn al-Bazzaz al-Ardabili,\\" Encyclopaedia of Islam, 2nd ed.  Content  The work is divided into an introduction, 12 chapters, and a conclusion. Only two of the chapters (chapters 2 and 11) deal with the circumstances of his life. Most of the rest of the book recounts numerous episodes of the shaykh performing miraculous feats. The work also includes Shaykh Safi's commentaries on various passages of the Qur'an and hadith. The contents may be summarized as follows: *Introduction: Prophecies by the Prophet Muhammad and various holy men foretelling the coming of Sheikh Safi. *Chapter 1: Safi ad-Din's genealogy, childhood, discipleship under Sheikh Zahed Gilani, and succession to leadership of the order. *Chapter 2: Miracles in which Shaykh Safi saved people from perilous situations in the sea, the mountains, or from enemies or illness. *Chapter 3: Miracles motivated either by Shaykh Safi's grace or displeasure. *Chapter 4: Safi ad-Din's explanations of difficult passages or apparent contradictions in the Qur'an and hadith. *Chapter 5: Miracles of Safi ad-Din involving jinn, animals, and non-living things. *Chapter 6: Safi ad- Din's practice of dhikr. *Chapter 7: Various miracles performed by Safi ad- Din, such as reading minds, predicting the future, and contact with the dead. *Chapter 8: Safi ad-Din's virtues and pious acts. *Chapter 9: Safi ad-Din's final illness and death. *Chapter 10: Miracles Safi ad-Din performed after he died. *Chapter 11: The shaykh's greatness and fame throughout the world. *Chapter 12: Miracles performed by Safi ad-Din's disciples.  Safavid-era revisions  Shaykh Safi ad-Din was a Sunni and an adherent of the Shafi\`i school of law.Zeki Velidi Togan, \\"Sur l'origine des Safavides,\\" in M√©langes Louis Massignon 3 (Damascus: Institut Fran√ßais de Damas, 1957), 353 In 1501 the Sufi order he founded became the ruling family in the Safavid empire, but they converted to Shi\`ism while at the same time continuing their role as head of the order. Certain elements in the Safvat as-safa, particularly Shaykh Safi's genealogy and his religious views, became inconsistent with the Safavid dynasty's self-image. Therefore, in 1542, Shah Tahmasb commissioned Mir Abu al-Fat'h Husayni to revise the Safvat as-safa to give it an explicit Shi\`i tone. This official version contains textual changes designed to obscure the Kurdish origins of the Safavid family and to vindicate their claim to descent from the Imams.Roger Savory, \\"EBN BAZZƒÄZ\\" in Encyclop√¶dia Iranica  Editions  There have been two published editions of the Safvat as-Safa. The first was a lithographed edition prepared by Mirza Ahmad ibn Hajj Karim Tabrizi and published in Bombay in 1911. This has traditionally been the standard edition used by scholars, who call it the Bombay lithograph. The second published edition appeared in 1994 in Tehran, edited by Ghulam Reza Tabataba'i Majd.

They are typically designed to circulate as currency or currency substitutes. Bills of credit are mentioned in Article One, Section 10, Clause One (also known as the Contract Clause) of the United States Constitution, where their issuance by state governments is prohibited. History =Use in the American Colonies (pre 1775)= British colonies in North America would issue bills of credit in order to deal with fiscal crises, although doing so without receiving them as revenue in like amounts would increase the money supply, resulting in price inflation and a drop in value relative to the pound sterling. The documents would circulate as if they were currency, and colonial governments would accept them as payment for debts like taxes. They were not always considered legal tender for private debts. Colonial decisions on the issuance of bills of credit were also frequently the subject of disputes between differing factions within the colony, and with royally appointed governors. Between 1690 and 1750 the matter was regularly debated in the Province of Massachusetts Bay, where merchants and lenders stood to lose value when new bills were issued, and borrowers stood to gain, because they could repay their debts with depreciated bills. The Massachusetts bills were finally retired in 1749 when the province received a large payment in coin for its financial contributions to the 1745 Siege of Louisbourg. The Province of New Jersey issued bills of credit beginning in the 1710s, but successfully managed to avoid significant inflationary effects.Fleming, pp. 29‚Äì30 =Insertion in the United States Constitution= Article I, Section 10, Clause 1 prohibits the states from issuing Bills of Credit. The prohibition of states issuing Bills of Credit came in direct response to how states managed their financial policy during the era of the Articles of Confederation. While all states in theory recognized the American Continental as their official currency, in reality, nearly every state issued its own Bills of credit, which further devalued the Continental and led to its eventual collapse as a currency. The painful experience of the runaway inflation and collapse of the Continental dollar prompted the delegates to the Constitutional Convention to include the Contract Clause into the United States Constitution, so that the individual states could not issue bills of credit or \\"make any Thing but gold and silver Coin a Tender in Payment of Debts.\\"U.S Constitution, Article 1, Section 10 This restriction of bills of credit was extended to the Federal government, as the power to \\"emit bills\\" from the Articles of Confederation was abolished, leaving Congress with the power \\"to borrow money on credit.\\"U.S Constitution, Article 1, Section 8 Usage throughout history The United States Government has, at numerous times throughout American History, issued Bills of Credit to utilize in place of paper currency. Most instances of this have occurred during wartime. =18th century= American Revolutionary War (1775‚Äì1783) During the American Revolutionary War the Continental Congress frequently issued bills of credit referred to as Continentals. Because of inflation they rapidly declined in value, leading to the unfavorable comparison that something was \\"not worth a Continental\\". =19th century= United States Notes In 1862, the United States Department of the Treasury began to issue United States Notes as obligations of the United States. United States Notes are examples of Bills of Credit as they used to be inserted by the Treasury into circulation free of interest (production of these notes was halted in 1971 during termination of the Bretton Woods system, yet Congress retains the power to put more into circulation at any time, and $300 million remain in circulation still). Interest-bearing notes Interest-bearing notes are a grouping of Civil War-era bills of credit-related emissions of the US Treasury. The grouping includes the one- and two-year notes authorized by the Act of March 3, 1863, which bore interest at five percent annually, were a legal tender at face value, and were issued in denominations of $10, $20, $50, $100, $500 and $1000. Compound interest treasury notes Two-year $20 1864 compound interest treasury note Compound interest treasury notes were emissions of the United States Treasury Department authorized in 1863 and 1864 with aspects of both paper money and debt. They were issued in denominations of $10, $20, $50, $100, $500 and $1000. While they were legal tender at face value, they were redeemable after three years with six percent annual interest compounded semi-annually.. In the absence of efficient investment banks, the hybrid nature of these instruments allowed the government to directly distribute debt by paying the notes out to creditors as legal tender, and then relying on interest-seeking parties to eventually remove them from circulation in order to redeem them with interest at maturity. Refunding Certificate The Refunding Certificate was a type of interest-bearing banknote that the United States Treasury issued in 1879. They issued it only in the $10 denomination, depicting Benjamin Franklin. Their issuance reflects the end of a coin-hoarding period that began during the American Civil War, and represented a return to public confidence in paper money. =20th century= Federal Reserve Bank Notes Federal Reserve Bank Notes, issued between 1915 and 1934, are bills of credit that are legal tender in the United States. They had the same value as other kinds of notes of similar face value. Federal Reserve Bank Notes differ from Federal Reserve Notes in that they are backed by one of the twelve Federal Reserve Banks, rather than by all collectively. They were backed in a similar way to National Bank Notes, using U.S. bonds, but issued by Federal Reserve banks instead of by chartered National banks. Federal Reserve Bank Notes are no longer issued. Confusion with paper money Legal writers‚Äîas opposed to economic historians‚Äîincorrectly assume that the constitutional phrase \\"Bills of Credit\\" was simply a synonym for paper money, but it only refers to one, though very important, type of paper currency.Natelson, Robert G. Paper Money and the Original Understanding of the Coinage Clause, Harvard Journal of Law & Public Policy, vol. 31, pp. 1044‚Äì45 The Constitution explicitly prohibits the states from issuing bills of credit and coining money. States are only permitted to make gold and silver coin legal tender. References References *Fleming, Thomas. New Jersey: A History. New York: Norton. 1984.

The player takes control of Axel Foley, the main character of the series. There are four distinct sub games including a side-scrolling action game, a driving game, an overhead view shooter and a first person shooter. The game was released on Commodore 64, ZX Spectrum, BBC Micro, Amstrad CPC, Amiga, Atari ST, and PC. The BBC version only contains the driving game. Blast Entertainment released a Beverly Hills Cop game in Europe for the PlayStation 2 in 2006, which was panned by fans of the movie.  Reception  The game was also reviewed in the magazine The Games Machine. They commented that the game's plot \\"bears absolutely no relation to the film storyline\\", the Commodore 64 version was graphically and sonically weak, and the Amiga and Atari ST releases were also poor, with an Axel Foley character that looked more like Daley Thompson. The reviewers of Zzap!64 thought the Commodore 64 version was not particularly well executed with \\"passable\\" graphics and sound, but provided \\"a lot of variety\\" making it \\"quite good value for money\\". The overall rating given was 68%. In 2006, Abandonware website Abandonias Sebatianos reviewed Beverly Hills Cop with \\"All in all the game is OK, but the animation is far from smooth.

Despite its detractors, Westlake has enjoyed considerable publicity over the course of its 60-year history.

City of Louisville, 362 U.S. 199 (1960), was a decision of the United States Supreme Court in which the Court unanimously held that it is a violation of due process to convict a person of an offense when there is no evidence of his guilt. It is one of the rare instances of the Supreme Court's granting certiorari to review a decision of a court so insignificant (the Police Court of Louisville, Kentucky) that state law does not provide any mechanism for appeals from its judgments.As explained during oral argument, Kentucky provides no appellate review of Police Court cases when the fine is less than $20. The fine here was $10, but it was one of a long series of similar fines. According to counsel for Thompson, as stated in oral argument, this reflected a police vendetta against Thompson for perceived uppitiness. The case is sometimes referred to as the \\"Shuffling Sam\\" case, because the petitioner Sam Thompson was known locally as \\"Shuffling Sam.\\"See Lewiston Daily Sun, High Court Backs Shufflin' Sam (March 22, 1960). The Court noted, \\"There is no evidence that anyone else in the cafe objected to petitioner's shuffling his feet in rhythm with the music of the jukebox.\\"362 U.S. at 202. See also [https://books.google.com/books?isbn=1596520604 , p. 61. Associate Justice Hugo Black delivered the opinion of the court. The case was briefed and argued for Thompson by several notable former law clerks of justices of the Court.Louis Lusky argued the cause for petitioner. He had been law clerk for United States Supreme Court Justice Harlan F. Stone from 1937 to 1938. With him on the brief were Harold Leventhal and Eugene Gressman. Leventhal was law clerk to U.S. Supreme Court Justices Harlan F. Stone from 1937 to 1938 and Stanley F. Reed in 1938, and later a federal court of appeals judge. Gressman was law clerk to U.S. Supreme Court Justice Frank Murphy from 1943 to 1948, and later was co-author of a leading treatise on Supreme Court practice and procedure, . See generally List of law clerks of the Supreme Court of the United States. Background =Arrest and proceedings in lower court= As stated in the opinion of the Supreme Court, Sam Thompson went into the Liberty End Caf√© in Louisville on a Saturday evening. Two policemen came into the caf√© and observed Sam \\"out there on the floor dancing by himself.\\" The officers accosted Thompson and asked him what he was doing, \\"and he said he was waiting on a bus.\\" The officers then arrested him for loitering, and took him outside. Thompson remonstrated ‚Äì he \\"was very argumentative ‚Äì he argued with us back and forth, and so then we placed a disorderly conduct charge on him.\\" That was the entire record that the prosecution put on at the trial, except for a record showing a total of 54 previous arrests. The Louisville city ordinance under which petitioner was convicted of loitering reads as follows: \\"It shall be unlawful for any person . . . , without visible means of support, or who cannot give a satisfactory account of himself, . . . to sleep, lie, loaf, or trespass in or about any premises, building, or other structure in the City of Louisville, without first having obtained the consent of the owner or controller of said premises, structure, or building; . . .\\" Thompson's counsel unsuccessfully sought dismissal of the charges on the ground that a judgment of conviction on this record would deprive Thompson of property and liberty without due process of law under the Fourteenth Amendment, in that there was no evidence to support findings of guilt. Thompson then put in evidence that he was waiting for a bus to his home that was due in an hour or less, that he was a regular customer at the caf√©, and that he was not unwelcome in the caf√©. There was no evidence that \\"anyone else in the caf√© objected to [Sam's] shuffling his feet in rhythm with the music of the jukebox, or that his conduct was boisterous or offensive to anyone present.\\" The Police Court found Thompson guilty of both charges and fined him $10 on each charge. =Procedural issues concerning appellate review= Police court fines of less than $20 on a single charge are not appealable or otherwise reviewable in any other Kentucky court. Thompson's counsel therefore asked the police court to stay the judgments so that he might have an opportunity to apply for certiorari to the U.S. Supreme Court to review the due process contentions he raised. The police court suspended judgment for 24 hours, during which time a longer stay from the Kentucky Circuit Court was sought. That court, after examining the police court's judgment and transcript, granted a stay, concluding that \\"there appears to be merit\\" in the contention that \\"there is no evidence upon which conviction and sentence by the Police Court could be based.\\" The city then sought to appeal, and the Kentucky Court of Appeals held that the Circuit Court lacked the power to grant the stay that it had granted, but the Court of Appeals sua sponte granted its own stay, because Thompson \\"appears to have a real question as to whether he has been denied due process under the Fourteenth Amendment of the Federal Constitution, yet this substantive right cannot be tested unless we grant him a stay of execution because his fines are not appealable and will be satisfied by being served in jail before he can prepare and file his petition for certiorari. Appellee's substantive right of due process is of no avail to him unless this court grants him the ancillary right whereby he may test same in the Supreme Court.\\" The U.S. Supreme Court then granted certiorari. Opinion of the Court Justice Hugo Black delivered the unanimous opinion of the Court that it violated due process to convict and punish Shuffling Sam without any evidence of his guilt The Supreme Court reviewed the evidentiary record and found \\"no evidence whatever in the record to support these convictions.\\" It then held that it is \\"a violation of due process to convict and punish a man without evidence of his guilt.\\" The Supreme Court did not state whether the state's action violated procedural or substantive due process, but it is generally considered that the Court found a violation of substantive due process.See Louis H. Pollak, The Supreme Court and the States: Reflections on Boynton v. Virginia, 49 15 (1961). Subsequent developments A commentator criticized the Court's opinion as \\"mak[ing] a deep incursion upon basic principles of federalism\\" by re-characterizing evidence of conduct that the Court deemed protected activity as \\"no evidence\\" of crime.No Evidence To Support a Conviction, 110 1137, 1146 (1962). According to Court Listener, this case has been cited approximately 16,000 times as of July 2015.
