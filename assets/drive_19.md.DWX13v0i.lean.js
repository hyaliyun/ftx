Early life  Wahlforss was born in Helsinki, the capital of Grand Duchy of Finland. His father Henrik Alfred Wahlforss was an appreciated chemistry teacher in Polytechnical institute; his mother, Emilia Elisabeth n√©e L√•nghjelm, was 24 years younger and originally from Ostrobothnia. The couple had four children: 1883 and 1885 born daughters Elisabeth and Henriette, and 1891 and 1895 born sons Wilhelm and Eric. While the father was doing significant research, his work, which was written in Swedish, remained without international attention. Another hindrance for his success was his drinking problem. He died in 1899 when Wilhelm was just eight years old. The family fell into poverty and moved often in the following years, however, staying in the same area, Oulunkyl√§.  Studies  During his school years in Swedish Normal School Wilhelm Wahlforss had classmates who later became influential, such as Hugo √ñsterman and Hjalmar Str√∂mberg. Wahlforss did well at geography and other subjects which required remembering, but not at mathematics, and particularly languages and writing created difficulties. He graduated few months late in autumn 1911 because first failed his matriculation exam in Finnish, the main language of the state.Zilliacus: Kannattavuuslaskelma. pp. 44‚Äì61. In September 1911 Wahlforss signed up for mechanical engineering studies in his father's former workplace which had been in the meantime renamed University of Technology. His orientation was textile industry. His strong areas were mechanics, physics, inorganic chemistry and economics, but in such subjects which required practical skills, as laboratory exercises, his ratings were \\"satisfactory\\". He took part in student activities and was active in the students' union. Wahlforss had a hectic social life, as an organiser he was efficient and determined, and he is described as a self- confident and charming person. Already during his studies he decided to become a manager of some large company. At the end of his studies Wahlforss focussed on heavy machinery and industrial economy. He did his internship in De F√∂renade Yllefabrikerna AB in Helsinki, Finlayson repair workshop in Tampere and later in Helsinki at Hietalahti Shipyard and Engineering Works, and finally in State Railways' Engineering Works foundry. For his master's thesis he made a complete and detailed calculation about textile factory economics and gained excellent rating, graduating in March 1916. In autumn 1915 Wahlforss started dating Siri Johanna Wrede, a young lady from Turku.Zilliacus: Appelassa. pp. 63‚Äì81.  Early career  = Nobel and Turun Rautateollisuus = Wahlforss started his working career as draftsman in Nobel arms company in Saint Petersburg in February 1916, but he returned to Finland already in May. After Wahlforss got engaged with Siri Wrede, he became workshop engineer in Turun Rautateollisuus in Turku which was then led by Siri's father Freiherr Carolus Wrede. The work was technical and intense, as the company order book was full of ammunition and other military equipment to the Imperial Russian Army. He quit at early 1917, possibly for loyalty towards many of his old classmates who had enlisted in the J√§ger Movement to fight against the Russian rule; also Wahlforss had wanted to join in the movement but was not accepted, because he was regarded as provider for his mother and younger brother. Another possible reason for leaving might have been his manager and brother of his fianc√©, Gustaf \\"Dutta\\" G.W. Wrede who he mostly got well along with but found his sarcasm arduous at times. = Fiskars = Wahlforss's new workplace was in Fiskars rolling mill, where he was appointed workshop technical manager under Albert Lindsay von Julin. Julin supported him a lot, sharing his experience and knowledge, but offered also a warning example about dangers of alcohol in business relations. Wahlforss enjoyed his work; he led a team of younger engineers and got a lot of freedom at renewing the outdated facilities. Wilhelm Wahlforss married Siri Wrede in April 1917, and soon the couple started to expect a child. But soon times became turbulent ‚Äì Carolus and Dutta Wrede were maltreated and captured for six days by workers and Russian seamen in November. Labour movement was increasingly radicalising and the Fiskars factory was only protected by some dozen men with carbines who could have done little against the 500 workers, who, however, stayed calm during the soon following civil war. In February the time of birth was getting closer, and for this Siri Wahlforss travelled to Turku which was in hands of Red Guards. Wilhelm Wahlforss was a leader in Pohja Civil Guard and he participated in actions of the White Guard. His personal involvement is unclear but it is strongly suspected that the troops he led participated in executions of dozens of Red Guard soldiers in Nummi. Their daughter Christel was born on 12. March 1918. = Return to Turun Rautateollisuus = In 1919, after two years in Fiskars, Wahlforss returned to Turun Rautateollisuus; Gustav Wrede was appointed manager of Teijon Tehtaat and Wilhelm Wahlforss became the new technical manager. In the same year he travelled to USA to learn tractor production. Wahlforss had more space to operate than before, but he aimed higher ‚Äì he wanted to become director. = Lehtoniemi = In 1921 Wahlforss got an opportunity to demonstrate his business skills ‚Äì he was appointed General Manager of Lehtoniemi shipyard and engineering works, which was another company partly owned by Carolus Wrede. The company operated in Lehtoniemi and Taipale close to Varkaus, Savonia, and had fallen into trouble after losing its market in Russia. Wahlforss worked hard travelling around Finland and making new customer contacts. The order book never became very long but Wahlforss managed to improve the financial result of the companyZilliacus: Matkalla Karjalaan. pp. 83‚Äì101. from 906 000 marks' loss to 147 000 marks' profit. Siri Wahlforss, who moved to Lehtoniemi in October 1921 together with Christel and three weeks old second daughter Susanna, did not like the too rural area. The period in Lehtoniemi helped the couple financially. = Adventure in textile industry = The family moved back in Turku, when Wahlforss bought major share of textile factory Turun Verkatehdas in autumn 1923 jointly with investor Harry Olsson. He financed the bargain largely with a bank loan. The company was in a difficult situation; the market had dropped due to cheap import and the machinery was worn out. Wahlforss could not turn the business profitable. Recovering of the company would have needed patience and capital, and Wahlforss had neither of them. Finally, the company was sold to Nordic Wool Company in late autumn 1924; the new owner Leo Wainstein was a calm and patient man ‚Äì opposite to Wahlforss ‚Äì and managed to turn the factory to flourish again. This was the biggest defeat of Wahlforss during his whole career. The money he managed to save he invested on Lehtom√§en Konepaja, where he returned, but left again after seven months ‚Äì and again to textile sector. = Sofia Zweygberg = In August 1925 Wahlforss started working for Viipuri textile distributor company Sofia Zweygberg, which had large debts and outstanding payments, and the managing director had recently died to a lightning strike. The desperate company hired Wahlforss for a high salary to reorganise the company. First Wahlforss put focus on getting the payments, and after half year he had collected 1.3 million marks of payments. The second action was selling of real estates and the Finlayson shares the company owned. The 1.27 million marks' loss of 1924 was decreased to loss of 0.9 million marks in 1925. Next Wahlforss put effort on increasing the sales and the result of 1926 showed 1.85 million marks' profit. But he left the company already at beginning of June, because he regarded his task was completed, and he had been offered a new interesting challenge.  W√§rtsil√§  Ab W√§rtsil√§ Oy, an iron works in V√§rtsil√§, Northern Karelia, was in financial problems; the company was deeply in debt due to a long-time unprofitable operation. Wahlforss had gained reputation as a capable restructurer and hired as General Manager of the company. Wahlforss repeated the same as he had done before ‚Äì he started to travel around the country to introduce the company products, but soon he realised that the company would not become profitable by producing just raw iron bars. Wahlforss decided to step up in degree of processing and soon the company started producing nails, band iron, radiators and other products. With these actions Wahlforss managed to lead the company result slightly to positive side in period 1927‚Äì1931, but it still did not manage to shorten its debts. New problems came in 1931 during the Great Depression; W√§rtsil√§'s financial situation got alarming and it was on verge of bankruptcy. The trading was stopped in Helsinki stock exchange. But two factors saved the company; the first one was galvanised wire production, which W√§rtsil√§ had started right before the depression as the first company in the Nordic Countries. The second one was the company personnel which agreed about lowering of salaries in order to save the company. Already in 1932 W√§rtsil√§ could pay dividend to its shareholders and the same trend continued in the following years. Robert Mattson, the major shareholder of engineering company Kone- ja Siltarakennus, died in 1935. Kone ja Silta was a big industrial company that owned a big workshop in Hakaniemi in Helsinki, but also the Hietalahti shipyard and Crichton-Vulcan in Turku. Mattson's shares were kept in strongroom in Pohjoismaiden Yhdyspankki (PYP) as deposit for debts. Rainer von Fieandt, who was a board member in Kone ja Silta, W√§rtsil√§ and PYP, organised together with Wahlforss a gigantic acquisition ‚Äì W√§rtsil√§, an East Finnish company with 700 employees, took over the leading metal industry company of Finland in 1935. The transaction was fully funded by a loan given by PYP. The new W√§rtsil√§ Corporation lead now four units which all were barely profitable; therefore, many financial specialists expressed their doubts on the future of the company. However, Wahlforss restructured and developed the corporation determinedly during the 1930s. In 1938 the total number of employees reached 6 000. The acquisition put Wahlforss on pedestal; he was the chairman first in the Finnish Metal Industry Association in 1937‚Äì1942 and thereafter in the Finnish Industrial Union 1942‚Äì1946. During the Second World War he travelled to USA to purchase weapons. After the war ended, Wahlforss participated in negotiations about war reparations with Soviet Union representatives and he was sent to Paris to attend as an expert attendee in the peace treaty negotiations in 1947. Over 40% of all war reparations which consisted of metal products were produced by W√§rtsil√§. At the end of 1940s number of personnel in W√§rtsil√§ reached already 11 000. Until 1954 Wahlforss was a member of delegation that negotiated about Soviet exports. In his negotiations with Soviet representatives he gained a legendary reputation; Wahlforss could only speak a couple of words in Russian and he did not know very much about naval architecture ‚Äì but he was a true businessman and therefore he made a number of ship deals with Soviet Union. Wahlforss resigned from the position of General Manager in 1961 but he remained as board member until his death in 1969.  Political career  Wahlforss in later life, 1966. Wahlforss entered into politics at the end of 1950s and he was selected with a large number of votes to the k√∂ping council of Espoo in 1960 municipal elections as a member of Swedish People's Party. However, Wahlforss was used to make decisions quickly and he did not get used to political processes. He also could not apply his knowledge of economics. He left the council just after one and half year during the term. Wahlforss participated in the so- called Honka alliance which was a wide-spectrum political project for overthrowing Urho Kekkonen in presidential elections of 1962. The alliance failed and got revealed and after this the personal relationship between Kekkonen and Wahlforss remained cold. Despite of this, the men co-operated successfully in the Soviet trade relationships; Kekkonen promoted actively exports of the Finnish companies and W√§rtsil√§ was the biggest individual Finnish exporter to Soviet Union.

She is known for the \\"Phil Ochs Song Nights\\" she organizes, at which various musicians sing the songs of her brother, singer-songwriter Phil Ochs. Ochs was born in Scotland on April 12, 1937, to an American father and Scottish mother. The following year, her family moved to the United States. Her brother Phil was born in 1940, followed by Michael in 1943.Schumacher, pp. 12, 16. The Ochs family moved frequently: to San Antonio, Texas, then to Austin, Texas; to Far Rockaway, New York, and then to Perrysburg in upstate New York.Schumacher, pp. 20, 23. After she graduated from high school, Ochs was sent by her parents to a finishing school in Switzerland. While she was away, the family moved to Columbus, Ohio. Ochs married a soldier in early 1957, but the couple were divorced by 1963.Eliot, pp. 16, 53. The couple had one child: Robyn. She later remarried and had two sons: David and Jonathan. In January 1976, Phil Ochs‚Äîwho was suffering from alcoholism and bipolar disorder‚Äîmoved to his sister's Far Rockaway, New York, home. She hoped she could nurture him back to health. He saw a psychiatrist who prescribed medication; he told his sister he was taking it.After Phil Ochs's death, Ochs found he had been lying about taking his medication. Schumacher, p. 349. On April 9, 1976, Phil Ochs hanged himself in the bathroom of Sonny's house.Schumacher, pp. 344‚Äì352. Ochs was a school teacher in Far Rockaway and upstate New York.

Kennelly, S.J., (May 22, 1914 ‚Äì January 3, 2011) was an Irish-born American Jesuit and academic administrator. He was a member of the Society of Jesus for more than seventy-seven years. Kennelly served as the 13th president of Loyola University New Orleans from 1970 until 1974. He was also the founder of Strake Jesuit College Preparatory in Houston, Texas. Kennelly spent thirty- three of his years of his priesthood working in Tampa, Florida on three separate occasions. Biography =Early life= Kennelly was born on May 22, 1914, in Kilbaha, Moyvane, County Kerry, Ireland, to parents, Timothy and Mary Jane Kennelly, who resided in County Kerry. He had five brothers and four sisters. In 1929, his uncle invited him to attend high school in New York City. A second uncle, Rev. Patrick Ryan, further encouraged Kennelly to move to Mobile, Alabama, where he attended Spring Hill College, which had a high school on its campus at the time. Kennelly entered the Society of Jesus, whose members are commonly known as the Jesuits, on June 9, 1933, at St. Charles College in Grand Coteau, Louisiana (Today, St. Charles College is now the Jesuit Spirituality Center at St. Charles College). He obtained his bachelor's degree in classics from Spring Hill College in 1939. He then studied at St. Mary's College, Kansas. He was ordained a Catholic priest within the Society of Jesus in 1946 while studying at St. Mary's College. Kennelly then returned to Ireland, where he received a master's degree in education in 1949 from the National University of Ireland. Kennelly spent much of the 1940s as a postgraduate student while also working as a teacher and administrator at several Jesuit high schools. He first worked as a teacher at Jesuit High School in Tampa, Florida from 1940 until 1943. He left that position to pursue studies at St. Mary's College in Kansas. Kennelly was then appointed the principal of the former Jesuit High School in Shreveport, Louisiana, from 1948 until 1953. =Jesuit High School in Tampa= Kennelly returned to Jesuit High School in Tampa, where he served as the school's president and rector from 1953 to 1959. Kennelly spearheaded a $600,000 capital campaign to purchase 80 acres of rural farmland from a dairy rancher during his tenure as principal. The land acquisition allowed Jesuit High School to move from its former downtown Tampa location to the current campus, which is located on North Himes Avenue. The Tampa Tribune called Kennelly the \\"founder\\" of the modern Jesuit High School campus in 2011. Kennelly designed Jesuit High School's campus with St. Anthony's chapel as its centerpiece. =Strake Jesuit College Preparatory= Kennelly founded Strake Jesuit College Preparatory in Houston, Texas. He served as the school's president and rector from 1959 until 1970, when he departed to become president of Loyola University New Orleans. =President of Loyola University New Orleans (1970‚Äì1974)= Kennelly served as the 13th President of Loyola University New Orleans. The new home of the Loyola University New Orleans College of Law was constructed during Kennelly's tenure in office. Kennelly also established the President's Council, which consisted of a group of business executives who contributed their professional experience to the university. Kennelly was a fervent opponent of recreational drugs on campus, telling the Times-Picayune in a 1974 interview that, \\"I've done everything in my power to wipe them from the campus, and I think I've been successful.\\" Kennelly stepped down as President of the university in 1974 at the age of 59, saying it was time for a younger leader, according to The Times-Picayune. He was succeeded as president by Father James C. Carter, S.J., who had been the university's provost before his promotion. =Florida= Father Kennelly became the assistant pastor of Gesu Church in downtown Miami, Florida, after leaving the Loyola presidency. Kennelly served at Gesu Church from 1974 until 1975. Kennelly returned to Tampa in 1980, where he would live and work for twenty-two years. He became the associate pastor of Sacred Heart Catholic Church in Tampa, Florida from 1980 to 1982. He was further elevated to pastor-superior of Sacred Heart Catholic Church from 1982 until 1990. Kennelly publicly supported the opening a St. Francis House, an outreach center founded by Franciscan Sister Anne Dougherty to provide support for people with AIDS and HIV, in 1988. Kennelly returned once again to Jesuit High School in Tampa, Florida, serving as its rector and vice president from 1990 until 1997. He then returned to Sacred Heart Church in Tampa, as the pastor emeritus and Jesuit provincial vicar from 1997 until 2002. =Later life= Kennelly moved to Ignatius Residence, a Jesuit retirement community located in the Algiers neighborhood of New Orleans, in 2003. Father Michael Kennelly died at the Ignatius Residence in Algiers, New Orleans, Louisiana, on January 3, 2011, at the age of 96.

Early career during the Revolutionary Wars Joining the army in November 1790 as a mere trooper of the chasseurs-√†-cheval of Brittany, he subsequently served in the Army of the Rhine and of the Moselle, then in the Vend√©e, in Italy and in Germany, during the French Revolutionary Wars. In 1802 he became a captain of the first Regiment of chasseurs-√†-cheval of the Consular Guard. Napoleonic Wars Guyot took part to the Wars of the Third and Fourth Coalition with the Grande Arm√©e, holding the rank of squadron commander in the Guard chasseurs-√†-cheval regiment and being noted for bravery at the Austerlitz and Eylau. He fought at the minor Battle of Waren-Nossentin on 1 November 1806.Smith, pp. 229-230 A colonel in the Imperial Guard in 1807, he was created a baron of the Empire the next year and given a position in Lefebvre-Desnouettes's Guard light cavalry, commanding the Emperor's escort during the latter's brief campaign in Spain. In 1809, after the bloody battle of Aspern-Essling, Guyot was given the function of colonel commander of the Guard chasseurs-√†-chevalTulard, p. 931. and six weeks later he led a famous charge at the battle of Wagram. This action would bring him the rank of brigadier general. A Chamberlain of Emperor Napoleon I from March 1810, he was subsequently sent to Spain, where he won a promotion to general of division in 1811. During the Russian campaign and subsequent War of the Sixth Coalition, Guyot would serve as commander of the Guard chasseurs-√†-cheval. In the 1813 campaign in Saxony, he was wounded at the battle of L√ºtzen and led a brilliant charge at the battle of Bautzen, before being made prisoner at the battle of Kulm, in August. Released after an exchange of prisoners, Guyot took part to the epic battle of Leipzig, before being created a count of the Empire in November of that year. The 1814 campaign in France saw general Guyot at the heart of the action, commanding cavalry at La Rothi√®re, Champaubert and Craonne. 1814 incident and beyond In February 1814, General Guyot suffered a career-threatening incident, while he was commanding the Imperial Guard heavy cavalry. After the battle of Vauchamps, Guyot left the Guard horse artillery company that was attached to his division in an exposed position, with orders to join him in a precise location at nightfall. Guyot did not leave behind a cavalry escort and a guide, which resulted in the artillery company being ambushed that night, with the loss of some cannon and an entire platoon, killed or prisoner. These facts were immediately reported to the colonel commander of the Guard horse artillery, but nobody dared to inform Emperor Napoleon. Eventually, Marshal Fran√ßois Joseph Lefebvre was also informed and he went to the Emperor with the bad news. The Emperor immediately demanded a complete briefing and, upon hearing that the artillery company in question was under Guyot's command, he sent for him at once. Seeing Guyot, Napoleon aggressively criticized him for the incident and, after Guyot attempted to put the blame on the artillery company captain, Napoleon began a furious rant, blaming Guyot for the defeat at Brienne and for his failure to protect the artillery during this battle. He went on to criticize him for the fact that the Guard cavalry was always absent when needed, that it was not present to defend its Emperor on several occasions, including at Champaubert. Napoleon then axed Guyot on the spot and turned to his commander, General Etienne de Nansouty, telling him to notify General R√©mi Joseph Isidore Exelmans that he had been appointed at the head of the Guard heavy cavalry, in replacement of Guyot.Thoumas, p. 49-51. After Napoleon's abdication, Guyot was named commander of the 'Royal Corps of Cuirassiers', formerly Grenadiers √† Cheval de la Garde Imp√©riale. Nevertheless, during the Hundred Days, Guyot rallied to Napoleon's cause and he was again given the command of the Guard heavy cavalry division, at the head of which he charged at Waterloo, where he was wounded twice. After the fall of the Empire, he was placed on the retired list at his own request, returning to active service briefly between 1830 and 1833 to command the 10th military division. Recognition The name Guyot is inscribed under the Arc de Triomphe in Paris.

United States, 562 U.S. 44 (2011), is a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court upheld a Treasury Department regulation on the grounds that the courts should defer to government agencies in tax cases in absence of an unreasonable decision on the part of the agency. Under the Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA), students and their educational employers are exempted from paying Social Security taxes. The Treasury Department issued a regulation in 2004, declaring those who worked more than 40 hours a week were ineligible for such an exemption. The Mayo Foundation filed suit to challenge the regulation and for a refund of the taxes it had paid on its medical residents‚Äîrecently graduated physicians who work more than full-time providing patient care, but who are still considered trainees by the medical profession. The District Court ruled for the Mayo Foundation and struck the regulation, but was reversed by the Court of Appeals. The Supreme Court ruled unanimously to uphold the regulation as within the Treasury Department's statutory authority to issue and as a reasonable construction of FICA. The Court clarified that the deferential standard of Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc. (1984) applied, notwithstanding prior Court rulings that had adopted a more stringent standard to tax regulations. Applying Chevron, the Court first found that Congress had left the matter to the agency because the statute was silent on the definition of \\"student\\" and its applicability to medical residents specifically. Second, the Court found that the regulation was a reasonable interpretation of the statute, and that its clear line helped distinguish workers who study and students who work, simplified enforcement, and furthered the broad coverage of Social Security. Background In the first decade of the 21st century, the vast majority of medical residents in the United States were physicians who had recently graduated from a medical school in the United States. While graduating from a medical school provides an individual with a medical degree, a state medical license is required to practice medicine. All states require that an individual pass Step 3 of the USMLE or COMLEX exams and complete at least one year of residency training to obtain an unrestricted medical license; in practice, most practicing physicians complete their multiyear residency. While training, residents practice medicine with considerable autonomy under the supervision of attending physicians. Medical residencies traditionally require lengthy hours of their trainees. Residents in the past had literally resided in hospitals for the duration of their training. By 2010, when the case was argued before the Supreme Court, regulations from the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education and the American Osteopathic Association had limited work hours to about 80 hours per week, and a first-year resident at the Mayo Clinic made $47,259 plus benefits. In 1935, the United States Congress passed the Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA), which imposed a payroll tax on workers. The revenues of the tax were meant to be used to finance Social Security. An amendment to the Act, passed four years later, provided that a \\"service performed in the employ of... a school, college, or university... if such service is performed by a student enrolled in and regularly attending classes at such school, college, or university\\" would be exempt. First-year residents, or interns, were also specifically exempted. In 1965, Congress repealed the intern exemption but left the student exemption in place. Until the 1990s, the Act and its application to medical residents were not an issue. Many hospitals assessed and paid FICA taxes on behalf of their employees. The University of Minnesota's hospitals did not, however, and in the early 1990s, the Social Security Administration sued to recover a small portion of those taxes. An initial administrative review ruled for the Social Security Administration, but the district court reversed. The Eighth Circuit affirmed the district court's decision after granting a de novo review,Minnesota v. Apfel, 151 F.3d 742 (8th Cir. 1998) and the University recovered $40 million. A number of other residency programs quickly filed lawsuits, attempting to recoup the taxes they had paid. After some of those programs were successful in other circuit courts, the Treasury agreed to repay the taxes it had collected. However, it also promulgated a new regulation to take effect in April 2005 that stated that any full-time employee, which includes nearly all medical residents, were ineligible to receive the student exemption,The relevant section of the Treasury's regulation states: \\"The services of a full-time employee are not incident to and for the purpose of pursuing a course of study. The determination of whether an employee is a full-time employee is based on the employer‚Äôs standards and practices, except regardless of the employer‚Äôs classification of the employee, an employee whose normal work schedule is 40 hours or more per week is considered a full-time employee. An employee‚Äôs normal work schedule is not affected by increases in hours worked caused by work demands unforeseen at the start of an academic term. However, whether an employee is a full-time employee is reevaluated for the remainder of the academic term if the employee changes employment positions with the employer. An employee‚Äôs work schedule during academic breaks is not considered in determining whether the employee‚Äôs normal work schedule is 40 hours or more per week. The determination of an employee‚Äôs normal work schedule is not affected by the fact that the services performed by the employee may have an educational, instructional, or training aspect.\\" 26 C.F.R ¬ß31.3121(b)(10)‚Äì 2(d)(3)(iii) clearly stating that it was doing so to \\"overturn court rulings that had upheld the view that residents remained students\\". Lower court proceedings and arguments before the Supreme Court The Mayo Clinic and the University of Minnesota sued in federal court to overturn those regulations. The district courts agreed with them, but upon appeal, the Eighth Circuit consolidated the two cases into one and reversed the judgments, remanding the cases for entry of judgments in favor of the United States. This decision was at odds with decisions from the Second, Sixth, Seventh, and Eleventh Circuits, which had all previously ruled that residents may count as students for the purpose of FICA taxes. The Eighth Circuit's ruling created a circuit split, and on appeal, the Supreme Court agreed to hear the case. Mayo and Minnesota, supported by amicus briefs from a number of residency programs and medical organizations, argued that a residency is primarily educational in nature. They asserted that a residency is generally chosen based on academic criteria and that a residency must be completed in order for a physician to be licensed to practice medicine. They also argued that residency training involves not only supervised work, but also an educational curriculum, conferences, and lectures, much like clinical years of medical school. Mayo's attorney, former Bush Administration Solicitor General Theodore Olson, also argued that the rule was \\"arbitrary\\", as the tax would apply to a resident working 40 hours per week but not to a resident working only 39 hours per week. The medical schools proposed that the IRS should base their determination on the primary purpose of a program‚Äîproviding an education versus providing a livelihood. In response, Assistant to the Solicitor General Matthew D. Roberts argued on behalf of the United States that patient care and not educational curricula occupies the vast majority of residents' time. He also argued that although the 1939 FICA Amendment had originally specifically exempted interns, residents who had not yet obtained their unrestricted medical license, that exemption was removed in 1965 to allow doctors to begin paying into Social Security earlier so that they could be eligible for certain benefits. During oral arguments, Chief Justice John Roberts noted that the case was a \\"very familiar situation of an apprentice who is both an employee and a student,\\" and that the only way that one could draw a line between the two \\"is to have somebody say: This is going to be the line.\\" He was of the opinion that if anyone should draw the line, the Internal Revenue Service should be the one. Associate Justice Sonia Sotomayor, on the other hand, felt that residents were employees, as evidenced by her statement \\"You don't think receiving $50,000 or $60,000 a year is enough to make you an employee of someone?\\" According to The Wall Street Journal, Associate Justice Samuel Alito appeared to be more favorable to the medical schools, asking the Justice Department's lawyer at one point \\"in general, why do medical students become residents? Are they enrolled in the program to make money...or do they want additional education?\\" Opinion of the Court In a decision written by Chief Justice Roberts, the Supreme Court unanimously upheld the Eighth Circuit's decision. Associate Justice Elena Kagan recused herself from participating in the case, as she had signed the government's brief during her tenure as Solicitor General of the United States. Declining to review using a standard set out in National Muffler Dealers Assn., Inc. v. United States (1979), the Court instead used a standard set out in Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc. (1984). Chevron, a landmark case regarding deference to government agencies, instituted a two-part test: The job of the reviewing court is to first establish whether Congress has unambiguously spoken about the matter. If so, the court is to follow Congress' intent. If not, it is the job of the court to determine whether the agency's statutory interpretation was a reasonable one. National Muffler, on the other hand, requires that reviewing courts take into account \\"whether the regulation harmonizes with the plain language of the statute, its origin, and its purpose\\" and states that courts may examine a statutory interpretation made years after the passage of the original act on the merits. The Mayo Foundation had requested that the Court rule according to the National Muffler standard, while the United States argued that the Court should use the Chevron standard, arguing that National Muffler had been superseded. The Court had in fact cited both cases in opinions since 1984, but agreed with the Government's position, stating that it would not be wise to \\"carve out an approach to administrative review good for tax law only\\". Despite the Mayo Foundation's arguments otherwise, the Court ruled that \\"student\\" was a sufficiently ambiguous term to state that Congress has specifically addressed the issue. The Court also noted that Congress in the past had specifically singled out medical residents when making exemptions available, which in the Court's eyes made the Mayo Foundation's arguments about unambiguity unreasonable. Therefore, according to Chevron, the role of the courts should solely be to determine whether the Treasury Department made a reasonable decision‚Äîand the Court concluded that the Treasury did just that. In writing for the Court, Roberts stated that \\"The [Treasury] department certainly did not act irrationally in concluding that these doctors ‚Äì 'who work long hours, serve as high skilled professionals, and typically share some or all of the terms of employment of career employees' ‚Äì are the kind of workers that Congress intended to both contribute and benefit from the Social Security system\\". Impact The Mayo Clinic noted that it had been paying the taxes while the case was pending in the courts, so the 15-page opinion would not force them to pay back taxes. In March 2010, while the case was pending before the Supreme Court, the Treasury announced that it would not contest refund claims for taxes paid prior to the April 2005 regulation. It would however assess taxes on salaries paid after that date, which would cost residency programs a total of approximately $700 million annually, or $3,100 a year for a resident earning $50,000 a year (and equivalent amount for the resident's employer). An article in the New England Journal of Medicine noted that \\"[r]esidents could find additional support in the Court's unambiguous holding for efforts to enforce other workplace rights, such as unemployment benefits (e.g., after hospital closure) or protection under the Family Medical Leave Act.\\" The Supreme Court's decision to use Chevron as its test for reviewing the Treasury Department's decision for marked a departure from previous practice; the Court had the courts have previously given less deference to the Internal Revenue Service's statutory interpretations., citing According to an article in The Federal Circuit Bar Journal, the Court's application of the National Muffler standard to \\"tax regulations promulgated under \\" in the years following Chevron \\"created confusion among the lower courts\\". The Mayo Foundation decision settled the matter. , partially citing According to an article in the Florida Tax Review, the Court in doing so \\"unambiguously overruled\\" its previous decision in the National Muffler in favor of Chevron, finding that an agency should have leeway in interpreting the statute in question, no matter when or how long ago the statute was placed in effect, how consistent the agency was in interpreting the statute, the importance of the statute or how closely Congress has looked into the agency's decision.National Muffler indicated that the proper standard for judicial review should be the following: \\"In determining whether a particular regulation carries out the congressional mandate in a proper manner, we look to see whether the regulation harmonizes with the plain language of the statute, its origin, and its purpose. A regulation may have particular force if it is a substantially contemporaneous construction of the statute by those presumed to have been aware of congressional intent. If the regulation dates from a later period, the manner in which it evolved merits inquiry. Other relevant considerations are the length of time the regulation has been in effect, the reliance placed on it, the consistency of the Commissioner's interpretation, and the degree of scrutiny Congress has devoted to the regulation during subsequent re-enactments of the statute.\\" However, an article in the George Washington Law Review which advocates for the use of the National Muffler standard in reviewing retroactive tax regulations () states that National Muffler may not have been entirely overruled, arguing that the Court implied that Chevron test is only to be used in \\"complex questions of statutory interpretation\\" and that the Court left open the possibility that a future scenario may warrant the use of the National Muffler test instead of the Chevron test. The Court also overruled Rowan Cos. v. United States (1981), and United States v. Vogel Fertilizer Co.

The Tupac Katari Revolutionary Movement was founded in May 1978 and was constituted as a left-wing national democratic organization for all classes, based mainly on the peasantry and other exploited strata, with the object of establishing a just society, majority rule and self-determination of the people.Political parties of the world. Longman, 1980. Led by Juan Condori Uruchi, Clemente Ramos Flores, Daniel Calle M. The party claims origins in independence movements started under Spanish rule in 1781 (by T√∫pac Katari in Bolivia and T√∫pac Amaru II in Peru) and continued as peasant movements in 1946‚Äì1952, leading to land reform, universal suffrage and the nationalization of mines between 1952 and 1964, and to the creation of a Tupac Katari Confederation in 1971. In 1978 the Tupac Katari Revolutionary Movement took part in an electoral coalition Democratic and Popular Union backing Hern√°n Siles Zuazo.Elections in the Americas : a data handbook / ed. by Dieter Nohlen, Vol. 2. [Oxford] [u.a.]: Oxford University Press, 2005. After the 1978 elections, the MRTK broke with the Democratic and Popular Union and personal rivalries divided it into three factions.Van Cott, Donna Lee. From Movements to Parties in Latin America: The Evolution of Ethnic Politics. Cambridge University Press, 2007. For the 1979 general elections, the fraction that retained the name MRTK, led by Macabeo Chila Prieto, was the component of the Revolutionary Nationalist Movement-Alliance, with the MNR's V√≠ctor Paz Estenssoro as the coalition's presidential candidate. The second fraction was led by Clemente Ramos Flores and joined the Democratic and Popular Union backing Hern√°n Siles Zuazo.The dictionary of contemporary politics of South America. Author: By Phil Gunson, Andrew Thompson, Greg Chamberlain. Routledge, 1989. P. 92. The third and largest was led by Jenaro Flores Santos, who declined to compete and \\"instructed the party's adherents to vote for the left\\". In 1980 the MRTK allied with the Revolutionary Party of the Nationalist Left and its candidate Juan Lech√≠n Oquendo.Dunkerly, James. Bolivia: coup d'√©tat. Latin America Bureau, 1980. P.15. The Macabeo Chila Prieto's MRTK took part in 1985 elections, running its leader. He polled 1.08 per cent of the vote. After the 1985 elections, the Macabeo Chila Prieto's MRTK disappeared. In 1985 Jenaro Flores Santos registered the Revolutionary Liberation Movement Tupaq Katari (Movimiento Revolucionario Tupaj Katari de Liberacion, MRTKL). It took part in 1985 elections, running Jenaro Flores Santos. He polled 2.11 per cent of the vote. Within a year of its formation, divisions emerged within the MRTKL between Jenaro Flores Santos, on the one hand, and V√≠ctor Hugo C√°rdenas and Walter Reynaga V√°squez, the party's two deputies of the National Congress, on the other. In a 1988 party congress, Jenaro Flores Santos walked out with some of his supporters and formed the Katarist United Liberation Front (FULKA). Both parties lost support after the internal bickering became public. Jenaro Flores Santos's exit still did not achieve unity in the MRTKL: neither V√≠ctor Hugo C√°rdenas nor Walter Reynaga V√°squez would accept the second position in the new party hierarchy. V√≠ctor Hugo C√°rdenas eventually edged out his rival. The MRTKL took part in 1989 elections, running V√≠ctor Hugo C√°rdenas. He polled 1.6 per cent of the vote. Although the indigenous candidates attracted large crowds, they found that many campesinos already were committed to the Revolutionary Nationalist Movement, the Revolutionary Left Movement, or other parties that had a better chance of winning.

Eisenhower's farewell address (sometimes referred to as \\"Eisenhower's farewell address to the nation\\") was the final public speech of Dwight D. Eisenhower as the 34th President of the United States, delivered in a television broadcast on January 17, 1961. Perhaps best known for advocating that the nation guards against the potential influence of the military‚Äìindustrial complex, a term he is credited with coining, the speech also expressed concerns about planning for the future and the dangers of massive spending, especially deficit spending, the prospect of the domination of science through Federal funding and, conversely, the domination of science-based public policy by what he called a \\"scientific- technological elite\\". This speech and Eisenhower's Chance for Peace speech have been called the \\"bookends\\" of his administration.Susan Eisenhower, \\"50 Years Later, We're Still Ignoring Ike's Warning\\", The Washington Post, January 16, 2011, p. B3. Background Eisenhower served as a president for two full terms from January 1953 through January 1961, and was the first U.S. president to be term-limited from seeking re-election again. He had overseen a period of considerable economic expansion, even as the Cold War deepened. Three of his national budgets had been balanced, but spending pressures mounted. The recent presidential election had resulted in the election of John F. Kennedy, and the oldest American president in a century was about to hand the reins of power to the youngest elected president.Nancy Gibbs, \\"When New President Meets Old, It's Not Always Pretty\\". Time, November 10, 2008. The speech Eisenhower's farewell address, January 17, 1961. Length 15:30. As early as 1959, Eisenhower began working with his brother Milton and his speechwriters, including his chief speechwriter Malcolm Moos, to develop his final statement as he left public life. It went through at least 21 drafts.John Milburn, \\"Papers shed light on Eisenhower's farewell address\\". Associated Press, December 10, 2010. The Huffington Post. Retrieved 2010.12.10. The speech was \\"a solemn moment in a decidedly unsolemn time\\", warning a nation \\"giddy with prosperity, infatuated with youth and glamour, and aiming increasingly for the easy life.\\" A draft of the farewell address, showing handwritten edits. Despite his military background and being the only general to be elected president in the 20th century, he warned the nation with regard to the corrupting influence of what he describes as the \\"military-industrial complex\\". He also expressed his concomitant concern for corruption of the scientific process as part of this centralization of funding in the Federal government, and vice versa: Legacy Although it was much broader, Eisenhower's speech is remembered primarily for its reference to the military-industrial complex. The phrase gained acceptance during the Vietnam War era and 21st-century commentators have expressed the opinion that a number of the fears raised in his speech have come true.Hanft, Adam (January 18, 2011). \\"50th Anniversary of Eisenhower's 'Military-Industry Complex' Speech; Still Shocking on Many Levels\\".
