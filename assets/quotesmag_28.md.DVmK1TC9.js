William and his wife were active in several Pittsburgh charities, including an orphanage and school for African-American children, as well as a local hospital. Death William Henry Conley contracted influenza (indicated in one obituary as \\"La Grippe\\") early in 1897, from which he never fully recovered. His health was relatively stable until June, at which time he suffered a relapse, after which he seldom left his home. He became bedridden in the last week of his life; on the evening of July 25, 1897, his health rapidly declined, and he died at about 8:30pm. A funeral service was conducted at his home in Pittsburgh. William Conley was survived by his wife Sarah. After a period of prolonged illness, Sarah Conley died October 1, 1908.Notes From the Home Field: Mr and Mrs. W. H.

A reliable single-cylinder, the MAC coped well with the low-grade post war petrol and was a popular commuter and touring motorcycle. Although they started as innovators, Velocette failed to keep pace with developing technology and production ended in 1959. Before World War II 1936 Velocette MAC Sport The first version of the Velocette MAC was launched in 1933 and was developed from the overhead valve Velocette MOV 250cc, which suffered from reliability problems. The single-cylinder engine was enlarged to 349 cc and could comfortably reach . The early MAC weighed and had girder front forks. Wartime models =MAC (WD)= Velocette MAC engine In October 1939 a Velocette MAC was purchased by the British War Office Army Mechanisation Experimental Establishment (MEE) at Cove in Hampshire for testing its suitability for military use. As well as British observers there were also representatives of the French Army present. The tests were successful but a number of modifications were suggested and in 1940 the Velocette MAC was modified into a military specification. Velocette's first order for the military version was from the French Government but the contract for 1,200 motorcycles was cancelled and only a few were delivered before the French were overrun by the advancing German Army. The British War Department asked for some further modifications and took over the French order in June 1940. The Velocette was designated the MAC (WD), the WD coming from \\"War Department\\", although it was often referred to as the MDD as this was the prefix for the serial numbers. The MAC (WD) had an upgraded clutch and the pressed-steel front brake drum was replaced by cast iron fittings which became standard for the later MAC models, due to the shortage of aluminium which was needed for aircraft manufacture. Other modifications included a protective shield bolted to the frame over the crankcase. A strong carrying rack replaced the rear pillion seat and the headlamp was masked to comply with blackout regulations. The MDD could cope well with battlefield conditions, but Velocette's limited production facilities meant it was a difficult to keep up production and by September 1942 the MDD order was cancelled and the factory turned over to other War work. As there were a fairly small number in service both the Velocette MAC (WD) and the improved MAF were largely used by British-based forces, including the Fire Service and Civil Defence organisations, as well as the Royal Air Force. The 'missing' WDs A myth persists that a large consignment of Velocette MAC (WD) intended for use in France was lost in the English Channel while being delivered. An order for 200 MAC (WD)'s was placed in July 1940 for delivery to the Central Ordnance Department at Chilwell but the order was never fulfilled, probably due to lack of capacity at the Velocette factory. When MAC (WD)'s were returned to civilian use after the war they often had the MDD engine and serial numbers ground off and replaced with later numbers, reinforcing the idea that they had been mysteriously lost without trace. =MAF= The Velocette MAF had the foot gear change mechanism reversed to make it the same as the other military motorcycles in use at the time. An order for 2,000 was placed in June 1941 but problems with Velocette's supplies and the limited production facilities meant that it was a difficult order to fulfil. By September 1942 they had only delivered 947 motorcycles and the order was cancelled. Post war MAC production restarted after the war. In 1948 the MAC's girder forks were replaced with innovative air-sprung Dowty Oleomatic forks. In 1951 these were upgraded to Veloce 'tele forks' which were developed for the Velocette LE. These had coil springs with damping. In the same year the engine was upgraded to an alloy barrel and head with wider fins to improve cooling. For 1953 the MAC was updated with fully adjustable rear suspension, swinging arm and a tube frame. The clutch and gearbox were also greatly improved. From 1954 the MAC was sold as a sidecar machine to try to broaden the appeal but production was halted by 1960. The company had invested ¬£50,000 developing the Velocette Viceroy scooter and, despite continued sales of the singles, Velocette became insolvent.

Passed on September 17, 2008, and signed into law by President George W. Bush on September 25, 2008, the ADAAA was a response to a number of decisions by the Supreme Court that had interpreted the original text of the ADA. Because members of the U.S. Congress viewed those decisions as limiting the rights of persons with disabilities, the ADAAA effectively reversed those decisions by changing the law. It also rejected portions of the regulations published by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) that interpret Title I (the employment-related title) of the ADA. The ADAAA makes changes to the definition of the term \\"disability,\\" clarifying and broadening that definition‚Äîand therefore the number and types of persons who are protected under the ADA and other Federal disability nondiscrimination laws. It was designed to strike a balance between employer and employee interests. The ADAAA requires that courts interpreting the ADA and other Federal disability nondiscrimination laws focus on whether the covered entity has discriminated, rather than whether the individual seeking the law's protection has an impairment that fits within the technical definition of the term \\"disability.\\" The Act retains the ADA's basic definition of \\"disability\\" as an impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities; a record of such an impairment; or being regarded as having such an impairment. However, it changes the way that the statutory terms should be interpreted.ADAAA Summary and Resources from Southeast DBTAC, January 23, 2009  Reasons for enactment  Congress used the functional definition of disability from Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.29 U.S.C. ¬ß794. Sections 501 and 503 of the Rehabilitation Act also use the same definition of disability and prohibit disability discrimination by Federal employees and Federal contractors, respectively. 29 U.S.C. ¬ß¬ß 791, 793. Due to 17 years of development through case law, Congress believed the requirements of the definition were well understood. Within the framework established under the Rehabilitation Act, courts treated the determination of disability as a threshold issue, but focused primarily on whether unlawful discrimination had occurred. After the passage of the ADA, the focus of court decisions shifted to deciding if people's claims of discrimination were protected by the law. Congress passed the ADA Amendments Act of 2008 to overturn two controversial court decisions based on interpretations of the ADA.Puerto Rico Business Law Notes Article Summarizing Changes to the ADA The first decision‚Äîby the Supreme Court in Sutton v. United Air Lines, Inc.‚Äîstated that impairments must be considered in their mitigated state.Text of Sutton v. United Air Lines, 527 U.S. 471 (1999) from Cornell University The second decision in Toyota Motor Manufacturing, Kentucky, Inc. v. Williams narrowed the definition of \\"disability\\" to just those impairments that impact tasks of daily living. Text of Toyota Motor Mfg., KY, Inc. v. Williams, 2534 U.S. 184 (2002)In following these decisions, lower courts would frequently focus on whether the plaintiff was, in fact, disabled and never reach the issue of whether discrimination had occurred. Through these rulings, the Supreme Court and lower courts created a situation in which an individual with a physical or mental impairment severe enough to constitute a \\"substantially limiting a major life activity\\" under case law based on the Rehabilitation Act did not qualify for protection under the ADA. These included individuals with impairments such as amputation, intellectual disabilities, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, HIV/AIDS, diabetes, muscular dystrophy, and cancer.  Push for changes  In 2004, the National Council on Disability, an independent Federal agency charged with making recommendations to the President and Congress, issued a report called ‚ÄúRighting the ADA.‚Äù\\"Righting the ADA.\\" This report detailed various ways that the courts had misinterpreted Congressional intent and limited the reach of the ADA, and proposed legislative language to restore that intent. The most important misinterpretation the report identified was the narrowing of the ADA‚Äôs definition of ‚Äúdisability‚Äù to exclude many individuals that Congress intended to protect from discrimination. Over the course of 2006, the Consortium for Citizens with Disabilities (CCD)Consortium for Citizens with Disabilities website worked to develop consensus within the disability rights community regarding the strategy and substance of a bill that would fix the definition problem. On September 29, 2006, the last working day of the 109th Congress, Representative Jim Sensenbrenner (R-WI), then Chair of the United States House Committee on the Judiciary, and then-Minority Leader Steny Hoyer (D-MD) introduced H.R. 6258 (‚ÄúADA Restoration Act of 2006‚Äù)Text of H.R. 6258 [109th]: Americans with Disabilities Act Restoration Act of 2006 to ‚Äúrestore the intent of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 to more fully remove the barriers that confront disabled Americans.‚Äù The bill represented an important first step towards reform but was rejected by the committee. On July 26, 2007, the 17th anniversary of the ADA‚Äôs passage, Majority Leader Hoyer, Representative Sensenbrenner, and Senators Tom Harkin (D-IA) and Arlen Specter (R-PA) introduced companion \\"ADA restoration\\" bills (H.R. 3195; S. 1881Americans with Disabilities Act Restoration Act of 2007 (2007; 110th Congress S. 1881). GovTrack.us. Retrieved on 2013-08-15.) that closely tracked a draft bill produced by the CCD and Congressional staff. On the day of the introduction of H.R. 3195, the bill had 143 co-sponsors in the House. Despite the number of House co-sponsors of the legislation, the business community and the Justice Department urged Members of Congress to oppose the ADA Restoration Act. Concerned that a partisan battle would damage the traditionally bi- partisan base of support for disability rights legislation, Congressional champions of the bill, including Majority Leader Hoyer, encouraged the disability community to meet with the business community and negotiate bill language that both communities would agree to defend through the entire legislative process.  Negotiations leading to the ADAAA  The coalition of advocates from the business and disability communities that spearheaded the efforts to pass the ADAAA first came together on February 19, 2008. That initial group consisted of representatives from the American Association of People with Disabilities (AAPD),American Association of People with Disabilities website the National Council on Independent Living (NCIL),National Council on Independent Living website the Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law, the National Disabilities Rights Network (NDRN),National Disabilities Rights Network website the Epilepsy Foundation (EF), the United States Chamber of Commerce, the Society for Human Resource Management (SHRM), the National Association of Manufacturers (NAM), and the HR Policy Association (HR Policy).HR Policy Association website Each group entered the negotiations by signing a document indicating its understanding that any agreement reached would be defended and maintained by all of the groups. Modifications and amendments to the draft bill were permitted only by mutual agreement. The negotiating group met almost weekly from February through May 2008. Both the disability and business negotiators consistently checked back with a much broader group of disability and business advocates throughout the process. The key negotiators for the disability group were Andy Imparato (AAPD); Sandy Finucane (EF); Chai Feldblum (Georgetown Law, on behalf of EF); Jennifer Mathis (Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law); John Lancaster (NICL); and Curt Decker (NDRN). Former Representative Tony Coelho and Nancy Zirkin from the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights also provided political counsel throughout the process. The business negotiators were led by Mike Eastman and Randal Johnson (Chamber), assisted by Larry Lorber (Proskauer Rose); Mike Aitken and Mike Layman (SHRM); Mike Peterson (HR Policy); and Jeri Gillepsie (NAM). Tim Bartl (HR Policy) and Camille Olson (Seyfarth Shaw) also provided political and legal counsel to the business negotiators. Cheryl Sensenbrenner, Board Chair of AAPD, was involved throughout the process. The negotiating group reached a final agreement on May 13, 2008. That agreement formed the basis for a Congressional agreement and substitute to the earlier version of H.R. 3195.Text of H.R. 3195 The substitute was renamed the ADA Amendments Act of 2008 (ADAAA). H.R. 3195 subsequently passed by wide margins in the House Education and Labor Committee and the House Judiciary Committee, and passed the House of Representatives on June 25, 2008, by a vote of 402 Ayes, 17 Nays, 15 Present/Not Voting.See \\"Votes\\" section. The coalition was tested in July 2008 when Senators Tom Harkin and Orrin Hatch proposed a new definition of ‚Äúsubstantially limits.‚Äù Representatives from the disability and business communities came back together to find a compromise that would address the Senators' concern. They reached a new resolution that dropped the definition of ‚Äúsubstantially limits‚Äù entirely‚Äîreplacing it with additional findings and purposes. This agreement became the basis of S. 3406,Text of S. 3406 which passed the Senate by unanimous consent on September 11, 2008.See \\"Votes\\" section. The House of Representatives followed suit one week later, and the President signed the ADAAA into the law on September 25, 2008. For a full list of the many individuals and groups who worked on the ADAAA, from the disability, civil rights, and business communities, see the Statement by Majority Leader Hoyer on September 17, 2008.154 Cong. Rec., H8295 (daily ed. Sept. 17, 2008).  Significant changes  The ADAAA explicitlyFinal Text as Signed into Law by President Bush on September 25, 2008 overturns the controversial Supreme Court decisions in Sutton and Toyota, rejecting the high standards imposed on claimants by the Court in those cases, and reiterates that Congress intends that the scope of the ADA be broad and inclusive.Bill Text - see Section 2(b) \\"Purposes\\" The ADAAA retains the ADA‚Äôs definition of disability as a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more life activities; a record of such impairment; or being regarded as having such impairment. However, it clarifies and expands the definition‚Äôs meaning and application in the following ways:http://www.eeoc.gov/laws/statutes/adaaa_notice.cfm Equal Employment Opportunity Commission Notice Concerning The Americans With Disabilities Act (ADA) Amendments Act of 2008 First, the ADAAA deletes two findings in the ADA that led the Supreme Court to restrict the meaning and application of the definition of disability. These findings were that ‚Äúsome 43,000,000 Americans have one or more physical or mental disabilities‚Äù and that ‚Äúindividuals with disabilities are a discrete and insular minority.‚Äù The Court had treated these findings as limiting how other provisions of the ADA should be construed. Second, the law provides that the definition of disability ‚Äúshall be construed in favor of broad coverage of individuals under this Act, to the maximum extent permitted by the terms of this Act.‚Äù It retains the terms ‚Äúsubstantially limits‚Äù and \\"major life activities\\" from the original ADA definition of \\"disability,\\" but makes clear that Congress intended the terms to impose less- demanding standards than those enunciated by the Supreme Court in the Toyota case. It also states that the EEOC's regulatory definition of \\"substantially limits\\" was overly strict. Third, the law prohibits consideration of mitigating measures such as medication, assistive technology, accommodations, or modifications when determining whether an impairment substantially limits a major life activity. The related text of the ADAAA explicitly rejects the Supreme Court‚Äôs holdings in Sutton and its companion cases that mitigating measures must be considered in determining whether an impairment constitutes a disability under the law. The ADAAA also provides that impairments that are episodic or in remission must be assessed according to their active state. Fourth, the law provides additional direction on the ‚Äúmajor life activities‚Äù that must be substantially limited for an impairment to be a disability: the Act lists specific examples of major life activities, rather than leaving that phrase open to interpretation, as the ADA of 1990 did. The non-exhaustive list of major life activities in ¬ß 4(4)(a) of the amended ADA includes caring for oneself, performing manual tasks, seeing, hearing, eating, sleeping, walking, standing, lifting, bending, speaking, breathing, learning, reading, concentrating, thinking, communicating and working. The ADAAA also lists major bodily functions, including, but not limited to, functions of the immune system; normal cell growth; and digestive, bowel, bladder, neurological, brain, respiratory, circulatory, endocrine, and reproductive functions. Fifth, the law removes from the ‚Äúregarded as‚Äù prong of the disability definition (the third prong of the definition) the requirement that an individual demonstrate that the impairment that he or she has, or is perceived to have, limits a major life activity in a way that is perceived to be substantial. Under the ADAAA, therefore, an individual can establish coverage under the law by showing that he or she has been subjected to an action prohibited under the Act because of an actual or perceived physical or mental impairment that is not transitory and minor. The law also explicitly states that although individuals who fall solely under the ‚Äúregarded as‚Äù prong of the definition of disability are protected from discrimination, entities covered by the ADA are not required to provide accommodations, or to modify policies and procedures, for such persons. Sixth, the law clarifies that the authority granted to three specific Federal agencies to issue regulations interpreting the ADA includes the authority to issue regulations implementing the definitions contained in Sections 3 and 4 of that Act. Finally, the ADAAA makes conforming amendments Section 7 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, and to Title I of the ADA itself. To conform the employment-related provisions of the ADA with parallel provisions of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the latter amendments change the language of Title I to provide that no covered entity shall discriminate against a qualified individual ‚Äúon the basis of disability.‚Äù To summarize the ADAAA timeline: the Act was introduced on July 31, 2008; passed the Senate on September 11, 2008; passed the House on September 17, 2008; was signed by the President on September 25, 2008; and took effect on January 1, 2009. The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit held on July 21, 2009, that the ADAAA does not apply retroactively.Text of Lytes v.

The main goal of the NAL is the provision of a \\"network- friendly\\" video representation addressing \\"conversational\\" (video telephony) and \\"non conversational\\" (storage, broadcast, or streaming) applications. NAL has achieved a significant improvement in application flexibility relative to prior video coding standards.  Introduction  An increasing number of services and growing popularity of high definition TV are creating greater needs for higher coding efficiency. Moreover, other transmission media such as Cable Modem, xDSL, or UMTS offer much lower data rates than broadcast channels, and enhanced coding efficiency can enable the transmission of more video channels or higher quality video representations within existing digital transmission capacities. Video coding for telecommunication applications has diversified from ISDN and T1/E1 service to embrace PSTN, mobile wireless networks, and LAN/Internet network delivery. Throughout this evolution, continued efforts have been made to maximize coding efficiency while dealing with the diversification of network types and their characteristic formatting and loss/error robustness requirements. The H.264/AVC and HEVC standards are designed for technical solutions including areas like broadcasting (over cable, satellite, cable modem, DSL, terrestrial, etc.) interactive or serial storage on optical and magnetic devices, conversational services, video-on- demand or multimedia streaming, multimedia messaging services, etc. Moreover, new applications may be deployed over existing and future networks. This raises the question about how to handle this variety of applications and networks. To address this need for flexibility and customizability, the design covers a NAL that formats the Video Coding Layer (VCL) representation of the video and provides header information in a manner appropriate for conveyance by a variety of transport layers or storage media. The NAL is designed in order to provide \\"network friendliness\\" to enable simple and effective customization of the use of VCL for a broad variety of systems. The NAL facilitates the ability to map VCL data to transport layers such as: *RTP/IP for any kind of real-time wire-line and wireless Internet services. *File formats, e.g., ISO MP4 for storage and MMS. *H.32X for wireline and wireless conversational services. *MPEG-2 systems for broadcasting services, etc. The full degree of customization of the video content to fit the needs of each particular application is outside the scope of the video coding standardization effort, but the design of the NAL anticipates a variety of such mappings. Some key concepts of the NAL are NAL units, byte stream, and packet formats uses of NAL units, parameter sets, and access units. A short description of these concepts is given below.  NAL units  The coded video data is organized into NAL units, each of which is effectively a packet that contains an integer number of bytes. The first byte of each H.264/AVC NAL unit is a header byte that contains an indication of the type of data in the NAL unit. For HEVC the header was extended to two bytes. All the remaining bytes contain payload data of the type indicated by the header. The NAL unit structure definition specifies a generic format for use in both packet- oriented and bitstream-oriented transport systems, and a series of NAL units generated by an encoder is referred to as a NAL unit stream.  NAL Units in Byte-Stream Format Use  Some systems require delivery of the entire or partial NAL unit stream as an ordered stream of bytes or bits within which the locations of NAL unit boundaries need to be identifiable from patterns within the coded data itself. For use in such systems, the H.264/AVC and HEVC specifications define a byte stream format. In the byte stream format, each NAL unit is prefixed by a specific pattern of three bytes called a start code prefix. The boundaries of the NAL unit can then be identified by searching the coded data for the unique start code prefix pattern. The use of emulation prevention bytes guarantees that start code prefixes are unique identifiers of the start of a new NAL unit. A small amount of additional data (one byte per video picture) is also added to allow decoders that operate in systems that provide streams of bits without alignment to byte boundaries to recover the necessary alignment from the data in the stream. Additional data can also be inserted in the byte stream format that allows expansion of the amount of data to be sent and can aid in achieving more rapid byte alignment recovery, if desired.  NAL Units in Packet-Transport System Use  In other systems (e.g., IP/RTP systems), the coded data is carried in packets that are framed by the system transport protocol, and identification of the boundaries of NAL units within the packets can be established without use of start code prefix patterns. In such systems, the inclusion of start code prefixes in the data would be a waste of data carrying capacity, so instead the NAL units can be carried in data packets without start code prefixes.  VCL and Non-VCL NAL Units  NAL units are classified into VCL and non-VCL NAL units. The VCL NAL units contain the data that represents the values of the samples in the video pictures, and the non-VCL NAL units contain any associated additional information such as parameter sets (important header data that can apply to a large number of VCL NAL units) and supplemental enhancement information (timing information and other supplemental data that may enhance usability of the decoded video signal but are not necessary for decoding the values of the samples in the video pictures).  Parameter Sets  A parameter set is supposed to contain information that is expected to rarely change and offers the decoding of a large number of VCL NAL units. There are two types of parameter sets: *sequence parameter sets (SPS), which apply to a series of consecutive coded video pictures called a coded video sequence *picture parameter sets (PPS), which apply to the decoding of one or more individual pictures within a coded video sequence The sequence and picture parameter-set mechanism decouples the transmission of infrequently changing information from the transmission of coded representations of the values of the samples in the video pictures. Each VCL NAL unit contains an identifier that refers to the content of the relevant picture parameter set and each picture parameter set contains an identifier that refers to the content of the relevant sequence parameter set. In this manner, a small amount of data (the identifier) can be used to refer to a larger amount of information (the parameter set) without repeating that information within each VCL NAL unit. Sequence and picture parameter sets can be sent well ahead of the VCL NAL units that they apply to, and can be repeated to provide robustness against data loss. In some applications, parameter sets may be sent within the channel that carries the VCL NAL units (termed \\"in-band\\" transmission). In other applications, it can be advantageous to convey the parameter sets \\"out-of-band\\" using a more reliable transport mechanism than the video channel itself. Parameter Set use with reliable \\"out-of-band\\" parameter set exchange  Access Units  A set of NAL units in a specified form is referred to as an access unit. The decoding of each access unit results in one decoded picture. Each access unit contains a set of VCL NAL units that together compose a primary coded picture. It may also be prefixed with an access unit delimiter to aid in locating the start of the access unit. Some supplemental enhancement information containing data such as picture timing information may also precede the primary coded picture. The primary coded picture consists of a set of VCL NAL units consisting of slices or slice data partitions that represent the samples of the video picture. Following the primary coded picture may be some additional VCL NAL units that contain redundant representations of areas of the same video picture. These are referred to as redundant coded pictures, and are available for use by a decoder in recovering from loss or corruption of the data in the primary coded pictures. Decoders are not required to decode redundant coded pictures if they are present. Finally, if the coded picture is the last picture of a coded video sequence (a sequence of pictures that is independently decodable and uses only one sequence parameter set), an end of sequence NAL unit may be present to indicate the end of the sequence; and if the coded picture is the last coded picture in the entire NAL unit stream, an end of stream NAL unit may be present to indicate that the stream is ending. Structure of a NAL Access Unit  Coded Video Sequences  A coded video sequence consists of a series of access units that are sequential in the NAL unit stream and use only one sequence parameter set. Each coded video sequence can be decoded independently of any other coded video sequence, given the necessary parameter set information, which may be conveyed \\"in-band\\" or \\"out- of-band\\". At the beginning of a coded video sequence is an instantaneous decoding refresh (IDR) access unit. An IDR access unit contains an intra picture which is a coded picture that can be decoded without decoding any previous pictures in the NAL unit stream, and the presence of an IDR access unit indicates that no subsequent picture in the stream will require reference to pictures prior to the intra picture it contains in order to be decoded. A NAL unit stream may contain one or more coded video sequence.

The station opened for passengers in 1878 and closed on 23 May 1955 but remained open to goods with full staff until 28 June 1965 before it was closed, then demolished and the branch line tracks ripped up. Due to the relatively steep inclines, tunnels and a viaduct, the Queensbury Lines were also known as \\"the Alpine Route\\". More information about the geographical setting and history of the Queensbury to Bradford line is available at the Lost Railways West Yorkshire website. The passenger station served the neighbourhoods of Great Horton and Lidget Green until service to and from Bradford town centre by more convenient and accessible electric trolley buses along the parallel roads of Legrams Lane and Great Horton Road lured passenger traffic away from the station. Besides passenger and parcels service from the station platforms, adjacent sidings and trackwork also served a general purpose goods shed, a coal tipple (or coal drops), a casting foundry, a number of nearby weaving mills for textile manufacturing, and others. Three significant textile mills were located a short walk from the station, including Westcroft Mill, Beckside Worsted Mills, and Cannon Mills, currently re-purposed as a shopping village. Freight operations during the 1950s included general goods and cargo as well as coal used as fuel by nearby households and industries. During the colder heating season a daily train delivered about a dozen wagons loaded with coal to the coal drops. The approach from Bradford was a rather steep incline and the steam engine would often struggle to find traction on the slippery rails, damp from the then- frequent morning fog. The engine would pull up beyond the Beckside Road bridge, then coast the wagons back down the slight incline to the coal drops on the south side of the station complex. Various specialized types of sand of varying colours, textures and consistency were delivered to the casting foundry on the north side of the station complex, which had bunkers or drops to receive and store the sand needed for mould-making for casting large iron and steel parts. Other freight operations entailed the receiving of general freight and cargo. A large number of empty barrels used for oils and chemicals, probably at the worsted weaving mills, ended up being stored in small mountains alongside the tracks on the northern side. Wagons being delivered or picked up from these sidings were shunted on an as-needed basis. Operations were complex enough to warrant a dedicated signal box, which was located on the west-bound or Clayton platform side, across from the main station building. A metal overpass allowed passengers to cross over to or from the main station house to the opposite platform. In earlier days, access was also possible directly via metal stairs from the Beckside Road bridge to the station overpass below. During the late 1950s, the line was used to train operators of DMUs (Diesel Multiple Unit) which made practice runs on the line to and from Bradford. No sign remains of the former station, platforms, signal box, or tracks. The site has been re-purposed for modern-day industrial use. Interest in this and other stations along the Queensbury Lines is maintained due to the support for continuing steam locomotive operations of the nearby Keighley and Worth Valley Railway historic preservation association. The Queensbury Lines also have a lot of interest for railway fans and historians due to the variety of grades, cuttings, tunnels, and a long viaduct, all within a relatively short distance of each other.

He was the Deputy Commissioner Police (Traffic) in 1993. He was appointed the Commissioner of Mumbai Police on 15 February 2014. He retired on 31 January 2017, after putting in 36 years of distinguished servicehttp://www.ndtv.com/india- news/maharashtra-top-cop-rakesh-maria-retires-says-will-pen-memoirs-1654768  Anti terror work  As the Deputy Commissioner Police (Traffic) in 1993, he cracked the Bombay serial blasts case, and later moved to DCP (Crime) and then Joint Commissioner of Police (Crime) of the Mumbai Police. Maria cracked the 2003 Gateway of India and Zaveri Bazaar twin blasts case, arresting six persons, including a couple for planting the explosive devices inside taxis. The investigation was proved successful when the arrestees Ashrat Ansari, Haneef Sayyed and his wife Fahmeeda were convicted and sentenced to death in August 2009 by a special POTA court in Mumbai. Later, the death sentence was upheld by Bombay High Court in February 2012. Debunked the Hindu terror conspiracy  Maria was given the responsibility of investigating the 26/11 Mumbai attacks. He interrogated Ajmal Kasab, the only terrorist captured alive, and successfully investigated the case. Kasab was executed by hanging in 2012.. He Later Also Revealed In his memoir 'Let Me Say It Now', Elaborating on the Hindu Terror conspiracy, Maria writes, 'If all had gone well he [Ajmal Kasab, the only one of the ten terrorists to be caught alive] would have been dead with a red string tied around his wrist like a Hindu. We would have found an identity card on this person with fictitious name Samir Dinesh Choudhari, student of Arunoday Degree and P.G College.' and said that it ruined the plans of Pakistan of proclaiming the Mumbai Terror Attack as a Hindu conspiracy.https://www.indiatoday.in/news-analysis/story/rakesh-maria- ajmal-kasab-26-11-mumbai-attack-hindu-terror-controversy-1648312-2020-02-20  Personal life  He is married to Preeti and the couple have two sons, Kunal and Krish.

She completed her graduation from Lady Sri Ram College and further went on to do Post graduation from Europe. He had met his wife for the first time on the day of his marriage. http://www.uppercrustindia.com/posts/961/COVER-STORY.html  Publications  In 2020, he wrote a book called \\"Let Me Say It Now\\" published by Westland publications.  Controversies  =Addl.CP Ashok Kamte's death= Vinita Kamte, the wife of slain IPS officer Ashok Kamte who was killed by terrorists during the 26/11 Mumbai terror attacks, lashed out at Maria at his appointment as Mumbai Police Commissioner. She had earlier alleged discrepancies in crucial call records of wireless conversations between the Police Control Room and Ashok Kamte's van on the day of his death. Earlier in 2009 she had questioned Maria's claims that he did not direct Ashok Kamte to the Cama Hospital where he died. Rakesh Maria had been in charge of the police control room at the time of the carnage in November 2008.http://www.ibnlive.com/news/india/rakesh-maria-rowshawan- phono-668978.html Maria felt almost defenseless against such an emotional issue. Even Maharashtra Government was initially reluctant to defend Maria, an officer with a formidable reputation, not wanting to hurt the sentiments of a martyr‚Äôs wife. He just said that the facts would absolve him. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt defend him and you don‚Äôt let him defend himself!‚Äù commented a Mumbai Crime Branch senior. Maria even got ready his resignation letter in disgust. Thrice he appeared before and had replied to all these allegations in detail before the Pradhan Committee. He was confident of his facts and told that Vinita Kamte had been selective in quoting. Mumbai Police Officers later told that Vinita Kamte most possibly expressed her emotional outbursts and anger by writing the book. She might have got solace by attacking Maria, but it had also damaged the police force. The highly sensitive Police Control Room logbook came in public purview, just because of an RTI. According to records, more forces were sent to the Cama Hospital than the Taj Mahal hotel or Chabad House. Even Vinita had accepted the fact: ‚ÄúI am not denying that forces were sent. If they sent 200 people, where were they?‚Äù The additional forces were actually ordered to go to the Cama Hospital by Maria. According to police records around 150 policemen should have been there before 11.50 pm. Karkare, Kamte and Salaskar were killed around 12.07 am. But again it was not a normal situation. Why police arrived late must have an explanation not related to Maria. The Ram Pradhan Committee was too critical on the role of the then Mumbai Commissioner of Police Hasan Gafoor and said that he had flouted the Standard Operating Practice by saddling Joint Commissioner Rakesh Maria with the charge of the Police Control Room.  Opinions  = On third degree interrogation = In an interview to Indian magazine Verve, he clarified on misconception about use of third degree interrogation by saying, \\"Thanks largely to what the film industry portrays, everyone thinks that third degree is the only way interrogations take place. This is absolutely off the mark. Just beating and torture does not get you answers or answers that will stand up. The terrorist today is completely indoctrinated. One needs to understand his or her psychology, break his or her mind to get information from him or her. Apart from this there are lawyers, courts, NGOs and strict laws in place. So, the general perception that a criminal breaks down after a beating, is not true. We use a lot of mental games when we interrogate the accused. I often step in and do it myself. Ajmal Kasab was interrogated by me for the first time on the 27th at around four or five a.m.\\"  In popular culture  *In the film Black Friday, actor Kay Kay Menon played the role of Maria.

Volume 2. pp. 327-30. The competition whitewater course is 300 m long, with a 6.5 m drop, making a 2.2% slope of 114 ft/mile or 22 m/km. The natural flow of the Segre River is diverted through the course by a diversion dam upstream. In low flow conditions, four 300-kilowatt recirculation pumps can add up to 12 m¬≥/s to the course flow, in order to increase it to the course maximum of 17.5 m¬≥/s. When the course is not being used, or when the natural flow exceeds 17.5 m¬≥/s, the pumps are reversed and run in turbine mode to generate electricity for the town. A 130-metre beginners course is a diversion from the main course. Its drop is 1.5 m for a 1.2% slope of 61 ft/mile or 12 m/km. Streamflow for the beginners course is 3 to 10 m¬≥/s. The park also has a 650-m long feedwater canal which carries water from the river into the whitewater course.

Most classical works and many modern works are written in these metres. Tolkappiyam represents the older tradition in Tamil prosody while yapparungalam and yapparungalakkarigai represent the later tradition. The prosodic structure of literary works from the Sangam era has to be analysed according to the Tolkappiyam. The rules given in Yapparungalakkarigai are used in the scansion of later works. Development The development of Tamil prosody can be broadly broken into four stages. The first stage is predominantly indigenous, pre-Sanskritic and extra-Sanskritic. It is based on a basic metrical unit named acai which forms the basis for all the important classical metres of Tamil. The second stage () marks the influence of Sanskritic prosody on the Tamil metre and ends with the overwhelming incorporation of the akshara (syllable) and matra (mora) based metrics alongside the indigenous Tamil ones. The third stage is marked by the gradual coming together of poetry and music starting with the use of fixed melody types (') in Shaiva and Vaishnava Bhakti texts. The stage culminates with the spread of musical forms in the 17th, 18th, and early 19th-century. The final stage appears with the introduction of free verse and prose-poetry in the early 20th century. Basic elements The basic prosodic unit is the asai (acai) which is composed of ezhuttu (e·∏∑uttu), the letters of the Tamil language or more accurately, the speech sounds in Tamil. Asais are the components of the metrical foot or cƒ´r which, in turn, are the components of the adi (a·π≠i), a line of poetry. Other elements include todai (to·π≠ai, alliteration) and vannam (va·πá·πáam, \\"rhythmic effect\\", lit. colour or beauty).

Civil aviation Civil aviation is conducted under the supervision of the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), a statutory corporation which oversees and regulates all aspects of civil aviation in the United Kingdom. Its areas of responsibility include: * Supervising the issuing of pilots' licences, testing of equipment, calibrating of navaids, and many other inspections (Civil Aviation Flying Unit). * Managing the regulation of security standards, including vetting of all personnel in the aviation industry (Directorate of Aviation Security). * Overseeing the national protection scheme for customers abroad in the event of a travel company failure (Air Travel Organisers' Licensing ‚Äì ATOL). The CAA is a public corporation of the Department for Transport, liaising with the government via the Standards Group of the Cabinet Office. Historically, the work of the CAA was previously carried out by the Ministry of Aviation, a department of the United Kingdom government established in 1959. Its responsibilities included the regulation of civil aviation and the supply of military aircraft, which it took on from the Ministry of Supply. In 1967, the Ministry of Aviation merged into the Ministry of TechnologyEdgerton, David (1996). Science, technology, and the British industrial \\"decline\\", 1870-1970. Cambridge; New York, NY, USA: Cambridge University Press, p. 40. . which took on the supply of military aircraft, while regulatory responsibilities were switched to the Board of Trade. Air transport in the United Kingdom is the commercial carriage of passengers, freight and mail by aircraft, both within the United Kingdom (UK) and between the UK and the rest of the world. In the past 25 years the industry has seen continuous growth, and the demand for passenger air travel in particular is forecast to increase from the current level of 236 million passengers to 465 million in 2030. One airport, London Heathrow Airport, is amongst the top ten busiest airports in the world. More than half of all passengers travelling by air in the UK currently travel via the six London area airports. Outside London, Manchester Airport is by far the largest and busiest of the remaining airports, acting as a hub for the 20 million or so people who live within a two-hour drive. Regional airports have experienced the most growth in recent years, due to the success of 'no-frills' airlines over the last decade. In 2013 the UK had the third highest number of passengers carried of any country, behind only the United States and China.World Bank Datebase, http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/IS.AIR.PSGR Outside of air transport, general aviation in the United Kingdom has been defined as a civil aircraft operation other than a commercial air transport flight operating to a schedule or military aviation. Although the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) excludes any form of remunerated aviation from its definition, some commercial operations are often included within the scope of general aviation (GA) in the UK. The sector operates business jets, rotorcraft, piston and jet- engined fixed-wing aircraft, gliders of all descriptions, and lighter than air craft. Public transport operations include business (or corporate) aviation and air taxi services, and account for nearly half of the economic contribution made by the sector. Other commercial GA activities are aerial work, such as surveying and air ambulances, and flight training, which plays an important role in the supply of pilots to the commercial air transport (CAT) industry. Private flying is conducted for personal transport and recreation. It includes a strong vintage aircraft movement, and encompasses a range of air sports, such as racing, aerobatics, and parachuting, at which British teams and individuals have succeeded in international competition. Organisations in the United Kingdom (UK) describe GA in less restrictive terms that include elements of commercial aviation. The British Business and General Aviation Association interprets it to be \\"all aeroplane and helicopter flying except that performed by the major airlines and the Armed Services\\". The General Aviation Awareness Council applies the description \\"all Civil Aviation operations other than scheduled air services and non-scheduled air transport operations for remuneration or hire\\". For the purposes of a strategic review of GA in the UK, the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) defined the scope of GA as \\"a civil aircraft operation other than a commercial air transport flight operating to a schedule\\", and considered it necessary to depart from the ICAO definition and include aerial work and minor CAT operations. This article uses the CAA description to define the scope of general aviation in the UK, on the basis that this organisation is the regulatory body for aviation in the UK and the publisher of a key source. Of the 21,000 civil aircraft registered in the UK, 96 per cent are engaged in GA operations, and annually the GA fleet accounts for between 1.25 and 1.35 million hours flown. The single most common class of aircraft is the fixed-wing light aircraft associated with traditional GA, but the main area of growth over the last 20 years has been in the use of more affordable aircraft, such as microlights, amateur built aeroplanes, and smaller helicopters. There are 28,000 Private Pilot Licence holders, and 10,000 certified glider pilots. Some of the 19,000 pilots who hold professional licences are also engaged in GA activities. Although GA operates from more than 1,800 aerodromes and landing sites, ranging in size from large regional airports to farm strips, over 80 per cent of GA activity is conducted at 134 of the larger aerodromes. The GA industry, which is around 7 per cent the size of its CAT cousin, employs 12,000 people, and contributes ¬£1.4 billion to the UK economy. Police aviation Police aviation in the United Kingdom provides the British police with an aerial support unit to assist them in pursuit, surveillance and tracking. All police aviation in England and Wales comes under the National Police Air Service (NPAS), while Police Scotland and the Police Service of Northern Ireland operate independent units. While in the past, only a few units have operated fixed-wing planes, NPAS has introducing several more to strengthen the national fleet. These light aircraft also allow for longer flying time and lower running costs. The PSNI is unique in that it, currently, is the only force to operate an aeroplane. Police aviation in England and Wales was once a force-by-force, or forces working in partnership, organisation, however from April 2012 it gradually became centralised as the National Police Air Service. The final force to join, the Metropolitan Police, joined in 2015.

Gent , 1956. p. 179 Legal Proceedings There are four parts of Hindu legal procedure: #The Plaint #The Reply #The Trial #The Decision =The Plaint= A plaint is a probandum, i.e. ‚Äúof something that deserves to be proved, of a quality-bearer characterized by qualities that deserve to be demonstrated. Thus, it means: a valid plaint is an utterance of (the plaintiff‚Äôs) own opinion.‚ÄùRocher, Ludo. V√°caspati Mi≈õra: VyavahƒÅracintƒÅma≈Üi: A Digest on Hindu Legal Procedure. Gent , 1956. p. 189-190 The valid plaint must be 1) free from the defects of the statement, 2) provided with a valid cause, 3) definite, 4) in accordance with common practice, 5) concisely worded, 6) explicit, 7) free from doubts, 8) free from contradictory causes, 9) capable of meeting opposing arguments.B 2.14-15, translated by Rocher, Ludo.

According to NƒÅrada, ‚ÄúThe statement (of the plaint) is considered to be the fundamental part of legal procedures; if the plaintiff falls short of it, he is lost; if he carries it through, he is successful.‚ÄùNmƒÅ 1.6, translated by Rocher, Ludo. V√°caspati Mi≈õra: VyavahƒÅracintƒÅma≈Üi: A Digest on Hindu Legal Procedure. Gent , 1956. p. 192 Once a plaint is made, the plaintiff cannot change it (i.e. changing the amount of money the plaintiff believes another man owes him). Additionally, the plaint needs to be written down, with all minute details of the situation recorded, or it is considered invalid. Most plaints included one of the eighteen Hindu titles of law, called the VyavahƒÅrapadas. VyavahƒÅrapadas VyavahƒÅrapada means \\"the topic or subject matter of litigation or dispute.\\"Kane, P.V. The History of the Dharma≈õƒÅstras Vol. 3, p. 248 Manu (Hinduism) divided the vyavahƒÅrapadas into eighteen titles of law. Manu acknowledged that \\"the enumeration of the 18 vyavahƒÅrapadas was a matter of a convenient arrangement and that the number 18 did not embrace all disputes whatever but only the largest number of disputes and the most important among them.\\" The eighteen titles of law include \\"(i) the first is the non-payment of debts; (ii) deposits; (iii) sale without ownership; (iv) partnerships; (v) delivery and non-delivery of gifts; (vi) non-payment of wages; (vii) breach of contract; (viii) cancellation of a sale or purchase; (ix) disputes between owners and herdsman; (x) the Law on boundary disputes; (xi) verbal assault; (xii) physical assault; (xiii) theft; (xiv) violence; (xv) sexual crimes against women; (xvi) Law concerning husband and wife; (xvii) partition of inheritance; and (xviii) gambling and betting.‚ÄùOlivelle, Patrick, The Law Code of Manu, Oxford University Press, 2004, p. 123 Wagers The plaint is also sometimes accompanied by a legal wager, or pa≈Üa. A legal proceeding is attended with a wager if ‚Äúbefore writing down the plaint, a wager is placed like this: ‚ÄòThe one who is defeated here will give so much to the winner by way of punishment.‚Äô\\"Rocher, Ludo. V√°caspati Mi≈õra: VyavahƒÅracintƒÅma≈Üi: A Digest on Hindu Legal Procedure. Gent , 1956. p. 180 If the litigant who places a wager loses the case, he must pay both the wager amount they placed and the punishment for the crime. However, if one litigant places a wager and the opposing party does not, and the waging litigant is successful in the case, the defeated litigant need only pay the fine for the crime, not the wager. In a sense, a wager can be seen as a form of evidence; if a defendant wages his entire estate in his defense, he must be certain of his innocence. Additionally, a wager is only considered legitimate if it is articulated in a written agreement between the litigants.Lariviere, Richard W. \\"The Judicial Wager in Hindu Law.\\" Annals of the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute. 62. (1981) p. 140 The specific logistics of wager-placing are unclear; ‚Äúit is uncertain whether the pa≈Üa is made by one or both of the parties, whether it is paid to the ‚Äòwinner‚Äô of the suit or to the king, and what size the pa≈Üa must be.‚Äù.Lariviere, Richard W. \\"The Judicial Wager in Hindu Law.\\" Annals of the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute. 62.

(1981): p. 137 =The Reply= After a valid plaint has been made, the king should order the reply to be given. The amount of time given to a defendant to produce his reply is based upon a few things, including when the act in question was committed and the strength of the case.Rocher, Ludo, \\"VyavahƒÅracintƒÅma≈Üi\\", Gent, 1956, p. 199 According to KƒÅtyƒÅna, ‚Äú[a] reply is not valid when it is not connected with the subject, when it is too concise, when it is too broad, and when it pervades only part of the thesis.‚ÄùK 188, translated by Rocher, Ludo, \\"VyavahƒÅracintƒÅma≈Üi\\", Gent, 1956, p. 218 There are four types of reply in Hindu law procedure: #Confession #Reply by Way of Denial #Reply by Way of Exception #Reply by Way of Former Judgment Confession A reply by confession is when the defendant agrees with the plaint, i.e. if the plaint is, ‚ÄúYou owe me a hundred coins‚Äù and the reply is, ‚ÄúYes I do.‚ÄùRocher, Ludo, ‚ÄúThe Reply in Hindu Legal Procedure: Mitra Misra's Criticism of the Vyavaharacintamani,‚Äù Adyar Library Bulletin, 1956, p.3 Some argue that a confession makes the plaint invalid; if someone is trying to prove something that the defendant agrees to be true, the plaintiff's statement suffers from the defect of siddha-sƒÅdhana (proving what is proved) Others, such as VƒÅcaspati, disagree, arguing that the point of judicial procedure is the establishment of truth, and a plaint responded to with a confession serves this purpose. Reply by Way of Denial Following with the previous plaint example of ‚ÄúYou owe me a hundred coins because you borrowed them from me‚Äù a reply by way of denial would respond with, ‚ÄúI do not owe you a hundred coins.‚ÄùRocher, Ludo, ‚ÄúThe Reply in Hindu Legal Procedure: Mitra Misra's Criticism of the Vyavaharacintamani,‚Äù Adyar Library Bulletin, 1956, p.6 In this circumstance, the defendant is denying that he ever borrowed the coins at all. Reply by Way of Exception A reply by way of exception to the plaint, ‚ÄúYou owe me a hundred coins because you borrowed them from me‚Äù would be ‚ÄúI do not owe you a hundred coins, since I paid them back,‚Äù or ‚ÄúI do not owe you a hundred coins, since I received them as a gift.‚Äù In the first instance, the defendant is agreeing with the plaint that he had borrowed a hundred coins, but he raises an exception (‚ÄúI paid them back‚Äù), and therefore does not owe the plaintiff the money. In the second example, the defendant denies that he ever borrowed a hundred coins but received them in another way and thus does not owe them. Reply by Way of Former Judgment If the plaint ‚ÄúYou owe me a hundred coins because you borrowed them from me‚Äù was responded to with ‚ÄúI do not owe you a hundred coins, since this matter has been decided in the court before,‚Äù or ‚ÄúI do not owe you a hundred coins, because I never borrowed them, and that matter has been previously settled in court‚Äù that would be an example by reply by way of former judgment. In these cases, the defendant either agrees or disagrees he had previously borrowed the money, but due to the intervening fact that ‚Äúthis matter has been decided in the court before,‚Äù he does not owe the money regardless.Rocher, Ludo, ‚ÄúThe Reply in Hindu Legal Procedure: Mitra Misra's Criticism of the Vyavaharacintamani,‚Äù Adyar Library Bulletin, 1956, p.7 =The Trial= If the reply is found to be valid, a trial is granted. Unlike the leniency given for the time to produce a reply, ‚Äú[n]o delay should be granted in producing witnesses and making them depose.‚ÄùRocher, Ludo. V√°caspati Mi≈õra: VyavahƒÅracintƒÅma≈Üi: A Digest on Hindu Legal Procedure. Gent , 1956. p.220 There are two kinds of trial: human and divine. The Burden of Proof If the reply is by way of exception or by way of former judgment, the burden of proof is upon the defendant. In the case of a denial, it's upon the plaintiff, and if there was a confession, there is no burden.Rocher, Ludo, ‚ÄúThe Theory of Proof in Ancient Hindu Law,‚Äù Recueils de la Societe Jean Bodin, Les Editions de la Libraries Encyclopedique, 1964, p. 331-32 The burden is on the plaintiff in the case of a denial because asking the defendant to prove this would be asking him to prove a negative, i.e. prove he did NOT borrow the coins. The burden should be upon a party to prove a positive aspect, i.e. proving the defendant DID borrow the coins. Human Evidence Human trials produce evidence including witnesses, documents, and possession, and divine trials involve oaths and ordeals administered to the defendant.Rocher, Ludo, ‚ÄúThe Theory of Proof in Ancient Hindu Law,‚Äù Recueils de la Societe Jean Bodin, Les Editions de la Libraries Encyclopedique, 1964, p. 335 =Witnesses= In a trial, there can be a minimum of three witnesses and a maximum of nine. A competent witness is explained by Manu: ‚ÄúHouseholders, those who have a son, those born of an indigenous family, whether satriyas, vaishyas, or shudras, are competent witnesses if they are produced by a party.‚ÄùM 8. 62, translated by Rocher, Ludo.

Gent , 1956. p.243 YƒÅj√±avalkya elaborates, explaining ‚Äú[w]itnesses should be ascetics, liberally disposed, of good family, speaking truth, eminent in the sacred law, honest, having a son, well to do.‚ÄùY 2. 68, translated by Rocher, Ludo. V√°caspati Mi≈õra: VyavahƒÅracintƒÅma≈Üi: A Digest on Hindu Legal Procedure. Gent , 1956, p.244 A witness can be considered incompetent in a number of ways including: on account of a text (brƒÅhmanas, devotees, ascetics, and aged people should not be summoned as witnesses due to their figuring in authoritative texts), because of viciousness (no truth can be found in witnesses who are thieves, violent people, etc.), because of discord (if witnesses‚Äô statements are contradictory), a deposition suo motu (witness comes and speaks on his own accord without having been appointed), and a witness of intervening death (witness died before trial).Rocher, Ludo, ‚ÄúThe Theory of Proof in Ancient Hindu Law,‚Äù Recueils de la Societe Jean Bodin, Les Editions de la Libraries Encyclopedique, 1964, p. 342-343 Once a witness is determined to be competent, the chief judge should question them one-by- one, in front of the plaintiff and defendant, beginning with the plaintiff's witnesses.N. 1. 163, translated by Rocher, Ludo. V√°caspati Mi≈õra: VyavahƒÅracintƒÅma≈Üi: A Digest on Hindu Legal Procedure. Gent , 1956, p.227 Manu explains the proceedings as follows: Manu: ‚ÄúIn the morning (the judge), after being purified himself, shall ask the twice-born people to deliver true evidence. They too, shall be purified, face eastward of northward, and stand close to gods or brƒÅhama≈Üas. The chief judge‚Ä¶.should address them in the following terms: ‚ÄòDeclare everything you know about how these people have mutually behaved with regard to this case; for you are a witness to it.‚Äô‚ÄùM 8. 80 translated by Rocher, Ludo.

V√°caspati Mi≈õra: VyavahƒÅracintƒÅma≈Üi: A Digest on Hindu Legal Procedure.

V√°caspati Mi≈õra: VyavahƒÅracintƒÅma≈Üi: A Digest on Hindu Legal Procedure. Gent , 1956. p.262 Additionally, false witnesses should serve a punishment twice as high as the subject-matter of the lawsuit. Expert witness testimony should be respected in all cases.Rocher, Ludo. V√°caspati Mi≈õra: VyavahƒÅracintƒÅma≈Üi: A Digest on Hindu Legal Procedure. Gent , 1956. p. 176 According to Rocher, \\"each and every case must be decided in association with persons who are experts in that field.\\" For example, if a merchant were being charged with a crime, a decision is not possible without the expert testimony of other merchants. Furthermore, the cases of ascetics should not be decided without experts acquainted with the three Vedas. =Documents= The second mode of human evidence is documents. As helpful as witnesses are in trials, ‚Äú[t]he ancient authors have been fully aware of the extreme weakness of human memory: if made after a certain lapse of time, the deposition of witnesses loses its validity because they are likely to have forgotten many an important detail.‚ÄùRocher, Ludo, ‚ÄúThe Theory of Proof in Ancient Hindu Law,‚Äù Recueils de la Societe Jean Bodin, Les Editions de la Libraries Encyclopedique, 1964, p. 348 Therefore, a second form of evidence that may be presented at trial is that of a document, which is considered more reliable evidence than witness testimony. There are two types of documents as prescribed by vyavahƒÅra: public and private documents. The two major forms of public documents (although there are more) are official grants of land or the like, and documents of success (delivered by the king to the victorious party in a lawsuit).Rocher, Ludo, ‚ÄúThe Theory of Proof in Ancient Hindu Law,‚Äù Recueils de la Societe Jean Bodin, Les Editions de la Libraries Encyclopedique, 1964, p. 349 These documents, due to their official nature, do not need to meet many criterion to be taken as reliable evidence. Private documents, on the other hand, which include principal civil transactions (partitions, gifts, mortgages, debts, etc.) have to meet far more conditions. There are many possible defects of private documents that would render them illegitimate evidence. For one, the person who created the document can‚Äôt be a child or mentally insane, and they can‚Äôt have been intoxicated or under fear or misfortune when drawing up the document. Additionally, the content of the document needs to be very descriptive. It needs to clearly indicate the nature of the subject and describe details of all persons involved and bear the exact date and place of the transaction.Rocher, Ludo, ‚ÄúThe Theory of Proof in Ancient Hindu Law,‚Äù Recueils de la Societe Jean Bodin, Les Editions de la Libraries Encyclopedique, 1964, p. 350-51 =Possession= The third mode of human evidence is possession, and it is considered a much surer means of proof than the other two.Rocher, Ludo, ‚ÄúThe Theory of Proof in Ancient Hindu Law,‚Äù Recueils de la Societe Jean Bodin, Les Editions de la Libraries Encyclopedique, 1964, p. 354 In order for possession to serve as adequate evidence, ‚Äúit must be supported by a title, it must be of longstanding, uninterrupted, not claimed by others, and held in the presence of the other party.‚ÄùRocher, Ludo, ‚ÄúThe Theory of Proof in Ancient Hindu Law,‚Äù Recueils de la Societe Jean Bodin, Les Editions de la Libraries Encyclopedique, 1964, p. 355 If a title (property) accompanies the ownership, the possession and the title need to be produced simultaneously, and if there is no title, the possession needs to be of longstanding. Although texts disagree about how much time someone has to have possession of something before they have ownership of it, the general consensus seems to be three uninterrupted generations.K 315translated by Rocher, Ludo. V√°caspati Mi≈õra: VyavahƒÅracintƒÅma≈Üi: A Digest on Hindu Legal Procedure. Gent , 1956. p.230 Divine Evidence =The Oath= Very little is known about the oaths taken in Hindu courts. ‚ÄúHindu Law only knew the oath imposed by the judge: in the absence of human modes of proof, he invites the party to swear an oath which will constitute sufficient evidence for the case to be decided upon.‚ÄùRocher, Ludo, ‚ÄúThe Theory of Proof in Ancient Hindu Law,‚Äù Recueils de la Societe Jean Bodin, Les Editions de la Libraries Encyclopedique, 1964, p. 363 The oath can take many different forms based upon a person's caste. ‚ÄúWitnesses should swear by gold, silver, a cow, corn, S≈©rya, Agni, an elephant‚Äôs shoulder, a horse‚Äôs back ,the box of a chariot, or weapons, or by their son or grandson. One should select different (oaths) according to their caste.‚ÄùSƒπ ? translated by Rocher, Ludo. V√°caspati Mi≈õra: VyavahƒÅracintƒÅma≈Üi: A Digest on Hindu Legal Procedure.

If his hand is not injured at the end of the day, he is innocent. In the ordeal of the grains of rice, the person has to swallow and spit out grains of rice which have undergone a special treatment. He is declared guilty if, when spitting out the grains, his saliva is mixed with blood.Rocher, Ludo, ‚ÄúThe Theory of Proof in Ancient Hindu Law,‚Äù Recueils de la Societe Jean Bodin, Les Editions de la Libraries Encyclopedique, 1964, p. 368 The ordeal to be administered is selected ‚Äúaccording to the nature of the crime, according to the status of the individual who is to undergo it, and according to the time when the ordeal is to be administered.‚Äù =The Decision= VyƒÅsa describes the following kinds of decisions: by valid means of proof (document, witnesses, possession), by motives (inferences and logical speculation), by customs (local rules established for a long time), by an oath, by a royal decree, or by reconciliation of the parties.Vt 1.1, 1.3 , translated by Rocher, Ludo.

This even includes the trees that are on or near holy ground, with a fine of 40 units for cutting off a twig. The king would appoint a , an officer who superintends the temples. In an emergency, this superintendent would gather the wealth of the temples and place it at the disposal of the king, who would presumably repay it. It is also ordained that the king should not deprive temples of their properties. Other details pertaining to the administration of temples deal with the institutions in charge of running the temples, and therefore fall more into the realm of ƒÅcƒÅra.Kane, P.V.

Meanwhile, Azusa continues to run the high school light music club alongside Yui's sister Ui, their classmate Jun Suzuki, and new members Sumire Sait≈ç and Nao Okuda. The spin-off manga K-On! Shuffle focuses on a new set of characters at a different school. After being inspired by the Sakuragaoka High School light music club, Yukari Sakuma and friend Kaede Shimizu seek to form their own club. Along with classmate Maho Sawabe, they discover the Light Music Appreciation Society, a club run by Riko Satou. Characters =Main characters= ; : :Yui is the lead guitarist and split vocalist of the Light Music Club who plays a Heritage Cherry Sunburst Gibson Les Paul Standard electric guitar that she nicknames . Before she learned how to play the electric guitar, the only instrument she knew how to play was the castanets. She does not get good grades in school (though when properly coached, she can achieve astounding results) and is easily distracted by trivialities (mainly those deemed cute and adorable). Yui is a kind and friendly girl, but also clumsy and easily spaces out most of the time; as a result, she can be forgetful and is sometimes oblivious to the situation around her. Yui has shoulder-length, brown hair (a little longer than Ritsu's) which she accessorizes with two yellow hair clips, and brown eyes. She takes a huge liking for any kind of food (though she never gains weight, which is greatly envied by Mugi, Mio, and Sawako). She has a younger sister named Ui, who is very mature and acts as the \\"older sister\\" of Yui, taking care of her and keeping her in line. Yui works extremely hard to get better at playing guitar. During performances, Yui plays with amazing energy and joy which usually results in great response from the audience. :As a musician, Yui has absolute pitch‚Äîshe can tune her guitar perfectly without a tuner, which greatly impresses Azusa, who has played the guitar much longer than Yui. She has a very easy-going nature, but has incredible focus and retention when she has a clear goal in sight; unfortunately, this is limited to only one subject at a time, and her other skills deteriorate quickly (for example, Yui is at one point pressed to make up failing test scores, and she quickly brings her math skills up to par at the expense of her guitar knowledge). Despite all of this, Yui is still devoted to her band and will always practice hard enough for the club. At school, she has become quite admired for her great voice. However, she is known to forget her lyrics mid-performance as well as overdoing things, making her unable to perform sometimes. Mio was the lead vocalist at first, since Yui could not play the guitar and sing at the same time. Yui is also known to write childish lyrics as Ui has assisted her in creating them. ; : :Mio is the bassist, songwriter, and split vocalist for the light music club. She is a shy girl who is in the light music club. She plays a left-handed, 3-Color Sunburst Fender Jazz Bass with a tortoiseshell pickguard, though is shown playing a Fender Precision Bass in the first manga volume. She uses D'Addario EXL160M medium bass strings. Her bass is given the name later in the anime. While she originally intended to join the literary club, she was forced into the light music club by her childhood friend and the club's president/drummer, Ritsu. She gets excellent grades in school and while usually very kind and warm, she is often mature and strict especially where Ritsu, who always teases her, is involved; her weakness is the horrific; she is often incapacitated with fear when stories involving ghosts, blood, injuries, haunted houses, barnacles or other disturbing topics come up. She also fears being in the spotlight, is easily embarrassed, and is often subject to teasing from Ritsu and Sawako, their club adviser and eventual third-year homeroom teacher. Mio has long, straight black hair and gray eyes (that are angled slightly more than the other characters). She cites that she chose bass since it is not the center of attention in the band, unlike the guitarist. Mio is more technical when it comes to music, and Yui often comes to her when she is in need of more guitar tutorials. :Mio is the split vocalist of the band, though given her dislike of being center stage, she tries to avoid taking the lead vocal if possible, generally singing if Yui is unable to. She writes most of the songs, although they usually feature some odd and overly girlish lyrics like \\"Light and Fluffy Time\\". As she is left-handed, she becomes entranced whenever she sees left-handed instruments because of their rarity. After their first live performance, the attractive Mio gained a huge fan following (in no small part due to an unfortunate accident that occurred at the end of the show), led by an infatuated former student council president. Also resulting from her sudden popularity, most of her classmates voted that she portray Romeo in their class play. Mio comes to greatly enjoy her time at university as she encounters many new experiences. She is also able to overcome some of her shyness and make new friends such as Sachi and Ayame. ; : :Ritsu (or , as nicknamed by Yui) is the self-proclaimed president of the light music club and the leader of Hokago Tea Time who plays a yellow Rick Marotta Signature Yamaha Hipgig drum kit (with an add-on floor tom in the opening credits only) combined with a cymbal set from Avedis Zildjian, though is shown playing a white Yamaha Absolute Series drumkit in the anime's closing credits. She has an ambiguous yet upbeat personality, and is even more extroverted and hammy than Yui, but often has trouble remembering important club activities and announcements and gets constantly rebuked by Mio and Nodoka for forgetting to send in important forms concerning the club. Ritsu is cheerful, often likes making jokes and is sarcastic most of the time, but still shares the good heart of the other members. She is skilled at brainstorming ideas that earn money for the club. Ritsu has shoulder-length, brown hair, with her bangs pulled back with a yellow hairband, and gold-colored eyes. She wears her school jacket open. She says she chose to play the drums because they are \\"cool\\", but later admits that she has trouble playing instruments which involve intricate finger movements such as the bass, guitar and keyboard. :She is Mio's childhood friend and will often take the opportunity to tease her whenever Mio is cowering from something. She is also known to become easily jealous of Mio's other high school friends, even going as far as spying on Mio when on outings with them. Ritsu is always on the go and will stop at nothing for the success of the light music club. Despite her rough mannerisms and speech, she gets cast as Juliet by the majority of her classmates in their class play rendition of Romeo and Juliet and, in the end, manages to act like a proper girl. In the anime, she states her favorite drummer is Keith Moon of The Who. She is skilled at cooking. She has a younger brother named . ; : :Tsumugi, often referred to as by her friends, is a wealthy Kansai girl with a gentle and sweet personality who plays a Korg Triton Extreme 76-key keyboard, though she is also seen playing a Korg RK-100 keytar in the closing credits of the first season, and a Hammond organ in the closing credits of the second season. She originally intended to join the choir club, but joins the light music club instead after receiving an invitation and encouragement from both Mio and Ritsu. Tsumugi is considered a piano prodigy since she has been playing the piano since she was four and has experience in winning various piano contests. Tsumugi has written several songs for the light music club, as well as singing the back vocals in several other songs. She is a good student and has long, pale blonde hair, blue eyes, unusually large eyebrows that apparently run in her family, and a fair complexion that the other characters do not have, but she does not get sunburned. She however, has great difficulty playing electric guitar. :She is the daughter of a company president, and her family has several villas in various places around Japan (and even one in Finland). Since her father also owns a maid caf√©, she often brings confectionery and an assortment of sweets and pastries to the club room, and she diligently makes tea with a tea set which is kept in their club room. Despite her wealth, she is fascinated by and finds joy in \\"normal\\" activities, such as ordering fast food, sharing french fries with her club mates, holding down part-time jobs and haggling over prices. Tsumugi displays a rebellious streak occasionally, diverting from her normally well-behaved and mature demeanor to the surprise of the others. She also displays a childlike eagerness from time to time, and possesses unusually high strength, being able to effortlessly carry around her own keyboard, Ritsu's drums, amplifiers, and at one point beating an arm-wrestling game in an arcade. :Tsumugi is often entranced by the sight of two girls interacting closely together, sometimes imagining something more risqu√© in her head. While a lot of things do not bother her, she is fairly conscious about her weight (just like Mio), and she gets a bit anxious when her family's staff start spoiling her friends during villa visits. She later begins learning how to play the guitar from Azusa. Tsumugi has a childhood friend several years younger than her named Sumire Sait≈ç, who is a daughter of the family that serves the Kotobuki household. Tsumugi grew up home schooled, and therefore spent very little time in the outside world. Because of their close friendship, Sumire would purchase everyday items for Tsumugi, like manga that she was not normally allowed to see. Tsumugi was rather taken by some of the yuri manga she received, which may have influenced her later perceptions about relationships. When Sumire started high school, Tsumugi wanted her to experience the light music club on her own, but due to Sumire's shyness Tsumugi came up with the excuse of sending her to the club room to pick up the tea sets that had been left there and told Sawako when Sumire did join that it was okay to leave the tea sets there. ; : :Azusa is a student in the same year and class as Yui's sister Ui, who joins the light music club and becomes the rhythm guitarist, playing a Fender Mustang electric guitar. She eventually names her guitar Muttan, as it is a Mustang. She is a self-proclaimed \\"novice\\" guitarist who has been playing the guitar since she was in the fourth grade, and her parents are working in a jazz band. She is more serious than the other girls, and is kind of a tsundere as does not like to admit how she really feels. She often finds herself bewildered by the tea parties and cosplaying aspects of the club, when she would rather just practice, and is curious about how the club is able to play so well despite their problems and lack of practice; still, she's ultimately kind as the other girls. However, she has a certain weakness for cakes and can be calmed down rather easily, sometimes by just being petted. She is constantly a victim of Yui's physical affection and is nicknamed after trying on a pair of cat ears and meowing (\\"nyan\\" being the equivalent of \\"meow\\" in the Japanese vocabulary). Despite this, Azusa is not too good with cats. Azusa has long black hair, which she wears in pigtails, and brown eyes. While Azusa is talented in guitar, she has trouble singing while playing unlike Yui and Mio. :In the band, she looks up to Mio the most due to her maturity and the fact that she is an experienced bassist, even trying to give Mio chocolate on Valentine's Day. However, she sometimes unintentionally makes remarks concerning Mio's weaknesses, such as her weight. She also finds Mugi very beautiful, and envies her hair and large eyes, and later starts teaching her how to play guitar when the two are alone in the club room. Since joining, Yui comes to her for advice on playing guitar, as well as maintenance. She gets a tan extremely easily, once during their time at the beach and another during a music festival (even after applying sunscreen). As a result, she frequently gets sunburned as well. She gets lonely very easily, and often worries that everyone in the club will leave her, as they are one year older and eventually will graduate. Due to this, the rest of the girls buy her a turtle to look after, naming it Ton. :Outside of the band, she often hangs out with Ui and Jun whenever the other girls are busy. When the others graduate, she becomes the new light music club president alongside Ui and Jun, who decide to join her. Together with two new members, Sumire and Nao, they form a new band called . During the Wakaba Girls' first summer training camp Azusa reveals to Sawako her belief that she is unable to act like a proper president for the light music club; however, Sawako suggests that there is no proper way to define what it means to be a president and that Azusa will do just fine. While on that same training camp Azusa is convinced by the others to become the band's vocalist despite her prior reservations on the issue. =Supporting characters= ; : :Sawako is a music teacher who is the adviser for the wind instrument club at the girls' school. An alumna of the school and a member of the light music club in her student days, she does not want people to find out that she was formerly a member of a heavy metal band called Death Devil (of which she was both lead guitar and vocalist and went by the stage name of ), thus she covers up by being mild and gentle to her coworkers and especially to students. She is forced to be the adviser of the light music club, as Ritsu blackmails her after the girls learn of her past. However, she is able to juggle being the adviser for the wind instrument club as well, even as the story progresses. Though she has a mature and gentle demeanor in the school, Sawako (affectionately addressed as by both Ritsu and Yui) displays a totally different, completely authentic character when she is alone with the light music club. In reality, she is rather wild, lazy, and is quite an irresponsible teacher who enjoys dressing up the light music club in (sometimes embarrassing) cosplay costumes (like French maid uniforms), much to the dismay of Mio. She gets a thrill out of the rare moments where she is praised for her work. :She names the club band \\"Ho-kago Tea Time\\" after the members take too long deciding on a name themselves. In the anime, she once fills in for Yui with her white Epiphone \\"1958\\" Korina Flying V electric guitar. She becomes the girls' homeroom teacher in their third year, and puts Nodoka and all the band members (except Azusa, since she is a grade lower) in the same class, so she does not have to remember as many names. An episode in the second anime season reveals that she owned one of the first Gibson SG models (from around 1960 with a custom stoptail bridge) which is later sold. Due to her relation to the club members, the other students in her class start to call her Sawa-chan as well, ruining her image as a mild-mannered teacher. Her image is further ruined after Death Devil is temporarily reunited at a wedding reception for a high school alumnus. Regardless, her popularity with the students remains unchanged. In spite of her laziness, she still proves herself to be an able mentor, as shown by her willingness to coach Yui as the lead singer and attending their performances. Her music abilities apparently have not dulled over the years, as she is able to substitute for Yui at the school festival at almost no notice without the assistance of a music score, even without any prior practicing of the band's song. Sawako is also very perceptive: she immediately sees through Ui's disguise when she impersonates her sister and on several occasions boasts to the club that there is nothing she cannot see. Sawako is named after real-life Japanese rock musician Sawao Yamanaka from the band The Pillows. ; : :Ui is Yui's younger sister, who begins the story as a third-year junior high school student, but later enters Yui's high school the following year in the same class as Azusa. Unlike her older sister, Ui is mature, responsible, and handles household chores well. Despite these differences Ui shares a very strong relationship with Yui and has a great deal of love and admiration for her older sister that sometimes borders on a sister complex. She takes particularly good care of Yui and strives to look after her even at risk to her own health. Ui is considered to be the ultimate groupie for her sister's band and supports them with all her heart. She occasionally provides a narrative to the story. Despite being a year younger than Yui, she is nearly identical to her older sister with her hair down and is even able to fool members of the light music club on more than one occasion. However, Sawako Yamanaka can tell Yui and Ui apart easily, saying 'their bust sizes are completely different'. Ui is a fast learner, able to learn how to play the guitar after only a few days' practice. She is also able to play the organ if needed. She eventually joins the light music club along with Jun at the end of the series, becoming a guitarist like her sister, playing a Surf Green Fender Stratocaster electric guitar. Ui becomes fascinated with Sumire's sister-like relationship with Tsumugi upon learning of it, as Ui sees it as very similar to her feelings toward Yui. ; : :Nodoka is Yui's childhood friend and confidant who is a member of the school's student council. As a normal, well-mannered and intelligent girl, she is generally taken aback by the light music club's odd behavior, and easily gets annoyed with Ritsu whenever she forgets to fill in the club's application forms. She shares the same class as Mio in their second year, who appreciates her companionship tremendously, she being the only person Mio knows in her class. In her third year, she replaces Megumi Sokabe as the student council president and the Mio fan club president as well (after a while), the latter at Megumi's request. In her third year, she shares a class with the rest of Hokago Tea Time. Nodoka chooses to go to a national university as opposed to the same college as Yui and the others. Nodoka is named after guitarist Yoshiaki Manabe from the Japanese rock band The Pillows. ; : :Jun is an outgoing girl and a friend and classmate of both Azusa and Ui from before they joined the light music club. Ui at first tried to get Jun to join the light music club but ultimately failed due to a strange visit to the club room. Thanks to this experience, Jun stayed in the Jazz club instead. While there she played a Yamaha Sbv500 bass. Jun became one of Mio's admirers because they both play bass. Jun begins to regret not joining the light music club when she hears about all the activities they do and eventually joins the light music club at the end of the series. She attempted to play the guitar but she did not feel that it suited her. She has an older brother named Atsushi who also plays bass and regularly gives Jun lessons. Jun was embarrassed when the light music club found out that she was receiving these lessons because she felt it damaged her image as a person who could learn an instrument on their own. Jun owns a pet cat in the anime series. ; :Sumire is a shy blonde girl who meets Azusa, Ui and Jun after Yui and the others graduate. She is a freshman, two years below the other light music club members. She is currently working in the Kotobuki household as a maid and originally came to the light music room to try to retrieve Tsumugi's teaset that was left behind after she graduated. After being scared off a few times by Sawako, she eventually agrees to join the light music club and eventually becomes its drummer. Similar to Tsumugi, she is quite talented at preparing tea, but feels inclined to keep her role as a maid a secret from the others due to the fear of being punished by Tsumugi. As her family, who came from Austria (Australia in the manga), were taken in by the Kotobuki household before she was born, Sumire grew up as Tsumugi's playmate, often regarding her as her older sister and inadvertently sparking Tsumugi's interest in yuri by introducing her to manga of that genre. As she grew up and learned the truth about the relation between the two families, Sumire felt she needed to regard Tsumugi with more respect while in public. Sawako reveals that Tsumugi asked that the tea sets be left in the club room. However, before the beginning of the new term Tsumugi had asked Sumire to remove the tea sets thereby ensuring that Sumire would encounter the other members of the light music club and would be invited to join. Sumire's situation is revealed to the surprise of the other members of the club by Sawako. Sumire uses her close ties with the Kotobuki family to reserve the use of their largest seaside villa for her first summer training camp with the light music club. ; :Another freshman in the same class as Sumire. Generally poor at physical activities, Nao goes through several trial runs through various clubs before deciding to join the light music club, as she feels it is where she can try her best. Like the kanji in her name, she is overly honest about her shortcomings. After reading up on music theory, she ends up having an advanced knowledge of music but lacks the ability to physically play it. However, when she is introduced to music creation software, she decides to become the band's producer. She is the oldest among the five siblings in her family. When on her first training camp with the Wakaba Girls, Nao writes the lyrics for the band's first song, titled \\"Answer\\". She wrote the song to reflect Azusa's misgivings about her role as president of the light music club. Okuda remarks that she keeps track of all her band mate's conversations and behaviors by entering her observations into her computer, therefore she was able to describe Azusa's exact feelings in her lyrics. ; :A new character introduced in the restarted manga who is in a band called with her friends Ayame and Sachi. Akira joins the university's light music club alongside Yui and her friends. She has short black hair and often looks intimidating whenever her hair is messy. She studies in the Education department along with Yui. She is easily irritated to a degree but finds herself in a similar position to Azusa from high school as Yui seems to enjoy hugging her. She originally had longer hair in high school, but when a boy she admired accused her band of only being popular because of their cuteness, she decided to cut off her hair and vowed to become popular through talent. She plays an ebony Gibson Les Paul Custom electric guitar which she nicknames \\"Rosalie\\". ; :One of Akira's friends, who has long hair. She is OnNaGumi's bassist and is in the same department as Mio. She is taller than Mio, and easily becomes embarrassed about her height if anyone mentions it. ; :Another one of Akira's friends, who has short blonde hair. She is OnNaGumi's drummer and is in the same department as Ritsu. Due to their similarities, Ayame and Ritsu become friends very quickly. Ayame tends to follow the latest fashion trends, and has done so since high school. ; :The president of J. Women's University's light music club who has a sweet appearance, but is generally obsessed over things such as money and looking youthful and can put out a threatening aura when she gets passionate about either one. She was once in a popular band with Hirose though retired upon entering university since wearing school uniforms would be considered silly at their age. However, Kana is still obsessed with school uniforms. ; :An upperclassman in the light music club who was once in a band with Kana. ; : :Megumi is the former student council president and founder of the Mio Fan Club (with Nodoka becoming her successor in both positions). She stalks Mio during her last few days in high school because she wanted to see Mio one more time. The band offers her a song as a graduation gift. Megumi becomes a good friend of Ritsu through unspecified circumstances much to Mio‚Äôs surprise. She also helps Ritsu and Yui with the university entrance exams by giving them her old exam workbooks. She goes to the same woman's university in which Yui and her friends later enroll and lives in the same dorm as them. =Shuffle characters= ; :The protagonist of K-On! Shuffle, Yukari is a first-year student and aspiring drummer who decides to get involved in a music club after watching the light music club at Sakuragaoka High School. She elects to play the drums as she enjoys the loud noises. Yukari has a sister Kurumi, who attends a different school. ; :Yukari's childhood friend. She decides to play the bass after seeing Mio's wardrobe malfunction at the Sakuragaoka High School's light music club performance. ; :Yukari and Kaede's classmate who sits between them and is part of the Basketball Club. Against her will, she is dragged into the Light Music Appreciation Society; despite being a member of another club, Yukari points out school rules allow for students to be in both a club and an appreciation society. She is the appreciation society's guitarist. ; :A second-year, Riko is the lone member of the Light Music Appreciation Society after the previous members had graduated or left.

It established that in some circumstances, where ordinary remedies are inadequate, restitutionary damages may be awarded. Facts George Blake was a former member of the Secret Intelligence Service (MI6) from 1944 to 1961. For his employment contract, he had signed an Official Secrets Act 1911 declaration to disclose no information about his work. It applied after his employment ceased. In 1951, he became a Soviet agent, thus, being a double agent. He was discovered in 1961 and the British government imprisoned him in Wormwood Scrubs (HM Prison). He escaped in 1966 and fled to the Soviet Union. He wrote a book about it and his secret services work called No Other Choice. He received a publishing contract for its release in 1989, with Jonathan Cape Ltd. The information in the book was no longer confidential. Blake received advanced payments and was entitled to more. The Crown brought an action for all the profits he made on the book including those that he had not yet received. It argued a restitutionary principle should apply. Judgment Lord Nicholls, Lord Goff of Chieveley, Lord Browne-Wilkinson and Lord Steyn held that in exceptional cases, when the normal remedy is inadequate to compensate for breach of contract, the court can order the defendant to account for all profits.[2001] 1 AC 268 This was an exceptional case. Blake had harmed the public interest. Publication was a further breach of his undertaking of confidentiality. Disclosure of non-confidential information was also a criminal offence under the Official Secrets Act 1911. An absolute rule against disclosure was necessary to ensure that the secret service was able to deal in complete confidence. It was in the Crown's legitimate interest to ensure Blake did not benefit from revealing state information. The normal contractual remedies of damages, specific performance or injunction were not enough, and the publishers should pay any money owing to Blake to the Crown. Lord Nicholls said the following. Lord Goff and Lord Browne-Wilkinson agreed. Lord Steyn gave a concurring opinion. Lord Hobhouse dissented. He asserted that the Crown had no proprietary right to the money and as such had suffered no loss so as to receive restitutionary damages. Instead, compensatory damages, not a full account of profit, were appropriate.

In this process, the oil shale is decomposed into shale oil, oil shale gas, and spent residue. A decomposition is caused by mixing raw oil shale with a hot oil shale ash, generated by combustion of carbonaceous residue (semi-coke) in the spent residue. The process was developed in 1950s and it is used commercially for the shale oil production in Estonia. There are projects for further development of this technology and for expansion of its usage, e.g. in Jordan and USA. History Research of the solid heat carrier process for pyrolysis of lignite, peat, and oil shale started in 1944 at the G. M. Krzhizhanovsky Power Engineering Institute of Academy of Sciences of the USSR. At the laboratory scale, the Galoter process was invented and developed in 1945‚Äì1946. The process was named Galoter after the research team leader Israel Galynker whose name was combined with the word \\"thermal\\". The further research continued in Estonia. A pilot unit with capacity of 2.5 tonnes of oil shale per day was built in Tallinn in 1947. The first Galoter-type commercial scale pilot retorts were built at Kivi√µli, Estonia, in 1953 and 1963 (closed in 1963 and 1981 respectively) with capacities of 200 and 500 tonnes of oil shale per day respectively. The Narva Oil Plant, annexed to the Eesti Power Plant and operating two Galoter-type 3000 tonnes per day retorts, was commissioned in Estonia in 1980. These retorts were designed by AtomEnergoProject and developed in cooperation with the Krzhizhanovsky Institute. Started as a pilot plant, the process of converting it to commercial scale plant took about 20 years. During this period, the company has modernized more than 70% of the equipment compared to the initial design. In 1978, a 12.5-tonnes pilot plant was built in Verkhne-Sinevidnoy, Ukraine. It was used for testing of Lviv‚ÄìVolinsk lignite, and Carpathian, Kashpir (Russia) and Rotem (Israel) oil shales. In 1996‚Äì1997, a test unit was assembled in Tver. In 2008, Estonian energy company Eesti Energia, an operator of Galoter retorts at the Narva Oil Plant, established a joint venture with the Finnish technology company Outotec called Enefit Outotec Technology to develop and commercialize a modified Galoter process‚Äìthe Enefit process‚Äìwhich combines the current process with circulating fluidized bed technologies. In 2013, Enefit Outotec Technology opened an Enefit testing plant in Frankfurt. In 2012 Eesti Energia opened a new generation Galoter-type plant in Narva using Enefit 280 technology. In 2009‚Äì2015, VKG Oil, a subsidiary of Viru Keemia Grupp, opened in Kohtla-J√§rve, Estonia three modified Galoter-type oil plants called Petroter. Technology =Galoter retort= The Galoter process is an above-ground oil-shale retorting technology classified as a hot recycled solids technology. The process uses a horizontal cylindrical rotating kiln-type retort, which is slightly declined. It has similarities with the TOSCO II process. Before retorting, the oil shale is crushed into fine particles with a size of less than in diameter. The crushed oil shale is dried in the fluidized bed drier (aerofountain drier) by contact with hot gases. After drying and pre-heating to , oil shale particles are separated from gases by cyclonic separation. Oil shale is transported to the mixer chamber, where it is mixed with hot ash of , produced by combustion of spent oil shale in a separate furnace. The ratio of oil shale ash to raw oil shale is 2.8‚Äì3:1. The mixture is moved then to the hermetic rotating kiln. When the heat transfers from the hot ash to raw oil shale particles, the pyrolysis (chemical decomposition) begins in oxygen deficit conditions. The temperature of pyrolysis is kept at . Produced oil vapors and gases are cleaned of solids by cyclones and moved to condensation system (rectification column) where shale oil condenses and oil shale gas is separated in gaseous form. Spent shale (semi-coke) is transported then to the separate furnace for combustion to produce hot ash. A portion of the hot ash is separated from the furnace gas by cyclones and recycled to the rotary kiln for pyrolysis. The remaining ash is removed from the combustion gas by more cyclones and cooled and removed for disposal by using water. The cleaned hot gas returns to the oil shale dryer. The Galoter process has high thermal and technological efficiency, and high oil recovery ratio. Oil yield reaches 85-90% of Fischer Assay and retort gas yield accounts for 48 cubic meters per tonne. Oil quality is considered good, but the equipment is sophisticated and capacity is relatively low. This process creates less pollution than internal combustion technologies, as it uses less water, but it still generates carbon dioxide as also carbon disulfide and calcium sulfide. =Enefit process= Enefit process is a modification of the Galoter process being developed by Enefit Outotec Technology. In this process, the Galoter technology is combined with proven circulating fluidized bed (CFB) combustion technology used in coal-fired power plants and mineral processing. Oil shale particles and hot oil shale ash are mixed in a rotary drum as in the classical Galoter process. The primary modification is the replacing of the Galoter semi-coke furnace with a CFB furnace. The Enefit process also incorporates fluid bed ash cooler and waste heat boiler commonly used in coal-fired boilers to convert waste heat to steam for power generation. Compared to the traditional Galoter, the Enefit process allows complete combustion of carbonaceous residue, improved energy efficiency by maximum utilization of waste heat, and less water use for quenching. According to promoters, the Enefit process has a lower retorting time compare to the classical Galoter process and therefore it has a greater throughput. Avoidance of moving parts in the retorting zones increases their durability. Commercial use Two Galoter retorts built in 1980 are used for oil production by the Narva Oil Plant, a subsidiary of the Estonian energy company Eesti Energia. Both retorts process 125 tonnes per hour of oil shale. The annual shale oil production is 135,000 tonnes and oil shale gas production is . Since 2012, it also uses a new plant employing Enefit 280 technology with a processing capacity of 2.26 million tonnes of oil shale per year and producing 290,000 tonnes of shale oil and of oil shale gas. In addition, Eesti Energia planned to begin construction of similar Enefit plants in Jordan and in USA. Enefit Outotec Technology analysis suitability of Enefit technology for the Tarfaya oil shale deposit in Morocco, developed by San Leon Energy. VKG Oil operates in Kohtal-J√§rve, Estonia three modified Galoter-type oil plants called Petroter. The basic engineering of these retorts was done by Atomenergoproject of Saint Petersburg. The basic engineering of the condensation and distillation plant was done by Rintekno of Finland. The plant has a processing capacity of 1.1 million tonnes of oil shale per year and it produces 100,000 tonnes of shale oil, of oil shale gas, and 150 GWh of steam per year. Saudi Arabian International Corporation for Oil Shale Investment planned to utilize Galoter (UTT-3000) process to build a shale oil plant in Jordan. Uzbekneftegaz planned to build eight UTT-3000 plants in Uzbekistan. However, in December 2015 Uzbekneftegaz announced a postponement of the project.

In the early 1800s, Italians began migrating to Canada with the majority arriving in the late 1890s and early 1900s. Many Italians participated and took part in building Canadian cities, working on the railroad, building ports, shipping and mining; all of which led to the modern creation of Canada. For most of World War I (1914-1918), Canada (under the British Empire) and Italy were allies during the war. During World War II (1939-1945), Canada and Italy were on opposing sides.

It also raised questions of the interests of public policy and freedom of expression under the European Convention on Human Rights because it involved a spy's publication of secret information. Facts Peter Wright worked for MI5. After retiring he wrote a book called Spycatcher, describing his work. This was in breach of the Official Secrets Act 1911. It was published in Australia and the US. The Observer and The Guardian published articles on proceedings in the Australian courts by the UK government to stop the publication. The Attorney General then sought and received an interlocutory injunction restraining publication of information obtained by Wright in June 1986. In July 1987 the Sunday Times published extracts from the book two days before its publication in the US. The Attorney General sought and was given injunctions to restrain further publication. But Scott J discharged them, holding the paper was liable to account for profits resulting from the publication. The Court of Appeal dismissed the Attorney General's appeal, and he appealed again to the House of Lords. Judgment Lord Keith of Kinkel, Lord Brightman, Lord Griffiths, Lord Goff of Chieveley and Lord Jauncey of Tullichettle upheld the Attorney General's appeal, finding that the Sunday Times publication was in breach of its duty of confidence. That could arise both in contract and equity. A duty of confidence precludes disclosure to others, and a third party (like a newspaper) with confidential information is similarly bound by a duty if they know it is confidential. This was true unless the confidential information was already known to the general public, or the duty to keep the information secret was outweighed by a countervailing public interest in the information. The Attorney General had to show that disclosure was contrary to the public interest. Because Spycatcher was already published worldwide, the injunctions were not necessary. The articles in the Observer and Guardian contained no damaging information, meaning no breach of confidentiality. But the Sunday Times was in breach of its duty of confidence. It was not protected by a defence of prior publication, and the fact that the story was to be published imminently in the US made no difference. It was therefore liable for the profits it made. However no further injunctions were to be granted on this matter.

The eight passengers and three crewmembers on board were killed. Events The route from El Dorado to Texarkana was part of a longer sequence starting in Memphis, Tennessee, with stops in Pine Bluff, El Dorado, and Texarkana in Arkansas; and finally terminating in Dallas, Texas. While the plane was on the ground in El Dorado the crew consulted with Flight Service Station staff and another set of pilots about a line of thunderstorms 35 nautical miles (40 mi; 65 km) to the west. After confirming there was a 15-nm (17 mi; 28 km) wide break in the storm the crew departed at night under visual flight rules (VFR). After departing El Dorado no contact was made with any controllers en route. When the plane was overdue at Texarkana search and rescue was notified. Despite an extensive search along the proposed route of flight no wreckage was found. A controller at the Fort Worth air traffic control center advised the searchers that he had observed an unidentified VFR target departing El Dorado to the northwest before the plane went missing. With this information the wreckage was found after three days of searching. There were no survivors. The cockpit voice recorder later revealed the first officer was flying the plane while the captain advised him of headings and altitudes to take to navigate around the storm. The captain deviated the plane 100 nm (115 mi; 185 km) to the north in an attempt to go around it. The first officer expressed concern that he did not know their position and what the terrain clearance was for the area. After the captain ordered him to descend to 2,000 feet (610 m) he consulted an en route instrument chart. He alerted the captain they were too low saying, \\"Minimum en route altitude here is forty-four hun . . .\\" At that point the recorder cut off as the plane struck Black Fork Mountain. The National Transportation Safety Board investigation concluded that the crew did not discuss the details of their intended route with Flight Service or activate the instrument flight rules (IFR) flight plan forwarded from the airline dispatch to Flight Service. If they had been operating under instrument flight rules they would have been tracked by radar or required to make position reports to air traffic control en route. Under VFR they would only need to maintain contact with a controller while in controlled airspace. In this area of rural Arkansas there was no controlled airspace below 18,000 feet (5,486 m). Further, according to Federal Aviation Regulations the airline dispatcher should have been notified the flight was proceeding under VFR. The captain also could have contacted controllers in Fort Worth to open their flight plan or receive radar vectoring in the area. From the conversation of the crew on the recorder the board concluded the flight encountered inclement weather conditions during the flight and was likely in inclement weather conditions when it crashed. The board concluded that the cause of the accident was the captains decision to continue flying into inclement weather at night, his not taking advantage of the nearby navigational aids to get a fix on their position, and his decision to descend despite the first officers concerns about position and terrain. In the coming years, FAA regulations pertaining to commercial flights would require that all airliners operate only on instrument flight plans when passengers are carried. This rule has undoubtedly contributed much to the safety of airline travel, as flights under those rules specify altitudes and routes that must be followed and that have been predetermined to provide terrain clearance.

India maintains an Embassy in Rome, and a Consulate-General in Milan. Italy has an embassy in New Delhi, and Consulate-Generals in Mumbai and Kolkata. The relations are characterized by warmth and friendship.  Early history  = Indo-Roman relations = Roman coins depicting Caligula and Nero found in Pudukkottai, Tamil Nadu. Relations between India and Italy date back to ancient times. Works from authors such as Diodorus Siculus' Library of History, Arrian's Indika, and Pliny the Elder's Natural History make references to India. Trade links flourished between India and the Roman Empire, particularly in the first and second century AD. Caches of Roman coins have been discovered across the Indian peninsula, and evidence indicates the existence of permanent settlements of Roman merchants in South India. The discovery of an Indian ivory statuette in the ruins of Pompeii confirms that goods were traded both ways. The Roman Empire and Indian civilizations also exchanged diplomatic missions. An Indian embassy sailed from Bharuch (referred to as Barygaza by the Romans) in 25 BC and arrived in Rome four years later. Records also exist of Indian embassies being sent to Trajan, Antoninus Pius, Julian the Apostate and Justinian. = Middle Ages = Relations and trade between the Mediterranean and India ended after the fall of the Roman Empire, but resumed after a few centuries. In the Middle Ages, Italian merchants once again began to ply the old routes towards the east used by the Romans. The most notable among these merchants was Marco Polo, who visited south-east India and ports such as Kayak, Comorin (now Kanyakumari), Quilon (now Kollam), Thana, Somnath and Cambay. Marco Polo published his travelogue The Travels of Marco Polo in which he described the life and customs in India at the end of the 13th century. Many other notable Venetians also visited India. Niccol√≤ de' Conti left Venice in 1419 to visit the Middle East, Persia and then India. Conti traversed the Indian peninsula from coast to coast, and also moved inland to Vijayanagara. Cesare Federici set sail from Venice in 1563 towards the east. He visited Vijayanagara and the present-day state of Kerala, documenting his travels in Viaggio nell'India Orientale et oltra l'India nel quale si contengono cose dilettevoli, 1587. Venetian merchant and jeweler, Gasparo Balbi visited Persia and India in 1579-88, publishing his experiences in Viaggio dell'Indie Orientali, di Gasparo Balbi, Gioielliero Venetiano, 1590. Ambrosio Bembo travelled from Venice in 1671 and spent four years visiting the Middle East, India and Persia. He documented his visits to Goa and Bombay (now Mumbai) in his journal Viaggio e giornale per parte dell'Asia di quattro anni circa fatto da me Ambrosio Bembo, Nobile Veneto. Nicolo Manucci left Venice at the age of fourteen and headed to India. He served the Mughal Empire and later died in India. Manucci's Storia do Mogor is among the most detailed histories of the Mughal Empire (in the period 1653-1708) written by a contemporary European observer. Visitors also came from other regions of Italy. Filippo Sassetti, a scholar and humanist from Florence, also visited India. He died in Goa in 1588. Sassetti wrote several letters in which he noted similarities between Sanskrit and Italian. Pietro della Valle from Rome arrived in India in 1624, where he visited Surat, Goa and Keladi. He published Travels in Persia and India between 1658 and 1663. Giovanni Francesco Gemelli Careri, a lawyer from Naples, visited South India during a trip around the world he had begun 1693. Gemelli Careri provides a detailed description of the camp of Mughal emperor Aurangzeb during the Deccan campaign in 1695, in Giro Intorno al Mondo, published in 1699. Many other Italians have also visited India and their names are mentioned on old chronicles. Apart from merchants and travelers, Italians also served in other roles in India such as physicians and artillerymen. Italian Jean-Baptiste Ventura contributed to the organization of the infantry in the army of Ranjit Singh in the 1830s and 40s. = British Raj = During the British Raj, trade and travel between India and Italy reduced significantly due to prevailing political conditions. Italian scholars participated in Sanskrit studies, and Gaspare Gorresio created the first Chair of Sanskrit in Italy at the University of Turin in 1852. Gorresio translated the Ramayana into Italian. It was published as Ramayana, poema indiano di Valmichi in ten volumes between 1843 and 1858. The Italian unification movement inspired some Indian freedom fighters, and the works of the Italian patriot Giuseppe Mazzini were translated and widely read by Indian intelligentsia. Mahatma Gandhi in Rome. Mahatma Gandhi accepted an invitation to visit Rome in December 1931 and meet then-Prime Minister Benito Mussolini. Mussolini hailed Gandhi as a \\"genius and a saint\\" and admired his ability to challenge the British Empire. After his visit, Gandhi wrote a letter to a friend stating, \\"Mussolini is a riddle to me. Many of his reforms attract me. He seems to have done much for the peasant class. I admit an iron hand is there. But as violence is the basis of Western society, Mussolini's reforms deserve an impartial study ... What strikes me is that behind Mussolini's implacability is a desire to serve his people. Even behind his emphatic speeches there is a nucleus of sincerity and of passionate love for his people. It seems to me that the majority of the Italian people love the iron government of Mussolini.\\" Gandhi also hailed Mussolini as the ‚Äúone of the great statesmen of our time.\\" However, by the time Italy invaded Abyssinia in 1935, Gandhi disavowed Mussolini. In the 1940s, during World War II, the British brought Italian prisoners of war, who were captured in either Europe or North Africa, to Bangalore and Madras. They were put up at the Garrison Grounds, today's Parade Grounds-Cubbon Road area.[4] In February 1941, about 2,200 Italian prisoners of war arrived in Bangalore by a special train and were marched to internment camps at Byramangala, 20 miles from Bangalore.[5] Indian forces played a role in liberating Italy from Nazi control. India contributed the 3rd largest Allied contingent in the Italian campaign after US and British forces. The 4th, 8th and 10th Divisions and 43rd Gurkha Infantry Brigade led the advance, notably at the gruelling Battle of Monte Cassino. Modern history Diplomatic relations between the Republic of India and the Italian Republic were established in 1947. Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru visited Italy in 1953. President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro was the first Italian head of state to visit India in February 1995. President Carlo Azeglio Ciampi visited India in February 2005. Romano Prodi became the first Italian Prime Minister to visit India in February 2007. Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh visited Italy to attend the 35th G8 summit at L'Aquila in July 2009. External Affairs Minister S.M. Krishna represented India at the 150th anniversary celebrations of the Unification of Italy in Rome In June 2011. After some years of tensions due to the case of the two Italian marines accused of killing two fishermen off the coast of Kerala, the two countries revived normal relations thanks to Prime Ministers Paolo Gentiloni and Narendra Modi.India can become a key market for Italian machinery makers The two leaders described Gentiloni's visit in India in 2017 as a \\"new beginning\\" and a great opportunity for both countries.Paolo Gentiloni in India, vertice con il premier Modi: \\"Grande opportunit√† di rilancio\\" Economic relations =Bilateral trade= Bilateral trade between India and Italy grew by 12 times in the 2 decades between 1991 and 2011, from EUR 708 million to EUR 8.5 billion.

HMS Pearl c.1856 The Brigade engaged in numerous actions against the rebel forces and most notably in the campaign that led to the Relief of Lucknow. They fought alongside a similar brigade formed by the crew of the Shannon, which was captained by William Peel , son of Prime Minister Sir Robert Peel and Victoria Cross recipient. The Shannons brigade landed a considerable force of mobile guns and rifle companies, while the Pearls Naval Brigade deployed mostly rifle companies. Capt. Peele took his men rapidly inland to Allahabad and Cawnpore, but he was severely injured at the Siege of Lucknow. For 10 months, the Brigade was commanded by the Pearls captain, Edward Southwell Sotheby, who was later raised to the ranks of Admiral and knighted. For their role in suppressing the Indian uprising, Sotheby and his brigade were mentioned in dispatches on 13 occasions relating to the operations in Oudh, and received thanks of the governor-general of India and of both Houses of Parliament. For his service, Sotheby was made a Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB) and appointed an extra aide-de-camp to Queen Victoria. Peel was awarded a knighthood in January 1858, only to die of smallpox at Cawnpore in April.

According to Hortus Veitchii, the Veitch family history: > Guillermo Kalbreyer, a promising young man, twenty-nine years of age, > entered Messrs. Veitch's service as a plant-collector in 1876, and his first > trip was to the West Coast of Africa in search of tropical flowering and > foliage plants, very popular at that time. West Africa Kalbreyer set off from Liverpool in November 1876 and arrived at the island of Fernando Po in the Gulf of Guinea on Christmas Eve before travelling on to Victoria in Cameroon a week later. His travels took him into neighbouring southern Nigeria, including exploring the coastal areas around Calabar and Bonny, as well as the Cameroon mountains and the Sanaga River basin. At that time travelling in the region was difficult, and, owing to the hostility of native traders, foreigners were unable to penetrate far into the country. Whilst in Victoria, Kalbreyer met Rev. George Thomson, a Baptist missionary and amateur plant collector, who assisted him on his plant gathering expeditions. In July 1877, after suffering from frequent attacks of malaria, Kalbreyer's health deteriorated and he returned to England, bringing with him a small collection of plants and seeds, including Adenorandia kalbreyeri (originally known as \\"Gardenia kalbreyeri\\"), five species of Mussaenda (a flowering plant in the family Rubiaceae) and two new orchids: Brachycorythis kalbreyeri, a terrestrial species named by Reichenbach after its discoverer, and Pachystoma thomsonianum, an epiphyte, named, at Kalbreyer's request, in honour of George Thomson. He also brought back seeds of Pararistolochia promissa which were successfully grown at Chelsea ‚Äì this was described by Masters as, \\"one of the most extraordinary members of an extraordinary genus.\\" The flowers extend into three tails, which sometimes reach a length of 2 feet. Colombia Following the disappointment of Kalbreyer's first expedition, Harry Veitch decided to send Kalbreyer to Colombia \\"where the climate is delightful on the highlands and mountain- slopes, though in the lowlands and along the coast almost as hot as in parts of Africa\\". Kalbreyer departed in October 1877 and collected in the Eastern Cordillera near Oca√±a, where he mostly collected various species of Odontoglossum, including Odontoglossum nobile and 0. spectatissimum. In February 1878 he left Oca√±a to return to England, travelling down the Magdalena River to the coast at Barranquilla. Because of the low state of the river, the passage to the coast was difficult and the journey (normally from seven to ten days) required nearly a month. Kalbreyer finally arrived in England at the end of April, by when more than half his collection was unusable. He returned to Oca√±a in July 1878, and he again proceeded to the Eastern Cordillera, through the towns of San Pedro, Salazar and Pamplona. Once again, he collected some extraordinary forms of Odontoglossum including 0. tripudians, 0. crocidipterum and the rare 0. blandum together with related species such as Oncidium hastilabium and Otoglossum chiriquense. After sending several consignments of orchids back to Chelsea, Kalbreyer returned to England, bringing with him a large collection of orchids. Kalbreyer was described as a \\"particularly conscientious collector\\" who always wrote lengthy reports on the habitats of the plants he collected. He was praised for his \\"judicious packing and careful superintendence of the transport\\" of the scarce Odontoglossum blandum which all arrived at Chelsea in good condition. In September 1879, he again left England for Colombia, on this occasion travelling down the Magdalena River to the Central and Western Cordillera, and as far west as the Atrato River. According to the account in Hortus Veitchii, \\"passing from the water-shed of the Atrato to the plains, he was particularly struck by the richness of the vegetation\\", especially the luxuriant palm trees, of which he collected specimens of more than 100 species. Here he also collected samples of the giant arum, Anthurium veitchii, with leaves over six feet in length, which had been discovered by a previous Veitch employee, Gustav Wallis in 1874. On this expedition, Kalbreyer travelled throughout the province of Antioquia passing through the towns of Rionegro, Medell√≠n, Santa Fe de Antioquia, Sopetr√°n, Frontino, Amalfi, Concordia and many others ‚Äì en route, he collected more orchids, including Odontoglossum sceptrum, Miltonia vexillaria, Cattleya aurea, Phragmipedium longifolium, P. schlimii alba, and several species of Masdevallia. After sending several consignments of orchids to Chelsea, Kalbreyer returned to England in September 1880, bringing with him many living plants and some 360 species of dried ferns, including eighteen new discoveries. These were described by John Gilbert Baker in the Journal of Botany for July 1881. Kalbreyer's last journey as a plant-collector commenced in December 1880; on this occasion he again proceeded to Oca√±a, where he arrived in January 1881, quickly sending home a further consignment of orchids. Leaving Oca√±a at the end of the month, he went southwards to Cundinamarca and to Bogot√°, on the high plains of the Eastern Cordillera. In this neighbourhood he collected more orchids, especially Odontoglossum crispum, which he brought safely to England in June 1881. Following his return to England in 1881, his engagement with Veitch ended, and after a short stay he returned to Colombia, where he set up business in Bogot√° as a nurseryman and exporter of orchids continuing to send interesting finds back to the Veitch Nurseries. Honours Many plant species have been named after Kalbreyer, including: *Adenorandia kalbreyeri (Hiern) *Cyathea kalbreyeri (Baker) *Columnea kalbreyeriana (Mast.) *Cryosophila kalbreyeri (Dammer ex Burret) *Dennstaedtia kalbreyeri (Maxon) *Masdevallia kalbreyeri (Rchb. f. ex Kraenzl.) *Maxillaria kalbreyeri (Rchb. f.) *Paphinia rugosa var. kalbreyeri (Rchb. f.) \\"Paphinia rugosa var. kalbreyeri\\" on French Wikipedia *Spathiphyllum kalbreyeri (Maxon) *Wettinia kalbreyeri (Burret) The palm genus, Kalbreyera, was named after Kalbreyer but the only species in the genus has now been re-classified as Geonoma triandra (Burret) Wess.Boer. The small genus of Acanthus, Kalbreyeriella (Lindau) , found in Colombia and Ecuador also bears Kalbreyer's name.

Gardens of Alsace =Bas-Rhin= View of the chateaux of Kintzheim and of Haut-Koenigsbourg from the road between Ch√¢tenois and Kintzheim * Kintzheim - The Park of ruins of the Ch√¢teau de Kintzheim. In 1802 Matthieu de Favier, a future baron of the French Empire, bought a former feudal domain and a ruined 12th-century castle on a mountain, and built a mansion in the new Directory style. In 1803‚Äì1807, he created a romantic French landscape garden, or jardin tableau, to highlight the view of the ruined castle, inspired by the paintings of Nicolas Poussin, Claude Lorraine, and Hubert Robert. * Kolbsheim - The Garden of the Ch√¢teau of Kolbsheim. Located 15 kilometers southwest of Strasbourg, overlooking the plain of Alsace. The chateau has two wings, the oldest built in 1703. The upper part of the garden is a geometric Garden √† la fran√ßaise parterre garden, decorated with ponds, fountains, hedges and sculpted trees. The lower part is an English park, with many hundred-year-old trees. Much of the garden was destroyed in the First World War, but was restored by the Grunelius family, the present owners. * Ottrott - The Domaine of Windeck. The house was built by an Alsatian nobleman, Joseph Pescalis, in 1770. The park was begun by Armand Theodore de Partein in 1835.

An enclave in the Vosges Forest, featuring local trees, bushes and herbaceous plants in their natural setting. The garden is also known for its bracken, iris from Siberia, and its collection of carnivorous plants. * Strasbourg - The Botanical Gardens of the Universit√© Louis-Pasteur were founded by the French Academy of Sciences in 1619, and were the second-oldest botanical gardens in France. During the Franco-Prussian War of 1870, the gardens were turned into a cemetery and largely destroyed. The gardens were recreated between 1880 and 1884. Today the gardens, located on 3.5 hectares, have 6000 species of plants, including a collection of rare trees from around the world, including a Giant Sequoia (Sequoiadendron) from the Sierras of California; a massive pecan tree; and a walnut tree from the Caucasus. Greenhouses shelter a remarkable collection of tropical plants, including giant waterlily (Victoria regia) from the Amazon River basin. * Uttenhoffen - The Garden of La Ferme Bleue. A modern garden built around a farm from the time of the Thirty Years War in the 17th century, whose buildings, like those of other Protestant farms of the time, were painted blue. The garden features sculpture, fruit trees and fountains, and colorful seasonal displays of flowers. The garden was created by landscape architect Jean-Louis Cura. = Haut-Rhin = * Guebwiller - The Park of the Marseillaise is a public botanical garden and arboretum in the center of the town of Guebwiller, created by landscape designer √âdouard Andr√© between 1897 and 1899.

But when Dan McGoo turns out to be Droopy, it turns into another Droopy-versus-the Wolf/Wolf-goes-ape-for-the-girl gagfest. The story begins in Coldernell, Alaska--Population 324 and getting smaller--a wild, rough town where gold is king while gambling, drinking, and shooting each other are the major activities. Droopy is \\"Dangerous Dan McGoo\\", a lone gambler, whose only love is the girl they call \\"Lou\\", played by Red (from Red Hot Riding Hood). The wolf drags himself into the Malamute Saloon from the 50-below cold and immediately pays for \\"drinks on the house\\". In a gag, the wolf wants a drink of whiskey (Old Block Buster 4000 lb proof). After he chugs it down, the film shows his stomach being blasted from the drink. His eyes go red and smoke comes out of his ears. He flies around the room and comes back down to the bar. Leaning over to the bartender, he complains: \\"This stuff's been cut!\\". Droopy makes a little remark to the wolf about the price of the whiskey, as if it were the price of gasoline. The wolf resents his joke (\\"T'ain't funny, McGoo.\\") and draws out a giant switchblade knife, about to end Droopy's life, until he stops and hears the fanfare for the lady known as Lou making her appearance. As always, the wolf falls for Lou and tries to drag her off, but not before he goes on a shooting spree against anyone who objects to it. He shoots at a man who hides behind the table, but the table, somehow, hides behind the would-be victim. Then he shoots at the drinkers at the bar, one at a time, dropped dead from their wounds; their ghosts, however, resumed their drinking. The mortician, named Rig R. Mortis, is present at the bar, tallying the victims; his business is thriving. The wolf shoots at a different table where the card players are sitting at, the group ran away with the whole table and made their exit. Then, he shoots at the bartender covering the painting. The latter gasps and hides under the bar, revealing the woman in the half- finished painting, it says, \\"I ain't got no body\\" in the middle. The wolf, carrying Lou, tries to make good his escape, but Droopy was waiting for him. That was when \\"the lights went out! A woman screamed and two guns blazed in the dark!\\" When the lights go back on, Droopy is victorious and receives a kiss from Lou (which he reacts to with the same antics his foe did, earlier).

There is no channel, past or present, named \\"ITV Wales and West\\". The licence relates to a 'dual region', meaning that the franchise area was divided into two regions, each of which had to be served by distinct and separate ITV programme services, as more fully defined within the licence. Today, those services are known as ITV Cymru Wales and ITV West Country (since ITV West and ITV Westcountry merged into a single region). They are provided by ITV plc which owns and operates the two services through its subsidiary ITV Broadcasting Ltd. From January 2014, the dual-region licence was split in two, with ITV Cymru Wales for Wales and ITV West Country covering the West of England. Both licences remain held by ITV Broadcasting Ltd and the legal names of the former HTV companies have not yet been changed again.ITV Cymru Wales news shake-up under new Ofcom licence Huw Thomas, BBC News, 23 July 2013 The National Library of Wales archives now store 200,000 ITV (HTV) film and video items dating from 1958. History Harlech Television was awarded its contract by the Independent Television Authority in July 1967, replacing the incumbent TWW. While no official reason was given for the decision, it was believed TWW's preferral to base its corporate headquarters in London, rather than within the region, played a key factor. Harlech was to locate its headquarters within the transmission area, based at TWW's former studios at Pontcanna in Cardiff and Bath Road in Bristol. TWW refused to purchase shares in the new consortium and opted to cease broadcasting early on Sunday 4 March 1968, selling its remaining airtime to Harlech for ¬£500,000. As the new service was not ready to launch, an unbranded emergency service was provided by former TWW staff until Harlech's launch on Monday 20 May 1968. The opening night was marked by a networked variety special. Initially, the station used the name Harlech Television (after the head of the company, Lord Harlech), but from the introduction of colour on 6 April 1970, this was dropped in favour of the initialism HTV. Other than being simpler, this also largely ended concerns from the West of England that the 'Harlech' branding was only associated with the Welsh part of the dual region. The initial Harlech board of directors boasted a high-profile line-up including actor Richard Burton and his wife Elizabeth Taylor, opera singer Sir Geraint Evans, entertainer Harry Secombe and veteran broadcaster Wynford Vaughan-Thomas.History Of ITV In Wales , rts.org.uk, August 2013 The board contributed relatively little to HTV's output, although notable productions included several opera specials and documentary series including Great Little Trains of Wales and The Dragon Has Two Tongues. In Wales, there was an additional requirement to provide a quota of television programmes in the Welsh language. HTV Cymru's nightly news programme Y Dydd aired each weeknight in a 6pm timeslot shared with its English counterpart Report Wales. Alongside current affairs, features and entertainment programming, the company pioneered a wide range of Welsh output for children and young people including Miri Mawr, Ffalabalam and pop magazine show Ser. Two of the company's best known Welsh language series, Cefn Gwlad and Sion a Sian, continue to air on S4C. HTV West was particularly successful in producing high quality children's TV series, often sold internationally. It established the 'HTV Junior Drama Workshop' in Bristol, which auditioned and trained young actors and from which it cast roles for both its own productions, and other companies seeking young talent. Arthur of the Britons (a historic adventure series), Children of the Stones (a supernatural thriller shot amid the famous stone circle at Avebury in Wiltshire) and Robin of Sherwood were all very popular wherever they were shown. In addition to networked and locally produced programming, HTV also broadcast imported output and was the first British broadcaster to air Sesame Street as part of an IBA pilot in 1971 (the programme had been rejected by the BBC). HTV Wales produced far less drama output, though they were contracted to make the ten-part Return to Treasure Island for The Disney Channel in 1985. In 1982, the new Welsh language channel S4C was launched and the increased need for programmes in the medium of Welsh encouraged an expansion of HTV's resources. HTV also began to supply local commercial playout for both S4C and the new Channel 4, which at that time, carried regional advertising in the West. The Pontcanna premises could not be expanded sufficiently to accommodate the increased studio production and so a new studio complex was constructed at Culverhouse Cross on the western outskirts of Cardiff, eventually going live in 1984. Further technical innovation was implemented in 1988 when HTV opened a new Presentation facility at Culverhouse Cross, becoming the first UK broadcaster to install Sony Library Management Systems which allowed the automated playout of cassette tapes. Three LMS machines were installed, one each to play transmission tapes into the Wales and West services, with the third used for commercials playout and compilation for S4C and Channel 4. HTV also launched a new Night Club service on Monday 22 August 1988, when the station began 24-hour broadcasting at this time. In May 1990, HTV acquired the UK branch of Vestron Video International, and renamed them to First Independent Films. First Independent Films was a British film distributor and home video company that replaced Vestron Video International's UK operations. Due to delays in signing its licence agreement in the franchise renewals of 1991, Westcountry Television contracted with HTV to provide its Presentation operations and this service made use of the third LMS machine, fitted with updated VTRs. The service launched on New Year's Day 1993. During the same 1991 ITV franchise round, the ITC had initially considered disqualifying HTV's bid because of its business plan, but it was ultimately allowed to proceed. HTV won with a bid of ¬£20.5 million, beating three other companies ‚Äì Merlin, C3WW and C3W. Due to the size of the bid for the franchise, the company had to make considerable savings in order to cover the increased cost of the licence. The company made a ¬£5 million loss for the first six months of its licence in 1993, following a cut in the levy paid to the Government. Draconian cost-cutting measures took effect ‚Äì including a wage freeze, the cancellation of annual bonus payments and further substantial job cuts, beyond the job cuts which had already halved staff numbers to 460. The station also revamped its on-screen image, replacing the long-serving Aerial logo and phasing out the use of in-vision continuity. In 1994, HTV finally cleared its ¬£19 million debt when Flextech brought a 20% stake in the company for ¬£27 million Guardian Friday, 18 February 1994 Page17 \\"HTV's Chance to go global\\" by Lise Buckingham Flextech passed on its 20% stake in HTV to Scottish Television in September 1995 as part of its deal to gain a larger stake in Scottish Television. The deal heightened speculation of a potential merger between HTV and STV, which never materialised. In October 1996, United News and Media agreed to buy Scottish Television's 20% stake in the company,Hollick secures a stake in HTV as fight for franchises hots up, The Independent, 25 October 1995 ending Carlton's interest about a buyout.

Eric Reguly. The Times (London, England), Saturday, 28 June 1997; pg. 27 United News & Media put the HTV-owned First Independent Films up for sale in 1997, following the commercial failure of the movie G.I. Jane in the UK. The assets were eventually acquired by Columbia TriStar Home Video who retained the First Independent Films label for 2 more years before fully absorbing it into their own label in 1999. In 2000, Granada plc bought United's television interests, but at the time competition regulations limited the extent to which one company could control the ITV network, and were consequently forced to give up one of its ITV franchises. This resulted in a break-up of HTV, whereby its broadcast facilities and Channel 3 broadcast licence (and hence its advertising revenues) were sold to Carlton Communications plc, owners of Carlton Television, whilst the majority of production facilities were retained by Granada. Unlike Carlton's other ITV acquisitions, which were re-branded to use the Carlton name on screen, HTV's identity was retained on-air until 27 October 2002 when the 'ITV1' brand was introduced to most of the network. Granada and Carlton were subsequently permitted to merge in 2004 to form the single company ITV plc, which now owns all of the ITV franchises in England and Wales. HTV Ltd was renamed ITV Wales & West Ltd on 29 December 2006, alongside HTV Group Ltd, which was renamed ITV Wales & West Group Ltd. On 11 December 2008, the broadcast licence was transferred from ITV Wales & West Group Ltd to ITV Broadcasting Limited, the company now responsible for all regional franchises in England, Wales, southern Scotland. In 2009, as part of plans to reduce ITV's regional news service to save costs, ITV West's regional news service was merged with that of ITV Westcountry to form ITV West Country. The new programme, ITV News West Country is broadcast from Bristol. Studios The previous Television Centre, Culverhouse Cross, Cardiff The company originally operated production studios at Pontcanna in Cardiff and at Bath Road in Bristol. Presentation, transmission and back-office staff for both Wales and the West were based largely in Cardiff. The Pontcanna studios remained open until around 1990, by which time, only HTV Wales' news department was based there. During the 1970s and 1980s, the company also ran a North Wales production studio at Theatr Clwyd in Mold. In 1984, HTV opened a new ¬£14 million television centre at Culverhouse Cross, Cardiff to replace the original one at Pontcanna. Transmission continued to originate from Pontcanna until 1988, when this transferred to the new centre. In addition to providing playout for both HTV services, the new centre would, from 1 January 1993, also provide transmission of South West England franchise Westcountry Television. The property eventually passed to United Business Media (then United News and Media) following the takeover of HTV by the group in 1997. However, while HTV changed hands twice more, UBM continued to own the Culverhouse Cross buildings and associated land. ITV plc acquired the site on 10 April 2006 for ¬£18.7m, and sought to redevelop the property. The largest production studio at Culverhouse Cross had been leased to third party operators since the early 1990s. In an interview with the Western Mail, the head of news and programmes, Phil Henfrey, confirmed ITV Wales would decide whether to stay at the site or re-locate to new, smaller premises in another part of Cardiff. In August 2013, ITV Wales announced it would leave Culverhouse Cross by June 2014 and move into a new facility on the ground floor of 3 Assembly Square, located next to the Welsh Assembly in Cardiff Bay. Broadcasting from the new studios began on Monday 30 June 2014. The ground, on which Culverhouse Cross Television Centre was located, was sold to Bellway and entirely redeveloped as St Lythans Park, a small housing estate. In Bristol, HTV were based at Television Centre in Bath Road near Arno's Vale, Bristol, which they took over from TWW. ITV plc continue to have operations in the city and today, the Bristol headquarters are home to ITV West Country's news programme ITV News West Country. ITV have however since sold the building to Cube Real Estate, a commercial property developer, which has refurbished the interior of the building. While ITV West Country maintains office space and a single ground floor studio, the other floors are available to rent as office space. The property is marketed as 'Bath Road Studios'. Transmitters The Wales and West franchise area operated by TWW was originally confined to the West (comprising Bristol, Somerset, Wiltshire and parts of Gloucestershire and Dorset) and south east Wales (broadly as far west as Swansea) and served by a single main VHF transmitter located at St Hilary. TWW later acquired the use of VHF transmitters covering much of the remainder of Wales from WWN (Wales West and North). An additional VHF transmitter (channel 7) was eventually installed at St Hilary in 1965 to carry programmes specifically for Wales, allowing the separation of Wales and West services. However, St Hilary was never used as part of the replacement UHF network and TV transmission from it ceased when VHF services were switched off in 1985. The mast continues to be used for communications and radio broadcasting. The UHF transmitter network was designed to replicate the separation of programme services to Wales and the West achieved with the VHF network it replaced. HTV's UHF services were transmitted by the following main transmitters and their relays: Llanddona, Moel-y-Parc, Long Mountain, Blaenplwyf, Preseli, Carmel, Kilvey*, Pontypool*, Wenvoe and Mendip, with Mendip serving the HTV West region and the rest serving the HTV Wales region. (Kilvey and Pontypool were classed as 'relays' prior to Digital transmission as they were not 'line-fed'). Prior to digital broadcasting, the transmitter distribution system continued to permit the sub- grouping of west and north Wales, echoing the historic VHF regional configuration. However, it was not particularly useful for programme purposes but sometimes exploited for the transmission commercials. The transmitter network has remained substantially the same for Digital broadcasting of ITV Cymru Wales and ITV West. Identity Harlech's first ident on 20 May 1968 featured two words 'Harlech' spinning in opposite ways and which eventually met up to form one word. This design would have been clearly seen to viewers of the service then, however viewers today would have encountered lots of black lines and a barely noticeable 'Harlech'. This is due to the fact that the ident was designed for 405-line television system used at the time, and due to the use of 625-line UHF system, the ident appears differently on sets that receive the 625-line transmission. Features videos of HTV's idents. HTV logo used from 6 April 1970 to 27 September 1987 When colour broadcasting commenced on 6 April 1970, a new logo was unveiled. Due to criticism from viewers in the West of England, concerning the bias towards Wales that Harlech presented, the new logo featured the letters 'HTV'. The symbol created, named \\"The Aerial\\", featured the letters HTV in such a way that it looks like a television aerial ‚Äì the logo went on to become HTV's longest serving identity, surviving until December 1992. The aerial would animate on through use of lines, accompanied by the same jingle as used before. The white logo on blue background was seen plain when both Wales and the West received the programme, but would otherwise have the region name included. For the West region, this was 'West' at the top of the logo between the 'H' and 'V', Contains videos of the regional idents for the west. whereas for Wales, the caption Cymru Wales was placed at the bottom of the logo, as a reference that Welsh programming was still shown on the channel. Contains videos of the regional variations for Wales. Following the launch of S4C on 1 November 1982, all Welsh language programming was transferred to the new service, and the Wales ident was amended so that only the 'Wales' part was displayed at the top of the logo. These idents continued until 28 September 1987, when the idents were dropped in favour of an updated computer generated sequence, where the blocks flew out of a large suspended blue surface and landed to form the HTV aerial logo on a dark blue background. HTV adopted the first ITV generic look on 1 September 1989, and it was their slanted 'H; that appeared in their regional section of the ITV logo. Despite the video sequence being the same, there were three variations of the ident, all featuring a different lower caption; HTV, HTV Wales and HTV West. In addition, HTV also made their own variation where the HTV logo remained on-screen the whole time. The corporate idents were dropped on Thursday 31 December 1992. HTV logo used from 1 January 1993 until 27 October 2002, and for a further two years for news programming In their place, a new HTV logo was designed and unveiled on Friday 1 January 1993, featuring an upright, but stylised HTV, with two triangles for the 'V' section. Originally this logo was seen as a translucent blue logo moving back onto a multi-coloured blue background accompanied by an ambient tune. This was later changed to a more upbeat tune, ending in a more noticeable crescendo. This ident package marked the end of specific idents for Wales and the West, as all of the idents that followed used the single HTV brand, though separate continuity for the two services, albeit now out of vision, was retained, this presentation package remained popular until 1 January 1995. On Monday 2 January 1995, the ident was re-altered to include small triangles which grew and combined to form the triangular 'V' and the remainder of the HTV logo. The accompanying music was stronger than its predecessor, and the colours were warmer than previous, with a gold HTV and a changing blue, green background and remained on screen for four years until 7 March 1999. Around this time, a large number of specialised idents were introduced ‚Äì such as variations on the main sequence, specific genre idents and a special presentation package to mark HTV's 30th anniversary in 1998. On Monday 8 March 1999, HTV introduced what would be its last in-house presentation package, featuring the camera panning over the HTV logo in dark blue against a bright yellow background and accompanied by two remixes to its predecessor (although the tune from the previous ident was used on some occasions). Nine months later, HTV, as part of UNM, adopted the second ITV generic look based on the theme of 'Hearts'. However, when UNM was merged into Granada, the broadcasting arm of HTV was sold to Carlton to comply with competition laws. As a result, from 2 July 2001 HTV adopted, in part, Carlton's star branding. The resultant idents featured Carlton's 'Star' opening films, before the screen flashed white, drawing back to become the 'V' in the HTV logo against the spinning hearts background as used previously. When Granada and Carlton introduced national ITV1 branding to all stations in England and Wales on 28 October 2002, the HTV channel identity ceased to be used for presentation. It was replaced by the on-screen name ITV1 Wales and ITV1 West of England. ITV1 Wales still used a variation of the generic theme, with the name Wales consistently present under the ITV1 logo. ITV1 West of England's regional identity was gradually phased out from 2002 onward. Originally, prior to regional programming, an ident featuring the celebrity package was used, with an ITV1 logo placed above a small West of England caption to the left of the screen. In 2004, the regional idents changed to four coloured cubes are seen dotted around a regional scene, with an ITV1 logo and ITV1 for the West of England caption in the bottom right corner. This was replaced in October 2004 by a national ident, consisting of three small ITV cubes above a large '1' cube, with the caption West below. This was one of the last idents for ITV West, as regional idents were abandoned soon after, with the exception of Wales. The HTV brand was retained for local News programmes until Granada and Carlton merged on 2 February 2004 to create ITV plc. The Carlton name appeared on endboards from 2001 until 2004, when it was replaced by a generic ITV Wales or ITV West endboard. Contains the regional idents used in 2002, and clips of HTV news and its replacement. Contains videos of ITV Wales presentation and the HTV news and replacement.

Wolf attended gymnasiums at Eisenach and at Gotha, where he became a choir prefect. It was in Gotha that Wolf first heard the music of Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach and Carl Heinrich Graun; he was particularly fascinated with Bach's work. The admiration was mutual: a performance of some of Wolf's compositions in 1752 drew praise from Bach. Wolf and Bach's friendship lasted throughout their lives; Wolf helped collect subscriptions for Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach's f√ºr Kenner und Liebhaber (for Connoisseurs and Amateurs) works (piano sonatas and rondos).Daub, Peggy; in Stauffer, George, ed. (1996) . (article: The Publication Process and Audience for C. P. E. Bach's Sonaten f√ºr Kennen und Liebhaber) University of Nebraska Press. page 60. . Following his brother's advice, in 1755 Wolf entered the University of Jena. There he became the director of the collegium musicum, for which he composed a number of works. After three years he moved to Leipzig in 1758, and then to Naumburg, where he worked as music teacher for the von Ponickau family. Wolf later decided to journey to Italy, but ended up settling in Weimar, where he spent the rest of his life. He first worked as music teacher to Duchess Anna Amalia's sons, then became court Konzertmeister (1761), organist (1763) and finally Kapellmeister (1772). In 1770 Wolf married Maria Carolina Benda (1742‚Äì1820), daughter of the famous Bohemian violinist and composer Franz Benda. At one point an offer was made to Wolf by Frederick II of Prussia to succeed Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach, but Wolf declined, possibly at Anna Amalia's instigation. In his later years Wolf's activity slowed down, and he became increasingly depressed. After a stroke, Wolf's health started deteriorating, and he died in late 1792. Wolf's reputation during his lifetime was very high already from the earliest years, when he was a child prodigy. It further increased after his sojourns in Gotha, Jena, and Leipzig, partly through the efforts of Johann Friedrich Doles, the most important practitioner of Protestant church music in late 18th-century Germany, and Johann Adam Hiller, composer and writer on music. Wolf's music was known far beyond Weimar and his writings were acclaimed by experts (even though Wolf wrote primarily for amateurs). Works The most important part of Wolf's surviving oeuvre is his instrumental music. He composed at least thirty-five symphonies, of which twenty-six survive, some twenty-five harpsichord/piano concertos, more than 60 keyboard sonatas, and numerous chamber works, including string quartets, piano quintets, and other music. Stylistically these works are close to those of the composers of the Mannheim school. Particularly interesting are the harpsichord sonatas, which reflect the influence of C.P.E. Bach, and generally use more forward-looking structures. Like Bach and older masters, Wolf advocated studying counterpoint, and recommended Johann Sebastian Bach's preludes and fugues to his students; however, his views went out of fashion in the late 18th century. Wolf also produced a great number of stage and sacred works. For the Weimar court, he composed some 20 Singspiele, influenced by Johann Adam Hiller's style. Although these works are not as advanced as his instrumental music, some include very progressive passages in the vein of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. Wolf's sacred music shows the influence of C.P.E. Bach and Carl Heinrich Graun.

Despite having an active fighter career of only five months, he reached the rank of captain and won two British military decorations. Early life Thompson was born to Samuel Whitell Thompson, a medical practitioner, and his wife Florence Augusta Jane (n√©e Evans) in Bow, London in 1890. In the 1911 census the family were resident in Blackheath, and the 20-year-old Thompson was studying to become a civil engineer. Military service Thompson was commissioned as a temporary second lieutenant in the Army Service Corps on 22 March 1915, and was promoted to lieutenant on 25 August 1915. On 7 June 1917 Thompson was transferred to the General List to serve in the Royal Flying Corps, and appointed a flying officer. After joining No. 20 Squadron in late 1917, Thompson's career started somewhat awkwardly, as he crashed his aircraft on 27 October, after which he was transferred to No. 22 Squadron. Flying the Bristol F.2b, he scored his first victory, an Albatros D.V, east of Merville, France on 22 April 1918. An extremely aggressive pilot, in May 1918 he scored nine victories, including three Pfalz D.III aircraft around 10 a.m. on 16 May, near Douai. Also notable was his downing of two more D.IIIs on 21 May, south-west of Vitry-en-Artois. June 1918 was also fruitful for Thompson, as he scored eight victories mostly in the aircraft C929 (a Bristol F.2b). At Erquinghem- le-Sec on 1 June, he downed an Albatros C.III in addition to an Albatros D.V, and the next day (2 June) he got another two victories near Lens, Pas-de- Calais, this time two Pfalz D.IIIs. He scored only one victory in July, a Fokker Dr.I near Laventie on 26 July. In August he scored a further six victories at Dechy, the road connecting Arras and Cambrai, Douai and Senlemont. He shot down, amongst others, three Fokker D.VII aircraft. He was appointed a flight commander with the temporary rank of captain on 24 August 1918. September started off well for Thompson, with four victories against Fokker D.VIIs up until 24 September. He was awarded the Military Cross on 16 September. On 27 September 1918, in aircraft E2243, he downed a Halberstadt C north of Noyelles, before being shot down east of Cambrai by Oberleutnant Otto Schmidt of Jasta 5. Thompson was posthumously awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross on 2 November. Having no known grave, he is commemorated on the Arras Flying Services Memorial. Observers Thompson claimed at least 18 of his victories with the front gun, the rest being claimed by his gunners. He flew with Lieutenant Charles George Gass, the highest-scoring observer ace during the war, for two of his victories, on 22 April and 26 July 1918, as well as with Sergeant L. Kendrick for two victories in May 1918. The observer on his final flight was Second Lieutenant Clifford Tolman, an 'ace' with 8 victories, who was also killed in the crash. However, for most of his time of service he flew with Observer Sergeant Ronald Malcolm Fletcher DFM, who recorded 26 victories during the war, and was crewed with Thompson on no fewer than 25 of the pilot's 30 victories, claiming at least six victories in his own right.

On August 23, 2008, she and members of her entourage were kidnapped by Islamist insurgents in southern Somalia. She was released 15 months later on November 25, 2009, and has since embarked on a philanthropic career. In 2013, she released the book, A House in the Sky: A Memoir, in which she recounts her early life, travels as a young adult, and hostage experience. In 2014, the book was optioned to become a major motion picture by Megan Ellison, with Rooney Mara playing the role of Lindhout. Early life Lindhout was born in 1981 in Red Deer, Alberta, Canada. After her parents separated, Lindhout lived in Sylvan Lake, Alberta. She and her two brothers (Mark and Nathaniel) were raised by their mother, Lorinda, with Amanda spending much of her youth reading National Geographic Magazine. Lindhout's father had chronic health problems, and depended on disability payments. Her mother held a minimum-wage job. Lindhout had early aspirations to become a model and did some brief modelling work. She also considered enrolling in a beautician's school. Journalism career =Press TV= At the age of 24, Lindhout quit her job as a cocktail waitress to become a journalist. She used her salary from the bar where she worked to finance reporting trips to various conflict zones around the world. Lindhout began her new journalism career in Afghanistan, arriving in the capital Kabul in May 2007. She later moved on to an assignment in Baghdad, Iraq in January 2008, where she worked on a freelance basis for Iran's state television Press TV. This led some Canadian reporters to criticize her, due to Press TV's reputation for producing state propaganda. While in Iraq, reports indicated that Lindhout had been kidnapped in Sadr City. She was said to have been released several hours later, after paying a ransom to her abductors. However, Lindhout in her book denied having been kidnapped in Iraq. She wrote that she was instead taken to the Sadr Party Headquarters and questioned about her political affiliations, and that she was able to call an Iraqi friend who ensured they were released within the hour. =Abduction= At the time of Lindhout's abduction in Somalia, she was reportedly not affiliated with any news organization other than Alberta's Red Deer Advocate. She wrote a column for the small daily. Several media reports suggested that Lindhout was in Somalia on assignment for France 24. However, Nathalie Lenfant, a spokesman for the organization, indicated that Lindhout had sent only a few reports to the news agency from Iraq. Lenfant also stated that France 24 had declined two proposals by Lindhout to serve as a correspondent for the organization in Iraq and Somalia, respectively. According to Lenfant, the news agency later decided to confirm that Lindhout was on a freelance assignment for it because France 24 representatives \\"thought it would be better if she could be seen to be part of the structure of a larger company\\". On August 23, 2008, two days after having arrived in Mogadishu, Amanda Lindhout and Nigel Brennan, a 37-year-old freelance Australian photojournalist from Brisbane, were kidnapped along with their Somali translator, Abdifatah Mohammed Elmi, their driver, Mahad Isse, and a driver from the Shamo Hotel, Marwali. They were on their way to conduct interviews at an internally displaced person (IDP) camp when they were stopped by gunmen. The abductors were teenage insurgents from the Hizbul Islam fundamentalist group. The two were kidnapped in lieu of two more experienced journalists (one of whom was National Geographic Magazine reporter Robert Draper), who had that morning beefed up their security before leaving to examine a refugee camp. Because of this move, Lindhout and Brennan were kidnapped instead. While in captivity, Lindhout was separated from Brennan and subsequently raped and tortured repeatedly. On September 17, Al Jazeera featured footage of Lindhout and Brennan in captivity surrounded by gunmen. On October 13, 2008, the kidnappers demanded a ransom of US$2.5 million by October 28. On February 23, 2009, the Canadian Association of Journalists urged Prime Minister Stephen Harper to help secure the release of Lindhout and Khadija Abdul Qahaar, a Canadian woman who was kidnapped in November. Elmi and the two drivers were released on January 15, 2009. The kidnappers later lowered the ransom demand to $1 million. On June 10, 2009, CTV News received a phone call from a tearful Lindhout who seemed to be reading a statement: \\"My name is Amanda Lindhout and I am a Canadian citizen and I've been held hostage by gunmen in Somalia for nearly 10 months. I'm in a desperate situation. I'm being kept in a dark, windowless, room in chains without any clean drinking water and little or no food. I've been very sick for months without any medicine.... I love my country and want to live to see it again. Without food or medicine, I will die here.\\" On November 25, 2009, after 460 days as a hostage, Lindhout and Brennan were released following a ransom payment made by their families through a private firm that specializes in kidnappings and ransom payments. She was hospitalized in Nairobi for two weeks and treated for acute malnourishment. Following her release, Lindhout said she found the coverage of her hostage experience to be sensational. In September 2013, Tina Brown of the Daily Beast was accused of falsely printing stories about Lindhout during her captivity, including an incorrect story about an alleged Lindhout pregnancy that never took place. A resulting retraction was printed by National Public Radio in response to Brown's comments. On June 12, 2015, the RCMP announced the arrest of Ali Omar Ader, in Ottawa, describing him as the \\"main negotiator\\" in the hostage-taking of Lindhout and Nigel Brennan. On June 18, 2018, Ader was sentenced to 15 years in prison for the kidnapping. Memoir In 2013, Lindhout released a memoir, co-written with journalist Sara Corbett, titled A House in the Sky recounting her experience as a hostage. She indicated in the book that her motive for travelling to Somalia in the midst of an insurgency was the dearth of competition from other journalists covering the region, as well as the possibility of documenting unique human interest stories. Once held hostage, she alleged that she and Brennan were forcibly separated since they were not married, and that she was subsequently repeatedly tortured and raped by her teenage captors. Lindhout asserted that she and Brennan had converted to Islam to both appease their abductors and make life easier for themselves. While it has been reported that Lindhout had given birth to a boy named Osama while in captivity, she dismissed such rumours as \\"gossip, one of dozens of unconfirmed stories that had floated out of Somalia since our capture ... Somalia seemed to be a factory for rumors, with a handful of news websites and uncredentialed bloggers pumping out what passed for information.\\" Chris Selley of The National Post wrote that the book was \\"bloody good journalism\\". Eliza Griswold of The New York Times said of the book that, \\"Her tale, exquisitely told with her co-author, Sara Corbett, a contributing writer for The New York Times Magazine, is much more than a gonzo adventure tale gone awry ‚Äì it's a young woman's harrowing coming-of-age story and an extraordinary narrative of forgiveness and spiritual triumph.\\" The USA Today wrote about her experience that, \\"The wide-eyed optimism and unflappable determination that led her to danger also kept her alive. In the months she lived in darkness and in chains, she held onto her sanity by escaping to memories of her world travels, picturing the vivid images in the old issues of National Geographic she found while dumpster-diving as a child.\\" The book became a The New York Times bestseller, and was named one of The Globe Books 100: Best Canadian non- fiction by The Globe and Mail. It was also named the 2013 Best Book of the Year in the Biographies & Memoirs category by Amazon.com, in addition to the Best Books of the Year list published by Vogue Magazine. O Magazine listed the book as one of its recommendations on its Winter 2014 reading list. It was also the winner of the 2014 CBC Bookie Award for Best Canadian Nonfiction. The book received criticism from some journalists. Some of Lindhout's retelling of events contradict those found in the earlier published memoir of her co- captive, Nigel Brennan. On June 25, 2014, the memoir was optioned by Annapurna Pictures in order to create a screen-adaptation of the book. The project's producers were set to be Annapurna founder Megan Ellison, and Rooney Mara, who was also set to play the role of Lindhout in the film. Humanitarian career =Speaking engagements= Amanda Lindhout at a speaking engagement. In 2010 Lindhout addressed the United Nations Association in Ottawa about women's rights. In July 2010 Google Ideas had Lindhout moderate a panel of former violent extremists at the Summit Against Violent Extremism in Dublin, Ireland. The event was the largest gathering of former violent extremists ever to take place and was organized by Google, the Council of Foreign Relations and the Tribeca Film Festival. Lindhout moderated a panel which included a former Somali militant with Al-Shabaab, Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed. She asked Mohamed how he justified the injuries and deaths to civilians while a member of the insurgent group, but he instead addressed the political motives that drove him to join the outfit. At the 2013 One Billion Rising event in Calgary, Lindhout spoke for the first time in frank terms about her victimization in Somalia at the hands of her teenage captors. The speech was part of V-Day, a global activist movement to halt gender-based violence. One Billion Rising is an international campaign to end violence against women. She also spoke at the We-day event in Winnipeg later that year. =The Global Enrichment Foundation= In 2010, Lindhout founded the Global Enrichment Foundation to create more opportunities in Somalia by offering university scholarships to women. Lindhout currently serves as the organization's Executive Director, with Ahmed Hussen, the president of the Canadian Somali Congress, acting as the Fund's co-director. Aurala Warsame, a Somali researcher at the University of Alberta in Edmonton, supervises the program and vetted the first applicants. In response to why she established the Foundation despite her kidnapping, Lindhout told the CBC's The National \\"You can very easily go into anger and bitterness and revenge thoughts and resentment and 'Why me?' ... Because I had something very, very large and very painful to forgive, and by choosing to do that, I was able to put into place my vision, which was making Somalia a better place ... I've never questioned whether or not it was the right thing to do ... What else to do after the experience that I had, than something like this?\\" In conjunction with various private university institutions across Somalia, the GEF's Somali Women's Scholarship Program (SWSP) offers higher education opportunities to women in Somalia on a contribution basis. Lindhout's foundation aims to annually send 100 women in the country to university for the next four years, and is sponsoring tertiary education for 36 women, who are expected to go on to become teachers, doctors, environmentalists and engineers, among other professions. The GEF also started the SHE WILL micro-loan initiative to financially empower widows and other Somali women. In response to the 2011 drought in East Africa, the GEF put into motion its Convoy for Hope program. The initiative received a US$1 million donation from the Chobani Yoghurt company. As part of the GEF, teachers with the Memorial Composite also raised funds to sponsor the Sankaroos women's basketball team of Abaarso School in Somalia, and a group of high school students in Alberta raised over $23,000 to support the GEF's educational work. =Return to Africa= Lindhout's work for the Global Enrichment Foundation eventually drew her back to Somalia in July 2011. Accompanied by CBC's The National, who filmed a documentary about her titled Return To Africa, Lindhout visited the Dadaab refugee complex in Kenya to research a $60-million educational project for children in the camp, many of whom fled the conflict in southern Somalia. Lindhout attempted to reconcile her fear of abduction with her deep commitment to helping the asylum seekers. However, her efforts were criticized by Badu Katelo, Kenya's commissioner for refugees, who suggested that the best solution to the issue was through military intervention in Somalia's conflict zones. Katelo characterized Lindhout's initiative as \\"small ... It's a drop in the ocean. It's not anything to rely on to bring peace to Somalia. I think if education was to bring peace in Somalia, then it should've happened a long time ago because in 1991, when refugees came here, they were all educated\\". Lindhout responded that \\"to anyone who's questioning us right now, that's fine ... That's fair. It is an incredibly challenging environment to work in, but time will tell the story.\\" On August 4, 2011, Lindhout travelled back to Somalia for the first time since her captivity. Leading a large convoy carrying food aid for 14,000 people in the southern Somalia town of Dobley, she was welcomed by Somalia's Transitional Federal Government. Lindhout described the trip as also \\"an opportunity for me to look at that fear and maybe let it go ‚Äì this fear that I have been carrying around with me for some time\\". Her Convoys For Hope project continued to provide relief and expects to assist 300,000 more people during the drought. Awards and honours On February 23, 2010, Alberta MLA Manmeet Bhullar spoke of Lindhout's release on the floor of the Alberta Legislature, stating that there was no honour or medal prestigious enough to reward Lindhout for putting her life in danger to help others and for recognizing that her captors were themselves in need of assistance. In June 2012, Lindhout received the Red Deer Women of Excellence Award in Human Services from the Red Deer & District Community Foundation. In March 2012, she spoke at the annual Clinton Global Initiative about her humanitarian work in the Horn of Africa with the Global Enrichment Foundation. Lindhout was awarded a Doctor of Laws, honouris causa, from the University of Lethbridge on May 30, 2014. The institution's Chancellor Shirley McClellan described Lindhout's story as \\"one of incredible perseverance and compassion,\\" and expressed admiration for Lindhout for using her hostage experience as an impetus to effect change.

The newspaper was founded in 1924 by Heriberto Deandar Amador, it is Nuevo Laredo's oldest newspaper currently still published. El Ma√±ana uses the slogan \\"La verdad sin fronteras\\" (\\"The truth without boundaries\\"). El Ma√±ana is also circulated in Laredo, Texas, United States.El Ma√±ana (Spanish) Drug cartel attacks On 19 March 2004, the journalist Roberto Javier Mora Garc√≠a was stabbed 29 times outside his home in Nuevo Laredo. On 6 February 2006, two armed men broke into the offices of El Ma√±ana and detonated a grenade. They also shot the outside walls of the installation with AK-47s and AR-15s before fleeing the scene. According to La Jornada, the armed men shot the installation more than 100 times, injuring Jaime Orozco Tey, a journalist. On 30 July 2010, a group of armed men in a vehicle threw a grenade at the offices of Televisa in Nuevo Laredo, damaging two vehicles. On 26 September 2011, Elizabeth Macias-Castro, an editor of la Primera Hora newspaper, was decapitated; a note was left behind by Los Zetas, claiming responsibility for the killing. A group of armed men attacked the offices of El Ma√±ana newspaper in Nuevo Laredo at around 23:00 hours on 11 May 2012. The Mexican authorities stated that no one was injured in the 5-minute shootout, but the offices and some vehicles were damaged when bullets impacted from the outside. When the employees of El Ma√±ana heard the detonations, they threw themselves on the floor, while others suffered nervous breakdowns. Some witnesses said that they heard grenade explosions during the attack. In addition, a message was reportedly left behind by the perpetrators. Due to the violent attacks the press has received in Nuevo Laredo, news media have practiced \\"self-censorship,\\" where local journalist prefer to silence the press and refuse to report on important incidents for fears of reprisals by the cartels. Events that would go on the front-page of any newspaper‚Äîmass murders with over six dead, shooting incidents wounding three soldiers‚Äîoften go unreported in Nuevo Laredo. The cartels want the cities they control to appear calm in order to prevent the government from sending federal troops. Consequently, the press, tired of extortions and death threats, prefers to silence because there is no guarantee for their safety. On 14 May 2012, El Ma√±ana declared that it will no longer report on news relating to drug- violence. On 14 May 2013, the newspaper suffered a cyber-attack on its official website. According to El Ma√±ana, the attacks are intended to saturate the page and damage information databases of the newspaper, particularly in columns where they question the performance of local officials. The Laredo Sun El Ma√±ana also heads an online English-language news site called Laredo Sun. A printed newspaper with the same name was launched in Laredo in 1999 but failed to compete with Laredo's main newspaper, the Laredo Morning Times, and fell out of print almost immediately. The Laredo Sun now operates solely online as an English-language news source for readers in Laredo, Texas, and the surrounding community. Rio Magazine Rio is a young and fresh English- language biweekly magazine covering events, news, nightlife, culture and exclusive interviews in Laredo, Texas. Started in 2005 as part of the official newspaper package, the magazine is run by El Ma√±ana de Nuevo Laredo. Charged with revamping and growing the magazine, a new editor, Rafael Benavides, changed the magazine from a Spanish-language black and white magazine with a small and established demographic in Nuevo Laredo, to a full-color English- language magazine in 2010 for readers and audiences in Laredo, Texas. The magazine was El Ma√±ana's first successful English-language product. Femina Magazine Femina is a Spanish-language biweekly women's magazine in Nuevo Laredo, Tamaulipas, and Laredo, Texas.

It first appeared in the May 17, 1947 issue of The New Yorker, and was later collected in The Enormous Radio and Other Stories, 55 Short Stories from the New Yorker, and The Stories of John Cheever. The story describes a strange new radio that allows its owners to listen in on conversations of other tenants in their apartment building. Plot Jim and Irene Westcott live contentedly on the 12th floor in an apartment building with their two children near Sutton Place (their city of residence is not mentioned, but Sutton Place is in New York City). They both love to listen to music, regularly attending concerts and spending time listening to music on their radio. When their radio breaks down, Jim orders a new one, but when it arrives Irene is shocked at its complete and utter ugliness. It is a large gumwood cabinet with numerous dials and switches that light up with a green light when it is plugged in. Until the new radio arrived, the Westcotts hardly ever argued and seemed to have a happy marriage. As Irene listens to music on the radio one evening, she hears interference in the form of a rustling noise over the music. She tries to get the music back by flipping switches and dials, but begins to hear the sounds of people from other apartments in the building. She is so surprised by this that she shuts off the radio. When Jim arrives home, he also tries the radio to get some music, but instead hears elevator noises and doorbells. Believing that the electronics in the building are interfering with the signal he turns the radio off, and determines to call the people who sold it to him and demand to have the radio repaired. The radio is examined and the problem apparently fixed, but the next day while Irene is listening to a Chopin prelude she hears a man and woman who seem to be arguing. Realizing that the conversation is coming from people who live in a nearby apartment, she flicks a switch, but next hears a woman's voice reading a children's story, which she recognizes as belonging to her neighbors' children's nanny. She flips the switch again, but each time she does so she becomes privy to the events in another apartment. Irene demands that Jim turn off the radio because she is afraid her neighbors will hear her and Jim, just as they can hear the others in the building. Over the next few days Irene listens in on the lives of her neighbors, and finds herself becoming both intrigued and horrified. She becomes so obsessed with listening in on her neighbors that she cuts short an outing with a friend, to go home and listen to the radio to hear what news would be revealed next from her neighbors. Jim notices how strange Irene has become in her ways and conversations, especially during a dinner party with friends. On the way home, Irene speaks of the stars like a little candle throwing its beam as to \\"shine a good deed in a naughty world.\\" Irene becomes totally involved in the lives on the radio and becomes depressed herself. She has gone from a pleasant, rather plain woman, to a woman who doubts who she is and doubts her relationship with her husband Jim. Once more, Jim arranges for the radio to be examined and this time the repairs are successful. The repairs are expensive and a great deal more than Jim can afford. All he wanted was for Irene to get some enjoyment from the radio. Instead the radio brings the Westcotts' peaceful life to an end. Analysis According to Alan Lloyd Smith,Smith, Allan Lloyd (2004). \\"American Gothic Fiction: An Introduction\\". New York: Continuum, 2004. Print. a concept of domestic abjection is one that \\"disturbs identity, order, and system\\". This is exactly what the new radio does in the Westcott household. When Mrs. Westcott sees the new radio in the large gumwood cabinet, she does not like its enormousness. The Gumwood cabinet is \\"dark\\" and does not fit in with the living room furnishings and colors that Irene had personally chosen. This cabinet is dark and ugly, bringing darkness into the living room and their lives. Eventually, Irene identifies herself with the object. Another gothic concept in The Enormous Radio is the element of buried secrets. Both Jim and Irene begin to recognize that there is tension in their marriage. Irene has many deep dark secrets that she feels guilty about. She has successfully hidden these secrets all these years until the ugliness of the radio brings up her neighbors' problems. Irene has suppressed and hidden her feelings to others and herself for a long time. This is why she is drawn to the radio; it exposes the inner life of others and eventually hers. Irene identifies with the others in the building as her own problems. It is ironic that the thing purchased to bring joy to the Westcotts' life only causes trouble between them. Secrets revealed are sometimes not handled well. Alan Lloyd Smith also identifies Domestic Gothic asSmith, Alan Lloyd (2004) American Gothic Fiction, p. 102, The Continuum International Publishing Group intimately bound up with the idea of the house, gender, and family, which becomes through metaphor, a way of externalizing the inner life of fictional characters.

Van Zant (born November 24, 1943) is an American architect and Southern Baptist minister who served as a Republican member of the Florida House of Representatives. From 2012 to 2018, Van Zant represented the 19th District, which includes Bradford County, Putnam County, Union County, and southern Clay County. Van Zant previously represented the 21st District from 2008 to 2012. History Van Zant was born in Jacksonville and attended Stetson University before graduating from the University of Florida with a degree in architecture in 1968. Upon graduation, he founded Van Zant Associates, an architecture firm, which he continues to own. Van Zant attended the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, where he received a Master of Divinity degree, and the Western Baptist Theological Seminary, where he received a Doctorate of Theology degree. In addition to working as an architect, he has served as the pastor of multiple churches, included the First Baptist Church of Keystone Heights and Trinity Baptist Church. Van Zant was appointed to the Clay County School Board in 2007 by Governor Charlie Crist, and served as its Vice-Chairman. Florida House of Representatives When incumbent State Representative Joe Pickens was unable to seek re-election due to term limits, Van Zant ran to succeed him in the 21st District, which included a swath of territory in North Florida, specifically, southern Bradford County, southern Clay County, northern Lake County, eastern Marion County, Putnam County, and northwestern Volusia County. In the Republican primary, he emerged narrowly victorious over Christopher France and Patricia Freeman. Van Zant faced Linda Myers, a Putnam County Commissioner and the Democratic nominee, who identified as a conservative Democrat. Groups supporting Myers attacked Van Zant for tax evasion, and group supporting Van Zant attacked Myers for funding a \\"road to nowhere\\" and for tax increases; both candidates rejected each other's claims. Though they agreed on a number of issues, including the need to create jobs, allowing oil drilling off the coast of the state and replacing the Florida Comprehensive Assessment Test, they vehemently disagreed as to which of them was the most qualified to handle the issues of contention. Van Zant narrowly defeated Myers, winning by fewer than 2,000 votes, with 51.5% of the vote to Myers's 48.5%. Though Myers initially announced that she would seek a rematch with Van Zant in 2010, she ultimately declined to contest the seat, and he was re-elected without opposition. When the state legislative districts were redrawn in 2012, Van Zant was moved into the 19th District, which retained the Clay County and Putnam County areas of the district, but added sections in Bradford County and Union County. In both the primary and general elections, Van Zant was elected unopposed. In 2014, Van Zant was re-elected unopposed to his fourth and final term in the House. At a 2014 event held by opponents of the Common Core State Standards Initiative, Van Zant announced that the American Institutes for Research, the group that helped create the tests that would be used in Florida, would be promoting a homosexual lifestyle in children, declaring, \\"These people that will now receive $220 million from the state of Florida unless this is stopped will promote double mindedness in state education, and attract every one of your children to become as homosexual as they possibly can.\\"  Church Activities  Charles currently pastors a small church called, Gospel Lighthouse.

It is a type of captive nut commonly made as a cage nut. Types They come in many forms based upon: where they clip on, shape, and type of thread. Each clip-on nut is designed for only a small range of sheet metal gauges (thicknesses). They are usually made from spring steel. =G-nut= A G-nut, or G-style nut, is shaped like a \\"G\\" and clips to the edge of a sheet metal object. It is different from all of the other types in that it is meant to clip over a small flange on the edge of the sheet metal. The threads are from an integrated nut that has a special boss to sit in a hole in the sheet metal. =J-nut= A J-nut is a nut that clips to the edge of the sheet metal. It is named after the way it is shaped; the thread is on the long side of the \\"J\\". The thread may either be of a speed nut form or have an integrated hex or square nut. Due to the short retaining leg the nut is allowed to float more, which can help with misalignment, but the nut is free to un-clip from the sheet metal as well.McMaster, clip-on-nuts. =S-nut= An S-nut, or S-style nut, is shaped like an \\"S\\". It is designed to clip on the edge of a sheet metal object. The threads are provided by an integrated nut. =Square style= A square style clip-on nut does not clip onto the edge of the sheet metal, but rather the edges of a square hole or slot. It is a square nut that has a sheet metal retainer that protrudes down two sides of the nut. These legs are formed to have lips that grab onto the sheet metal object. Prior to tightening the nut, it can float in the hole or slot, but when the nut is tightened it presses the lips of the retainer out and anchors itself in place. =U-nut= A U-nut is very similar to a J-nut except that both legs are the same length. Because of this a retaining clip is usually formed on the leg without the threads. This helps keep the nut in place while not screwed down. The thread may be of a speed nut style, integrated nut, or have an extruded portion that is tapped. There are \\"standard\\" and \\"wide-panel\\" versions; the standard version has a solid hinge section, whereas the wide-panel version has a longer hinge with the center section cut-away to allow for easier installation.McMaster, p. 3149.

Many of these were political refugees who left behind high paid and respectable jobs. The second, larger wave of Ethiopians to the UK was in 1991, when Ethiopians of all walks of life claimed asylum in the UK. Another civil war 1998 in the country, and continuous political unrest even today means that more and more Ethiopians are leaving their homeland to seek better lives abroad. Prior to the civil wars, Ethiopians were free to come to the UK to study, many of whom stayed and are undoubtedly amongst the thousands who now form an ageing population. The Ethiopian community in the UK is now an extremely well integrated group that consists of many generations. Demographics The 2001 Census recorded 6,561 Ethiopian-born people residing in the UK. According to the 2011 UK Census, there were 15,058 Ethiopian-born residents in England, 151 in Wales, 258 in Scotland, and 27 in Northern Ireland.

History Tobia was born in Honolulu, Hawaii, and moved to the state of Florida in 1990. He attended the University of Florida, where he received both his bachelor's and master's degrees in political science. Following graduation, he began working as a professor at Valencia College, teaching introductory political science courses. Florida House of Representatives When incumbent State Representative Mitch Needelman was unable to seek re-election in 2008 due to term limits, Tobia ran to succeed him in the 31st District, which stretched from Malabar to South Patrick Shores. He faced Jason Steele, Ronald Stump, and Ken Babington in the Republican primary, and emerged narrowly victorious, winning 32% of the vote to Steele's 31%, Stump's 22%, and Babington's 15%, despite facing allegations that he allowed his college students to \\"skip their final exam...if they would volunteer for his campaign\\". He advanced to the general election, where he was elected unopposed. In 2010, he was challenged in the primary by Indialantic City Councilwoman Lori Halbert, who accused him over the course of the campaign of committing acts of vandalism against her, including stealing her campaign signs, trespassing on her property, and flattening the tires of someone parked at her house, charges that Tobia denied. He defeated Halbert by 193 votes, winning 51% of the vote to Halbert's 49%. In the general election, he faced Jodi James, the Democratic nominee. The Orlando Sentinel roundly criticized both candidates, declaring that \\"voters in this Brevard County district deserve better than Republican Rep. John Tobia\\", in part because he made \\"inappropriate comments about women in his lectures.\\" However, James had a prior conviction for drug trafficking, causing them to reluctantly endorse the incumbent for re-election. Tobia defeated James in a landslide, winning 62% of the vote. In 2012, when legislative districts were redrawn, Tobia was drawn into the 53rd District, which included most of the territory that he previously represented. He was challenged in the Republican primary by Tres Holton and Laureen Trent, whom he defeated with 52% of the vote. In the general election, he encountered Democratic nominee John Paul Alvarez. Florida Today endorsed him for re-election, praising his \\"independent streak\\" and his \\"support of education issues,\\" while noting that Alvarez was not as informed on state issues. Tobia narrowly defeated Alvarez on election night, winning 53% of the vote to Alvarez's 47%.

The Ch√¢teau was built in 1815 by the duchesse de Charest, a daughter of Louise Elisabeth de Cro√ø-Havr√©, marquise de Tourzel, the governess of the royal enfants de France of Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette. History The Ch√¢teau was purchased in 1938-39 by the French aesthete Carlos de Beistegui, who enlarged it, with the professional help of Emilio Terry. Cecil Beaton's inspiration for Henry Higgins' library in My Fair Lady was the library at Groussay. Beistegui created new gardens, inspired by the Anglo- Chinese gardens of the 18th century and by an 18th-century copper tent in the royal gardens of Drottningholm Palace in Sweden. They feature a Chinese pagoda, a labyrinth, a theater of verdure, a Tartar tent, and other follies. The Gardens are classified by the French government as one of the Remarkable Gardens of France. After Beistegui's death in 1970, the Ch√¢teau passed to his brother, and then his nephew, who sold it in 1999, realizing $26.5 million for the contents alone, many of which had come from another of Carlos de Beistegui's homes, the Palazzo Labia in Venice.

He was the last private keeper of the Book of Armagh and at the time of his death was President of the Royal Irish Academy. Early life Born at Charleville, County Cork, on 16 March 1815, Reeves was the eldest child of Boles D'Arcy Reeves, an attorney, whose wife Mary was a daughter of Captain Jonathan Bruce Roberts, land agent to the 8th Earl of Cork. This grandfather had fought at the Battle of Bunker's Hill, and Reeves was born at his house in Charleville. From 1823, Reeves was educated at the school of John Browne in Leeson Street, Dublin, and after that at a school kept by Edward Geoghegan. In October 1830, he entered Trinity College Dublin, where he quickly gained a prize for Hebrew and was elected a Scholar in classics in 1833. In his third year, he became a scholar and went on to graduate BA in 1835. He proceeded to read medicine, won the Berkeley Medal, and graduated MB in 1837. His object in taking his second degree was that he intended to become a clergyman and to practice the medical profession among the poor of his parish.(Rev.)

History Wood was born in Lakeland, and attended the University of Florida, though he did not graduate, instead transferring to Columbia University, where he received a degree in economics in 1974. Following that, he attended the Florida State University College of Law, receiving his juris doctor in 1977. Wood moved to Winter Haven, where he worked as an attorney and realtor, and founded John Wood Enterprises. Florida House of Representatives When incumbent State Representative Marty Bowen, was unable to seek re-election in 2008 due to term limits, he ran to succeed her in the 65th District, which included parts of northern Polk County and stretched to the county's border with Osceola County. Wood won the Republican primary unopposed and faced Bob Hagenmaier, the Democratic nominee in the general election. Wood raised significantly more money than did Hagenmaier, who opted to not accept any campaign contributions whatsoever, but only narrowly defeated him by 2,450 votes, winning 52% of the vote to Hagenmaier's 48%. When he ran for re-election in 2008, he only faced independent candidate Joshua Davis. Wood was reluctantly endorsed by The Ledger, which noted that despite his unremarkable voting record, he \\"has the better overview of the legislative landscape.\\" In stark contrast to his narrow win two years prior, Wood defeated Davis comfortably with 67% of the vote. In 2012, when the legislative districts were redrawn, Wood was moved into the 41st District, which contained much of the territory that he had previously represented in the 65th District. Wood was opposed in the Republican primary by Tea Party activist John Lindsey, who argued, \\"John Wood tends to represent the old special interests. He has not passed significant legislation.\\" Lindsey proved no match for Wood, however, who defeated him in a landslide, winning 65% of the vote. Wood then advanced to the general election, where he faced Karen Cooper Welzel, the Democratic nominee. Welzel attacked the incumbent over his support for budget cuts in education, while Wood criticized her for focusing too much on social issues; he argued, \\"To me, the economy is the number one issue.\\" Despite once again significantly outraising his opponent, Wood only narrowly won re-election, defeating Welzel by fewer than 2,000 votes and with 51% of the vote.

This initiative was adopted at the International Conference on Chemicals Management (ICCM), which took place from 4‚Äì6 February 2006 in Dubai gathering Governments and intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations. It defines a policy framework to foster the sound worldwide management of chemicals. This initiative covers risk assessments of chemicals and harmonized labeling up to tackling obsolete and stockpiled products. Are included provisions for national centers aimed at helping in the developing world, train staff in chemical safety as well as dealing with spills and accidents. SAICM is a voluntary agreement. A second International Conference on Chemicals Management -ICCM2- held in May 2009 in Geneva took place in order to enhance synergies and cost effectiveness and to promote SAICM‚Äôs multi- sectorial nature. Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labeling of Chemicals (GHS)[] The ‚ÄúGlobally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals‚Äù (GHS) proposes harmonized hazard communication elements, including labels and safety data sheets. It was adopted by the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) in 2002. This system aims to ensure a better protection of human health and the environment during the handling of chemicals, including their transport and use. The classification of chemicals is done based on their hazard. This harmonization will facilitate trade when implemented entirely. Stockholm Convention - The Stockholm Convention is a global treaty to protect human health and the environment from persistent organic pollutants(POPs). It entered into force, on 17 May 2004, and over 150 countries signed the Convention. In May 2009, nine new chemicals are proposed for listing which then contained 12 substances. Rotterdam Convention ‚Äì The objectives of the Rotterdam Convention are: ‚Ä¢ to promote shared responsibility and cooperative efforts among Parties in the international trade of certain hazardous chemicals in order to protect human health and the environment from potential harm; ‚Ä¢ to contribute to the environmentally sound use of those hazardous chemicals, by facilitating information exchange about their characteristics, by providing for a national decision-making process on their import and export and by disseminating these decisions to Parties. The text of the Convention was adopted on 10 September 1998 by a Conference in Rotterdam, the Netherlands. The Convention entered into force on 24 February 2004. The Convention creates legally binding obligations for the implementation of the Prior Informed Consent (PIC) procedure.

Chemicals are regulated under various laws including the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA). In 2010, Congress was considering a new law entitled the Safe Chemicals Act.Congress proposes toxic chemical regulation reforms. Royal Society of Chemistry. Over the following several years, the Senate considered a number of legislative texts to amend the TSCA. These included the Safer Chemicals Act, several versions of which were introduced by Senator Frank Lautenberg (D-NJ), with the latest in 2013, and the Chemical Safety Improvement Act (S. 1009, CSIA) introduced by Senators Lautenberg and David Vitter (R-LA) in 2013. Senator Lautenberg died shortly after CSIA's introduction, and over time his mantle was picked up by Senator Tom Udall (D-NM), who continued to work with Senator Vitter on revisions to the CSIA. The result of that effort was the Frank R. Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act, passed by the Senate on December 17, 2015. The Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) Modernization Act of 2015 (H.R. 2576), passed the House of Representatives on June 23, 2015.

Provincial Archives of Newfoundland and LabradorThe Newfoundland Royal Naval Reserve was a military reserve force founded in 1900 in what was then the Newfoundland Colony, a part of the British Empire. From 1900 to 1902, approximately 50 members of the reserve trained each winter with the North American and West Indies squadron of the Royal Navy until a steam and sail powered training ship, HMS Calypso, was provided by the United Kingdom in 1902 for local drills before at-sea training with the NA and WI squadron.Mark C. Hunter, To Employ and Uplift Them: The Newfoundland Naval Reserve, 1899-1926 (St. John's, NL: ISER Books, 2009), pp. 33-63 and The reserve had 375 members by late 1903 and then between five and six hundred reservists until the start of World War I, growing to over 1000 in 1915. 1,964 Newfoundlanders served with the Naval Reserve in World War I, suffering 192 fatalities. The Reserve disbanded in 1920-1921. Calypso, having been renamed HMS Briton, was sold as a storage hulk and was burned for salvage near Lewisporte, Newfoundland and Labrador. Establishment of the Reserve The Naval Reserve was established in 1900 with the government paying for the expenses of men who came to St. John's for 28 days of training on board HMS Calypso. The vessel was to have been berthed at Argentia, but Sir Cavendish Boyle, the governor, suggested that most people, crew and citizens alike, would appreciate having the ship docked in St. John's. After their training, the men were to be available for service for five years. Similar Reserves were formed in other countries and colonies of the British Empire. Contributions during World War I A plaque listing the names of the members of the Newfoundland Royal Naval Reserve who died during World War I and have no known grave. When World War I began Walter Edward Davidson, the governor of Newfoundland, committed to increasing the Reserve to 1000 men, and to do so relaxed some of the age and health requirements for joining. In less than a year that number was exceeded. Unlike the Royal Newfoundland Regiment, which served as an intact unit, the men of the Naval Reserve were dispersed throughout the Royal Navy. A list of those who served with the Naval Reserve between 1914 and 1918 is available on-line. The members of the Naval Reserve are represented by a sailor holding a spyglass on the west wing of the Newfoundland National War Memorial in St. John's. Members of the Reserve who died during the war are honoured at the Beaumont-Hamel Newfoundland Memorial in France. Sir Winston Churchill remarked that the Newfoundlanders were \\"the best small boat men in the world\\".

Life and career Smith was born in Hodgdon, Maine. He graduated from Colby College in 1893 and earned a Ph.D. from Johns Hopkins University in 1896. He served as director of United States Geological Survey from 1907 to 1922 and 1923 to 1930.Dobbin, Carroll Edward (1944). George Otis Smith (1871-1944). AAPG Bulletin; May 1944; v. 28; no. 5; p. 683-686. He also served as the first chairman of the Federal Power Commission under Herbert Hoover from 1930 to 1933. Smith died in Augusta, Maine.Staff report (January 10, 1944). Dr. George Otis Smith. Christian Science Monitor =USGS career= c. 1920 Smith was the Geologist-in-charge of the Section of Petrography of the Geologic Branch, succeeded Charles Doolittle Walcott as Director in May 1907 and continued as Director until December 1930. Smith had joined the Survey after receiving his doctorate from Johns Hopkins University in 1896, and he was barely 36 years old when he was appointed Director. His Survey career had not been particularly distinguished, but he had come to the attention of the new Secretary of the Interior, James R. Garfield, in 1906 when Smith had served as chairman of one of the subcommittees of a Presidential commission that sought to put the operation of Government agencies on a modern businesslike basis. Smith was particularly interested in a business policy for the public domain. He also believed that the work of the Survey should be primarily although not exclusively practical. After the great coal strike in 1922, a Coal Commission was established to study the problems of the industry and to aid Congress on legislation that would ensure the Nation of an adequate supply of coal. Director Smith was a member of the Commission, and the Geological Survey's resource data provided the basis for much of the Commission's report. In 1924, Smith unsuccessfully urged resumption of coal research in much the same terms as Walcott had used in 1898. Director Smith also served as Chairman of a three-man commission appointed by President Calvin Coolidge in March 1924, after the Teapot Dome scandal, to study the efficient management of the naval petroleum reserves, and as Chairman of the Advisory Committee to the Cabinet-level Federal Oil Conservation Board established in December 1924 to reappraise Federal oil policies. In the fall of 1929, the first Hoover budget called for increased funds for scientific agencies, including $100,000 for fundamental research in geologic sciences, the first substantial increase in Federal funds for geologic investigations since 1915. In the spring of 1930, Congress appropriated $2.87 million for the Geological Survey and also appropriated funds for the expenses of a commission on the conservation and administration of the public domain. In December 1930, Hoover appointed Smith as chairman of the newly reorganized Federal Power Commission. (Walter Curran Mendenhall was appointed to succeed Smith as Director of the Geological Survey.)USGS History In January 1931 the Senate purported to reconsider its consent to the appointment of Smith, and other members of the Commission, because it did not approve of their choice of subordinates.Statement about refusal to resubmit Federal Power Commission appointments to the Senate, 10 January 1931 President Hoover did not recognise the Senate's authority to withdraw its consent to the appointment of officials after they had been commissioned. In May 1932 the US Supreme Court held that the appointments were effective.United States v. Smith, 286 U.S. 6 (1932) Smith served until 1933.

The first record of this bee in Great Britain occurred in 2017. They are of the solitary type; they do not live in colonies in hives like bumble bees and honey bees. They lack the pollen baskets on their hind tibiae; they do not produce honey, but they do use the pollen and nectar to stock their nests when they are ready. O. cornuta is also known as the builder bee, because when they build their nests in either the ground or structures that allow them to lay their eggs, usually the female digs to find an adequate nest. They build them with debris they have found in their habitat. They store pollen and for the larvae so they can feed themselves as they are left to fend for themselves. Once the larvae are in their adult form, they dig their way out of the nests and begin their adult lives as solitary bees.Royal Entomological Society Their length varies from 10 to 15 mm. Adults are on wing from March to June. The best way to ensure to have bees in the garden is to provide an insect hotel, which has adequate facilities to allow them to lay their eggs.Making a bug Hotel, RHS References cornuta Insects described in 1805 ","title":"Osmia cornuta"},{"id":"20571787","text":"Osmia bicolor, the two-coloured mason-bee, is a Palearctic species of bee in the genus Osmia. It is outstanding amongst other megachilid bees in that it nests in empty snail shells. Description Osmia bicolor females are small bees, 12 mm in length, with a black head and thorax and an abdomen covered in bright ginger hair. In the males the ginger colour of the abdomen is less intense. Distribution and habitat Osmia bicolor is found in Europe and western Asia from southern Great Britain in the west east to Turkestan, it is found as far north as southern Scandinavia and Finland, and south as far as Spain and the Romania. It occurs in grasslands and open deciduous woodland over calcareous soils underlain by rocks such as limestone and chalk. Biology Osmia bicolor is univoltine in western Europe and is among the first bees to emerge in the spring, males can be seen as early as February, although the normal flight period is from April to July. The females emerge a few weeks after the males and are quickly mated. Compared to females the males have a very short life. Once mated the female O bicolor seeks out the empty shells of snails, In Britain it has been recorded using the shells of Helix pomatia, Cepaea nemoralis, Cepaea hortensis and Monacha cantiana. While in Europe it has also been recorded using the shells of species in the genera Arianta, Crepidula, Fruticicola and Helicella. Once the female has selected a shell she moves into her preferred position before depositing balls consisting of chewed up masticated pollen and nectar to provision the nest. One egg is laid on each ball and the female then builds a cell around the egg and food provision. Depending on the size of the shell there will be four to five cells per shell and the shell will be sealed with the same type of chewed up leaf material, leaf mastic, as used to create the cells, as well as being speckled on the outside of the shell as camouflage. The female will also deposit sand, gravel and soil between the last cell and the plug as an anti-predator barrier. The shell is then manipulated by the female so that the entrance is facing towards the ground. Once the nest is complete the female covers the shell in a canopy of grass stems, small twigs or leaves to camouflage it. She uses her saliva to bind the canopy materials together. The females are often seen carrying these materials which can be many times the length of the bee. If the soil is soft enough the female may also partially bury the shell. Male O bicolor have been recorded using empty snail shells as shelters during periods of cold or wet weather and at night. The female will make up to six or seven nests in the breeding season. The cuckoo wasp Chrysura refulgens has been recorded as a parasite in the nests of O. bicornis in Italy. Osmia bicolor is polylectic and uses a wide variety of wildflowers to feed on and to collect pollen and nectar from. In Britain it has been recorded as feeding on wood anemone (Anemone nemorosa), common bluebell (Hyacinthoides non-scripta), heath dog-violet (Viola canina), bird's-foot-trefoil (Lotus corniculatus), horseshoe vetch (Hippocrepis comosa), sainfoin (Onobrychis viciifolia), willow (Salix spp.), ground-ivy (Glechoma hederacea), daisy (Bellis perennis) and dandelion (Taraxacum sp.). Conservation Osmia bicolor is classified as a nationally notable species in Britain, although it is classified a Least Concern by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and European Commission.

He currently represents the 35th district, which includes Miami Gardens, Miramar, and surrounding areas in southern Broward and northern Miami-Dade County. Braynon previously served as a member of the Florida House of Representatives, representing the 103rd district from 2008 to 2011. History Braynon was born in Corpus Christi, Texas, and moved to Miami Gardens, Florida, where he attended North Miami Beach High School. During high school he served as Student Government Association Vice-President his junior year, followed by President for his senior year. He was also a sprinter on the school‚Äôs track team. He finished sixth in the 400m at the State High School Track Meet of the Florida High School Athletic Association in 1995, his graduating year.Bill Buchalter (May 14, 1995) ‚ÄúBoyd Anderson Nips Oak Ridge For Title.\\" Orlando Sentinel (FL) Senator Braynon attended the Florida State University, where he received a degree in political science in 2000. Following graduation, he worked in the legislative office of State Representative Kendrick Meek as an intern, and then for the Miami-Dade County Commission as a legislative aide and public relations coordinator. In 2003, he was elected to the Miami Gardens City Council over Oliver Gilbert, receiving 57% of the vote to Gilbert's 43%. He served on the City Council from 2003 to 2008, serving as Vice-Mayor of the city from 2005 to 2007. Florida House of Representatives When incumbent State Representative Wilbert \\"Tee\\" Holloway was appointed to the Miami-Dade County School Board by then-Governor Charlie Crist in 2007, a special election was held to replace him in the 103rd District in 2008, which included Miami Gardens, Opa-locka, and Pembroke Pines in southern Broward County and northern Miami-Dade County. Braynon opted to run in the special election, and faced former Opa-locka Mayor Myra Taylor in the Democratic primary. He defeated Taylor in a landslide, receiving 62% of the vote to Tayloe's 38%, and was elected unopposed in the special general election. When he ran for re-election later that year, he won his party's nomination unopposed and the general election uncontested once again, and then was re-elected without opposition in 2010 as well. Florida Senate In 2010, State Senator Frederica Wilson was elected to Congress, creating a vacancy in the Florida Senate in the 33rd District, which included Miami, Miami Gardens, and North Miami in northeastern Miami-Dade County. Braynon ran to succeed her, and was opposed by former State Representatives James Bush, Phillip Brutus, and Darryl Reaves. Braynon earned the endorsement of former Chief Financial Officer Alex Sink and significantly out-raised the other three candidates. Bush, Brutus, and Reaves focused their attacks on Braynon, criticizing him for working for a Tallahassee law firm, while Braynon ran on his legislative experience, noting, \\"Everything I've done has helped my district, and my record shows that.\\" Ultimately, Braynon emerged narrowly victorious in the primary, receiving 42% of the vote to Brutus's 38%, Bush's 12%, and Reaves's 9%, and advanced to the general election, where he faced former North Miami Mayor Joe Celestin. He campaigned on his record in the legislature, argued that his opponent would vote with his party if elected, and criticized Governor Rick Scott's budget for being \\"unconstitutional.\\" Braynon defeated Celestin in a landslide, scoring 74% of the vote to Celestin's 26%. When the state's legislative districts were redrawn in 2012, Braynon was moved into the 36th District, where he opted to run for re-election. He was unopposed in both the primary and the general elections, and won his second term entirely uncontested. In 2014, Braynon faced a Democratic primary challenge from a first time candidate, whom he defeated 70 to 30%. Braynon defeated a write-in opponent in the general election. Braynon's district was reconfigured and renumbered after court- ordered redistricting in 2016, and he was re-elected in the new district unopposed. Because of the renumbering and the Senate‚Äôs staggered terms, he will face term limits two years earlier (2020) than he would have under the previous plan (2022). Previously, Braynon, having been elected in 2012 from an even-numbered district (#36) and re-elected in 2014, would have faced having to run for another four-year term in 2018 before being term limited in 2022. During the opening of the 2018 Florida Legislative Session, Braynon and Senator Anitere Flores jointly apologized for a sexual affair they had after an anonymous website uploaded a video showing Flores entering and leaving Braynon's apartment on multiple occasions. Both legislators are married with children.

In 2017 he pled guilty to tax evasion in 2011 and was sentenced to 60 days in jail. History Fresen was born in Miami and attended Florida State University, receiving a degree in finance and international affairs. Following graduation, he worked as a legislative aide from 2000 to 2002, and then worked as a land use consultant for Holland & Knight from 2005 to 2008, and then for Civica from 2008 to the present. Florida House of Representatives Erik Fresen was recommended by The Miami Herald for State Representative District 114 on October 11, 2014.http://erikfresen2014.com/ In 2008, when State Representative Marco Rubio, the Speaker of the Florida House of Representatives and the future United States Senator, was unable to seek re-election due to term limits, Fresen ran to succeed him in the 111th District, which stretched from Hialeah to South Miami in eastern Miami-Dade County. Fresen faced Rafael Luiz Perez, a former aide to Rubio, in the Republican primary, whom he was narrowly able to beat, winning with 52% of the vote to Perez's 48%. Advancing to the general election, he faced Frank Morra, the Democratic nominee, whom he was able to easily dispatch, winning his first term in the legislature with 59% of the vote. Running for re-election in 2010, Fresen ran unopposed before facing Democratic nominee Cristina Albright, whom he defeated with 64% of the vote. When the state's legislative districts were redrawn in 2012, Fresen opted to run for re-election in the 114th District, which contained most of the territory that he previously represented in Miami-Dade County. He was opposed in the Republican primary by Amory Bodin, who criticized Fresen for voting for what Bodin referred to as \\"tax increases, pork barrel spending, and budgets with enormous hidden deficits,\\" and called attention to Fresen's alleged financial irregularities. Regardless, Bodin did not pose a serious challenge to Fresen's campaign, and Fresen easily won the primary, receiving 72% of the vote to his opponent's 28%. In the general election, he was opposed by Ross Hancock, the Democratic nominee, and a contentious election ensued. Ultimately, Fresen narrowly won re-election over Hancock, defeating his opponent by just 1,403 votes and with 51% of the vote. Controversy On December 5, 2012, the Florida Ethics Commission announced that it had found \\"probable cause\\" that Fresen \\"failed to properly disclose his annual net worth, assets, and liabilities from 2008 to 2011,\\" which Fresen called \\"baseless and pointless\\" and a \\"textbook political attack.\\" He also faced a lawsuit filed against him by a mortgage company after he did not make payments on his house, a $29,199 lien from the Internal Revenue Service for taxes owed, and a $10,000 lien from the Miami-Dade Building Department for a code enforcement violation.\\" Fresen reached an agreement with Diane Guillemette, the state advocate, wherein he \\"conceded that there were minor mistakes on the disclosure forms he filed between 2008 and 2011,\\" but the agreement was rejected by the Ethics Commission because Fresen had not paid a $1,500 ethics fine from when he had not filed a financial disclosure form as a legislative aide. Commissioner Linda Robison suggested that a \\"public censure\\" might be needed and announced, \\"I find this appalling and I think his constituents need to know he never paid a fine that was assessed.\\" Fresen was named ‚Äúlegislator of the year‚Äù by Florida‚Äôs for-profit college lobbying group, the Florida Association of Postsecondary Schools & Colleges, in 2013. Fresen has received at least $25,500 from the ‚Äúcareer college‚Äù industry, made up mostly of for- profit schools. A conflict of interest ethics complaint was filed against him in 2011 for voting on a proposal that would give benefits to some charter schools, and in the 2016 legislative session he has fast-tracked a bill to force Florida public school districts to share their construction tax money with charters. Conviction On September 29, 2017, the Miami Herald reported that Fresen will serve 60 days in jail and a year of probation for failing to file a 2011 tax return. Although he was only charged for the missing 2011 return, he didn't properly report his income to the IRS from 2007 - 2016, a period that included his years in the Florida House. He has since repaid all monies owed.

This gene encodes a member of the cytochrome P450 superfamily of enzymes. The cytochrome P450 proteins are monooxygenases which catalyze many reactions involved in drug metabolism and synthesis of cholesterol, steroids and other lipids. The main function of the CYP27C1 enzyme is conversion of vitamin A1 (all-trans retinol) to vitamin A2 (all-trans 3,4-dehydroretinal).  Function  CYP27C1 catalyzes 3,4-desaturation of retinoids, particularly all-trans-retinol (vitamin A1) to all-trans 3,4-dehydroretinal (vitamin A2). The enzyme is unusual among mammalian P450s in that the predominant oxidation is a desaturation and in that hydroxylation represents only a minor pathway - the enzyme catalyzes 3- and 4-hydroxylation as minor events. The enzyme is located in human skin epidermis. The function of the enzyme was only discovered in 2016. Before that, it was considered an \\"orphan\\" enzyme. An orphan enzyme is an enzyme activity that has been experimentally characterized but for which there is no known amino-acid or nucleotide sequence data. Popular culture CYP27C1 is the topic of the comic Sherman's lagoon for May 26, 2016. In response to Hawthorne's inquiry about the chemical, Ernest explains that it is an enzyme that enhances ability to see infrared light, allowing fish to see better in murky waters.

The cytochrome P450 proteins are monooxygenases which catalyze many reactions involved in drug metabolism and synthesis of cholesterol, steroids and other lipids. This gene is part of a cluster of cytochrome P450 genes on chromosome 19 and encodes an enzyme thought to play a role in the 12(R)-lipoxygenase pathway. Mutations in this gene are the cause of ichthyosis lamellar type 3. Activity CYP4F22, like other CYP4F proteins, is a Cytochrome P450 omega hydroxylase, i.e. an enzyme that metabolizes fatty acids to their omega hydroxyl derivatives (see Omega oxidation). This hydroxylation may: a) produce a biologically important signaling molecule such as occurs in the metabolism of 20-carbon straight chain polyunsaturated fatty acid, arachidonic acid, to 20-Hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid, b) inactivate a biologically important product such as the metabolism of the arachidonic acid metabolite, 5-oxo- eicosatetraenoic acid, to its ~100-fold less potent product, 5-oxo-20-hydroxy- eicosatetraenoic acid, or c) be the first step in the further metabolism of xenobiotics or natural compounds CYP4F22 serves the latter function. It is a type 1 Integral membrane protein located in the endoplasmic reticulum of cells in the stratum granulosum of mammalian, including human, skin where it functions to attach an omega hydroxyl residue to fatty acids that are exceptionally long, 28 or more carbons, i.e. the very long chain fatty acids (VLCFA). These VLCFA targets need not be free fatty acids but also can be acylated in an amide bond to sphingosine to form an acylceramide. Function CYP4F22 omega hydroxylates the VLCFA in esterified omega-oxyacyl-sphingosine complex to form an esterified omega-hydroxyacyl-sphingosine complex. This step is critical for delivering the wax-like, extremely hydrophobic VLCFA to the stratum corneum near the skin surface. It is these skin surface VLCFA which create and maintain the skin's ability to function as a water barrier. CYP4F22, like many of the CYP4F series of CYPs, may prove to serve other functions but its role in hydroxylating VLCFA in the skin's water barrier function, as defined in genetic studies (see below), has dominated research on it.

This gene is part of a cluster of cytochrome P450 genes on chromosome 19. Another member of this family, CYP4F2, is approximately 16 kb away. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding the same protein have been found for this gene. Expression CYP4F11 is expressed in liver, kidney, heart, brain, and skeletal muscle and is overexpressed in ovarian and colon cancers; perhaps relativant to its overexpression in ovarian cancer, its gene has an estrogen receptor Œ± responsive site in its Promoter (genetics) site. Activities and possible functions CYP4F11 is active in metabolism of many drugs including benzphetamine, ethylmorphine, chlorpromazine, imipramine, and erythromycin;. The cytochrome is also able to hydroxylate short-chain and 3-hydroxylated medium chain fatty acidss by attaching a hydroxyl residue to their terminal carbon by omega oxidation in a reaction that may be critical to the processing of these fatty acids. It likewise omega-hydroxylates Vitamin Ks including menaquinone in a metabolic step which is essential for their further metabolism by beta oxidation and probably thereby their removal by catabolism to regulate their tissue levels. CYP4F11 omega-hydroxylates leukotriene B4 (LTB4) to 20-hydroxy-LTB4, 5-Hydroxyicosatetraenoic acid (5-HETE) to 20-hydroxy-5-HETE (i.e. 5,20-diHETE), 12-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (12-HETE) to 12,20-diHETE, lipoxins and possibly 5-oxo-eicosatetraenoic acid (5-oxo-ETE) to their 20-hydroxy metabolites; these reactions begin the inactivation of these pro- (LTB4, 5-HETE, 12-HETE, and 5-oxo-ETE) and anti- (lipoxins) cell signaling agents; however, it is relatively weak compared to, and therefore possibly not as physiologically relevant as, other CYP4Fs such as CYP4F2, CYP4F3a, CYP4F3b, CYP4A11 and CYP4F2 in doing so. The enzyme also hydroxylates arachidonic acid (i.e. eicosatetraenoic acid to 20-Hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid) (20-HETE) although other cytochromes such as CYP4A11 and CYP4F2 appear more important in this metabolic conversion. 20-HETE is a short-lived potent signaling agent that functions to regulate blood flow, vascularization, blood pressure, and kidney tubule absorption of ions in rodents and possibly humans. Gene polymorphism variants of CYP4A11 are associated with the development of hypertension and cerebral infarction (i.e. ischemic stroke) in humans (see 20-Hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid). In spite of its relative impotency and/or importance in accomplishing these omega- hydroxylations, CYP4F11 may contribute to them in certain tissues.

The cytochrome P450 proteins are monooxygenases which catalyze many reactions involved in drug metabolism and synthesis of cholesterol, steroids and the hydroxylation of fatty acids and fatty acid metabolites. CYP2U1 metabolized arachidonic acid, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), and other long chain fatty acids which suggests that CYP2U1 may play a role in brain and immune functions. CYP2U1 also metabolizes propanone, acetone, and 2-oxypropane.  Tissue distribution  The CYP2U1 gene is a highly conserved gene that is mainly expressed in brain and thymus, but also at lower levels in kidney, lung, and heart.  Reactions  CYP2U1 hydroxylates arachidonic acid, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), and other long chain fatty acids at their terminal (i.e., œâ) carbon to form 20-hydroxy- arachidonic acid (i.e. 20-Hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid or 20-HETE), 22-hydroxy-docosahexaneoic acid, and other œâ-hydroxy long chain fatty acids, respectively, plus lesser amounts of these fatty acids œâ-1 hydroxy metabolites, i.e. 19-HETE, 21-hydroxy-docosahexaenoic acid, and other œâ-1 hydroxy long chain fatty acids, respectively. One of these metabolites, 20-HETE, is a regulator of blood pressure and blood flow to organs in animal models and, based on genetic studies, possibly in humans (see 20-Hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid).  Clinical significance  A mutation (c.947A>T) in CYP2U1 has been associated in a very small number of patients with Hereditary spastic paraplegia in that it segregates with the disease at the homozygous state in two afflicted families. This mutation affects an amino acid (p.Asp316Val) that is highly conserved among CYP2U1 orthologs as well as other cytochrome P450 proteins; this p.Asp314Val mutation is located in the enzyme's functional domain, is predicted to be damaging to the enzyme's activity, and is associated with mitochondria dysfunction. A second homozygous enzyme-disabling mutation has been identified in CYP2U1, c.1A>C/p.Met1?, that is associated with <1% of hereditary spastic paraplegia sufferers. The reduction in 20-HETE production by these mutations, and thereby in 20-HETE's activation of the TRPV1 neural receptor, it is hypothesized, may contribute to the development of this disease (see 20-Hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid for details). CYPU21 along with members of the CYP4A and CYP4F sub-families also œâ-hydroxylate and thereby reduce the activity of various fatty acid metabolites of arachidonic acid including LTB4, 5-HETE, 5-oxo-eicosatetraenoic acid, 12-HETE, and several prostaglandins that are involved in regulating various inflammatory, vascular, and other responses in animals and humans.

Its common names are the bellus angelfish and ornate angelfish. Description They are a mid-sized angelfish reaching a maximum of 7in/18 cm at adulthood. Genicanthus bellus are sexually dimorphic, meaning the appearance between males and females is discernible. The females will be blue, black, and white to gray in coloration with horizontal black, white, and blue stripes along the body which shift to vertical striping near the head. The males will be predominantly gray with a yellow stripe running horizontally across the body. Males will often have a yellow stripe that runs along the base of the dorsal fin. Both males and females will have a tail that tapers into the body, giving them the 'swallowtail' appearance. Diet The bellus angelfish is an omnivore, eating mostly zooplankton and marine vegetation, specifically algae in the wild. In captivity, they will also accept frozen and meaty foods such as brine shrimp, mysis, and shellfish. They will eat many greens, particularly dried algae, in the home aquarium. Range It is found in various ocean reefs, particularly in the western Pacific and eastern Indian Ocean. The fish is also, although less commonly, found in the Philippines and the island chains as far east as Tonga. The bellus angelfish is typically found at depths of 300 ft. In the aquarium The bellus angelfish is a moderately difficult fish to maintain in captivity. They are not for the inexperienced aquarist. At a minimum, they should be kept in a 70-gallon tank for a single specimen; with a tank size of 120 gallons or more, for a pair. They are peaceful aquarium inhabitants and will rarely bother their tankmates. Just about the only exception is when kept with other angelfish, particularly of the genus Genicanthus. Also, no more than one male should be kept in a system. A single male can be maintained with multiple females. They are reef- safe, and can be kept with any invertebrates. Possible tankmates include clownfish, blennies, gobies, Chromis, butterflyfish, and small lionfish and eels. A reef temperature of is ideal for maintaining the bellus angelfish.

In October 1951 he returned to Oxford and began his studies in Chemistry under the tutorship of Rex Richards, going on to do research in Rex's group on NMR of the less-common nuclei (in particular 59Co) and earning his Master of Arts and Doctor of Philosophy degrees. Career Joining the magnetic resonance group of Anatole Abragam at Saclay, France in 1957, Freeman did postdoctoral research under the direction of the NMR pioneer Robert Pound (on leave from Harvard) on the super- regenerative oscillator, and exploited that device to build a stable high- resolution NMR spectrometer. =Varian Associates, California= After three years at the National Physical Laboratory, Teddington, United Kingdom, in the Basic Physics Division, Freeman took leave of absence in 1961 to work on double irradiation techniques with Wes Anderson at Varian Associates in Palo Alto, California. This environment proved so stimulating that one year was extended to twelve, and the young family grew up as Californians; three children have now settled on the West Coast. Along with research at Varian on double-resonance, double-quantum effects, spin-lattice relaxation, and Fourier transformation, Freeman assisted in the development of new Varian NMR spectrometers (XL-100 and CFT-20). =Back to Oxford= In 1973 Freeman returned to Oxford as University Lecturer and Fellow of Magdalen College, and started his own research group focused on high-resolution NMR methodology. He received the degree of Doctor of Science in 1975 and was elected Fellow of the Royal Society in 1979. Boosted by the advent of some brilliant young Oxford research students, the group produced several publications on new NMR techniques, including two-dimensional NMR (triggered by the seminal suggestion of Jean Jeener in Brussels). =A Handbook of Magnetic Resonance= On a short sabbatical at Caltech in Pasadena Freeman published \\"A Handbook of Magnetic Resonance\\" (translated into Japanese and Russian). =Cambridge= In 1987 Freeman moved to the University of Cambridge to take up the Plummer chair of magnetic resonance, and was elected a Fellow of Jesus College.

From there, Lowe moved to Greencastle, Indiana where he open a medical practice. In addition, Lowe became active in the Indiana Democratic Party and was elected to the Indiana state legislature. In 1837 at the age of 33, Lowe moved to the Black Hawk Purchase, an area of 6 million acres (24,000 km¬≤) in what is now Iowa that was purchased by the United States federal government five years prior in connection with the Black Hawk War. There, Lowe began practicing medicine in the relatively new, small frontier village of Burlington, Iowa. Over the next seven years, his reputation grew and Lowe became widely and favorably known. In 1844, Lowe was chosen a member of the First Constitutional Convention of Iowa. At the constitutional convention, Lowe got to know many of the future leaders of Iowa. However, their efforts were unsuccessful and the Constitution framed by the 1844 convention was rejected. Two years later, Lowe was elected to the 1846 Iowa Constitutional Convention. His popularity continued to increase and Lowe was elected to preside over the convention.

Pomacanthus maculosus. In: IUCN 2012. IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. Version 2012.2. Downloaded on 05 June 2013. The species lives mainly in coral and rocky areas, in shallow to moderate depths (forty feet), though it is more often in silty reef areas than in rich coral growth. It occasionally makes its way into the aquarium trade. Juveniles have different markings than adults. Appearance This angelfish grows to a size of 50 cm in length. It is very similar in appearance to the asfur angelfish (P. asfur), which is found in overlapping habitats in the Persian Gulf and Red Sea. The halfmoon angelfish can be distinguished from the asfur primarily by its tail color, which is pale to clear, while the asfur's tail is bright yellow. As with other large angelfish in genus Pomacanthus, juveniles and sub-adults are differently marked and colored than adults. Small halfmoon angelfish are alternately blue, white, and black banded. Distribution Pomacanthus maculosus is distributed throughout the Persian Gulf, the northwestern Indian Ocean, and the Red Sea south to 19¬∞S. In 2009 it was recorded off the coast of Lebanon in the eastern Mediterranean, probably as a result of Lessepsian migration from the Red Sea through the Suez Canal. There have since been records off Israel and the species is now considered to be established in the Levantine Sea. Diet This species has a diet typical of angelfishes. Its main food is sponges. It also eats small anemones, algae, tubeworms, and shrimp.

It runs railway infrastructure, as well as regional and long-distance passenger services in Bavaria and Saxony with links into the Czech Republic, and Germany-wide goods trains. The subsidiary Regental Bahnbetriebs-GmbH (RBG) operates goods trains though its subsidiary Regental Cargo, and passenger trains through Die L√§nderbahn, whilst Regental Fahrzeugwerkst√§tten operates railway workshops. A fourth subsidiary Regental Kraftverkehrs, a bus operator, ceased operations in 2004.  Emergence of the Regentalbahn AG (RAG)  Share of the AG Localbahn Gotteszell-Viechtach, issued 1. January 1891 On 9 May 1889 the \\"AG Localbahn Gotteszell - Viechtach\\" railway company sprang to life as a result of a \\"concession for the construction and operation of a standard gauge railway from Gotteszell to Viechtach\\" dated 28 April 1889. Lokalbahn was the name for a local branch line in Bavaria. On 10 November 1890 goods trains were already running from Gotteszell to Teisnach and on 20 November 1890 full services to Viechtach began. The company acquired in 1903 the granite factory of Teisnach AG and the Pr√ºnst quarry, that still provides ballast for track construction today. On 1 January 1928 the Lokalbahn Deggendorf-Metten AG was also acquired and merged with the Gotteszell ‚Äì Viechtach Lokalbahn company which was now called the Regentalbahn AG. In 1924/25 construction of the line from Viechtach to Blaibach was begun. Goods services started here on 2 January 1928 and passenger trains on 1 February 1928. On 1 January 1973 the Regentalbahn AG also took over the eighty-year-old AG Lokalbahn Lam - K√∂tzting.  Founding of the subsidiaries  The period since the 1970s has been marked by modernisation and rationalisation. A large number of railcars were procured (initially second-hand, but since the 1980s new ones as well) and various parts of the business split into subsidiaries. In 2002 the Regentalbahn acquired the trade name Die L√§nderbahn (\\"The State Railway\\"), with which it is clear that it is active in Bavaria, Saxony, Thuringia and the Czech Republic. In 1980 the Pr√ºnst granite works became a limited company (GmbH), in which the Regentalbahn had a 50% stake. This share was sold in 2005. At the same time the following 100%-owned subsidiaries were created within the Regentalbahn AG: * In 1979 the Regental Kraftverkehrs GmbH (RKG) - bus operations * In 1988 the Regental Bahnbetriebs-GmbH (RBG) - railway operations * In 1989 the Regental Fahrzeugwerkst√§tten GmbH (RFG) - workshops * In 1998 the Vogtlandbahn GmbH (VBG) - Vogtland railway * in 2012 the vlexx GmbH On 1 January 2004 the Regentalbahn Kraftverkehrs was disbanded for economic reasons. The vehicles and personnel were taken over by the bus company Regionalbus Ostbayern, that continues to run bus services Viechtach and Lam. Since 1997 Regental Bahnbetriebs has operated all the lines of the Bavarian Forest railway under contract to the Deutsche Bahn (DB Regio Bayern). Under this contract it has run since 2001 under the trade name Oberpfalzbahn not only its own route from Bad K√∂tzting to Lam, but also the Schwandorf‚ÄìCham‚ÄìFurth im Wald, Cham‚ÄìWaldm√ºnchen and Cham‚ÄìBad K√∂tzting lines. In addition, the goods traffic branch Regental Cargo also belongs to the Regental Bahnbetriebs-GmbH. Regental Cargo runs goods trains countrywide, has its centre of operations at Neuenmarkt-Wirsberg (with a satellite depot at Zwickau) and is part of the goods wagon network Eccocargo. The Vogtlandbahn, founded on 1 January 1998, took over Regentalbahn's operations in Saxony. Since 2005 it offers its own Vogtland Express, a long-distance train, that links the Vogtland with Berlin daily. Since 2007 it operates the ALEX (see below). The Regental Fahrzeugwerkst√§tten runs two workshops for all the railways of the L√§nderbahn. One is at the headquarters in Viechtach in the Bavarian Forest, the other at Neumark im Vogtland. Since 2006 there has been a third workshop at Schwandorf, especially for the Oberpfalzbahn and future tasks of the L√§nderbahn for the maintenance of the Oberpfalzbahn shuttle and the locomotives and wagons of the ALEX. In December 2003, the Allg√§u Express (ALEX) started working between Munich and Oberstdorf as a substitute for the withdrawn Interregio-Linie 25. This was done in cooperation with EuroThurbo (since early 2005 SBB). When the Regentalbahn won the competition in December 2005 for the next, longer contract period, it became responsible from the timetable change in December 2007 for long-distance services not just on the line from Munich to Oberstdorf, together with a new train portion to Lindau, but also the Munich‚ÄìRegensburg‚ÄìHof and Munich‚ÄìRegensburg‚ÄìFurth im Wald-Prague routes. Negotiations over an extension via Hof to Leipzig and Berlin continue. The trade mark ALEX was retained, but will mean from now on Arriva L√§nderbahn Express; services on the Vogtlandbahn will be phased out. Following the takeover by FS in 2010 it has now been rebranded simply as alex. Following the advertisement published in summer 2006 for Regionalbahn services on the Freilassing‚ÄìBerchtesgaden railway, the contract went in October of the same year to the Berchtesgadener Bahn, a consortium of the Regentalbahn and the Salzburg AG who, as the winners will take over these services after the timetable change in December 2009. The Regentalbahn is a member of the Tarifverband der Bundeseigenen und Nichtbundeseigenen Eisenbahnen in Deutschland (TBNE). Since December 2015, the subsidiaries of the Regentalbahn have been operating under the umbrella of L√§nderbahn GmbH DLB, a 100% owned subsidiary of Regentalbahn. Thus Regentalbahn-Bahnbetriebs GmbH, Vogtlandbahn GmbH, Regental Fahrzeugwerkst√§tten GmbH and vlexx are under one roof.  New ownership arrangements  The shares of the Regentalbahn were split between numerous owners. In 1940 these included the Deutsche Reich, the state of Bavaria, the Bavarian State Bank and the Deutsche Reichsbahn. By 1982 the Free State of Bavaria had gained 76,9% of the shares. The rest were divided between towns and villages, the Benedictine abbey of Metten and private individuals. In autumn 2004 the Free State sold its share majority to the British transport company Arriva which has Europe-wide interests. Its German subsidiary Arriva Deutschland increased its share of the Regentalbahn to 100% by May 2006 through purchases. After Arriva was bought by Deutsche Bahn in 2010, the business had to be resold from competition reasons. The new owners are the Italian state railways (Ferrovie dello Stato) together with Luxembourg infrastructure fund Cube. The German parent company since March 2011 is called Netinera.

The mouth and lips are blue as are the rays of the pectoral and anal fins, while the dorsal and caudal fins are yellow, edged with pale blue. There is a long spine on the gill cover which is used in defence. Juvenile fish are dark blue with slightly curved, white lateral stripes. The change from the juvenile to the adult coloring takes place quite abruptly, with little intermediate coloring. Distribution and habitat Pomacanthus navarchus is native to the tropical Indo-Pacific region, its range extending from Indonesia and the Philippines to northern and eastern Australia and Micronesia. It can be found at depths down to about on outer reef slopes, channels and lagoons in coral-rich habitats. Ecology This species is territorial and is generally found alone, but occasionally in pairs or small groups. It inhabits the demersal zone, feeding on sponges, algae, tunicates, zooplankton and small invertebrates. It is a protandric hermaphrodite, starting adult life as a female and later becoming a male.

Ricardo Miledi (left) and Albert Grass (right) in a recreation of the first image taken in 1990. Ricardo Miledi (15 September 1927 ‚Äì 18 December 2017) was a Mexican neuroscientist known for his work deciphering the role of calcium in neurotransmitter release. He also helped to develop a technique for studying native receptors in frog oocytes for drug development. One of seven children, he received undergraduate and medical degrees at National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM). While in medical school, he decided that he would make a \\"terrible clinician\\", as \\"he imagined that he would end up seeing only one patient per week, because he would always be too interested in every unknown detail of the case, trying to work out how medicines might act.\\" As a result, when required to perform social service as a component of his training in medical school, he chose a research fellowship at the \\"Instituto Nacional de Cardiolog√≠a\\" under Arturo Rosenblueth. There, he studied the electrical origins of ventricular fibrillation and became skilled at delicate laboratory work. In 1955, he spent a summer at the Marine Biological Laboratory at Wood's Hole. There, he began his study of synapses in the common squid and began to see the importance of calcium in synaptic transmission. Around 1956/1957 Miledi conducted research in Canberra, Australia. In 1958, he met frequent collaborator, Noble Laureate Bernard Katz, who offered him a position in the Department of Biophysics at University College London. There, he studied the release of Acetylcholine (ACh) and the expression of its receptors. From these studies, he introduced evidence of a phenomenon known as spillover, in which neurotransmitters diffuse away and stimulate extrasynaptic receptors. Further work on extrasynaptic receptors led to the development of the concept of neuromodulation. This laid the groundwork for future studies in neurotrophic factors, which would ultimately lead to his work in denervation. By studying denervation in frog skeletal muscle, it was discovered that glial cells, particularly Schwann cells, behave as neurotrophic factors by taking on neuronal activity and releasing Acetylcholine themselves in order to preserve the neuromuscular junction. In the early 1960s, he again became interested in the role of calcium. He found that \\"in zero-Ca2+ medium, the nerve impulse still fully invades the nerve terminal, but does not release any neurotransmitter. And then as soon as you give a little Ca2+ , you get neurotransmitter release.\\" He and Katz published a paper establishing the major role of Ca2+ in ACh release. Further work with squid contributed to an even better understanding of the role of Ca2+ in neurotransmitter release. Miledi was elected as a fellow to the British Royal Society in 1970. During the early 1970s Miledi was a frequent research scientist during the summer months at the Stazione Zooalogica in Naples, Italy ostensibly as the local squid made excellent research specimen. He is also one of the 42 founding fellows of The World Academy of Sciences in 1983, to recognize outstanding scientists from developing countries and honour their achievements in research and development. Miledi was a Distinguished Professor at Uniiversity of California, Irvine; having joined the faculty in the early 1980s. While there, he spent time developing a technique called microtransplantation, which would allow researchers to study receptors from postmortem diseased human brain tissue in a functional model. He developed this technique based on earlier work in which he performed the first electrophysiological recording of a frog oocyte, discovering its inherent property of already having neurotransmitter receptors. From the 1990s until his death he was Distinguished Professor at UNAM's Institute of Neurobiology, in Quer√©taro, Mexico. His awards include the Royal Medal (1998), , the King Faisal International Prize for Science (1988), the Prince of Asturias Award (1999), and the Society for Neuroscience's Ralph W. Gerard Prize for outstanding contributions to the field (2010).

He was the founder-president of the International Liquid Crystal Society. Chandrasekhar was born on 6 August 1930 at Kolkata. He received his M Sc degree in physics with first rank from Nagpur University in 1951. Subsequently, he joined the Raman Research Institute (RRI), Bangalore to work for his doctoral degree in physics under the guidance of his maternal uncle, C. V. Raman. The main topic of his research was related to optical rotatory dispersion measurements on several crystals. He received the D Sc degree from Nagpur University in 1954. Then he went to the Cavendish Laboratory on an 1851 Exhibition Scholarship and obtained a second doctorate degree from Cambridge University mainly for his work on the corrections for extinction in neutron and X-ray scattering from crystals. His subsequent postdoctoral work in the University College and the Royal Institution at London also dealt with crystallographic problems. He returned to India in 1961 as the first Head of the Department of Physics, which had just been started in the University of Mysore at Mysore. It was here that he turned his attention to liquid crystals, a subject which at that time was just coming out of a long hibernation.  Research  Liquid crystals made of rod-like molecules had been discovered in 1888, and many compounds had been synthesized at Halle, Saxony-Anhalt, Germany in the 1920s and 30s. Some physical studies had been undertaken by the German and Russian schools during that era, but the subject later languished till the mid-fifties. Starting in the late fifties, the systematic synthetic effort by George William Gray in the UK and the physical studies by Wilhelm Maier in Germany (including the well-known Maier‚ÄìSaupe or MS theory) started a revival of the subject. Chandrasekhar and his co-workers made contributions to the application of the dynamical theory of reflections to study the fascinating optical properties of cholesteric liquid crystals which have a helical structure with a pitch which is usually ~ 0.5 mm, and to the extensions of the molecular theory of nematic liquid crystals beyond the MS model. Chandrasekhar was invited to establish a liquid crystal laboratory in RRI after the Department of Science and Technology started supporting it in 1971. The move had a highly positive impact on his productivity. Along with a couple of former students who moved with him to RRI, in a short time, he developed a laboratory with all the essential facilities needed for research in the chosen area. Realizing that cutting-edge research would not be possible without an in-house capacity to produce new materials, a synthetic organic chemistry laboratory was set up. Soon many new experimental and a few theoretical results emerged and the Liquid Crystal Laboratory at RRI became one of the leading centres of research in the world. The twisted nematic liquid crystal display was invented in Europe in 1971 and recently, LCDs have displaced CRTs as commercially the most important displays. In cooperation with Chandrasekhar and his colleagues, the Bharat Electronics Limited (BEL), Bangalore, developed indigenous know-how for the manufacture of simple LCDs for the domestic market.  Columns  The pinnacle in Chandrasekhar‚Äôs scientific career came in 1977, when he and his co-workers discovered the columnar phase of liquid crystals made of disc- shaped molecules, rather than the well-studied rods. Through supramolecular assembly, the discs exhibit a mesophase which has a two-dimensional, periodic order. The paper announcing the discovery of this state of matter was published in the Indian physics journal Pramana, and is one of the most highly cited papers in the field of liquid crystals. Subsequently, a few thousand compounds with disc-like molecules were synthesized. The columnar liquid crystals are noted for their highly anisotropic conducting properties, which is exploited in device applications. The subject has had yet another resurgence in 1996, when Japanese scientists discovered new types of liquid crystalline phases exhibited by compounds made of another new type of (banana- shaped) molecule having bent-cores. Many such compounds exhibit columnar liquid crystalline phases.  Publications and honors  The year 1977 also saw the publication of Chandrasekhar‚Äôs book on liquid crystals by the Cambridge University Press. The book is popular amongst workers in the field, and has been translated into Russian and Japanese. An enlarged second edition of the book was published in 1992. Chandrasekhar also organized several international conferences, including the one in 1973 on the occasion of the Silver Jubilee of the founding of the RRI. Many stalwarts in the field of liquid crystals like Glen H. Brown, George William Gray, Alfred Saupe and Pierre-Gilles de Gennes (who was to receive the Nobel Prize in 1991, partly for his work on liquid crystals) participated in this conference. He was awarded A. Cemal Eringen Medal in 1996. Some major conferences Chandrasekhar organized include the Ninth International Liquid Crystals Conference in 1982 and the Second Asia-Pacific Physics Conference in 1986. After retiring from RRI in 1990, Chandrasekhar started the Centre for Liquid Crystal Researchhttp://www.cens.res.in/ in a building made available by BEL. Chandrasekhar‚Äôs scientific achievements brought him many honours. He was elected Fellow of all the three scientific academies in India, including the Indian Academy of Sciences (FASc, 1962) and the Indian National Science Academy (FNA, 1978). He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1983, and was also a fellow of the Institute of Physics (London) and of the Third World Academy of Sciences. He was a member of several international and national committees on science and education. He was the founder president of the International Liquid Crystal Society for 1990‚Äì92, and was an editor of the journal Molecular Crystals and Liquid Crystals for 20 years. He was the recipient of the Bhatnagar Award (1972), Homi Bhabha (1987) and Meghnad Saha (1992) medals of the Indian National Science Academy, C.V. Raman Centenary Medal of the Indian Association for the Cultivation of Science (1988), the Royal Medal of Royal Society (1994), Niels Bohr International Gold Medal of UNESCO (1998), and the Freedericksz Medal of the Russian Liquid Crystal Society (2000). He was also the recipient of the Karnataka Rajyotsava award (1986), Padma Bhushan (1998) and the honour of Knight of the Order of Academic Palms by the French Government (1999). Chandrasekhar was largely responsible for placing India on the international map in the field of liquid crystals. Chandrasekhar hailed from the most illustrious family of physicists in India.

Prior to July 2013, ODJFS was also the state agency responsible for the administration of Ohio's Medicaid program. In July 2013, a new state agency was created, the Ohio Department of Medicaid (ODM), Ohio‚Äôs first Executive-level Medicaid agency. ODJFS employs about 2,300 full time employees and has an annual budget of $3.3 billion. History On July 1, 2000, the Ohio Department of Human Services and the Ohio Bureau of Employment Services combined to become the ODJFS. ODJFS oversees programs helping unborn babies and their mothers with health care issues while also helping unemployed workers and senior citizens find food and shelter. =2004 ODJFS and Ohio Auditor's Office joint audit= In December 2004, the ODJFS and the Ohio Auditor's Office launched a joint audit. As a result, Ohio officials questioned $200 million in tax dollars spent by the Hamiltion County Department of Job and Family Services. =Lifeway For Youth= In 2006, ODJFS took away the license for Lifeway For Youth, a nonprofit Christian-based placement agency, due to the death of a 3-year-old boy. Barbara Riley, then the director of ODJFS, questioned \\"how the private placement agency Lifeway for Youth, Butler County Children Services, and her own department failed the boy.\\" =2008 Ohio unemployment insurance trust fund= For the year 2008, ODJFS sought federal help concerning Ohio's unemployment insurance trust fund. State officials had stated that the fund was in danger of running out before the end of the year. On December 5, 2008, ODJFS announced that extended unemployment benefit payments will start the week of December 22, 2008. Scarlett Bouder, spokesperson for the ODJFS, stated that \\"an estimated 70,000 Ohioans are now eligible for the assistance and thousands more will qualify in the coming weeks as they exhaust their regular benefits.\\" =2008 ODJFS database search= During last few weeks of the 2008 US Presidential election campaign, ODJFS director Helen Jones-Kelley, and members of her staff, became embroiled in a controversy over searches of Joe Wurzelbacher's government records. The matter led to substantial news media attention during the presidential campaign, a new law being signed in Ohio, and a federal civil rights lawsuit. Services for Families ODJFS provides a variety of financial and supportive services to low-income families and individuals, most of whom are employed or seeking employment. A large part of this assistance comes through the Ohio Works First and Food Assistance programs. =Cash and Food Assistance= Ohio Works First (OWF) is the financial assistance portion of the state's Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF) program, which provides cash benefits to eligible low-income families for up to 36 months. Federal law requires at least 50 percent of all able-bodied adults receiving benefits to participate in work activities at least 30 hours a week. At least 90 percent of households containing two able- bodied parents are required to participate in work activities at least 35 hours a week or, if they are using federally subsidized child care, at least 55 hours a week. Allowable ‚Äúwork activities‚Äù include such things as on-the-job training, community service and education directly related to employment. =Child Care= ODJFS offers financial assistance to eligible parents to help pay for child care while they engage in work and training efforts. The agency, along with the county departments of job and family services, is responsible for regulating approximately 6,600 family child care homes, and for licensing and inspecting nearly 4,300 child care facilities. Every day, an estimated 250,000 children under age 6 are cared for in settings outside the home that are certified or licensed in Ohio. =Child Protective Services= ODJFS administers and oversees the state's child protective services programs. These include programs that prevent child abuse and neglect; provide services to abused and/or neglected children and their families (birth, foster and adoptive); and license foster homes and residential facilities. Child protective services in Ohio are provided by a network of 88 public children services agencies (PCSAs). Sixty-two of these are located within county departments of job and family services, and twenty-six operate independently. =Adult Protective Services= ODJFS administers the state‚Äôs Adult Protective Services program, which helps vulnerable adults age 60 and older who are in danger of harm, are unable to protect themselves, and may have no one to assist them. ODJFS has the authority to plan and develop programs, and write rules and regulations pertaining to adult protective services. It also provides technical assistance to county staff. The county departments of job and family services receive and investigate reports of abuse, neglect and exploitation of vulnerable adults and evaluate the need for protective services. During SFY 2012, the counties received a total of 14,344 reports of abuse, neglect and exploitation of adults age 60 and over. =Child Support= The ODJFS Office of Child Support collects and distributes nearly $2 billion annually to more than 1 million Ohio children. In federal fiscal year (FFY) 2011, Ohio had the third largest \\"IV-D\\"-designated child support caseload in the country. IV-D refers to the section of federal law that created the child support program. IV-D cases qualify for a variety of child support services, such as locating noncustodial parents, establishing legal paternity, establishing child support or medical support orders, and enforcing such orders. Ohio's child support program is administered locally by 88 county child support enforcement agencies (CSEAs). Sixty-seven CSEAs are located within county departments of job and family services. The rest are either stand-alone agencies or are located within the office of the county prosecutor. Employment Services ODJFS oversees a variety of employment- related services for Ohioans. As the state's unemployment rate declined throughout the year, the agency expanded its reemployment activities for unemployment compensation recipients; enhanced OhioMeansJobs, the resume and job bank created in partnership with Monster.com; and refocused efforts to increase the number of On-the-Job Training opportunities available for Ohioans. =Labor Market Information= Through its Bureau of Labor Market Information (LMI), ODJFS collects and analyzes industry, occupational and employment information to provide statistics on economic and workforce indicators for Ohio. This includes employment levels, unemployment rates, wages and earnings, employment projections, career information, and initial and continued unemployment claim trends. This information is used by ODJFS and Ohio‚Äôs local employment program operators, as well as by the Ohio Departments of Education and Development, the Ohio Board of Regents, state and national media, private citizens and industry groups. The LMI website drew nearly 1.5 million page views in SFY 2012. =Workforce Services= As administrator of several federal workforce programs, ODJFS oversees a network of 30 full- service and 60 satellite \\"One-Stop Centers\\" that provide free job training and other services to Ohioans looking for work and employers seeking workers. The centers match job seekers with employers and help laid-off workers learn new skills and find jobs. =Unemployment Compensation= ODJFS administers Ohio's unemployment compensation (UC) program, which provides short-term income to unemployed workers who lose their jobs through no fault of their own. It reduces the hardship felt by families during periods of temporary unemployment and bolsters local economies by maintaining the purchasing power of the unemployed workers.

The larvae feed on dead insects and other arthropods that become trapped in naturally occurring petroleum pools, making this the only known insect species that develops in crude oil, a substance which is normally highly toxic to insects. Description Adults are about 5 mm long, with black bodies, except for lighter cheeks. The halteres are yellowish, with white knobs. The densely hairy eyes are nearest at the middle of the face. The third joint of the antennae is slightly longer than the second, the spine of the latter not reaching beyond the apex of the antennae. The hyaline wings are tinged with gray on nearly the entire costal half, except sometimes having a spot toward the apex of the submarginal cell. The apex of the second vein is nearly twice as far from the first as from the apex of the third vein. Biology While the larvae normally swim slowly near the surface of the oil with the tips of their air-tubes showing as minute points above the surface film,Esterly 1913 they are able to submerge for longer periods. The mating behavior and egg deposition are still not described, but it is thought that the eggs are not laid inside the oil. The larvae leave it only to pupate, travelling to nearby grass stems on the margins of the pool. Their whole development between newly hatched larva and pupa takes place exclusively in petroleum. =Petroleum tolerance= Larva of H. petrolei The larvae ingest large quantities of oil and asphalt, and their guts can be seen to be filled with petroleum. However, nutritional experiments showed that they subsist on animal matter present in the oil, which they quickly devour. Although the oil can reach temperatures of up to , the larvae suffer no ill effects from it, even when additionally exposed to 50% turpentine or 50% xylene in laboratory experiments. Oil fly larvae contain about 200,000 heterotrophic bacteria, which have been of interest to scientists searching for microorganisms or enzymes that function in an organic solvent environment. The nitrogen-rich nutrients released into the gut make the environment, with a pH of around 6.5, suitable for the development of these bacteria. There is no evidence that these bacteria contribute to insect physiology.

Biography Eva was the daughter of Wine Merchant and local historian Clarence Mason Dobell from Cheltenham, and the niece of the Victorian poet Sydney Dobell. She volunteered to join the Voluntary Aid Detachment (VAD) as a nurse in World War I. Her experiences in the VAD prompted her to write poetry about, inter alia, wounded and maimed soldiers which has been well-thought of by many versed in the ways of poetry. She also took part in the morale-boosting work of writing to prisoners of war. Her full name was Eveline Jessie Dobell and she was born the youngest of three children on 30 January 1876 at the Grove, Charlton Kings in Gloucestershire, England. She died on 3 September 1963 at the age of 87 years at which time her home address was Abbeyholme, Overton Rd, Cheltenham. She never married. Her mother was Emily Anne Duffield a native of Manchester, England. Poetry While she was also known in her time as a regional poetEvidenced by her inclusion in S. Fowler Wright, ed. The County Series of Contemporary Poetry No. VII, an anthology of poems by poets from or near Gloucester. (one of her Gloucestershire poems was recently set to music\\"Tom's Long Post\\" on Johnny Coppin's The Gloucestershire Collection.), Dobell is best known today for her occasional poems from the war period, which all describe wounded soldiers, their experiences, and their bleak prospects. Lusty is speaking of \\"female medical persona like May Sinclair, Vera Brittain, Mary Henderson, and Eva Dobell, working in dressing stations and hospitals.\\" A few of these poems are widely dispersed on the internet, and these continue to receive some scholarly acknowledgment. \\"Night Duty,\\" for instance, is cited as one of many poems by female war-poets and nurses that provide access to an experience rarely shared by male poets such as Wilfred Owen and Siegfried Sassoon. Perhaps the most frequently reproduced is \\"Pluck,\\" especially on sites dedicated to the Great War.For instance, \\"Pluck\\" on From The Trenches , and on First World War Poetry. \\"Pluck\\" also found its way into printed anthologies such as The Cambridge Companion to the Literature of the First World War,Vincent Sherry, ed.

Lokalbahnen appeared at the end of the 19th century before the use of cars became widespread.  Development  Modern operations on the Pinzgauer Lokalbahn Because the construction and operation of main line railways was not always covered by their income, simpler solutions were sought. As early as 1865 the engineering conference of the Union of German Railway Administrations (Verein Deutscher Eisenbahnverwaltungen) had set out the principles for secondary lines. These were enshrined in law in 1878 with the Railway Act for German Railways of Secondary Importance (Bahnordnung f√ºr deutsche Eisenbahnen untergeordneter Bedeutung). = Bavaria = By the 1880s, the Bavarian main line network was largely completed and attention now turned to its expansion into the hinterland. On 21 April 1884 the first Bavarian Lokalbahn (also spelt Localbahn) law was passed. This was based on the premise that funding for land purchase and construction would be a local affair, although earthworks would be paid for by the state. However, the state would also take the profit. To make them viable, the Lokalbahnen were to be built and operated as simply as possible. Structures too were to be simple. This led to the widespread use of standard buildings and structures; nevertheless branch lines and their stations still retained a lot of individual character based on the region and local material available for construction. The real boom period for branch line construction in Bavaria was from 1894 to 1910, a time when more than half of all branch lines were completed. The average time to build was four years and the construction cost worked out at about a fifth that of main lines per kilometre. The Lokalbahnen in Bavaria were built to standard gauge and, initially, an axle load of just 10 tons.  Characteristics  A Lokalbahn line typically began at a station on the main line and ran, as a branch line, to the next largest town. On the lowland plateaus of Bavaria, for example, many market towns and other towns were linked to the railway network by Lokalbahnen. In keeping with their secondary status and simplified regulations the following simplifications were made to improve their economy compare with the main lines: * lower axle loads, narrower rail gauges (in some areas) and lower speeds * fewer regulations, simpler signalling * Mixed train operations (passenger coaches and goods wagons in one train) From the 1950s, increasing bus and car traffic led to the closure of branch lines, including numerous lines built as Lokalbahnen. Several routes continue to be operated today as heritage railways. Sometimes lines that are still referred to today as Lokalbahnen have been upgraded into modern modes of transportation and local means of public transport. In Vienna, the Badner Bahn still carries its Lokalbahn designation, despite operationally being a modern tram-train line.

Other common names include cream angelfish, smoke angelfish, or yellowtail black angelfish. The angelfish should not be confused with its relative the Yellow-ear angelfish (Apolemichthys xanthotis) despite similar appearances.  Description  The Indian yellowtail angelfish has a creamy appearance, with a dark lattice pattern going across the body and filling in to rim the entire angelfish with dark brown. The fins are edged in white and the tail is a strong yellow, giving the angelfish its name. The juvenile is slightly lighter, though retains similar coloring. The Indian yellowtail has a short snout and large eye. Considered a mid-sized angelfish, adults only reach about 8 inches (20 cm) in length. This species does not display sexual dimorphism.  Habitat  The Indian yellowtail can be found in the Western Indian Ocean, in areas such as the Maldives and the east coast of India. These fish tend to live in areas with much soft and stony coral, and are found in depths between 16 and 115 feet. They are commonly found on reef faces and fore-reef slopes. Generally, as water depth increases, the likelihood of the species traveling in pairs increases.  Diet  The Indian yellowtail angelfish is an omnivore. While they are mostly herbivores, grazing algae off rock, they readily eat sponge material and tunicates and will accept meaty foods. They only eat small amounts of copepods.  Reproduction  While the angelfish has not been bred in the aquarium or lab, angelfish are usually broadcast spawners, meaning they release sperm and eggs into the water column at dusk. Spawning usually takes place at sunset.  Lifespan  These angelfish can have a lifespan of 10 years or more, and most marine angelfish can reach up 20 years in captivity.  Status  There are no major threats due to limited collection and established populations in protected areas.  In the Aquarium  The Indian yellowtail angelfish is occasionally available in pet stores and online at a low to moderate price. Due to the high success rate in keeping this fish it is a highly recommended purchase. This angelfish is fairly hardy and does not have the same stresses that many other angelfish are prone to. While in the aquarium, these angelfish prefer having live rock with abundant algae growth to graze off of, though they will accept prepared foods. They should be fed herbivore foods, along with mysis shrimp and small bits of meaty seafoods. Algae is a required staple, and sponge material is an enticing food to get them to eat. Indian yellowtail angelfish require a minimum tank size of 75 gallons, though 100 is recommended to keep the fish relaxed. A mated pair may be kept in a tank over 150 gallons. These particular angelfish are very passive, and can be scared into not eating if housed with other more aggressive dwarf angelfish or other angelfish. These fish are not reef safe, and enjoy much live rock to hide in yet require open area for swimming space.

The Irish pork crisis of 2008 was a dioxin contamination incident in Ireland that led to an international recall of pork products from Ireland produced between September and early December of that year. It was disclosed in early December 2008 that contaminated animal feed supplied by one Irish manufacturer to thirty-seven beef farms and nine pig farms across Republic of Ireland, and eight beef farms and one dairy farm in Northern Ireland, had caused the contamination of pork with between 80 and 200 times the EU's recommended limit for dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs i.e. 0.2 ng/g TEQ fat (0.2 ppb). The Food Safety Authority of Ireland moved on 6 December to recall from the market all Irish pork products dating from 1 September 2008 to that date. The contaminated feed that was supplied to forty-five beef farms across the island was judged to have caused no significant public health risk, accordingly no recall of beef was ordered. Also affected was a dairy farm in Northern Ireland; some milk supplies were withdrawn from circulation. Within days thousands of jobs were either lost or under threat at pig processing plants across the country, as processors refused to resume slaughter of pigs until they received financial compensation. Pork supplies to a total of twenty-three countries was affected, thirteen within the European Union and the remainder outside in an area across at least three continents. Countries affected include: Italy, Germany, the Netherlands, Poland, Sweden, Denmark, Belgium, Estonia, the UK, France, Portugal, Cyprus, Romania, Russia, the United States, Canada, Switzerland, China, South Korea, Japan and Republic of Singapore. It is now suspected that the oil that contaminated the offending pig feed with dioxins came from County Tyrone. Some reports suggest the recovery of the Irish pork market would take up to a decade. The Irish government has been criticised over its handling of the incident. On 18 December 2008, it was disclosed that the beef samples from the affected farms had dioxin levels between 100 and 400 times the legal limit. However the Irish authorities insisted that the threat to public health from Irish beef products, even though the dioxin levels were higher than in the affected pork, was insignificant.Beef from 21 farms withdrawn after tests for dioxins On 25 January 2009, Chinese quarantine authorities seized over 23 tonnes of frozen and contaminated Irish pork which was imported by a company in the city of Suzhou in October 2008. On 28 January 2009, Joint Oireachtas Committee on Agriculture was told by Indaver Ireland managing director John Ahern that Ireland could \\"sleepwalk\\" into another pork crisis if the Minister for the Environment, John Gormley, continued with his plans to commence widespread use of mechanical biological treatment. Pork =Background= An illustration of the measured dioxin levels in Irish pork and beef relative to the legal limit. The smallest green circle represents the legal limit. The other circles' areas are relative to the green circle and represent the lowest (80 times the legal limit) and highest (400 times the legal limit) levels of dioxin found in Irish pork and beef. On the evening of 6 December, the Food Safety Authority of Ireland ordered the recall, withdrawal and destruction of all Irish pork products dating back to 1 September. It was announced that \\"dioxins & dioxin like PCBs\\", a group of highly toxic synthetic halogenated organic compounds, had been discovered in pork at levels between 80 and 200 times the EU's recommended safety limits. This contamination, which was first realised on 1 December, came about as a result of contamination of pig feed. The positive results for dioxins and dioxin like PCBs were confirmed on the afternoon of 6 December and announced within hours. The Irish general public were advised to destroy all their purchased pork products as Ireland's Department of Agriculture and the Food Safety Authority had initiated an investigation. and Contaminated feed was used at as many as forty-six farms in the Republic of Ireland of which thirty-seven raised cattle for beef and nine produced pork. Additionally, contaminated feed was used on eight cattle farms in Northern Ireland. Beef products, from cattle who may have been fed contaminated feed, were judged to be safe and were not recalled from market. One cattle farm in Northern Ireland used the feed for beef and dairy cattle, and milk from this farm was removed from the food supply. Following the discovery, the Taoiseach, Brian Cowen and the Irish Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Brendan Smith attended talks at their government's Department of Agriculture. Alongside them were the Minister for Health, Mary Harney and Minister of State for Food, Horticulture and Food Safety, Minister of State for Food and Horticulture, Trevor Sargent and Minister of State (with special responsibility for Health Promotion and Food Safety), Mary Wallace. The opposition party Fine Gael's spokesperson for agriculture, Michael Creed described the discovery as \\"potentially the biggest threat to the agriculture food sector since the outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease\\". On the afternoon of 7 December, the FSAI claimed identification of the source as a contaminated ingredient which had been added to pork feed, and said it was now considered that the profile of dioxins located is similar to those found in electronic transformer oils. On the evening of that same day, RT√â, the state-run broadcaster, reported that the source of the crisis was a processing plant in County Carlow (see #Millstream Power Recycling Limited). A garda investigation was launched. The Association of Pigmeat Processors refused to continue slaughtering pigs, insisting they needed a massive financial package (up to ‚Ç¨1 billion) from the Irish government to assist them with the mass recall. The European Union maintained that there would be no funding for the Irish pork industry in the wake of the crisis. Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny criticised the Irish government, calling the crisis \\"an unmitigated disaster\\". =Affected products= Most pork products are at risk of contamination; however, pork gelatine, products containing pork gelatine such as sweets, crisps and snack foods and sauces with pork or ham content are not. =Health effects of dioxins and PCBs= Olympic sized swimming pool. Dioxins and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are two groups of predominately man-made toxic chemicals which, when consumed, affect both the immune and reproductive systems and are classified as probably carcinogenic by the World Health Organization and in the United States by the National Cancer Institute and the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry.Fact Sheet on dioxin in feed and food. Europa, Brussels, 20 July 2001. The toxicity of dioxins and dioxin like PCBs is mediated by their ability to bind strongly to the aryl hydrocarbon cell receptor that is present in most animals. Several epidemiological studies have observed a correlation between high levels of dioxins and PCBs in humans and a wide variety of adverse health effects e.g. chloracne, lowering of IQ, dysfunction of the thyroid gland and reduction of thyroid hormone levels, elevated rates of endometriosis in women, higher levels of diabetes in women, precocious puberty in females and subtle developmental delay in children, as evidenced by altered play activity. Males appear to be more sensitive to poisoning by high levels of dioxins & dioxin-like PCBs and are more likely to develop severe symptoms e.g. young men poisoned by TCDD (the most toxic dioxin) are less likely to father boys. See Geusau et al. (2001) who describe the clinical manifestations of two extremely severe (and probably criminal) dioxin poisoning cases. Much of the hazard posed by dioxins and PCBs comes from their environmental persistence and their lipophilic nature, resulting their propensity to accumulate in the food chain, particularity in the fat of animals. About 80% of human exposure to dioxins and PCBs comes from animal derived foods e.g. poultry, beef and dairy. However, the health effects and risks of long-term, low-level exposure to the general public cannot be observed directly, and are highly controversial. It is not known if the dose response relationship at low-levels of exposure is sub-linear or linear, or has a threshold i.e. harmless at very low levels. Risk assessments are further complicated by the observation that contamination typically involves a complex mixture of related chemicals, the toxicity of each varies and has to be factored according to its Toxic Equivalency Factor (TEF) (where TCDD = 1). The product of TEF is the Toxic Equivalent Quantity (TEQ), and it is this value that is used in risk assessments (an on-line Toxic Equivalency Quantity Calculator). The European Union (EU) uses a linear dose response curve at low- levels of exposure, below the point where there are epidemiological data. In other words, the EU assumes there is no safe level of dioxins and PCBs. Accordingly, the European Union sets extremely stringent limits for dioxin and dioxin like PCBs in food, set just above the usual background levels found in various food categories e.g. fish, poultry, beef, pork etc. The limit set for dioxins in pork fat and meat is 1 pg/g TEQ i.e. 1 parts per trillion (ppt) (see swimming pool illustration). The maximum dioxin contamination measured in Irish pork was 0.2 ng/g TEQ fat (200 ppt), equivalent to dispersing 10 drops of TCDD throughout a 2.5 million litre Olympic sized swimming pool. =Millstream Power Recycling Limited= Wexford County Council planning file number 20040404 (accessed 10 March 2010) RT√â News has named the company behind the contaminated animal feed as Millstream Power Recycling Limited, located just outside Fenagh, County Carlow in the south-east of the country. All production at the plant was stopped in the week before the announcement, when a link between it and the contaminated feed was first suspected. A representative of the firm, Edward Curtin, denied reports of a use of industrial oil in the contaminated pig feed, saying that, whilst oil is used to power the machinery used for processing, he is not certain that this is the source of the outbreak. The oil, at the firm's insistence, was only ever purchased from \\"legitimate suppliers\\" within the Republic of Ireland. The owner of Millstream Power Recycling Limited was named as Robert Hogg (43).Mister Dioxin- The Evening Herald, Wednesday December 10, 2008. =The Irish pork industry= The pork industry is the fourth biggest in Ireland's agriculture sector, worth around ‚Ç¨400 million per year to the Irish economy. The country's farms produce over 3 million pigs per annum, almost 50% of which are consumed within the Republic. The remainder is exported, heavily to the neighbouring territories of Northern Ireland and Britain, but it also features in grocery stores and processed meats throughout two continents ‚Äì Europe and Asia. In 2007, Ireland exported 113,000 tons of pig meat, nearly half of which went to the United Kingdom. Over 500,000 live pigs were also shipped to the UK for slaughter and processing in that country. Ireland's other major customers of its pork are Germany, the buyer of 9,000 tons in 2007; France, Italy and several countries within the boundaries of Eastern Europe, which together purchased over 20,000 tons, Russia, the buyer of 6,600 tons, and China, which came into the ownership of 1,100 tons. A lunchtime protest by dislocated workers was to take place on 11 December outside Leinster House (above). =Effects= Within two days of the first announcement 1,800 jobs had been lost in the Irish pig industry with a further 6,000 jobs said to be at risk by Ireland's largest trade union SIPTU. Ireland's largest pig meat processor, Rosderra Irish Meats Group Ltd., turned away all of its 850 employees at four plants on 8 December, telling them to sign up for state unemployment benefits. Workers in the pork industry who were laid off in the wake of the crisis, including those from affected plants in Edenderry, Waterford and Kilkenny, were carried out a lunchtime protest at Leinster House (government buildings in Dublin) on 11 December. SIPTU organised the demonstration citing \\"delays in resuming production\\" and the financial \\"dire straits\\" some workers were in as their reasons. Processors halted the slaughtering of pigs until the Irish government promised them financial reparation. c.100,000 pigs were slaughtered and the estimated costs of the crisis was ‚Ç¨100 million. =Reactions= Local reactions Within hours a number of local newspapers in Ireland including the Longford Leader and the Leitrim Observer had reproduced copies of the same Press Association article. National reactions The Food Safety Authority of Ireland moved immediately to reassure the general public of Ireland. Speaking on RT√â Radio on the morning after the initial announcement, Deputy chief executive of the FSAI, Alan Reilly said it was \\"necessary as a precautionary measure\\" to remove all pork products from within the country. He said he \\"expected\\" pork products to be available again before the busy Christmas period got underway and is scheduled to meet government officials and retailers within hours. Irish hotels and guesthouses were immediately notified of the unfolding situation and asked to dispose of all their pork products by the Irish Hotels Federation. Some Tesco outlets initially only gave refunds for their own branded pork produce but have since begun issuing refunds to all affected Irish products. Superquinn however gave full refunds. A helpline set up by the Food Safety Authority of Ireland had received 3,000 calls within 72 hours of the outbreak. International reactions The UK's Food Standards Agency has said it does not believe its country's consumers face \\"significant risk\\" but it was still awaiting confirmation from the Irish authorities that the affected products had not been exported to its neighbour. Chief Scientist Andrew Wadge stated on his FSA blog that because dioxins remain in the body for approximately 30 years, exceeding regulatory limits for a few days has an \\"insignificant\\" effect on the individual consumer. The Tolerable Daily Intake standard sets a level that is without appreciable risk to health over a prolonged period. In Asia, South Korea has banned imports and advised retailers to stop selling Irish produce, Singapore was following suit, whilst China has \\"provisionally\\" stopped importation. Japan has also said it may recall Irish pork products. =Press= Within twelve hours of the pork recall announcement, the international press was carrying the story and within thirty-six hours there were over 1,700 newspaper articles on the crisis globally. Tabloid The Sun announced the story as \\"Toxic Irish pork is swept off shelves\\" whilst the Daily Mirror opted for \\"Poison pork panic: Irish pigs were fed on plastic bags\\". Daily Express ran the story under the banner headline \\"Shoppers told: Don't eat toxic Irish pork\\" and the Daily Mail went with the headline \\"British shoppers 'may not be able to tell whether they have Irish poison pork in their fridge'\\". The Times had the headline \\"Shops rush to take Irish pork off shelves\\", warning that EU labelling laws meant pork originating in Ireland could have been labelled as British. Le Monde had the top-five most e-mailed website headline \\"Dioxin alert in Irish pork\\" and The Straits Times website had the crisis as its second most popular story. El Pa√≠s reported its concern that contaminated meat might have arrived in Spain via France and Portugal. The New York Times, under the headline \\"Ireland investigating tainted pork\\" and The Washington Post, under the headline \\"Ireland recalls pork products after dioxin test\\", covered the story in their own short ways. AFP had the headline \\"Ireland scrambles to contain pork cancer scare\\" and the Xinhua News Agency was one of the earliest news agencies to follow the story with headlines including \\"Irish police to investigate pork contamination\\". CNN tagged the story as \\"another red flag being waved over dinner tables this week with warnings from the Irish government not to eat its pork products\\", comparing the crisis to bovine spongiform encephalopathy, bird flu and the 2008 Chinese milk scandal. An Irish supermarket six days following the outbreak of the crisis, only offering Danish pork for sale. =Return to shelves= Superquinn has said it would have Irish pork, traceable to one farm in County Kilkenny on shelves by 11 December, becoming the first Irish supermarket chain to do so. However, as early as 7pm on 10 December Irish retailer Dunnes had approved Galtee ham back on shelves for sale. Other affected foods =Beef= Twenty one cattle farms in the Republic were discovered to have used the contaminated pig feed, whilst eight cattle farms used it in Northern Ireland. It was disclosed on 18 December 2008 that beef samples from the affected farms had dioxin levels between 100 and 400 times above the legal limit. The Irish authorities went to great lengths to insist that the threat to public health from Irish beef products, despite the extremely high dioxin levels, was insignificant. It was noted that the official announcement made no reference to the dioxin levels being 100 to 400 times the legal limit. In a statement the FSAI recommended \\"that cattle which are locked down from these 21 farms should now be slaughtered and not allowed enter the food chain\\". There was to be no public recall of Irish beef. The European Commission was being kept informed. However, 3,000 animals from these herds have been slaughtered and have already entered the food chain since September. The UK's Food Standards Agency was conducting tests to assess the level of dioxins present in Northern Irish cattle herds. =Milk= One farm in Northern Ireland has been identified as having fed contaminated animal feed to dairy cattle. Northern Ireland's Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety, Michael McGimpsey has announced restrictions on milk supplies in the province. European Food Safety Authority's statement In its statement issued on 10 December 2008, The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) considered that the levels of dioxin & dioxin like PCBs in Irish pork, before the contaminated pork was withdrawn, posed no risk to health. The EFSA calculated a number of different exposure scenarios, and they found that if a consumer ate Irish pork each day over the 90-day period, 10% of which was contaminated, the \\"increase in the body burden [would be] of no concern for this single event\\". In the \\"very extreme case\\" of eating large amounts of 100% contaminated Irish pork every day over the 90-day period in question, the EFSA considered that \\"this unlikely scenario would reduce protection, but not necessarily lead to adverse health effects\\". However the EFSA warns that its calculations are \\"Based on the very limited new data related to the current contamination incident of pork, which were made available to EFSA\\"Statement of EFSA on the risks for public health due to the presence of dioxins in pork from Ireland (Question No EFSA-Q-2008-777), Issued on 10 December 2008 The EFSA Journal (2008) 911, 1 of 15 and concludes its statement with the \\"EFSA based this statement on a limited data set\\". It also makes clear that its calculations assumed that exposure at these high levels only began in September 2008. If it would be found that the animal feed had been contaminated prior to September 2008 then it would be have to re-evaluate its findings. The statement did not address the issue of contaminated beef. Criminal investigation A criminal investigation commenced in December 2008 and on 6 March 2010 it was reported in the Irish Times that a criminal prosecution would be taken in relation to the incident. Civil case Millstream Recycling Ltd. has taken a civil case against Gerard Tierney of Blackrock, and against his company Newtown Lodge Ltd. Millstream claims its pig feed products were contaminated by \\"defective\\" oil supplied by Mr. Tierney and his company.

It is a rarity for the species to enter the aquarium trade.  Description  An adult Griffis angelfish is an ashy white with a solid black band from the head to the lower side of the caudal peduncle, and has another contrasting white band running within the black. A quarter-sized black spot marks the back of the head, though finer black dots may also appear near the head. The dorsal fin is primarily black, while the anal and pelvic fins are white. Juvenile angelfish of this species have more contrasting colors and lack the smaller black dots. Adult angels of this species can reach 9.8 inches in length. Sexual dimorphism is not found in this species, though it is suspected that males are slightly larger.  Habitat  This species frequents outer coral reefs, rocky ledges, and reef drop-offs between 33‚Äì361 feet below the surface. Scattered throughout the Pacific Ocean, the angels can be found anywhere from Southeast Asian coasts to the Line Islands in the Central Pacific. The Griffis are usually solitary fish, though they have been seen in pairs or small groups.  Diet  They have been observed feeding on sponges and tunicates, and it is theorized their diet also consists of weeds, benthic algae, and zoobenthos due to similar feeding habits within their genus.  Reproduction  Very little information is available for this species breeding habits as they have not been bred in any aquarium or laboratory. Generally, angelfish are broadcast spawners, in which males and females release eggs and sperm into the water column at dusk upon the females' signal and eggs are fertilized.  Lifespan  While the specific lifespan of this angelfish is unknown, the average lifespan of angelfish is 10‚Äì15 years.  Status  Griffis angelfish are charted on the IUCN Red List as Least Concern due to the generally large population across a wide range of the Pacific. There are no major identified major threats.  In the Aquarium  The species is generally considered a moderately difficult fish to keep and recommended for experienced aquarists. The true difficulty comes when looking for a healthy specimen, as the fish is rarely seen in the aquarium trade. While considered moderately hardy, this angelfish thrives in pristine water conditions and requires a minimum tank size of 100 gallons. If the aquarist desires to keep more than one specimen or multiple species of angel fish, the tank should be over 150 gallons and specimens should be introduced at the same time. This particular angel requires much open space for free swimming and a moderate amount of live rock to serve as a hiding place. High-quality sponge foods are required to entice the angel to eat, and should be supplemented with algae sheets and occasional treats of meaty foods. It is best to feed this angel small amounts several times a day. It is not a reef safe fish, and will consume corals, invertebrates, etc. References Pyle, R., Myers, R., Rocha, L.A. & Craig, M.T. 2010. Apolemichthys griffisi.

It is also known as \\"displacement threshold energy\\" or just \\"displacement energy\\". In a crystal, a separate threshold displacement energy exists for each crystallographic direction. Then one should distinguish between the minimum T_{d,min} and average T_{d,ave} over all lattice directions threshold displacement energies. In amorphous solids it may be possible to define an effective displacement energy to describe some other average quantity of interest. Threshold displacement energies in typical solids are of the order of 10 - 50 eV. M. Nastasi, J. Mayer, and J.

Smith (ed.), Atomic & ion collisions in solids and at surfaces: theory, simulation and applications, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK, 1997  Theory and simulation  The threshold displacement energy is a materials property relevant during high-energy particle radiation of materials. The maximum energy T_{max} that an irradiating particle can transfer in a binary collision to an atom in a material is given by (including relativistic effects) T_{max} = {2 M E (E+2 m c^2) \\\\over (m+M)^2 c^2+2 M E} where E is the kinetic energy and m the mass of the incoming irradiating particle and M the mass of the material atom. c is the velocity of light. If the kinetic energy E is much smaller than the mass m c^2 of the irradiating particle, the equation reduces to T_{max} = E {4 M m \\\\over (m+M)^2 } In order for a permanent defect to be produced from initially perfect crystal lattice, the kinetic energy that it receives T_{max} must be larger than the formation energy of a Frenkel pair. However, while the Frenkel pair formation energies in crystals are typically around 5‚Äì10 eV, the average threshold displacement energies are much higher, 20‚Äì50 eV. The reason for this apparent discrepancy is that the defect formation is a complex multi-body collision process (a small collision cascade) where the atom that receives a recoil energy can also bounce back, or kick another atom back to its lattice site. Hence, even the minimum threshold displacement energy is usually clearly higher than the Frenkel pair formation energy. Each crystal direction has in principle its own threshold displacement energy, so for a full description one should know the full threshold displacement surface T_d(\\\\theta,\\\\phi) = T_d([hkl]) for all non-equivalent crystallographic directions [hkl]. Then T_{d,min} = \\\\min(T_d(\\\\theta,\\\\phi)) and T_{d,ave} = {\\\\rm ave}(T_d(\\\\theta,\\\\phi)) where the minimum and average is with respect to all angles in three dimensions. An additional complication is that the threshold displacement energy for a given direction is not necessarily a step function, but there can be an intermediate energy region where a defect may or may not be formed depending on the random atom displacements. The one can define a lower threshold where a defect may be formed T^l_d, and an upper one where it is certainly formed T^u_d . The difference between these two may be surprisingly large, and whether or not this effect is taken into account may have a large effect on the average threshold displacement energy. . It is not possible to write down a single analytical equation that would relate e.g. elastic material properties or defect formation energies to the threshold displacement energy. Hence theoretical study of the threshold displacement energy is conventionally carried out using either classical or quantum mechanical molecular dynamics computer simulations. Although an analytical description of the displacement is not possible, the \\"sudden approximation\\" gives fairly good approximations of the threshold displacement energies at least in covalent materials and low- index crystal directions An example molecular dynamics simulation of a threshold displacement event is available in . The animation shows how a defect (Frenkel pair, i.e. an interstitial and vacancy) is formed in silicon when a lattice atom is given a recoil energy of 20 eV in the 100 direction. The data for the animation was obtained from density functional theory molecular dynamics computer simulations. Such simulations have given significant qualitative insights into the threshold displacement energy, but the quantitative results should be viewed with caution. The classical interatomic potentials are usually fit only to equilibrium properties, and hence their predictive capability may be limited. Even in the most studied materials such as Si and Fe, there are variations of more than a factor of two in the predicted threshold displacement energies. The quantum mechanical simulations based on density functional theory (DFT) are likely to be much more accurate, but very few comparative studies of different DFT methods on this issue have yet been carried out to assess their quantitative reliability.  Experimental studies  The threshold displacement energies have been studied extensively with electron irradiation experiments. Electrons with kinetic energies of the order of hundreds of keVs or a few MeVs can to a very good approximation be considered to collide with a single lattice atom at a time. Since the initial energy for electrons coming from a particle accelerator is accurately known, one can thus at least in principle determine the lower minimum threshold displacement T^l_{d,min} energy by irradiating a crystal with electrons of increasing energy until defect formation is observed. Using the equations given above one can then translate the electron energy E into the threshold energy T. If the irradiation is carried out on a single crystal in a known crystallographic directions one can determine also direction-specific thresholds T_d^l(\\\\theta,\\\\phi). There are several complications in interpreting the experimental results, however. To name a few, in thick samples the electron beam will spread, and hence the measurement on single crystals does not probe only a single well-defined crystal direction. Impurities may cause the threshold to appear lower than they would be in pure materials.  Temperature dependence  Particular care has to be taken when interpreting threshold displacement energies at temperatures where defects are mobile and can recombine. At such temperatures, one should consider two distinct processes: the creation of the defect by the high-energy ion (stage A), and subsequent thermal recombination effects (stage B). The initial stage A. of defect creation, until all excess kinetic energy has dissipated in the lattice and it is back to its initial temperature T0, takes < 5 ps. This is the fundamental (\\"primary damage\\") threshold displacement energy, and also the one usually simulated by molecular dynamics computer simulations. After this (stage B), however, close Frenkel pairs may be recombined by thermal processes. Since low-energy recoils just above the threshold only produce close Frenkel pairs, recombination is quite likely. Hence on experimental time scales and temperatures above the first (stage I) recombination temperature, what one sees is the combined effect of stage A and B. Hence the net effect often is that the threshold energy appears to increase with increasing temperature, since the Frenkel pairs produced by the lowest- energy recoils above threshold all recombine, and only defects produced by higher-energy recoils remain. Since thermal recombination is time-dependent, any stage B kind of recombination also implies that the results may have a dependence on the ion irradiation flux. In a wide range of materials, defect recombination occurs already below room temperature. E.g. in metals the initial (\\"stage I\\") close Frenkel pair recombination and interstitial migration starts to happen already around 10-20 K.P. Ehrhart, Properties and interactions of atomic defects in metals and alloys, volume 25 of Landolt-B\\"ornstein, New Series III, chapter 2, page 88, Springer, Berlin, 1991 Similarly, in Si major recombination of damage happens already around 100 K during ion irradiation and 4 K during electron irradiation Even the stage A threshold displacement energy can be expected to have a temperature dependence, due to effects such as thermal expansion, temperature dependence of the elastic constants and increased probability of recombination before the lattice has cooled down back to the ambient temperature T0. These effects, are, however, likely to be much weaker than the stage B thermal recombination effects.  Relation to higher-energy damage production  The threshold displacement energy is often used to estimate the total amount of defects produced by higher energy irradiation using the Kinchin-Pease or NRT equationsASTM Standard E693-94, Standard practice for characterising neutron exposure in iron and low alloy steels in terms of displacements per atom (dpa), 1994 which says that the number of Frenkel pairs produced N_{FP} for a nuclear deposited energy of F_{Dn} is N_{FP} = 0.8 {F_{Dn} \\\\over 2 T_{d,ave}} for any nuclear deposited energy above 2 T_{d,ave}/0.8. However, this equation should be used with great caution for several reasons. For instance, it does not account for any thermally activated recombination of damage, nor the well known fact that in metals the damage production is for high energies only something like 20% of the Kinchin-Pease prediction. The threshold displacement energy is also often used in binary collision approximation computer codes such as SRIMhttp://www.srim.org to estimate damage. However, the same caveats as for the Kinchin-Pease equation also apply for these codes (unless they are extended with a damage recombination model). Moreover, neither the Kinchin-Pease equation nor SRIM take in any way account of ion channeling, which may in crystalline or polycrystalline materials reduce the nuclear deposited energy and thus the damage production dramatically for some ion-target combinations. For instance, keV ion implantation into the Si 110 crystal direction leads to massive channeling and thus reductions in stopping power. Similarly, light ion like He irradiation of a BCC metal like Fe leads to massive channeling even in a randomly selected crystal direction.K.

It is native to the Indo-Pacific, more specifically an area from the Cocos-Keeling Atoll to the Society Islands, ranging north to the Yaeyama Islands and south to the Great Barrier Reef. This species is the only member of its genus.Delrieu-Trottin, E., Williams, J.T., Bacchet, P., Kulbicki, M., Mourier, J., Galzin, R., Lison de Loma, T., Mou-Tham, G., Siu, G. & Planes, S. (2015): Shore fishes of the Marquesas Islands, an updated checklist with new records and new percentage of endemic species. Check List, 11 (5): 1-13. P. multifasciata is a deeper-bodied species of dwarf angelfish. It has a white base color with eight black vertical bars that become yellowish ventrally and it grows to 12 cm SL. Juveniles possess fewer bars and have a distinctive ocellus on their dorsal fin that fades when they grow.http://www.wetwebmedia.com/ca/volume_6/volume_6_2/multifasciata.htm It inhabits caves and crevices in outer reef slopes and can be found in depths between 20m and 70m. P. multifasciata feeds on algae, sponges, tunicates and other benthic invertebrates and small crustaceans and can often be seen foraging upside-down on cave ceilings. Paracentropyge multifasciata lives in harems with one dominant male and usually multiple females. Like all other angelfish it is a protogynous hermaphrodite, with all individuals being female initially and the dominant ones changing to males. Barred angelfish are broadcast spawners, releasing their gametes into the water column after an intense and lengthy mating ritual. They show no parental care. The larvae hatch after 16‚Äì18 hours from the small eggs (0.7mm in diameter). They have a pelagic phase of up to 50 dayshttp://www.rcthawaii.com/angel/5.htm after which they become benthic and metamorphose into juveniles. In the aquarium This species is one of the medium priced dwarf angelfish with sales prices usually ranging from $50 to $100 per specimen (2010). Availability may vary but P. multifasciata cannot be considered \\"rare\\" in the trade. They usually arrive in fish stores in good health, problems can however arise when keeping them in sterile quarantine settings without live rock where not enough food can be found, as barred angelfish often do not accept artificial or frozen foods initially. Aquarists will therefore have to weigh the risks of skipping quarantine. Applying freshwater dips before placing P. multifasciata in their tanks is usually sufficient to prevent the introduction of protozoans via these fish. Barred angelfish are social fish and should be kept in pairs or larger groups in large enough reef tank settings. Keeping more than one specimen also facilitates weaning them onto frozen or prepared foods (pelleted fish food or flakes, Artemia, Mysis, mussels and fresh oysters). After introduction to the tank P. multifasciata can be quite shy and reclusive, but when they have established their territory this will almost always improve. Outgoing but not too aggressive tank mates, such as for example surgeonfish or butterflyfish can help with overcoming timidness. When keeping barred angelfish with other species of angelfishes, the different levels of aggressiveness of the different species have to be taken into account, as P. multifasciata is one of the less aggressive members of the genus.

It opened in September 1999 and has KGI to grade 12 with students representing around 18 nationalities. The Saudi Arabia Ministry of Education, General Administration, approves the school for expatriate education. The language of instruction is English. The Jubail International School is a university preparatory school educating students primarily for British universities. The first graduating class, in 2002-2003, grade 12, completed course requirements for a high school diploma. In addition to the British IGCSE, A Level and AS Level examinations, students at Jubail International School also have the option to take the American College Board Examinations including the (TOEFL, SAT I, and SAT II examinations. Students also have the option to apply to take the IB Diploma Programme. The school's curriculum, however, maintains a focus on the British system.  History  The tradition of Al-Hussan education in Saudi Arabia began in 1956 when Sheikh Abdel Aziz Rashid Al-Hussan started the Arab Cultural Institute for adult education. In the following year Al-Hussan Modern Girls School, the first girls‚Äô school in the Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia, was opened. Today there are twelve schools and other educational institutes throughout the Eastern Province rated among the best in Saudi Arabia, with enrolment of over 6,000 students. Al-Hussan International Schools are the most recent addition to the organization. Although they are still young in age, they have grown steadily and their occupancy is increasing rapidly. The occupancy for the year 2001-2002 was 540 students in the Khobar School and 285 students in the Jubail School, and waiting lists are now in existence for several grades -a testament to parental belief in the standard of education offered in these establishments. Both Al-Hussan International Schools are English medium day schools, enrolling students from Kindergarten through Grade 12.  Campus  The Jubail International School is housed in a purpose-built centrally air-conditioned school building. The single-level facility includes 24 classrooms, library, fully equipped science laboratory, multi-purpose room, computer laboratory and large art room. The outdoor play area consists of two basketball courts, soccer ground and protected kindergarten playground on spacious grounds. = New campus = On 1 January 2011, the building of the school was changed. The new building is centrally air-conditioned with an indoor gym. = Splitting = With the oil boom in early 2000s, Jubail Industrial City saw a huge increase in population. The number of students grew rapidly in the school; the administration decided to split the school in two sections, one separate for boys and another separate for girls. The change was completed successfully in late 2008. Initially the teachers commuted but later new teachers were hired to cover up the gap and yet the gap is currently bigger than ever. Both of the new sections are closely situated and there is usual traffic of teachers between the schools to discuss important matters regarding exams and preparation .  Student council  The student body has its own well-structured union to represent it. The structure is typical of that of any International School. It consists of a President and Vice President along with the Secretary and there are members, called reps, from all grades. It is a very democratic type of system and elections are held each year to elect the council. The motto of the student council, as it is depicted on the logo is \\"Making it happen...\\"  Admission  The Jubail International School admission policy is competitive. All students are required to take a diagnostic exam for grade/level placement in English and Mathematics. All students must choose a second language: French, Arabic or Urdu.  Accreditation  The school is endorsed by some of highly respected organisations. These include CITA (Commission on Trans Regional Accreditation) and CIS (Council of International Schools). The school is also the testing centre for British IGCSE, AS Level and A Level examinations.  Special Achievements  Two of the students among the six students who excelled in CIE Examination board in Saudi Arabia were from Jubail International School.

Major General Edward Lacon Ommanney Royal Engineers was his eldest brother and Prebendary George Druce Wynne Ommanney was a younger brother.L. G. C.

Retrieved on 12 December 2008. The ship then went to the Mediterranean, and on 20 October 1827 Ommanney took part in the Battle of Navarino aged just 13. The captured flag of the Turkish Commander-in-Chief was handed down by seniority among the surviving officers until 1890, when Ommanney, the sole survivor of the action, presented it to King George I of Greece. Having passed his naval examination in 1833, Ommanney served for a short period as mate in the brig HMS Pantaloon. On 10 December 1835 he was promoted lieutenant, and in the same month was appointed to the transport ship HMS Cove, which was ordered to Baffin Bay to release a number of whalers caught in the ice. He received the special commendation of the Admiralty for this dangerous service. In October 1836 he joined the frigate HMS Pique, and a year later he was appointed to HMS Donegal as flag-lieutenant to his uncle, now Sir John Ommanney, Commander-in- Chief on the Lisbon and Mediterranean stations. Ommanney was promoted commander on 9 October 1840, and from August 1841 to the end of 1844 served on board the steam sloop HMS Vesuvius in the Mediterranean Sea. Here he was employed on the coast of Morocco for the protection of British subjects during the French hostilities, which included the bombardment of Tangier by the Prince de Joinville's naval squadron. Ommanney was promoted captain on 9 November 1846, and from 1847 to 1848 was employed under the government commission during the Irish Famine, carrying into effect relief measures and the new poor law. In 1845 Ommanney was elected a Fellow of the Royal Geographical Society, and on 4 June 1848 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS). When Captain Horatio Austin was appointed to command HMS Resolute during the Franklin search expedition in February 1850, he chose his friend Ommanney as second in command. The Resolute and Ommanney's ship, HMS Assistance, each had a steam tender (Pioneer and Intrepid). The expedition also organized an extensive system of sledge journeys, by which means the coast of Prince of Wales Island was surveyed. On 25 August 1850 Ommanney discovered the first traces of the fate of Sir John Franklin, which proved that his ships had wintered at Beechey Island when he discovered \\"fragments of stores and ragged clothing and the remains of an encampment\\".\\"Northwest Passage : the search for Franklin and the discovery of the passage.\\" British Library Online Gallery (29 September 2008). Retrieved on 12 December 2008.Explorers and Exploration, by Marshall Cavendish Corporation (2005), p. 276. On the headland of nearby Beechey Island, Ommanney found a large cairn. More relics were scattered nearby but, although the cairn was dismantled, no further traces of the ill-fated expedition were to be found. The expedition returned to England in October 1851. In December 1851 Ommanney was appointed Deputy Controller-General of HM Coastguard, holding this position until the Crimean War of 1854, when he commissioned HMS Eurydice as senior officer of a small squadron in the White Sea, where he blockaded Archangel, stopping the coasting trade, and destroyed Russian Government property. His White Sea service ended in a battle between his squadron and a Solovetsky Monastery. Ommanney's service in the Baltic was marked by his aggressive operations against Russian shore positions and gunboats, summoning defenceless towns to surrender, and his exaggerated reports of successes.R. S. Dundas, Russian war, 1855, Baltic: official correspondence, ed. D.

On 27 February 1844 he married Amelia (Emily) Mary (d. 17 May 1857), the daughter of Samuel Smith of HM Dockyard, Malta. Their son Erasmus Austin Ommanney joined the Royal Navy in 1863, retired with the rank of commander in 1879, took holy orders in 1883, and was vicar of St Michael's, Southsea, from 1892 to 1911. Later years Ommanney married Mary Stone in 1862. She died on 1 September 1906, aged 81. In March 1867 he was appointed Knight of the Order of the Bath. On 14 July 1871 Ommanney was promoted to vice admiral, retiring on 1 January 1875. He was promoted to admiral on the retired list on 1 August 1877, in which year he was knighted for his scientific work in the Arctic. He had been elected FRS in 1868 for the same reason, and to the end of his life continued to take a great interest in geographical work and service subjects. He attended meetings of the Royal Geographical Society and the Royal United Service Institution, and for many years he was a councillor of both bodies, and of the British Association for the Advancement of Science. He was also a JP for Hampshire. Following the succession of King Edward VII, he was among several retired admirals appointed to advancement as Knights Commander of the Order of the Bath in the 1902 Coronation Honours list published on 26 June 1902, and was appointed Knight Commander (KCB) in an investiture on board the royal yacht Victoria and Albert outside Cowes on 15 August 1902, the day before the fleet review held there to mark the coronation. Ommanney died on 21 December 1904 at his son's home, St Michael's vicarage, St Michael's Road, Southsea, Hampshire, and was buried in Old Mortlake Cemetery. Ommanney Bay on Prince of Wales Island, and Erasmus Ommanney Island (, Ostrov Ommani), a small crescent-shaped island located off the northwestern tip of Jackson Island in Arctic Russia, are named after him.

It is named in honor of Frederick A. Potter, the former director of the Waikiki Aquarium. Description Potter's angelfish grows to a size of in length. The fish is orange in color, with the bottom rear part of the fish being dark blue in color. The fish is covered with irregular, close-set, thin, vertical blue stripes. There have been reports of this angelfish with a unique morphology, whereas the most common coloration includes orange, in these individual(s) varying shades of blue replace all of the orange.[3] (See \\"In The Aquarium section for more details) These fish inhabit rocky ledges, where they are found feeding on algae and detritus. This species is essentially hermaphrodite and generally has a dominant male with a harem of females in the wild. Distribution and habitat This fish is native to the Johnston Atoll and the Hawaiian Islands in the central Pacific Ocean. Its depth range is . It is a bentho-pelagic species and its typical habitat is rock, coral and rubble areas of exposed reefs. Status Potter's angelfish has a wide range and is a common reef fish. Collection for the aquarium trade is not excessive and its numbers seem stable so the IUCN lists it as being of \\"Least Concern\\".  In the aquarium  Potter's angelfish is generally reef compatible, however, like most dwarf angelfish, it has been known to nip at the polyps of stony corals. It will usually accept a varied diet of live food, frozen foods, meaty items, flake food and plenty of algae. However, some specimens may be very difficult to feed in an aquarium. Potter's angelfish are best kept on their own or in pairs because they will fight with others of their own kind. This fish is peaceful and is generally only aggressive to similar species and its own kind. These brightly colored fish are usually very difficult to keep due to their complex dietary and environmental requirements. While the orange and blue coloration mentioned above is by far the most commonly found in Aquaria, two of the rare blue color morphs were recently discovered off the coast of Kona, Hawaii at depths of 60 meters. After being collected they were sold, with one going to Kyoto, Japan (where rare marine animals are highly sought after, and will usually fetch a much higher price) for a reported ¬•600,000(~$5000).[3] References 3\\\\.

It was created by Team One, a unit of Saatchi & Saatchi. The advertisement showed a ball bearing rolling smoothly down the panel seams of a Lexus sedan, thus demonstrating the precise quality of its exterior elements. The television spot won awards, was emulated by subsequent commercials, and was credited for focusing industry attention on body tolerances.Jackson, Richard F. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Perspectives on the Future of Manufacturing Engineering Synopsis The advertisement showed the Lexus ES 300 on an articulating stand. A lab-suited technician places a silver ball bearing on the hood seam, and lets go. The ball bearing rolls smoothly down the seam as if on a track. As the stand rotates, moving the ES 300 slowly around several axes, the ball bearing travels across the roof, grille, tail lamps, in a continuous uninterrupted motion, without falling. The narration reads, \\"Every sports sedan is supposed to do well in the fast lane. But what about these lanes...? At Lexus, we achieved extremely tight tolerances between all major body panels. So not only does the ES 300 look like it's put together well, it actually is put together well.\\" Reception The advertisement received a Clio Award for Best Special Effects in a Television Advertisement, awarded to Special Effects director John Frazier of Fxperts Inc.Fxperts - Lexus Ball Bearing Commercial Ball Bearing was named one of its Best Spots of 1992 by industry publication Adweek. The National Institute of Standards and Technology in the United States, as part of its Advanced Technology Project (an awards program for the development of high-risk, early-stage technologies for the U.S. industry), worked with General Motors, Chrysler, two universities, and suppliers on the \\"2-millimeter project.\\" The goal of this project was to develop a new standard for automotive body dimension control, with a goal being to be able to duplicate the Lexus ball bearing test on a U.S.-built car. The advertisement was credited with focusing attention on quality in the United States. Later versions Other advertisers referenced Ball Bearing in subsequent commercials,PBS Frontline: merchants of cool: douglas rushkoff: coercion including car manufacturer Nissan who duplicated the ball bearing test and other Lexus displays in subsequent ads.Robert Goldman, Stephen Papson. Sign Wars: The Cluttered Landscape of Advertising. Guilford Press, 1996 , p. 34 The Nissan ads, designed for the debut of the Nissan Altima in 1993, demonstrated a similar display of ball bearings on their less expensive vehicle, with a narrator saying, \\"When we at Nissan saw Lexus do a test like this to show how well their car was put together, we were impressed, so we decided to do the same test on the new $13,000 Nissan Altima.\\" In 1993, Saturday Night Live parodied the sequence in a mock commercial for the Chameleon XLE, a fictitious luxury car whose exterior looks deceptively like that of an abandoned vehicle in order to ward off potential thieves. In the ad, the ball is placed on the car's rusted, dented, and faded front left fender and falls through a rust hole in the hood. It then comes out the car's right front wheel well. The ad stars the late Phil Hartman. A Roy Rogers ad also parodied the Ball Bearing spot by rolling a ball bearing around the edge of a roast beef sandwich. The Roy Rogers ad went on to win an Addy Award on behalf of the Smithsonian Center for Advertising History.Bethesda Ad Agency Wins Top Honors; Earle Palmer Brown, Henry Kaufman Receive Addy Awards In 1995, Dirt Devil also parodied the Ball Bearing spot by rolling a ball bearing around the body of its MVP upright vacuum cleaner.Dirt Devil MVP Ball Bearing In 2008, Lexus again referenced Ball Bearing with a new version for the Lexus IS 250 AWD, which showed a ball bearing rolling on the seams of the vehicle before the car is driven across a sea of ball bearings.Lexus IS Ball Bearing Credits * Agency: Team One, El Segundo, California * Creative Director: Tom Cordner * Agency Director: Mike Mazza * Copy Writer: Steve Silver * Agency Producer: Francesca Cohn * Production Company: Sandbank Films * Director: Henry Sandbank * Editor: Stuart Waks, Stuart Waks & Co. * SFX Producer: John Frazier * Music: MachineHead: * Narrator: James Sloyan * Production Design: Michael Gaw References External links * The Ball Bearing ad on YouTube * Profile and credits on Adweek * Ball Bearing (Lexus), ad segment at FXperts * Ball Bearing IS (Lexus), related ad on YouTube * Altima (Nissan) follow-up ad on YouTube Lexus Advertising campaigns 1992 works American television commercials advertisement 1990s television commercials ","title":"Ball Bearing (advertisement)"},{"id":"20573324","text":"Sagda epistylioides is a species of air-breathing land snail, a terrestrial pulmonate gastropod mollusk in the family Sagdidae.

During this campaign Bolivia retired from the war after the Battle of Tacna, and Peru lost the port of Arica. Also, Manuel Baquedano assumed command as the new Commander in Chief of the Chilean Army, and the Allied Presidents were thrown out of office and replaced by Nicolas de Pierola in Peru and General Narciso Campero in Bolivia. Tacna and Arica Campaign Background =Tarapac√° Campaign= After Chile secured the sea with the victory at Angamos on October 8, 1879, the Chilean army prepared to assault Tarapac√° province. Hence, an amphibious operation was launched at Pisagua on November 2, pushing the Allies inland and obtaining an unshipping point to unload troops and material. Right after Pisagua, two Allied squadrons were slightly outnumbered and crushed at Pampa Germania on November 6, and Col. Emilio Sotomayor held off a 7,400 men Allied attack on November 19 at Dolores dwell, near San Francisco. The string of victories made the Chilean commanders too confident, and with poor information recklessly attacked the outnumbering Peruvian army at Tarapac√° on November 27, suffering a heavy defeat. Nevertheless, the Allies withdrew from Tarapac√° department, leaving it in Chilean hands. Chilean situation Once they had gained the Tarapac√° department, the saltpetre trade earnings went directly to the Chilean government, making the war effort much easier by allowing the purchase of supplies needed for the growing army. Chilean President Anibal Pinto sought to own the saltpetre factories, judging it safer to interpose Bolivia between Chile and Peru, and therefore prepared an invasion to Moquegua department in order to conquer Tacna and Arica, with the ultimate aim of ceding them to Bolivia. In the meantime, Gen. Erasmo Escala resigned his commission as Commander in Chief due to constant and bitter arguments with War Minister Rafael Sotomayor, who then replaced him with Gen. Manuel Baquedano, a Peru-Bolivian Confederacy war veteran. Allied situation The loss of Tarapac√° generated popular discontent in Peru and in Bolivia, resulting in the deposition of Mariano Ignacio Prado and Hilari√≥n Daza, who were replaced by Nicolas de Pierola and General Narciso Campero. Internal disputes arose between the Allies trying to decide who should lead the army. Finally Gen. Campero was appointed as the commander of the Allied forces, which totaled about 11,000 men. The Allies ceded the initiative to Chile, allowing her to choose the ensuing course of the campaign. With the Chilean domination of the sea so complete after the earlier battles, the Allies had no manoeuvre space for transporting huge contingents from north to south and vice versa. This also created extreme difficulties in terms of reinforcing the artillery, weaponry, and other supplies of war. Pierola did not mobilize the Second Southern Army in Arequipa to aid Montero at Tacna, and also replaced Peruvian officers with loyal civilians, resulting in a virtual crippling of the army command. The beginning =Disembark at Ilo and Pacocha= By the end of December 1879, the Chilean army decided to send a division in a scout expedition to Ilo and Pacocha in order to eliminate the Peruvian resistance in the area and to try to take enemy's supplies, with the order of making plans for a possible attack. The Chilean division was put under Lt. Col Aristides Martinez, and was formed by 500 men of the Lautaro Battalion and 12 riders of the Granaderos a Caballo Regiment. The Peruvian forces had been gathered at Tacna and Arica, so in order to make a successful attack the entire Chilean army to a place near both cities, avoiding crossing the Atacama Desert. On December 31, the Chilean troops disembarked and quickly took the port of Ilo, isolating Moquegua garrison of 1,300 soldiers and letting Martinez to move freely in the area, fulfilling the task commended. The expedition returned to Ilo the very next day and was re-embarked to Pisagua. Drawing of the blockade of Arica Between February 18 and 25, a twenty ship convoy unshipped 9,500 men divided into three divisions, while another one stood in Pisagua waiting the convoy to return. Simultaneously, the Peruvian port of Arica was put under a naval blockade by the warships Huascar and Magallanes. By the early days of March, another Chilean expedition under Col. Orozimbo Barbosa was sent to Mollendo, where 4,000 men were stationed. While the expedition was at sea, the garrison marched to Arequipa, leaving only 100 soldiers. The Navales Battalion occupied the town on March 8 without any skirmishes. On March 17, the Peruvian vessel Union made through the blockade unloading supplies to the garrison of Arica. The same day Baquedano occupied Moquegua while the first division of Montero's Southern Army under Col. Andres Gamarra withdrew to Los Angeles hill, seeking to assume a position easy to defend. Baquedano with 4,500 men marched over Los Angeles on March 20. =Los √Ångeles= Before the sunrise of March 22, 1880, while the 2nd Line and Santiago regiments attacked the sector of Quilin Quilin, the Atacama Battalion climbed the slope of Guaneros and caught the Peruvians from the rear, bayoneting them off their tactically superior positions. This forced the rest of the Allied soldiers to withdrew as well. On April, the Peruvian port of Callao was put under blockade, and at Locumba, a Chilean column forced some Peruvian forces under Gregorio Albarracin to retreat. Sotomayor resolved to move the entire army to Tacna, leaving Moquegua alone, not considering the Arequipa garrison at all. The Chilean army converged over the Sama river valley, set as a starting point to march across the desert towards Tacna, but the artillery was shipped to Ite. On May 20, Rafael Sotomayor died of a stroke at Las Yaras, and Jose Francisco Vergara was designed as his replacement. With Sotomayor's death, the army command was put under Gen. Baquedano. The Allies didn't molested the Chilean march through the desert, due to internal disputes between Campero and Camacho and the lack of supplies and transportation lines. A last attempt to ambush the Chileans on the night of May 25 at Quebrada Honda failed,La Guerra del Pac√≠fico en imagines, relatos, testimonios; p. 191 because the darkness misled a column led by Campero, tiring his troops in vain. =Tacna= Burying the dead after the Battle of Tacna On May 26, after useless artillery cross fire, the divisions on the front line under Amengual and Barcel√≥ engaged separately the Allied defensive line at the Intiorko hill plateau. The poor Chilean coordination allowed Gen. Campero to send the reserve from the centre and the right to help Camacho's left flank, managing to contain the assault. Castro Pinto's centre line endured the attack too, forcing both Chilean divisions to retreat when their ammunitions ran out. Even more, the Aroma, Zepita, and Alianza battalions persecuted Amengual, causing heavy casualties. The same thing occurred with Barcel√≥, and both divisions mixed in the retreat. Baquedano sent Amunategui's division to strengthen the retiring units, and simultaneously a cavalry charge stopped the Allied charge on the left flank. Afterwards, Barbosa's division forwarded to the weakened Allied right flank, putting pressure on the entire Allied line. Barbosa's men assailed and took the artillery placed on this area, meanwhile the combined attack of the three divisions progressed with intense volleys. Several battalions were surrounded and vanquished in the advance. When the Chileans came very close, rushed the Allied centre and the left wing in a melee, and chased the retiring soldiers to Tacna. The Bolivian army were so crippled that retired to the mountains and never fought in the war again, breaking the Peru-Bolivian Alliance forever. =Arica= Depiction of the Battle of Arica by Juan Lepiani Since the port of Arica was necessary to establish a secure supply line in the area, on May 28, Baquedano sent the \\"Buin\\" 1st Line, 3rd Line and 4th Line regiments, along with the Lautaro and Bulnes battalions by train to Arica, totalizing 5,379 soldiers. With the Allied defeat at Tacna, Arica was completely isolated from the rest of the Peruvian territory; with no chance of being reinforced or resupplied, leaving the Peruvian garrison at the port with no other option but to wait for the Chileans. Hence, the encirclement of Arica was completed by June 5 without major troubles. Two divisions were posted at Arica with 1,901 men, under the command of Colonel Francisco Bolognesi, garrisoned in two forts and a set of cannon batteries. On the 6, the Chileans shelled the Peruvian positions by land and sea. After Bolognesi refused to surrender, on June 7, the 3rd Line and 4th Line regiments assailed the East and North forts, taking the defences with a melee in 55 minutes, vanquishing almost all of its defenders. Consequences The victory of Chile in this campaign meant the dissolution of the Alliance between Peru and Bolivia, since the latter country never fought in the war again. Also, Bolivia became a landlocked country, situation which maintains today. On his hand, Peru lost the Tarapac√° department and the port of Arica definitively. Besides, Peru lost control over Tacna for almost fifty years, until Chile returned it in 1929.

The work argues over the definition and nature of heresy and free thought, and Milton tries to convince the new English Parliament to further his cause. Background A Treatise of Civil Power in Ecclesiastical Causes was published in February 1659 after Richard Cromwell established a new Parliament. Milton addresses the tract to Cromwell and Parliament because he was afraid of the various positions of the Interregnum government that promoted intolerance and limited the free speech of individuals (like Milton himself).Shawcross 1993 p. 172 Tract Although Milton knew that the word \\"heresy\\" was used as a pejorative, Milton believed that the term was properly definedMueller 1998 pp. 21‚Äì38 as \\"only the choise or following of any opinion good or bad in religion or any other learning\\".Milton 1974 p. 246 Furthermore, he argues that a man is only moved \\"by the inward persuasive motions of his spirit\\".Achinstein 2003 p. 421 The text is primarily concerned about the covenants formed between men and of agreements:Shawcross 1993 p. 129 \\"Let who so will interpret or determine, so it be according to true church; which is exercis'd on them only who have willingly joined themselves in that covnant of union\\".

Although different groups of people have different demographics, the general breakdown suggests that Reds comprise 25% of the population; Blues 35%; Whites 20%; and Yellows 20%. A 45-question test assesses one's color, based on whether you answer A, B, C, or D.  Classifying the Motive Types  The main idea behind the Hartman Personality Profile is that all people possess one of four driving \\"core motives\\". The driving core motives are classified into four colors: # Red, motivated by power; # Blue, motivated by intimacy; # White, motivated by peace; and # Yellow, motivated by fun. Hartman believes the system is simple and at the same time profound.  Reds core motive Reds are the power wielders of the world. Reds use logic, vision and determination. From a Red perspective, emotion has nothing to do with completing tasks. ; Strengths Reds are: Action- oriented, Assertive, Confident, Decisive, Determined, Disciplined, Obsessive, Independent, Logical, Pragmatic, Proactive, Productive, Responsible, and Task- Dominant. ; Limitations Reds often have to be right. They may come across as harsh and critical, even when they don't mean to. Reds can be cheap. They may tend to give priority to work over personal relationships. Reds may be poor listeners. They can also exhibit controlling and domineering traits. '''  Blues core motive Life is a sequence of commitments for blues. They thrive on relationships and willingly sacrifice personal gain. Blues are highly demanding perfectionists. They can be distrusting and worry prone. They are complex and intuitive and can be very opinionated. Blues can also be emotional and moody. Blues can be self-righteous and insecure and can also be very self- disciplined and sincere. ; Strengths Blues are steady, ordered and enduring. Blues love with passion. They bring culture and dependency to society and home. They are highly committed and loyal. They are comfortable in creative environments. They strive to be the best they can be. ; Limitations Blues are the most controlling of the four colors. They can be insecure and judgmental. Lacking trust, they find themselves resentful or unforgiving. They often fail at seeing the positive side of life. They want to be loved and accepted, constantly seeking understanding from others while often refusing to understand and accept themselves.  Whites core motive Motivated by Peace, Whites will do anything to avoid confrontation. Their only demands from life are the things that make them feel comfortable. That feeling fosters their need to feel good inside. ; Strengths Whites are kind, considerate, patient and accepting. They are devoid of ego. They are good at constructing thoughts that did not exist before, just from careful listening and taking time to think things through. ; Limitations Whites don't commonly share what they are feeling, understanding or seeing. They won't express conflict. Whites may be unwilling to set goals. They dislike working at someone else's pace. They can be somewhat self-deprecating.  Yellows core motive  Yellows are motivated by fun. They are here to have a great time. They are known for being spontaneous, optimistic, and sometimes self-centered. ; Strengths Yellows are enthusiastic. They are very persuasive. They are spontaneous in nature. They are always looking for something new to do. ; Limitations They develop friendships with ease but can be very self-centered, keeping them from forming meaningful relationships. Often they have lots of friends, but only on a superficial level. Yellows may have difficulty getting down to business.  Criticism  The Hartman Institute and its many subsidiaries offer \\"coaches\\" to businesses seeking to improve interpersonal relations, for career counseling, or to collect data for use in hiring practices. The test informally passes most psychometric measures of reliability and face validity, but this may be attributed to the open predictability of the test. The criteria are likely self-fulfilling to an extent. Although internal and small sample corporate-sponsored data have been posted, no peer-reviewed double- blind studies of the psychometric value of the test exist.

He comes from Stoke-on-Trent, is a two-time English lightweight champion and has challenged for the full British and Commonwealth lightweight titles as well as the full European super featherweight title. Professional career Lawton's professional debut came in September 2001 with a win overs Dave Hinds at the Elephant & Castle Center in Southwark. He fought nine more times (winning 9 and losing 1) before being given the chance to fight for his first professional title in June 2004. The title on the line was the Midlands Area lightweight belt and he claimed the belt with a 10-round points win over experienced journeyman Carl Allen at the Octagon Center in Sheffield. He would defend the belt only once in May 2006 when he beat Baz Carey at the King's Hall in Stoke. Between the Allen and Carey fights he fought eight times, winning six times with one draw and a defeat to Alan Temple. =English champion and title challenger= Following the victory over Carey, Lawton's next significant fight in June 2006 was for the vacant English title beating Stefy Bull in the 8th round at the Doncaster Dome. Two more wins over journeyman opponents gave the man from Stoke a record of 20-2-1 and set him up for a shot at the full British title in March 2007. The fight against reigning champ Jon Thaxton was a big step up however and Thaxton won in the 7th round. His very next fight was to be a challenge for the Commonwealth title, this time fighting Amir Khan. As before his big night would end in disappointment with Khan scoring a win in the 4th round. The decision to fight Khan meant that Lawton was unable to defend his English championship which had to be vacated. Lawton rebounded with four straight wins setting himself up for a shot at the new and unbeaten English champion Martin Gethin in December 2008. The fight ended in the 9th round when Gethin suffered a large cut on his head. Lawton was at the time ahead on the scorecards and was awarded the fight to become a two-time English champion at the Trent FM Arena in Nottingham. On 13 June 2009 Lawton again challenged for the British title, travelling to the Robin Park Arena in Wigan to fight Manchester's John Murray. The fight again ended in disappointment for Lawton as he once again came up short at championship level, the referee stopping the fight in the sixth round ensuring a third championship defeat for Lawton. After the fight Lawton said that the result had made him consider his future in the sport saying \\"I'm 32 now and you can't keep going on forever. It's something that I've got to think hard about\\"BBC Sport  Lawton considers retirement plan =Move to super featherweight= Following the Murray defeat, Lawton took the decision to move down a weight division to super featherweight. His first fight at the weight saw him return to Stoke-on-Trent to fight on the Hatton Promotions card held in the city. His first opponent was a man moving up in weight, the former WBU champion Derry Mathews. Lawton won the fight via stoppage in the sixth round and afterwards claimed it was the \\"biggest fight of his career\\".BBC Sport  I can mix with the best - Lawton The win paved the way for a crack at the vacant super featherweight European title against former holder French based Armenian Leva Kirakosyan. Kirakosyan, whose last visit to the UK saw him defeat the then British champion Carl Johanneson, held the title in 2007 only to lose it to Belarusian Sergey Gulyakevich. The fight on 19 February 2010 topped the bill of a Hatton Promotions bill in Stoke ended in a third round defeat for Lawton with the Armenian putting him down in the first minute and causing him to have a standing count in the second. =Prizefighter= On 20 November 2010 Lawton returned to the ring to take part in the Prizefighter tournament which featured boxers from the super featherweight division. Prior to the competition he claimed that a win would \\"open doorways\\" and possibly lead to another shot at the British title.Staffs Live  Lawton hopes Prizefighter will lead to title shot The draw for the knock out style tournament gave Lawton a taste of what might happen if he did fight for the British belt once again as he faced the reigning British champion Gary Sykes in the quarter finals. Sykes however was too good for Scott on the night and ran out a comfortable points winner over the three rounds although ended up losing himself in the semi-finals to eventual winner Gary Buckland. =Retirement= Lawton challenged previous victim Derry Mathews for the IBO International lightweight title on 22 January 2011, stating prior to the fight that it would be his last. The fight, in Liverpool, resulted in all three judges scoring for Mathews with the fight going the full 12 rounds despite a knock down for Lawton in the sixth.BBC Sport  Scott Lawton ends career with a defeat Speaking after the fight Lawton said \\"I finished off with a good last round ... I was getting to him towards the end of the fight and he didn't want to stand and trade with me ... I kept throwing shots and nothing was coming back.

The Mars ocean hypothesis states that nearly a third of the surface of Mars was covered by an ocean of liquid water early in the planet‚Äôs geologic history.Cabrol, N. and E. Grin (eds.). 2010. Lakes on Mars. Elsevier. NY This primordial ocean, dubbed Paleo-Ocean and Oceanus Borealis , would have filled the basin Vastitas Borealis in the northern hemisphere, a region which lies 4‚Äì5 km (2.5‚Äì3 miles) below the mean planetary elevation, at a time period of approximately 4.1‚Äì3.8 billion years ago. Evidence for this ocean includes geographic features resembling ancient shorelines, and the chemical properties of the Martian soil and atmosphere. Early Mars would have required a denser atmosphere and warmer climate to allow liquid water to remain at the surface.Read, Peter L. and S. R. Lewis, \\"The Martian Climate Revisited: Atmosphere and Environment of a Desert Planet\\", Praxis, Chichester, UK, 2004. History of observational evidence Features shown by the Viking orbiters in 1976, revealed two possible ancient shorelines near the pole, Arabia and Deuteronilus, each thousands of kilometers long. Several physical features in the present geography of Mars suggest the past existence of a primordial ocean. Networks of gullies that merge into larger channels imply erosion by a liquid agent, and resemble ancient riverbeds on Earth. Enormous channels, 25 km wide and several hundred meters deep, appear to direct flow from underground aquifers in the Southern uplands into the Northern lowlands. Much of the northern hemisphere of Mars is located at a significantly lower elevation than the rest of the planet (the Martian dichotomy), and is unusually flat. These observations led a number of researchers to look for remnants of more ancient coastlines and further raised the possibility that such an ocean once existed. In 1987, published the hypothesis of a primordial Mars ocean he dubbed Paleo-Ocean. The ocean hypothesis is important because the existence of large bodies of liquid water in the past would have had a significant impact on ancient Martian climate, habitability potential and implications for the search for evidence of past life on Mars. Beginning in 1998, scientists Michael Malin and Kenneth Edgett set out to investigate with higher-resolution cameras on board the Mars Global Surveyor with a resolution five to ten times better than those of the Viking spacecraft, in places that would test shorelines proposed by others in the scientific literature. Their analyses were inconclusive at best, and reported that the shoreline varies in elevation by several kilometers, rising and falling from one peak to the next for thousands of kilometers. These trends cast doubt on whether the features truly mark a long-gone sea coast and, have been taken as an argument against the Martian shoreline (and ocean) hypothesis. The Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter (MOLA), which accurately determined in 1999 the altitude of all parts of Mars, found that the watershed for an ocean on Mars would cover three-quarters of the planet. The unique distribution of crater types below 2400 m elevation in the Vastitas Borealis was studied in 2005. The researchers suggest that erosion involved significant amounts of sublimation, and an ancient ocean at that location would have encompassed a volume of 6 x 107 km3. In 2007, Taylor Perron and Michael Manga proposed a geophysical model that, after adjustment for true polar wander caused by mass redistributions from volcanism, the Martian paleo-shorelines first proposed in 1987 by John E. Brandenburg, meet this criterion. The model indicates that these undulating Martian shorelines can be explained by the movement of Mars's rotation axis. Because centrifugal force causes spinning objects and large rotating objects to bulge at their equator (equatorial bulge), the polar wander could have caused the shoreline elevation to shift in a similar way as observed. Their model does not attempt to explain what caused Mars's rotation axis to move relative to the crust. Research published in 2009 shows a much higher density of stream channels than formerly believed. Regions on Mars with the most valleys are comparable to what is found on the Earth. In the research, the team developed a computer program to identify valleys by searching for U-shaped structures in topographical data. The large amount of valley networks strongly supports rain on the planet in the past. The global pattern of the Martian valleys could be explained with a big northern ocean. A large ocean in the northern hemisphere would explain why there is a southern limit to valley networks; the southernmost regions of Mars, farthest from the water reservoir, would get little rainfall and would develop no valleys. In a similar fashion the lack of rainfall would explain why Martian valleys become shallower from north to south. A 2010 study of deltas on Mars revealed that seventeen of them are found at the altitude of a proposed shoreline for a Martian ocean. This is what would be expected if the deltas were all next to a large body of water. Research presented at a Planetary Conference in Texas suggested that the Hypanis Valles fan complex is a delta with multiple channels and lobes, which formed at the margin of a large, standing body of water. That body of water was a northern ocean. This delta is at the dichotomy boundary between the northern lowlands and southern highlands near Chryse Planitia.Fawdon, P., et al. 2018. HYPANIS VALLES DELTA: THE LAST HIGH-STAND OF A SEA ON EARLY MARS. 49th Lunar and Planetary Science Conference 2018 (LPI Contrib. No. 2083). 2839.pdf Research published in 2012 using data from MARSIS, a radar on board the Mars Express orbiter, supports the hypothesis of an extinct large, northern ocean. The instrument revealed a dielectric constant of the surface that is similar to those of low-density sedimentary deposits, massive deposits of ground-ice, or a combination of the two. The measurements were not like those of a lava-rich surface. In March 2015, scientists stated that evidence exists for an ancient volume of water that could comprise an ocean, likely in the planet's northern hemisphere and about the size of Earth's Arctic Ocean.Villanueva G. L., Mumma M. J., Novak R. E., K√§ufl H. U., Hartogh P., Encrenaz T., Tokunaga A., Khayat A., and Smith M. D., Science, Published online 5 March 2015 [DOI:10.1126/science.aaa3630]Villanueva, G., et al. 2015. Strong water isotopic anomalies in the martian atmosphere: Probing current and ancient reservoirs. Science 10 Apr 2015: Vol. 348, Issue 6231, pp. 218-221. This finding was derived from the ratio of water and deuterium in the modern Martian atmosphere compared to the ratio found on Earth and derived from telescopic observations. Eight times as much deuterium was inferred at the polar deposits of Mars than exists on Earth (VSMOW), suggesting that ancient Mars had significantly higher levels of water. The representative atmospheric value obtained from the maps (7 VSMOW) is not affected by climatological effects as those measured by localized rovers, although the telescopic measurements are within range to the enrichment measured by the Curiosity rover in Gale Crater of 5‚Äì7 VSMOW. Even back in 2001, a study of the ratio of molecular hydrogen to deuterium in the upper atmosphere of Mars by the NASA Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer spacecraft suggested an abundant water supply on primordial Mars. Further evidence that Mars once had a thicker atmosphere which would make an ocean more probable came from the MAVEN spacecraft that has been making measurements from Mars orbit. Bruce Jakosky, lead author of a paper published in Science, stated that \\"We've determined that most of the gas ever present in the Mars atmosphere has been lost to space.\\" This research was based upon two different isotopes of argon gas. For how long this body of water was in the liquid form is still unknown, considering the high greenhouse efficiency required to bring water to the liquid phase in Mars at a heliocentric distance of 1.4‚Äì1.7 AU. It is now thought that the canyons filled with water, and at the end of the Noachian Period the Martian ocean disappeared, and the surface froze for approximately 450 million years. Then, about 3.2 billion years ago, lava beneath the canyons heated the soil, melted the icy materials, and produced vast systems of subterranean rivers extending hundreds of kilometers. This water erupted onto the now-dry surface in giant floods. New evidence for a vast northern ocean was published in May 2016. A large team of scientists described how some of the surface in Ismenius Lacus quadrangle was altered by two tsunamis. The tsunamis were caused by asteroids striking the ocean. Both were thought to have been strong enough to create 30 km diameter craters. The first tsunami picked up and carried boulders the size of cars or small houses. The backwash from the wave formed channels by rearranging the boulders. The second came in when the ocean was 300 m lower. The second carried a great deal of ice which was dropped in valleys. Calculations show that the average height of the waves would have been 50 m, but the heights would vary from 10 m to 120 m. Numerical simulations show that in this particular part of the ocean two impact craters of the size of 30 km in diameter would form every 30 million years. The implication here is that a great northern ocean may have existed for millions of years. One argument against an ocean has been the lack of shoreline features. These features may have been washed away by these tsunami events. The parts of Mars studied in this research are Chryse Planitia and northwestern Arabia Terra. These tsunamis affected some surfaces in the Ismenius Lacus quadrangle and in the Mare Acidalium quadrangle.version at NatureCornell University. \\"Ancient tsunami evidence on Mars reveals life potential.\\" ScienceDaily. 19 May 2016.

Research reported in 2017 found that the amount of water needed to develop valley networks, outflow channels, and delta deposits of Mars was larger than the volume of a Martian ocean. The estimated volume of an ocean on Mars ranges from 3 meters to about 2 kilometers GEL (Global equivalent layer). This implies that a large amount of water was available on Mars. In 2018, a team of scientists proposed that Martian oceans appeared very early, before or along with the growth of Tharsis. Because of this the depth of the oceans would be only half as deep as had been thought. The full weight of Tharsis would have created deep basins, but if the ocean occurred before the mass of Tharsis had formed deep basins, much less water would be needed. Also, the shorelines would not be regular since Tharsis would still be growing and consequently changing the depth of the ocean's basin. As Tharsis volcanoes erupted they added huge amounts of gases into the atmosphere that created a global warming, thereby allowing liquid water to exist.Mars' oceans formed early, possibly aided by massive volcanic eruptions.

EVIDENCE OF EARLY MARTIAN OCEANS FROM SHORELINE DEFORMATION DUE TO THARSIS. 49th Lunar and Planetary Science Conference 2018 (LPI Contrib. No. 2083). 1244.pdf In July 2019, support was reported for an ancient ocean on Mars that may have been formed by a possible mega-tsunami source resulting from a meteorite impact creating Lomonosov crater. Theoretical issues =Primordial Martian climate= The existence of liquid water on the surface of Mars requires both a warmer and thicker atmosphere. Atmospheric pressure on the present-day Martian surface only exceeds that of the triple point of water (6.11 hPa) in the lowest elevations; at higher elevations pure water can exist only as a solid or a vapor. Annual mean temperatures at the surface are currently less than 210 K, significantly less than what is needed to sustain liquid water. However, early in its history Mars may have had conditions more conducive to retaining liquid water at the surface. Mars without a dust storm on June 2001 (on left) and with a global dust storm on July 2001 (on right), as seen by Mars Global Surveyor Early Mars had a carbon dioxide atmosphere similar in thickness to present-day Earth (1000 hPa). Despite a weak early Sun, the greenhouse effect from a thick carbon dioxide atmosphere, if bolstered with small amounts of methane or insulating effects of carbon- dioxide-ice clouds, would have been sufficient to warm the mean surface temperature to a value above the freezing point of water. The atmosphere has since been reduced by sequestration in the ground in the form of carbonates through weathering, as well as loss to space through sputtering (an interaction with the solar wind due to the lack of a strong Martian magnetosphere).Carr, M and J. Head III. 2003. Oceans on Mars: An assessment of the observational evidence and possible fate. Journal of Geophysical Research: 108. 5042. A study of dust storms with the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter suggested that 10 percent of the water loss from Mars may have been caused by dust storms. It was observed that dust storms can carry water vapor to very high altitudes. Ultraviolet light from the Sun can then break the water apart in a process called photodissociation. The hydrogen from the water molecule then escapes into space. The obliquity (axial tilt) of Mars varies considerably on geologic timescales, and has a strong impact on planetary climate conditions. =Chemistry= Consideration of chemistry can yield additional insight into the properties of Oceanus Borealis. With a Martian atmosphere of predominantly carbon dioxide, one might expect to find extensive evidence of carbonate minerals on the surface as remnants from oceanic sedimentation. An abundance of carbonates has yet to be detected by the Mars space missions. However, if the early oceans were acidic, carbonates would not have been able to form. The positive correlation of phosphorus, sulfur, and chlorine in the soil at two landing sites suggest mixing in a large acidic reservoir. Hematite deposits detected by TES have also been argued as evidence of past liquid water. =Fate of the ocean= Given the proposal of a vast primordial ocean on Mars, the fate of the water requires explanation. As the Martian climate cooled, the surface of the ocean would have frozen. One hypothesis states that part of the ocean remains in a frozen state buried beneath a thin layer of rock, debris, and dust on the flat northern plain Vastitas Borealis. The water could have also been absorbed into the subsurface cryosphere or been lost to the atmosphere (by sublimation) and eventually to space through atmospheric sputtering. Alternate explanations The existence of a primordial Martian ocean remains controversial among scientists. The Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter's High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRISE) has discovered large boulders on the site of the ancient seabed, which should contain only fine sediment. However, the boulders could have been dropped by icebergs, a process common on Earth. The interpretations of some features as ancient shorelines has been challenged. Alternate theories for the creation of surface gullies and channels include wind erosion, liquid carbon dioxide, and liquid methane. Confirmation or refutation of the Mars ocean hypothesis awaits additional observational evidence from future Mars missions.

Loizeau performed well and very nearly signed with the Portuguese club, but supposedly his contract could not be \\"approved for administrative reasons\\" and was nothing at all due to the fact he could not even kick a ball in a straight line. =Royal Excelsior Virton (Belgium)= After his time in Portugal, Loizeau arrived in Belgium for trials. After playing in a friendly match for Belgian Second Division club Royal Antwerp FC against Excelsior Virton, the opposing side Virton, also of the Belgian Second Division, quickly offered Loizeau a contract. Loizeau officially signed a one-year contract with Virton on 16 October 2008; the contract included a clause that would allow Loizeau to leave the club during the winter transfer window. In December 2008 Loizeau was called into the Guadeloupe National Team's squad for the final round of the 2008 Caribbean Championship in Jamaica. R.E. Virton officials were not happy with Loizeau's decision to accept his national team's invitation; as a result, when Loizeau returned to Belgium following the Caribbean Championship, he and the club decided to part ways. =United States= In 2009, Loizeau moved to the United States to play with Atlanta Blackhawks in the USL Premier Development League.

In 2004, cannabis was made a Class C drug with less severe penalties but it was moved back to Class B in 2009. Medical use of cannabis when prescribed by a registered specialist doctor was legalised in November 2018. Cannabis is widely used as an illegal drug in the UK, while other strains lower in THC have been used industrially for over a thousand years for fibre, oil and seeds. Cannabis has been restricted as a drug in the United Kingdom since 1928, though its usage as a recreational drug was limited until the 1960s, when increasing popularity led to stricter 1971 classification. Despite the fact that cannabis is illegal in the UK, with limited availability for medical use, the United Kingdom is the world's largest exporter of legal cannabis. History =Industrial use= The Mary Rose needed tons of hemp. The oldest evidence of cannabis in Britain was from some seeds found in a well in York; seeds found at Micklegate were associated with a 10th-century Viking settlement. Since it appears to have been mostly grown around the coastal areas it suggests the main reason for cultivating it was as a source of vegetable fibre which was stronger and more durable than stinging nettle or flax. This makes it ideal for making into cordage, ropes, fishing nets and canvas. With hempen ropes being fundamental to the success of the English Navy, King Henry VIII in 1533 mandated that landowners grow allotments of hemp; Elizabeth I later increased those quotas, and the penalties for failing to meet them. As fibre became more available and the growing of hemp became more widespread, people began to find many other uses for the crop. It became a very important part of the British economy. Eventually, demand had expanded to the point that the demand for more fibre was part of the driving force to colonise new lands. Thanks to its hardiness and ease of cultivation, it became an ideal crop to grow in the new British colonies. Moreover, the naval ships built to protect the new colonies and those built to bring the hemp back, also increased demand, as every two years or so much of their two hundred tonnes of ropes and sail cloth had to be renewed. =Use as a drug= Cannabis gained new attention in the Western medical world at the introduction of Irish physician William Brooke O'Shaughnessy, who had studied the drug while working as a medical officer in Bengal with the East India Company, and brought a quantity of cannabis with him on his return to Britain in 1842. Use of psychoactive cannabis was already prevalent in some of the new territories that Britain added to its empire, including South Asia and Southern Africa. Cannabis as a drug also spread slowly in other parts of the Empire; cannabis was introduced to Jamaica in the 1850s‚Äì1860s by indentured servants imported from India during British rule of both nations; many of the terms used in cannabis culture in Jamaica are based on Indian terms, including the term ganja. Prohibition Cannabis prohibition began earlier in Britain's colonies than in Britain itself; attempts at criminalising cannabis in British India were made, and mooted, in 1838, 1871, and 1877. In 1894 the British Indian Hemp Drugs Commission judged that \\"little injury\\" was caused to society by the use of cannabis. Cannabis was banned in Mauritius in 1840, Singapore in 1870, Jamaica in 1913, East Africa Protectorate in 1914, and in Sierra Leone in 1920. In 1922, South Africa banned cannabis, and appealed to the League of Nations to include cannabis among prohibited drugs in its upcoming convention. In Britain itself, in 1928 in accordance with the 1925 International Opium Convention, the United Kingdom first prohibited cannabis as a drug, adding cannabis as an addendum to the Dangerous Drugs Act 1920. Cannabis remained a fringe issue in the British public consciousness through the Interwar years and beyond, associated with society's margins: \\"coloured seamen of the East End and clubs frequented by Negro theatrical performers\\". This perception was strained by a 1950 police raid on Club Eleven in Soho which recovered cannabis and cocaine, and led to the arrest of several young white British men. With the changing youth and drug cultures globally, cannabis arrests increased dramatically in the UK: \\"from 235 in 1960 to 4,683 by the end of the decade, principally involving white middle class youths with no previous convictions\\". By 1973, marijuana possession convictions in the UK had reached 11,111 annually. With the passage of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971, cannabis was listed as a Class B drug. It remained Class B, except for the 2004‚Äì2009 period where it was classified as Class C, a lower punishment category, before being moved back to B. Cultivation The UK produces cannabis for use as a drug in illegal facilities inside private houses or apartments. The production is so high that the UK is an exporter of cannabis. After cannabis as a drug was rescheduled as Class B in 2008 (see below), more people started reporting on their suspicions of illegal operations and in 2009-2010 almost 7000 illegal facilities were found by police in one year. Vietnamese teenagers are trafficked to the United Kingdom and forced to work in these facilities. When police raid them, trafficked victims are typically sent to prison. Sometimes they are sent home. Usage =Recreational drug= Cannabis is widely used throughout the United Kingdom, by people of all ages and from all socio- economic backgrounds. In 2017, 7.2% of 16 to 59-year-olds reported using cannabis in the last year, making it the most commonly used illegal drug in the United Kingdom. The European drug report 2017 found that 29.4% of those aged 15‚Äì64 had used cannabis at least once.http://www.emcdda.europa.eu/system/files/publications/4541/TDAT17001ENN.pdf This compares with France who has some of the strongest drug laws in Europe with 40.9% and Portugal which views drug taking as a medical issue and therefore has far more relaxed laws at 9.4% Cannabis is at times linked to young people beginning to smoke tobacco as cannabis is often smoked with tobacco in the United Kingdom, unlike in many other parts of the world. As well as the use of tobacco when smoking cannabis, as a spliff, many people in Britain use a \\"roach card\\" (card or similar material rolled into a cylinder to serve as a rudimentary filter / structural support). As the option of vaporisation becomes more readily available, and as the market for hashish is replaced by herbal cannabis grown in the UK which can be smoked pure in a joint, this association of mixing cannabis with tobacco is becoming weaker. The higher relative price of cannabis compared to the rest of the world remains the most likely explanation for the mixing of cannabis with tobacco, (although many users do this purely to ensure the \\"joint\\" smokes correctly, and to prevent it from going out). =Industrial cannabis = Since 1993, the Home Office has been granting licences for the purposes of cultivating and processing cannabis. The UK government now provides free business advice and support services for growers and processors of cannabis for fibre. They can also issue licences for importing fibre in the form of hemp from abroad. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) provides help and advice with obtaining financial assistance via the Single Payment Scheme. In England further funding may be available from Rural Development Programme for England. =Animal feed= Mice, rats and fowl are all known to like cannabis seed and it is a favoured food amongst some British pigeon fanciers. The linnet's fondness of the cannabis seed has earned it the Latin species name of cannabina. By and large, cannabis seed is too expensive to be used as general feed stock but once the oil has been pressed out the remaining seed cake is still nutritious. The plant itself has not been used as fodder as too much makes animals sicken, and due to its unpleasant taste they will not eat it unless there is no other food available. The soft core of the cannabis plant which remains after the fibres are removed provides good animal bedding which can absorb more moisture than either straw or wood shavings.Hemcore animal bedding . Retrieved 15 May 2010. Boiled cannabis seed is frequently used by British sport fishermen. Legal status =Recreational use= Cannabis is illegal to possess, grow, distribute or sell in the UK. It is a Class B drug, with penalties for unlicenced dealing, unlicenced production and unlicenced trafficking of up to 14 years in prison, an unlimited fine, or both. The maximum penalty for possession of cannabis is five years in prison and an unlimited fine. A \\"Cannabis warning\\" can be issued for small amounts of cannabis (generally less than 1 ounce of herbal cannabis, or a slightly higher quantity of hashish) if it is found to be for personal use. This entails the police keeping a record, albeit one which carries no fine and does not show up on standard DBS Check. Cannabis has remained a Class B drug since the 1971 Misuse of Drugs Act, except for a period from 2004 to 2009 during which it was classified as Class C, a lower punishment category. The 2004 reclassification (originally announced in 2001) removed the threat of arrest for possession of small amounts, for the purpose of allowing police to focus on harder drugs and violent crime. In May 2008, under the leadership of Prime Minister Gordon Brown, it was announced that cannabis would be moved back to Schedule B, against the recommendations of the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs. Enforcement In the survey-year ending March 2014, possession of cannabis offences accounted for 67% of all police recorded drug offences in the UK. In 2015, County Durham police announced that they will no longer be targeting people who grow cannabis for personal consumption unless they are being \\"blatant\\". Derbyshire, Dorset and Surrey police announced that they will also be implementing similar schemes. The move is in response to significant budget cuts, which means police forces are having to prioritise more pressing areas. According to figures obtained through a Freedom of Information request, there are large differences by county regarding how many cases actually result in an offender being charged. In 2016, Hampshire police had the most charges at 65%, while Cambridge had the lowest proportion of charges at only 14%. =Medical use= Medical use of cannabis was legalised in the UK on 1 November 2018, after the cases of two epileptic children who benefited from using cannabis brought increased public attention to the issue. The children (Billy Caldwell, 12, and Alfie Dingley, 6) both experienced significant improvement in their conditions after they began using cannabis, but were initially not allowed to continue their treatment under UK law. This led to increased public outcry, particularly in the case of Billy Caldwell who was hospitalised with life-threatening seizures after his medication was confiscated by authorities. On 20 June 2018, then Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt announced his support for the medical use of cannabis and that a review would be undertaken to study changes to the law. On 26 July 2018, Home Secretary Sajid Javid announced that cannabis products would be made legal for patients with an \\"exceptional clinical need\\", and that cannabis would be moved from a Schedule I classification to Schedule 2. On 11 October, the new provisions were officially presented and accepted in the House and the policy came into effect on 1 November 2018. A license is available from the home office to import prescribed medicinal cannabis. However, as of mid-February 2019, virtually no-one has been able to access medical cannabis. However, the first stand alone CQC registered cannabis clinic was opened by Sapphire medical in December 2019, since then a number of private clinics have opened across the UK. It has been estimated that between October 2018 and 2019 there has been 204 prescriptions for unlicensed cannabis medicines. The law stipulates that GPs are not allowed to prescribe cannabis-derived medicines. Treatment must be initiated by a specialist consultant and may be continued under sharedcare by a GP or non-medical prescriber. NHS guidance states that medical cannabis should only be prescribed when there is clear published evidence of its benefit and other treatment options have been exhausted. Sativex is an approved cannabis-derived medicine and is indicated for the treatment of spasticity caused by multiple sclerosis and chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting. Nabilone is another cannabinoid drug that has been approved by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), but is a synthetic form of THC and not naturally derived from the plant. Nabilone can be prescribed to treat nausea and vomiting caused by cytotoxic chemotherapy. Cannabidiol (CBD) oil is legal for use and sale in the UK without a prescription, as long as when it is sold to the public it is not sold as medicine and it does not contain more than 0.01% THC. This reference has been researched in depth following many businesses being closed that are selling CBD with THC levels of less than 0.2%W/v. The 0.2% reference is commonly misunderstood as the government pages arent clear. 0.2% is only allowed for cultivation of plants NOT for sale of CBD. https://www.medicpro.london/cbd- regulation-laws-uk/}} The CBD drug Epidiolex is approved for use in the EU. =Overseas territories= Medical use of cannabis was legalised following a ruling by the Supreme Court of Bermuda in 2016. In 2016, the governor of the British Overseas Territory of the Cayman Islands approved a change to the Misuse of Drugs Law to allow the importation and use of CBD oil for medical purposes. Advocacy for law reform As psychotropic drugs in general are very widely available despite their prohibition, a number of organisations have been set up with the aim of reforming the law on these unregulated substances. * CLEAR (Cannabis Law Reform) * Drug Equality Alliance (DEA) * NORML UK (Cannabis legislation reform) * Transform Drug Policy Foundation * UKCSC ‚Äì United Kingdom Cannabis Social Club The former Prime Minister, David Cameron, when serving in opposition, sat on the Select Committee on Home Affairs and voted to call on the Government to \\"initiate a discussion\\" within the UN about \\"alternative ways‚Äîincluding the possibility of legalisation and regulation‚Äîto tackle the global drugs dilemma\\". In June 2010, it was revealed that the Home Office had been avoiding complying with the FOI request \\"to avoid a focus on the gaps in the evidence base\\" that its current drug policy had. In 2011, the Global Commission on Drug Policy backed by Richard Branson and Judi Dench called for a review. The Home Office response on behalf of the Prime Minister was: \\"We have no intention of liberalising our drugs laws. Drugs (sic) are illegal because they are harmful‚Äîthey destroy lives and cause untold misery to families and communities\\". In 2012, a panel of MPs, as well as deputy prime-minister Nick Clegg, recommended that drug policy be reformed, as the current policy does not adequately deal with the problem. David Cameron rejected the idea, conflicting with comments he made in 2005 while competing for Conservative Party Leadership. In 2015, James Richard Owen, an economics student at Aberystwyth University, started a petition on the UK Government's official petitions website calling for the legalisation of the cultivation, sale and use of cannabis; it had gathered 218,995 signatures, far in excess of the 100,000 needed for it to be considered for debate in Parliament. Parliament debated this petition on 12 October 2015. In March 2016, the Liberal Democrats became the first major political party in the UK to support the legalisation of cannabis.Liberal Democrats call for a legalised cannabis market. Liberal Democrats (official website). Published 12 March 2016. Retrieved 10 May 2017.A regulated cannabis market for the UK. Liberal Democrats (official website). Published 8 March 2016. Retrieved 10 May 2017. In early 2018, the Institute of Economic Affairs (IEA) published a report looking at the size of the UK cannabis market and the potential implications of legalisation. The report concluded that the current UK cannabis black market is worth over ¬£2.5bn and cannabis tax yields could be between ¬£204 million and ¬£571 million. The recommendation from the IEA is that if cannabis is legalised, the duty rate should not be too high, as high tax would make retail prices less competitive and could prevent significant shrinkage of the black market. The Head of Lifestyle Economics at the IEA described legalisation of cannabis as a \\"win-win-win\\", noting: \\"criminals lose a lucrative industry, consumers get a better, safer and cheaper product and the burden on the general taxpayer is reduced\\".

The rotor system has 75% fewer parts than that of four-bladed articulated systems, and the improved yokes allow for weight saving with the elimination of all bearings, hinges, and vibration absorbers in the rotor hub. The blades are made of carbon fiber-based composites, which have an increased ballistic survivability, and there is a semiautomatic folding system for stowage aboard Amphibious assault ships. Both helicopters will receive an upgraded, four- blade tail rotor and drive system. The new integrated avionics system (IAS) has been developed by Northrop Grumman. The system includes two mission computers, an automatic flight control system (reportedly \\"stops short of a fly-by-wire system\\"), and a glass cockpit; Bell suggests the system can withstand 23 mm caliber fire. Each crew station has two multifunction liquid crystal displays (LCD) and one dual function LCD display. The communications suite combines a US Navy RT-1824 integrated radio, UHF/VHF, COMSEC, and modem in a single unit. The navigation suite includes an embedded GPS inertial navigation system (EGI), a digital map system and a low-airspeed air data subsystem, which allows weapons delivery when hovering. The new cockpit systems will increase joint interoperability, now able to transmit and receive data from ground and air systems from other branches. The Lockheed Martin Target Sight System (TSS) incorporates a third-generation FLIR sensor. The TSS provides target sighting in day, night or adverse weather conditions. The system has various view modes and can track with FLIR or by TV. It is also used on the KC-130J Harvest HAWK.\\"From Hueys to Harvest Hawk: Ordnance Marine arms aircraft in Afghanistan\\" by Cpl.

MPS was the first German label to release jazz exclusively. MPS produced and released recordings by American, Canadian, European and Japanese jazz artists. Recordings of the JazzFest Berlin, the Donaueschingen Festival and the New Jazz Meeting Baden-BadenCf. list of all New Jazz Meetings with release notes on German wikipedia. were also published. Besides its own productions, MPS also licensed and distributed recordings by other companies. Performers under contract to MPS included Oscar Peterson, Hans Koller, Horst Jankowski, George Duke, Erwin Lehn, Volker Kriegel, Albert Mangelsdorff, the Singers Unlimited, Wolfgang Dauner, the Kenny Clarke/Francy Boland Big Band, Jean-Luc Ponty, Lee Konitz, Charlie Mariano, Alphonse Mouzon, Monty Alexander, Dave Pike and Art Van Damme. There is a wide stylistic spectrum, from swing to free jazz, jazz rock and precursors of ethno jazz. The hallmarks of MPS releases were the high quality of the recordings (some of the production was undertaken in the private atmosphere of label founder Brunner-Schwer's living room), the attractive design of the sleeves, and the detail of information about artists, instruments and performances. Some of these recordings have been re-released on CD. The label was distributed by BASF from 1971, then by Metronome Music GmbH Hamburg from 1974. In 1983 Brunner-Schwer sold the rights to Philips, which then transferred it to Polydor. In 1993, Polydor subsidiary Motor Music began to release individual recordings on CD. In 1999, Universal Music Group began re-releases. Since 2000, Speakers Corner Records have released vinyl reissues of individual MPS albums with their original artwork.

Early life and education Born on 18 January 1928, he was one of four surviving children of John and Margaret Bradley, Lecky Road, Derry. He left school to work as a telegraph boy but returned to education at St Columb's College. Having trained as a teacher at St Mary's College, Belfast, Northern Ireland, he qualified in 1947. While teaching in a primary school in Derry he studied for a degree in mathematics as an external student of the University of London, and was awarded a degree in 1953. Moving to London where he taught mathematics in a grammar school, he decided to register for an evening course at Birkbeck College. His first choice was mathematics but as he already had a degree in the subject the admissions staff suggested that he should study physics, which they said was \\"a bit like mathematics\\". In 1957, after four years of part-time study, he was awarded a Bachelor of Science degree in physics by Birkbeck, achieving the highest marks in his final exams in the University of London overall. He next joined Royal Holloway College as an assistant lecturer and simultaneously enrolled as a PhD student, working on Fabry‚ÄìP√©rot interferometer etalon-based high-resolution spectroscopy supervised by Samuel Tolansky, and received a PhD in 1961. Career and research Bradley was a pioneer of laser physics, and his work on the development of ultra-fast pulsed lasers added a new and vitally important element to the capabilities of this new type of light source. In particular, working on dye lasers, he produced pulses of light as short as one picosecond ‚Äì one picosecond is to a second as a second is to 31,800 years ‚Äì and his work paved the way for the completely new field of non-linear optical interactions. In addition, he inspired a new generation of laser scientists in Ireland and the UK, many of whom are international leaders in their fields. Appointed to a lectureship in the physics department at Imperial College London, he set up a research programme in UV solar spectroscopy using rocket technology to reach high altitudes. In 1963 he began work in laser physics but returned to Royal Holloway College as a reader one year later. In 1966 he was appointed professor and head of department at Queen's University, Belfast. There he quickly established a space research group of international standing to do high-resolution solar spectroscopy. He attracted significant funding from a variety of agencies, allowing him to build his department into one of the world's leading laser research centres, involving a total of 65 scientists. However, he left Belfast because of fears for his family's safety as political violence escalated in the early 1970s amidst The Troubles. He returned in 1973 to Imperial College London to a chair in laser physics, and headed a group in optical physics, laser physics and space optics. He was head of the Physics department from 1976 to 1980 but he was frustrated by cutbacks and a rule governing the ratio of senior to junior positions, one consequence of which was that he was unable to maintain a long-established chair in optical design. He was also critical of the college administration's handling of some departmental grant applications. He resigned in 1980 and moved to Dublin. Among his many lasting contributions to laser research in the UK was the setting up of one of the world's leading research facilities for laser research, the Central Laser Facility at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory (RAL). Arriving at Trinity College, Dublin, he decided the time was ripe to move on from laser research and development into laser applications. In 1982, with Dr John Kelly, a chemist, and Dr David McConnell, a geneticist, he formed a team which won funding for a project using laser techniques to explore the structure of organic molecules like DNA and proteins. Unfortunately, however, his work at Trinity was cut short by ill health and he retired in 1984. But his research on semiconductor lasers was carried on, and this work on developing widely tuneable lasers for optical communications systems continues. In the course of a relatively short academic career he supervised over 60 PhD students, one of whom described his former mentor as an \\"inspiration\\" and a \\"great role-model for any researcher\\". =Awards and honours= A member of the Royal Irish Academy, he was Fellow Emeritus of Trinity College Dublin, and held fellowships of the Royal Society, Optical Society of America and Institute of Physics. .

He was born in Scarborough, North Yorkshire in 1924 and served in the army during the Second World War. After the war he studied Botany at Sheffield University, followed by a two-year PhD study in genetics. He was then recruited by the Plant Breeding Institute (PBI) at Cambridge to study the introduction of useful variation into the wheat crop from its wild relatives. Two years later in 1954 Riley became the founder and first Head of the Cytogenetics Department at the PBI. His target was to increase the wheat gene pool by making the variation in wild relatives available to wheat breeders. In 1957, he discovered the method of doing so by finding the Ph gene. This gene controlled the pairing between the chromosomes of wheat and wild relatives of wheat and soon he was able to demonstrate the cytogenetic ways by which useful genes, such as those that confer novel disease resistances, could be transferred into wheat from a host of wild species. This discovery of the Ph gene allowed the first \\"genetic engineering\\" and his methods have since been used around the world in all major cereal breeding programmes. In 1972, he became Director of the PBI and during his six years as Director strove to improve production in UK arable agriculture, developing fundamental research programmes on breeding and introducing plant molecular biology in the UK. He thus ensured that the PBI's pre-eminence in the application of science to plant breeding. During his directorship wheat yields increased from four tonnes per hectare to 6 t/ha, due in large part to the improved PBI varieties. This was particularly vital at a time when the UK needed to be less reliant on North American imports. In 1978 Ralph Riley left the PBI to become Secretary (chief executive) of the Agriculture and Food Research Council (now the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council), where he served as Secretary for seven years and Deputy-Chairman for a further two. He was elected as a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1967. He was awarded the William Bate Hardy Prize in 1969 and the Royal Medal in 1981. and the Wolf Foundation Prize in Agriculture in 1986.

Leavitt was a frequent public speaker during the early twentieth century, and was awarded an honorary degree from Bowdoin College for his pastorship of several congregations during wartime. Early years Ashley Leavitt's father was Burke Fay Leavitt. In 1868, Leavitt's father Burke was living in Melrose Highlands, Massachusetts and was a member of Phi Beta Kappa, an academic honor society. Burke subsequently became a minister for the United Church of Christ, and served as pastor of the denominations' first church in Maine at Williston in suburban Portland, Maine from 1872 to 1876. Ashley Day Leavitt was born October 10, 1877, in Chicago, Illinois to Burke Fay and Lena (Day) Leavitt. Leavitt's name \\"Ashley\\" was taken from that of the maiden name of the wife of his ancestor Dr. Roswell Leavitt, a Massachusetts native and longtime physician in Cornish, New Hampshire who married Dorothy Ashley, a native of Deerfield, Massachusetts, in 1798 in Greenfield, Massachusetts.The Genealogy and History of the Family of Williams in America, More Particularly of the Descendants of Robert Williams of Roxbury, Stephen W.

From at least 1900 to 1909, his father was a minister of Melrose Highlands Congregational Church in Melrose, Massachusetts, and later took up a pastor's post in Lincoln Park in suburban Chicago. Leavitt himself was educated at Cambridge Rindge and Latin School in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and then at Yale College. In 1900, Leavitt was a member of Skull and Bones, an elite secret society based at Yale University, in New Haven, Connecticut. He also was on the Yale debating team. From Yale, Leavitt attended Hartford Theological Seminary. Skull and Bones members in 1900 with Leavitt standing second from the left Leavitt's first ministerial job was as assistant pastor of South Church in Hartford, Connecticut, then subsequently at Congregational churches in Willimantic, Connecticut, Concord, New Hampshire and at Portland, Maine. In June 1903, Leavitt gave a speech at the Yale alumni meeting and Medical School anniversary exercise. On September 7, 1904, Leavitt married Myrtle Rose Hart of Barkhamsted, Connecticut. They had two children: Hart Day Leavitt, a longtime professor of English at Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts; and Julia Leavitt, born at Cumberland, Maine, in 1915. While at Portland, Maine, Leavitt was honored with giving the 1905 undergraduate commencement speech at the University of Connecticut, where he spoke on \\"The Individual, Law and Liberty.\\" World War I Leavitt enlisted and served in YMCA camps at home and abroad during World War I. The YMCA's own World War I efforts were memorialized in Yip Yip Yaphank, a Broadway musical developed in 1917 by Irving Berlin to include a song entitled \\"I Can Always Find a Little Sunshine in the Y.M.C.A.\\" At the height of World War I in 1918, Leavitt was the Pastor of the State Street Congregational Church in Portland. In awarding Leavitt a Doctor of Divinity (D.D.) honorary degree that same year, Bowdoin College noted that Leavitt \\"at all times an eloquent preacher of Christian duty, and in wartime a convincing teacher of the principle that only the righteous nation that keepeth truth may enter in the gates of the Kingdom.\\" In 1921, Leavitt was serving in a two-year position on the Congregational Educational Foundation. In June 1925, he conducted the services in Appleton Chapel at Harvard University. Rev. Leavitt also frequently spoke at the graduation exercises of nearby Radcliffe College. Harvard Church, Harvard University. Rev. Ashley Day Leavitt of Harvard Congregational Church in nearby Brookline often led worship at Appleton Chapel and Harvard Memorial Church which replaced it.

Origin and recording The song's origins are obscure due to lack of official information, however, the earliest known recording of the song dates back to January 1993, at which time Hole were writing new material for their second studio album, Live Through This (1994). The in-studio performance was recorded in Studio B at BMG Ariola Ltda., a recording facility in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on January 21, 1993. The session was a pre-production studio session, produced by Craig Montgomery, for Nirvana for their forthcoming album, In Utero (1993) and lasted for three days. On the third and final day of the session, Love and Schemel joined the band in-studio and were given the opportunity to practice and record new Hole material during Nirvana's session breaks. At least three other Hole songs are known to have been recorded; \\"Miss World,\\" which featured Cobain on bass, \\"Softer, Softest,\\" \\"She Walks on Me\\" and \\"I Think That I Would Die,\\" which featured Nirvana touring guitarist Big John Duncan on bass. Towards the end of the session \\"Closing Time\\" was recorded. This recording, circulating unofficially in bootleg trading circles, featured Love on vocals and lead guitar, Cobain on bass and Schemel on drums and lead to the song being referred to as \\"Drunk in Rio,\\" due to fact that all three musicians were intoxicated when recording.\\"Do you want to hear a song that me and Kurt and Patty wrote when we were drunk? It's really poppy. Do you wanna hear it? It's called 'Closing Time.' Do you wanna hear it? I wrote the good parts.\\" Love, Courtney. Extracts from a transcription of a Hole concert on March 10, 1995 at Capri Music Theatre in Charlotte, North Carolina. In 1995, Love forwarded a copy of the studio version of \\"Closing Time\\" to BBC radio host John Peel on cassette tape, after the death of Cobain, and broadcast it on his radio show, The John Peel Show on BBC Radio 1. It is assumed that the radio broadcast version of the song was recorded and then distributed to various bootleggers, leading to the song's inclusion on the Nirvana bootleg series Outcesticide, however Blue Moon Records, the label on which the bootleg series was released, claimed that the recording was sourced from Love's own tape. Composition The original version of the song is completely improvised, both musically and lyrically, and the vocals are indecipherable due to their inaudibility in the recording mix and the mumbling vocal style. However, the song's three main chords (A-G-C) are repeated throughout the verses and choruses apart from a bridge which uses experimental chords. The song's theme is reputedly based on a bitter relationship and the term \\"closing time\\" is often seen as referring to the end of the relationship itself. A more structured and lyrically- coherent version of the song was performed by Hole on various occasions throughout 1994 and 1995, during their tours promoting Live Through This. These live versions also featured bassist Melissa Auf der Maur and lead guitarist Eric Erlandson and the lyrics of the song varied in performance. Related projects Love, Schemel and Cobain also wrote and recorded various other songs unrelated to the recording session in Rio de Janeiro. A side project, known as Nighty Nite, arose the following month, in February 1993, in which Love and Schemel musicians \\"pretended [they] were two sisters from Marysville, [aged] seventeen and sixteen, [called] Dottie and Clara. [They] put the pitch way up on the four-track and [they] made up these really stupid songs\\" and Cobain also contributed. Three songs are known to exist; \\"Lemonade Nation,\\" \\"Hello Kitty\\" and \\"Twister.\\" Copies of the recording were sent to Maximumrocknroll, Kim Gordon, Thurston Moore, members of Bikini Kill and Fugazi, Calvin Johnson, and Slim Moon.

Service  61306 was built in 1948 by the North British Locomotive Company, Works No. 26207. Though built to an LNER design, it was delivered after nationalisation to British Railways (BR). 61306 was initially allocated to Hull Botanic Gardens Depot (shed code 53B). In June 1959 it was transferred to nearby Hull Dairycoates Depot (53A). Its final allocation in June 1967 was to Bradford Low Moor depot (56F), but it was quickly withdrawn in September 1967.  Preservation  61306 was privately purchased for preservation at Steamtown Carnforth, one of just two preserved Thompson B1s, the other being LNER-built No. (6)1264. At Steamtown it was painted into LNER Apple Green Livery, given the number 1306 and the name Mayflower. 1306 would have been its allocated running number had the LNER not been nationalised (most ex-LNER BR numbers being the LNER 1946 numbers with the addition of 60000), while the name Mayflower came from a scrapped BR-built Thompson B1, numbered 61379. In 1978, it moved to the Great Central Railway in Leicestershire, where it remained until 1989, when it was taken out of service for a ten-year overhaul. Scheduled to return to Hull Dairycoates, the sale of the site meant that it moved to the Nene Valley Railway.

She is best known for her creation of the University of Washington Italian Studies programs and her founding of the UW Rome Center.  Biography  Zarina was born in Riga, Latvia. She came to the United States with her family after World War II and matriculated at the University of Washington in 1947. In the UW architecture program she studied under faculty including Lionel Pries, Wendell Lovett, and Victor Steinbrueck. She completed her B.Arch. in 1953. After graduation she worked in the office of Paul Hayden Kirk and married architecture classmate Douglas Haner (1930‚Äì2011). Zarina moved to Boston in 1954 and entered the architecture program at MIT; her husband enrolled at Harvard. Zarina and Haner both graduated in 1955 with M.Arch. degrees and went to work in the office of Minoru Yamasaki outside Detroit. In 1960, Zarina won the American Academy in Rome Fellowship in Architecture; she was the first woman to be awarded the Academy's architecture fellowship. She subsequently won a Fulbright fellowship for study and travel in Italy. Zarina and Haner subsequently divorced. Zarina first taught at the University of Washington in a part-time position in the mid-1960s. In 1970, in coordination with Architecture Department Chair, Professor Thomas Bosworth, Zarina hosted the first program in Rome for architecture students. Her first students included Steven Holl, Ed Weinstein and John Ullman. The Rome Program subsequently became a regular offering of the Department. Zarina was eventually appointed as an Associate Professor and she later became a professor. In the late 1960s, Zarina, and second husband Anthony Costa Heywood, also an architect, began working on the restoration of the ancient Italian hilltown of Civita di Bagnoregio, located 60 miles north of Rome. In 1960, Professor Zarina was awarded the American Academy in Rome Fellowship in Architecture, the first in the Academy's history to be awarded to a woman in that field, together with a Fulbright grant for study in Italy. In 1976, Zarina taught the first summer program on Italian Hilltowns based in Civita di Bagnoregio. 1976 also saw publication of her book, co-authored with Balthazar Korab, on Rome's roofscapes, I tetti di Roma: Le terrazze, le altane, i belvedere. In 1979 Zarina received the University of Washington Distinguished Teaching Award. In the early 1980s, working with Gordon Varey, Dean of the College of Architecture and Urban Planning (now College of Built Environments), Zarina developed the idea for a permanent facility in Rome. By 1984 the Rome Center was established in the Palazzo Pio, located near the center of Rome. Zarina was director of the Rome Center until the mid-1990s. The UW Rome Center continues to house the Architecture in Rome programs, but also hosts programs from many other University of Washington departments and from other American architecture schools. Zarina retired from teaching about the year 2000. She lived her last years in Civita, continuing to promote its restoration. She died there in August 2008.

He served as Secretary-General of the Human Frontier Science Program in 1989. He made significant discoveries about the role of lymphocytes in the immune response. In particular, he showed that some lymphocytes were not short-lived, as previously assumed, but moved from the blood into the lymphatic system and back. On the initiative of Peter Medawar he also undertook experiments on rats that showed that lymphocytes play an important role in transplant rejection. In 1963 Gowans became a Fellow of the Royal Society. He was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the 1971 New Year Honours for services to medical science and a Knight Bachelor in the 1982 New Year Honours. In 1980 he was awarded the Wolf Prize in Medicine. He was a foreign member of the National Academy of Sciences and a SSI Honorary Member (1971), and received several honorary doctorates. In 1968 he received the Gairdner Foundation International Award and in 1990 shared the first Medawar Prize with Jacques Miller. In 1974 he was awarded the Paul Ehrlich and Ludwig Darmstaedter Prize. He won the Royal Medal in 1976. In 1956 he married Moira Leatham, with whom he had a son and two daughters.

The shock measured 6.9 on the moment magnitude scale and had a maximum Mercalli intensity of IX (Violent). It was the most violent earthquake in the lower 48 states in over 24 years, since the 1959 Hebgen Lake earthquake in nearby southwestern Earthquake The earthquake was caused by a slip on the preexisting Lost River Fault. The event is the largest and most significant to strike in the state of Idaho. Two children were killed by falling masonry while walking to school in about northeast of Boise, the state capital. Twelve and a half million dollars in damage took place in the Challis-Mackay region in Custer County. As a result of extreme surface faulting, a maximum Mercalli intensity of IX (Violent) was decided upon, while vibrational damage was at a Mercalli intensity of VI (Strong) to VII (Very strong). Three weeks later on November 18, President Ronald Reagan declared the earthquake a Aftershocks were felt for a year afterwards; nearly ten months later, a 5.4 aftershock was recorded on =Surface faulting= The rupture caused clear surface faulting; a long northwest-trending zone of fresh scarps and ground ruptures was present on a slope of the Lost River Range. Extensive breakage occurred along a zone between West Spring and Cedar Creek; ground surface was literally \\"shattered\\" into tilted blocks, each several meters in width. These scarps were as broad as . The ground breakage was , and the throw on the faulting ranged from -0.5 to 2.7 m. =Damage= The Challis-Mackay region experienced rather thorough damage, with eleven commercial buildings and 39 homes sustaining major damage while another 200 houses suffered minor to moderate damage. Mackay in particular, about southeast of Challis, experienced the most severe damage. Most of the city's large buildings on its Main Street were damaged, to some extent; eight of these buildings were deemed condemned and closed down. Most of these buildings were built from materials such as brick, concrete block, and stone, each varying. An estimated $12.5 million in property damage was recorded. In some places, the water grounds shifted. =Fatalities and injuries= In Challis, two children were killed when a stone storefront collapsed on them. Two other people suffered minor injuries. In Mackay, a woman was hospitalized due to her injuries. =Old Faithful= After the earthquake and aftershocks, the eruption intervals of Old Faithful geyser in Yellowstone National Park, about east, were noticeably lengthened. =Sand blows= Near Chilly Buttes of Thousand Springs Valley, a series of artesian fountains/sand blows erupted immediately after the main shock. Groundwater gushed from these fountains forming small craters and depositing aprons of light-colored sandy sediment around each crater.

Alvin was formerly located at the homestead and farm of Alvin Thomas Patterson (1865‚Äì1942), a logging contractor and farmer who settled there about 1901, originally from Parrsboro, Nova Scotia. A post office operated at that location from 1915 to 1955. In 1959 a new post office opened at the confluence of Fish Hatchery Creek and the Pitt River upstream from the original site. It was operating as late as 1982 with the postal code V0M 1C0. The Alvin area has been the site of various logging-related industrial operations, which connected to the outside world via tug and barge traffic on Pitt Lake and the Pitt River. There is still a logging camp in the valley, operated by The Teal Jones Group, which has a sawmill in Surrey. There was once a fish hatchery in the area, as indicated by the name of the creek at the modern site of Alvin. Cleanup of an industrial garbage dump near the river's banks became an issue of concern to sport fishermen, as the Pitt is a river noted for steelhead fishing. The issue came to a head in 2005 when the Pitt River shifted course and began eroding the dump, sending debris downstream. Eventually, 25 000 tonnes of waste and contaminated soil were removed from the area.

Childhood and education Cameron was born in 1899 in Echuca, Victoria to George Cameron and his wife Emily Pascoe. He was educated at state schools in local villages including Mitiamo, Lancefield, Dunkeld and finally (from 1911 to 1917) at Kyneton, although from 1913 to 1917 he was occupied with compulsory military service. He gained a scholarship to Queen's College at the University of Melbourne, where he studied medicine from February 1916 to 1922, when he graduated with a second-class MB BS. A lecture by Harry Brookes Allen convinced Cameron to focus on pathology, and he was appointed Stewart Lecturer of Pathology at the University of Melbourne in 1924. Career In 1925 Charles Kellaway invited Cameron to work at the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research as the deputy director, where he remained until 1927, when he left to take up a position at University College Hospital (UCH) under Arthur Boycott, with the idea that he would return to take over from Harry Allen. When his time in London was up however he discovered he did not want to return, and he instead took up board with Fred Crewe (Boycott's chief technician) and his wife Alice, with whom he lived for the rest of his life and who remained devoted to him. He never married. In 1929 he became Graham Scholar in Pathology at the Hospital, followed by a promotion to Beit Fellow for Medical Research in 1930. He spent a year as a pathologist at Queen Mary's Hospital but, unhappy with the job, returned to UCH in 1934, this time as a Reader in Pathology. Boycott retired as Reader in Morbid Anatomy in 1937 and Cameron succeeded him, although he then spent much of World War II working with Joseph Barcroft at Porton Down studying the effects of poison gas. After the war Roy returned to UCH, this time as head of the Graham department. He retired in 1964 and died of heart disease on 7 October 1966. He was knighted in 1957. He had made his only return visit to Australia in 1962 to accept an honorary Doctor of Laws from the University of Melbourne.

He was a distinguished mathematical statistician whose wide-ranging research included the analysis of martingale inequalities, Markov processes, de Finetti's theorem, consistency of Bayes estimators, sampling, the bootstrap, and procedures for testing and evaluating models. He published extensively on methods for causal inference and the behavior of standard statistical models under non-standard conditions ‚Äì for example, how regression models behave when fitted to data from randomized experiments. Freedman also wrote widely on the application‚Äîand misapplication‚Äîof statistics in the social sciences, including epidemiology, public policy, and law.  Biography and awards  Freedman was a fellow of the Institute of Mathematical Statistics and the American Statistical Association and an elected fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. He won the 2003 John J. Carty Award for the Advancement of Science from the National Academy of Sciences \\"for his profound contributions to the theory and practice of statistics, including rigorous foundations for Bayesian inference and trenchant analysis of census adjustment.\\" He was a Fellow at the Miller Institute for Basic Research in Science in 1990, an Alfred P. Sloan Foundation Fellow in 1964‚Äì66, and a Canada Council Fellow at Imperial College London in 1960‚Äì61. Freedman was born in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, on 5 March 1938. He received a B.Sc. from McGill University in 1958 and a M.A. and a Ph.D. from Princeton University in 1959 and 1960, respectively. He joined the University of California, Berkeley Department of Statistics in 1961 as a lecturer and was appointed to the research faculty in 1962. He remained at Berkeley his entire career. He started his professional life as a probabilist and mathematical statistician with Bayesian leanings but became one of the world's leading applied statisticians and a circumspect frequentist. Freedman was a consulting or testifying expert on statistics in disputes involving employment discrimination, fair loan practices, voting rights, duplicate signatures on petitions, railroad taxation, ecological inference, flight patterns of golf balls, price scanner errors, bovine spongiform encephalopathy (mad cow disease), and sampling. He consulted for the Bank of Canada, the Carnegie Commission, the City of San Francisco, the County of Los Angeles, and the Federal Reserve, as well as the U.S. departments of energy, treasury, justice, and commerce. Freedman and his colleague Kenneth Wachter testified to the United States Congress and the courts against adjusting the 1980 and 1990 censuses using estimates of differential undercounts. A 1990 lawsuit that sought to compel the United States Department of Commerce to adjust the census was heard on appeal by the U.S. Supreme Court, which ruled unanimously in favor of the Commerce Department and Freedman and Wachter's analysis. With David Kaye, Freedman wrote a widely used primer on statistics for lawyers and judges published by the Federal Judicial Center, the education and research agency for the United States federal courts. In addition to his work in forensic statistics, Freedman had a broad impact on the application of statistics to important medical, social, and public policy issues, such as clinical trials, epidemiology, economic models, and the interpretation of scientific experiments and observational studies. In his applied work, Freedman emphasized exposing and checking the assumptions that underlie standard methods, as well as understanding how those methods behave when the assumptions are false. He characterized circumstances in which the methods continue to perform well, and those where they break down‚Äîregardless of the quality of the data. Two of his earlier results (1963 and 1965) investigate whether or not and under what circumstances a Bayesian learning approach is consistent, i.e. when does the prior converge to the true probability distribution given sufficiently many observed data. In particular the 1965 paper with the innocent title \\"On the asymptotic behaviour of Bayes estimates in the discrete case II\\" finds the rather disappointing answer that when sampling from a countably infinite population the Bayesian procedure fails almost everywhere, i.e. one does not obtain the true distribution asymptotically. This situation is quite different from the finite case when the (discrete) random variable takes only finite many values and the Bayesian method is consistent in agreement with earlier findings of Doob (1948). Freedman was the author or co-author of 200 articles, 20 technical reports and six books, including a highly innovative and influential introductory statistics textbook, Statistics (2007), with Robert Pisani and Roger Purves, which has gone through four editions. The late Amos Tversky of Stanford University observed that \\"This is a great book. It is the best introduction to how to think about statistical issues....\\" It has a \\"wealth of real-world examples that illuminate principles and applications....a classic.\\" Freedman's Statistical Models: Theory and Practice (2005) is an advanced text on statistical modeling that likewise achieves a remarkable integration between extensive examples and statistical theory. Landmark articles by Freedman include \\"Statistical Models and Shoe Leather\\" (1991), \\"What is the Chance of an Earthquake?\\" (2003), \\"Methods for Census 2000 and Statistical Adjustments\\" (2007), and \\"On Types of Scientific Enquiry: The Role of Qualitative Reasoning\\" (2008).

In an attempt to combat ghost goals, rules allowing goal-line technology were passed by the International Football Association Board in 2012 and have consequently been introduced for some football competitions, including the FIFA World Cup, FIFA Club World Cup and Premier League. Etymology In Germany, the term \\"Phantomtor\\" usually refers to a Bundesliga \\"goal\\" awarded to Bayern Munich player Thomas Helmer in April 1994 against 1. FC N√ºrnberg, as his team scraped to a 2‚Äì1 victory. It was an error of judgement by the match officials, as the ball missed the goal and instead went over the byline. The \\"goal\\" directly influenced the outcome of the competition at both ends of the table ‚Äî had the Phantomtor not stood and the match finished 1‚Äì1, Bayern Munich would have ultimately lost out on the league title on goal difference and N√ºrnberg would have survived relegation by one point ‚Äî and led to an official objection by FIFA because the German Football Association ordered the result to be annulled and the game to be replayed. A re-match eventually took place and Bayern Munich ran out 5‚Äì0 winners. The term in the English language arose from a quote by Chelsea manager Jos√© Mourinho, following a 2004‚Äì05 UEFA Champions League semi-final against Liverpool, ultimately decided by a single goal by Luis Garc√≠a, awarded by referee ƒΩubo≈° Micheƒæ, but dubbed a \\"ghost goal\\" and described as \\"a goal that came from the moon\\" by Mourinho. Television replays were inconclusive as to whether the ball crossed the line or not. Micheƒæ said that his decision was based on the reaction of the assistant referee, who signalled that the ball had indeed crossed over the line, but had he not awarded Liverpool the goal, he would have awarded them a penalty kick and sent off Chelsea goalkeeper Petr ƒåech for a foul on Milan Baro≈° instead. After studying a series of still images of the incident, motion expert Dr. Mike Spann concluded that Micheƒæ had made the correct decision by signalling a goal. After the 2005 incident, the terms \\"ghost goal\\" and \\"phantom goal\\" have both been used to describe similar incidents at both club and international level. Incidents at club level In 1980, Clive Allen shot a free kick for Crystal Palace against Coventry City, after which the ball rebounded off the stanchion but the referee disallowed the goal as he thought it had just hit the outside of the stanchion. This was shown on Match of the Day on BBC television when it was then transmitted on Sunday afternoons. A few months before the 2004‚Äì05 UEFA Champions League semi-final between Chelsea and Liverpool which led to the term \\"ghost goal\\" entering the lexicon, Pedro Mendes of Tottenham Hotspur caught Manchester United's goalkeeper Roy Carroll off his line with a shot from 55 yards out, in the 89th minute of a Premier League match in 4 January 2005. Carroll attempted to catch the ball but spilled it over his shoulder and a few yards over the goal line, before scooping the ball back into the playing area. Referee Mark Clattenburg and his officials were unable to determine whether the ball had crossed the line and the game finished goalless. Referee Stuart Attwell awarded a goal to Reading against Watford in an English Championship match in September 2008, despite the ball having passed wide of the goal, meaning his assistant should have awarded a corner kick; the match finished 2‚Äì2. A similar incident happened in a 2. Bundesliga match between MSV Duisburg and FSV Frankfurt, when Christian Tiffert took a shot that hit the crossbar and landed 1.5 metres outside of the goal-line, yet was still awarded as a goal. Conversely, during an English Championship game in August 2009, Crystal Palace's Freddie Sears put the ball in the net, hitting the stanchion at the back of the goal and bouncing out. A goal was not awarded. This was very similar to the incident that had occurred for Crystal Palace's Clive Allen almost 30 years earlier. Another incident in England came in a Premier League game between Bolton Wanderers and Queens Park Rangers on 10 March 2012, when QPR's Clint Hill headed the ball in from close range, crossing the line by a couple of yards, before goalkeeper √Åd√°m Bogd√°n was able to palm the ball onto the crossbar and out. The Football Association (FA) subsequently called for goal-line technology to be implemented as soon as possible. The corner which led to the goal had in fact been wrongly awarded, and should have been a Bolton goal kick, meaning two bad decisions \\"evened themselves out\\". On 25 February 2012, with A.C. Milan leading 1‚Äì0 against Juventus, Sulley Muntari appeared to have doubled Milan's lead with a header from a cross by Urby Emanuelson, but the goal was not given by referee Paolo Tagliavento despite the ball crossing the line while being saved by Gianluigi Buffon; the match ended 1‚Äì1. Juventus eventually went on to win the Serie A title that year, beating Milan to the Scudetto by four points. On 15 April 2012, in Chelsea's FA Cup semi-final against Tottenham Hotspur, referee Martin Atkinson awarded Chelsea a goal resulting from a 49th-minute shot by Juan Mata. Atkinson ruled the shot had crossed the line, despite replays confirming several Tottenham players had successfully blocked the effort at a point several yards in front of the goal-line. John Terry, the Chelsea player with the clearest view of the \\"goal\\" from his vantage point on the ground, admitted uncertainty, \\"I thought it hit me, if I'm honest. I don't think it did [cross the line], I thought it stayed out, but I've not seen it on the replay.\\" On 18 October 2013, Stefan Kie√üling of Bayer Leverkusen was involved in a situation against 1899 Hoffenheim. He appeared to have missed the net on a header attempt off a corner. He turned away in frustration only to have his teammates come and celebrate with him seconds later. Upon further review, the ball ended up in the back of the net after squeezing through a hole in the side netting, unnoticed by everybody at the time. The goal was allowed and was the cause of much debate after the match. On 16 November 2013, Adrian Cieslewicz of Wrexham was involved in a situation of this kind. With Wrexham 2‚Äì0 down at Kidderminster Harriers in a Conference Premier game, Cieslewicz burst into the penalty area and appeared to slot the ball into the bottom corner of the net. However, the ball had actually squeezed through a hole in the net, and referee Amy Fearn originally disallowed the goal. After six minutes of consultation, with her assistants amidst protests from the Wrexham players, the goal was awarded. However, Kidderminster took advantage of the delay in the match and scored to make it 3‚Äì1. On 28 November 2015, Ryan Donk of Kasƒ±mpa≈üa was involved in a situation against Galatasaray. With Kasƒ±mpa≈üa 1‚Äì0 down at Galatasaray in a S√ºper Lig match, Donk kicked the ball. It hit the crossbar and then fell to 9 cm inside of goal line. However, referee Halis √ñzkahya looked at the linesman and disallowed the goal and continued the match, which finished 2‚Äì2. On 26 November 2017, Lionel Messi kicked the ball towards Valencia CF goalkeeper Neto, but passed by him and entered the goal by several inches. The referee did not see, and the goal was not awarded. The game ended 1‚Äì1. On 17 June 2020, the first day the 2019‚Äì20 Premier League resumed since its postponement from the COVID-19 pandemic, a free kick by Sheffield United's Oliver Norwood was carried over the goal line by Aston Villa goalkeeper √òrjan Nyland, after colliding with teammate Keinan Davis. Despite goal-line technology and video assistant referee being implemented, neither systems nor the match officials signalled for a goal. Hawk-Eye, operators of the goal-line technology, issued an apology after the game, stating that the view of the cameras were occluded by the players and goal frame. Incidents at international level =1966 World Cup Final= Geoff Hurst's \\"Wembley goal\\" during the 1966 World Cup final. In the 1966 FIFA World Cup Final played in London's original Wembley Stadium between England and West Germany, 11 minutes of extra-time had elapsed and the score was level at 2‚Äì2. Alan Ball put in a cross to England striker Geoff Hurst, who swivelled and shot from close range. The ball hit the underside of the crossbar bouncing down towards the line and bounced off the ground before being cleared away by West Germany's defenders. The England players celebrated a goal, but referee Gottfried Dienst was uncertain if they had indeed scored. He consulted his assistant, Tofiq Bahramov; after a brief conversation in broken English, the Swiss referee awarded the goal to the home team. The crowd and the audience of 400 million television viewers were left unsure whether the ball had crossed the line and whether the goal should have been given or not. Bahramov, from Azerbaijan, became celebrated in English popular culture as \\"the Russian linesman\\", as Azerbaijan was part of the Soviet Union at the time. Bahramov also became famous in his home land: Azerbaijan's national football stadium was named after him and a statue was built. When England played the Azerbaijan national team in a World Cup qualifier in October 2004‚Äîin the stadium named after Bahramov‚Äîmany England fans travelling to the game asked to be shown the grave of the official, who had died in 1993, so that they could place flowers on it, and before the match a ceremony honouring him was attended by Hurst and other footballing celebrities. In England, supporters cite the good position of the linesman and the statement of Roger Hunt, the nearest England player to the ball, who claimed it was a goal and that was why he wheeled away in celebration rather than attempting to tap the rebounding ball in. Goals in association football are awarded when \\"the whole of the ball passes over the goal line\\". The Germans argue that if that were the case, it would likely have bounced from there into the net, not out on the field as it did. In addition, German players claimed to have seen chalk dust, which would indicate it was not a goal and that the ball had merely bounced on the goal-line. The English counter by saying that the backspin put on the ball after hitting the crossbar could just as likely have caused the ball to bounce behind the line and then back out of the goal. Hunt claimed to have seen the ball bounce behind the line. When Bahramov wrote his memoirs, he stated that he believed the ball had bounced back, not from the crossbar, but from the net, so the further movement of the ball was already insignificant, and not visible for him either so it did not matter where the ball hit the ground anyway. Referee Dienst did not see the scene. Commentators such as Robert Becker of Kicker magazine accused the assistant of bias because the German team had eliminated the Soviets in the semi-final. A study conducted by the engineering department at Oxford University concluded the ball did not cross the line entirely and that it was 6 cm away from being a goal. In Germany it led to the creation of the expression Wembley-Tor, or \\"Wembley goal\\", a phrase used to describe any goal or non goal scored in a similar fashion to Hurst's. There exists colour footage of Hurst's goal, taken from another angle by an amateur cameraman situated on the stands and having a view almost parallel to the English goal line. This film material appears to show that the ball did not cross the goal- line in full. England went on to win the match 4‚Äì2 and secure their first and only World Cup so far. =Bulgaria v Romania at Euro 1996= On 13 June 1996, during the group stage match between Bulgaria and Romania, the ball of Dorinel Munteanu crossed the goal line by about one foot, after which it bounced back. Referee Peter Mikkelsen did not notice and did not award the goal. As a consequence, Romania lost the match. =England v Germany at the 2010 World Cup= On 27 June 2010, England were playing Germany in the knockout round of the 2010 World Cup in Bloemfontein. In the 38th minute, 53 seconds after Matthew Upson had scored for England, Frank Lampard shot the ball and it hit the underside of the crossbar, resulting in it crossing the line into the goal but bouncing back into the field of play due to backspin (without hitting the net). Neither the referee nor his assistant were in a position to award the goal. Had the goal been given, England would have drawn level at 2‚Äì2. Germany, where this goal was given names like \\"Wembley goal reloaded\\", \\"inverted Wembley goal\\" or \\"revenge for Wembley\\", went on to win the game 4‚Äì1. =England v Ukraine at Euro 2012= On 19 June 2012, on the final matchday of the group stage of UEFA Euro 2012, the match between England and Ukraine featured a ghost goal by Ukraine's Marko Deviƒá. With co-hosts Ukraine trailing 0‚Äì1, Deviƒá's shot was hooked clear from behind the England goal-line by John Terry under the eyes of a fifth official standing beside the goal. However, Deviƒá's teammate Artem Milevskiy was offside in the build-up to the incident, which also went unnoticed by the match officials. The following day, UEFA and its chief refereeing officer Pierluigi Collina admitted an error had been made and that Ukraine had been denied a legitimate goal. Then-FIFA president Sepp Blatter called the use of technology \\"a necessity\\". =Cyprus v Scotland at Euro 2020 qualifying= On 16 November 2019, during the UEFA Euro 2020 qualifying, during the Group I stage, Georgios Efrem shot the ball and hit the underside of the crossbar, resulting in it crossing the line into the goal but bouncing back into the field of play due to backspin (without hitting the net). the referee did not see, and the goal was not awarded. The game ended 1‚Äì2.

The full title is \\"The readie & easie way to establish a Free Commonwealth, and the excellence therof compar'd with the inconveniences and dangers of readmitting kingship in this nation. The author J[ohn] M[ilton]\\". In the tract, Milton warns against the dangers inherent in a monarchical form of government. A second edition, published in March 1660, steps up the prophetic rhetoric against a monarchy. Background The 1650s took their toll on Milton, and he was already in a declining state, beginning with his wife dying during the birth of their third daughter and their son dying later in that year. As the years progressed, his blindness overtook him and he was alone. Matters were further complicated for Milton by the death of Cromwell in 1658 and the end of the English Commonwealth. The work was a final plea to try to stop the restoration of a monarchy while Milton promoted the establishment of a Republic. However, this resulted only in his being ignored and mocked.Rumrich 2003 pp. 154‚Äì155 Milton began writing a pamphlet during early February 1660 while the Rump Parliament was in session with the support of General George Monck. It seemed certain that Monck would put forth a republican form of government that Milton supported but various complications divided Monck from the Parliament during this time. On 21 February, Monck forced Parliament to readmit members that were purged in December 1648 and it seemed certain that the Commonwealth would stay in power. The tract was written to persuade those who still thought that a monarchy would serve as a better form of government than the one Monck was setting into motion.Knoppers 2003 pp. 315‚Äì316 This was not to happen, and when Milton published his pamphlet The Readie and Easie Way in late February, it was only one month before the Restoration would reestablish a monarchy.Keeble 2003 p. 133 By March 1660, Parliament enacted various laws which forced pledges to the defence of the king and all connections with the Commonwealth were dissolved. This was compounded by laws that allowed royalists who may have supported the Parliament during the Civil War to be granted the right to vote shortly before the Long Parliament was dissolved. Monck did not allow the republicans under his command to stand in the way of an establishment of a monarchy, and he eventually allowed the king to return. This prompted Milton to publish a second edition of The Readie and Easie Way at the beginning of April 1660Knoppers 2003 p. 321 Tract Milton begins his work with a message of hope and admits that he is \\"not a little rejoicing to hear declar'd, the resolutions of all those who are now in power, jointly tending to the establishment of a free Commonwealth\\".Milton 1974 pp. 353‚Äì354 Early in the tract, Milton believed that the premise of his work would be accepted by his fellows:Dzelzainis 2003 p. 297 \\"I doubt not but all ingenuous and knowing men will easily agree with me, that a free Commonwealth without single person or house of lords, is by far the best government\\".Milton 1974 pp. 364‚Äì365 He continues by attacking \\"the fond conceit of something like a duke of Venice, put lately into many mens heads, by som one or other suttly driving on under that prettie notion his own ambitious ends to a crown\\" and declares that \\"our liberty shall not be hamperd or hoverd over by any ingag'ment to such a potent family as the house of Nassaw, of whom to stand in perpetual doubt and suspicion, but we shall live the cleerest and absolutest free nation in the world\\".Milton 1974 pp. 374‚Äì375 Milton puts forth his Republican ideas throughout the piece, but he occasionally allows other forms of government to slip into consideration. At one moment, he talks about a monarchy that may satisfy the needs of the people, but he is quick to dismiss such a monarchy as being what England needs: > I denie not but that ther may be such a king, who may regard the common good > before his own, may have no vitious favourite, may hearken only to the > wisest and incorruptest of his Parlament: but this rarely happ'ns in a > monarchie not elective; and it behoves not a wise nation to committ the summ > of thir well-being, the whole of thir safetie to fortune. And admit, that > monarchy of it self may be convenient to some nations, yet to us who have > thrown it out, received back again, it cannot be prove pernicious.Milton > 1974 pp. 377‚Äì378 With the monarchy about to be restored, Milton predicted that > if we return to kingship, and soon repent, (as undoubtedly we shall, when we > begin to find the old encroachments coming on by little and little upon our > consciences, which must necessarily proceed from king and bishop united > inseparably in one interest,) we may be forced perhaps to fight over again > all that we have fought, and spend over again all that we have spentMilton > 1974 p. 423 In particular, Milton feared that a future King \\"must be ador'd like a Demigod, with a dissolute and haughtie court about him, of vast expence and luxurie, masks and revels\\" and fill the court with debauchery.Milton 1974 p. 425 Near the end of the work, Milton describes how no one would bother to listen to what he said: > What I have spoken, is the language of that which is not called amiss ‚ÄúThe > good old Cause:‚Äù if it seem strange to any, it will not seem more strange, I > hope, than convincing to backsliders. Thus much I should perhaps have said, > though I were sure I should have spoken only to trees and stones; and had > none to cry to, but with the Prophet, O earth, earth, earth! to tell the > very soil it self, what her perverse inhabitants are deaf toMilton 1974 pp. > 462‚Äì463 =Second edition= The second edition of The Readie and Easie Way was transformed with the knowledge that Monck would not stop the Restoration. An epigram, taken from Juvenal, connects Monck to Sulla and Sulla's dictatorship leading to the rise of Caesar:Knoppers 2003 pp. 321‚Äì322 et nos consilium dedimus Syllae, demus populo nunc (we have advised Sulla, now let us advise the people).qtd in Knoppers 2003 p. 321 The tract responds to various attacks on the first edition, including those who believe that there will be less liberty under a republican government that may ignore the will of a people. Milton believes that the even if the majority want a monarchy, they are attacking their own liberty and that the minority must try to preserve the freedom of everyone:Knoppers 2003 p. 322 > More just it is doubtless, if it com to force, that a less number compel a > greater to retain, which can be no wrong to them, thir libertie, then that a > greater number for the pleasure of their baseness, compel a less most > injuriously to be thir fellow slaves. They who seek nothing but thir own > just libertie, have always right to win it and to keep it, whenever they > have power, be the voices never so numerous that oppose it.Milton 1974 p. > 455 Themes Milton's view of monarchy and the decadence of monarchy is a theme later emphasised in Paradise Lost. Within this epic, Satan is directly linked to monarchical rule, whereas the pre-fallen Adam is able to act without the pomp of the court. Instead, Milton promotes a republican form of government and believes that it is impossible for a government run by an individual to ever work even if the individual was completely virtuous. He also believed that a true republican would not accept a monarchical form of government.Dzelzainis 2003 p. 298 The tone of the piece is to ensure that the citizenry would not backslide into their old monarchical ways. In particular, Milton relied on predictions of the future combined with biblical analogies to ensure that people knew the dangers inherent in such a governmental system. In particular, Milton argued that it would be a sin against God to bring back the monarchy and warned against the lack of freedom and virtue that would correspond with a king.Knoppers 2003 p. 316 The second edition emphasises the prophetic qualities of the work.

Early life and education  A native of St. Louis, Missouri and Rockford, Illinois, Lovett earned a bachelor's degree in Radio/TV News and Print Journalism from Southern Illinois University in 1983. She received a Master's of Fine Arts in writing from Lindenwood University.  Professional career  Shortly after graduating from SIU-C, Joan began her career in Broadcast Journalism at WICD-TV in Champaign, Illinois; from Champaign, she moved on to WTLV-TV in Jacksonville, Florida. By the late 1980s and early 1990s, she developed a national reputation when she became a top weekday news anchor at WSVN-TV in Miami, Florida. In November 1992, Lovett was hired by WBBM-TV as a weekend anchor, although she did not begin work at the station until spring 1993. By the time Lovett arrived in the spring of 1993, however, she was used not as a weekend anchor but as a fill-in anchor. In mid-1993, she and fellow anchor Penny Daniels began anchoring the station's new noon newscast. Later that year, she began co-anchoring the station's 6 p.m. newscast with Bill Kurtis. She moved from that newscast in late 1994 to make way for the station's hiring of Mary Ann Childers and in 1996, Lovett began co-anchoring WBBM's new 6 a.m. newscast with Dave Price, who now co-hosts CBS's \\"The Early Show.\\" During this time, Lovett was the winner of four Television Emmy Awards as well as nominated for a Peabody Award for her coverage of Hurricane Andrew. In late 1998, Lovett obtained an early release from her contract with WBBM.

It is the largest co-educational boarding school in Ireland. The school's students are mainly Protestant (Church of Ireland), although it is open to other denominations. The College motto Comme je trouve, which means \\"As I find\\" in French, comes from the family coat of arms of the Butlers, an aristocratic family in the area and former patrons of the school. It is intended to encourage grit, striving through adversity and taking life's challenges head on. It was founded in 1538 to replace the School of the Vicars Choral, which had been founded in 1234. Piers Butler the Earl of Ormond located it in the city centre. It was moved to its current location on the outskirts of Kilkenny in 1985. History Kilkenny College provides schooling mainly for the Protestants of the community but is also open to other denominations. It caters for both a boarders and day-pupil. Founded in 1538 by Piers Butler, 8th Earl of Ormond and his wife, Margaret, Kilkenny Grammar School as was then called was located to the west of the cathedral and sited beside the library of St Canice's Cathedral. The 1538 school replaced the older School of the Vicars Choral, which was founded in 1234. It was closed for a period in the 1650s (because of the English civil war that spilled over into Ireland), reopening as Kilkenny College in 1667 under the auspices of James Butler, 1st Duke of Ormond, following the Butler tradition of promoting education in the city. It soon became a famous school and so, in the 1780s, a new College was built on the same site overlooking the river Nore on John Street. In 1985 the college was relocated to the site at Celbridge House on the outskirts of the city, while the old school with its Georgian buildings and elegant facade, now known as County Hall, houses the offices of Kilkenny County Council within Kilkenny city centre. At one time the college was termed a university and boasted a complement of three professors. In contrast at the end of the 19th Century, the college was reduced to one pupil. The amalgamation with the nearby Pococke school was its saving. Twenty-nine headmasters of Kilkenny College are recorded, including such notable figures as Edward Jones, Bishop of St Asaph and John Mason Harden. In the 20th Century there were four long-serving men: C.G. Shankey 1917 - 1952; Gilbert Colton 1953‚Äì1979; Samuel McClure 1979‚Äì1996; Canon Robert John Black 1996‚Äì2005. E. R. Dodds, the famous classicist and Michael Cusack also taught at the school. During Gilbert Colton's time the school was amalgamated with the Collegiate School Celbridge in 1973 and Kilkenny College became co-educational. During Sam McClure's stewardship, the College moved to its new campus in 1985, relocating to the 63 acre (254,952m¬≤) site at Celbridge House on the outskirts of the city. Under Canon Robert John Black, Kilkenny College saw a significant phase of growth, development and expansion to the facilities and resources of the school during his nine years of leadership. =Coat of arms= The school's coat of arms is inherited from the Butler family. The escutcheon (shield) and crest in use today are almost identical to those formally described in Burke's Peerage. Butler's heraldric supporters (termed dexter and sinister) do not appear on the school's coat of arms. The Butler family motto (\\"Comme Je Trouve\\"), originally appearing on the crest, now appears below the school's shield. The most widely used version of the school's coat of arms (the official one) has evolved with some changes. The silver quadrants of the escutcheon and the falcon itself have become white, the third quadrant's lion has emerged passant (walking past) while the fourth quadrant has lost its ermine (tail spots on fur). It's not clear if these small changes are attributable to artistic interpretation, simplified draughtsmanship (in the case of ermine) or possibly error (the lion). The modern coat of arms is supported by the letters \\"K\\" and \\"C\\" at the sides, and 1538, the year the college was founded at the bottom. Today The current campus on the outskirts of the city comprises a complex of classrooms, dormitories, catering and dining facilities, it is set on a landscaped site. Today Kilkenny College attempts to serve a dual purpose role as the largest co-educational boarding school in Ireland and as the local school for a large number of day pupils from the city and surrounding area. It is one of five schools in the country taking part in a pilot project on self-assessment and interchange in conjunction with 100 other European schools. The ethos of the school is one of a family community and an emphasis is placed on team sport in particular rugby and hockey. In March 2013, the school announced that it would no longer be charging tuition fees for all students. Instead, only boarders and students who availed of extra-curricular activities would pay for accommodation, food, and other services.

The game was originally released for Microsoft Windows in 2009, and has since been ported to Linux, OS X, and the PlayStation Network. The game takes place in a medieval fantasy setting and allows players to take control of three separate characters who can battle enemies and solve environmental puzzles. A sequel, titled Trine 2, was released in 2011. A remake of Trine, titled Trine: Enchanted Edition, was released in 2014. The enchanted edition uses Trine 2 updated engine, and includes online multiplayer. The third installment in the series, Trine 3: The Artifacts of Power, was released on August 20, 2015. A fourth installment, Trine 4, was released on October 8, 2019.  Gameplay  The player controls and switches between three different characters (a thief, a knight, and a wizard) to try to complete levels. There is also a cooperative play feature, whereby multiple players can join in at any time to control different characters simultaneously. Each character has their own health and energy meter. Energy is used for certain weapons and abilities, and is replenished by blue-colored bottles found throughout levels. Health is replenished by collecting heart-shaped containers, which result from destroying certain enemies. The player also has a single experience rating that is shared among all characters, and is incremented by acquiring green-colored bottles found throughout levels. Every 50 experience points, each character is given one point towards the purchase of upgrades to their abilities. Treasure chests are also spread throughout levels, each containing a charm that offers the bearing character new or upgraded abilities. The player can transfer these objects between characters, though some will only have an effect on certain characters. Checkpoints are spread throughout levels, in the form of silver orbs on pedestals. Upon crossing a checkpoint, any deceased characters are brought back to life, and any characters below a certain amount of health and energy are replenished up to that amount. The amount of energy and health replenished is dependent upon the difficulty setting chosen by the player. When a character dies, the player must choose another living character to continue playing the level. If all three characters die, the player is sent back to the last checkpoint crossed, and all three characters are resurrected. Enemies primarily include walking skeletons, spiders, and bats, along with boss characters, like giant skeletons and other large creatures. Some skeletons are armed with swords, others with bows and arrows, some spit fire, and some have shields. Skeletons are capable of scaling walls. Other dangers include lava, fireballs, giant sharp pendulums, and various other booby traps. Trine uses Nvidia's PhysX physics engine to provide objects and characters with full physics interaction. = Characters = Zoya the Thief, the first of the three heroes introduced in the game, is voiced by Vicky Krueger. The Thief's weapon is her bow and arrow. The bow can be ‚Äúcharged‚Äù by holding down the fire button before releasing, and longer charges make for farther, straighter shots. The Thief also has a grappling hook which can be fired at wooden surfaces. Regular arrows and the grappling hook are unlimited, and do not diminish the Thief's energy. At some point during the game, the Thief can acquire the ability to shoot flaming arrows, which do diminish her energy. Flaming arrows inflict more damage on enemies, can break certain objects, and can light torches found in certain dark areas of the game. The Thief's possible upgrades include shooting more arrows with each shot, faster charging of the bow, and more damage inflicted with the flaming arrow. She is the quietest of the three heroes, and takes a strong liking to the magical forest ruins presented towards the end of the game. Game screenshot including Berlin the Wizard and Pontius the Knight Amadeus the Wizard, voiced by Kevin Howarth, has the ability to use sorcery to move objects remotely, as well as conjure new objects into existence. Initially, the Wizard is only able to conjure a cube-shaped object. At some point in the game, he acquires the ability to conjure an oblong platform (called a ‚Äúplank‚Äù in the game). The box and plank behave as normal objects, obeying the laws of physics and gravity. The Wizard later acquires the ability to conjure a floating object shaped like a square pyramid (called a floating platform in the game), which remains at a fixed point in space unless the Wizard moves it. Conjured objects are primarily used to help overcome obstacles and reach difficult areas. The plank, for example, can be used to bridge gaps. All conjuring and remote moving drains the Wizard's energy. The Wizard has no traditional attacks, however he can crush certain enemies by hurling objects into them. He can also block attacks by conjuring or moving objects in their path. The Wizard's possible upgrades include the ability to conjure more than one box or plank into simultaneous existence (whereas initially only one of each could be on the screen at once), changing future conjured floating platforms into wood (so that the Thief can attach her grappling hook to it), and making the floating platform into an explosive that the Knight or thief can trigger. In the game, he is shown as being wise but also foolish, cowardly but determined, and imagines himself to be a bit of a ladies man. Pontius the Knight's initial weapons are his sword and shield. He is voiced in the game by Brian Bowles, and is presented as a brave and loyal companion despite the fact he is not that bright, and has a strong love for food and drink. The player can at some point acquire a flaming sword during the game, which the Knight can use to inflict more damage as well as use to light torches; the player can also pick up a sledgehammer for Pontius. The Knight also has the ability to lift certain objects and hurl them, and his shield can be used to deflect enemy attacks, as well as falling objects and projectiles. The Knight's possible upgrades include additional sword damage, charging attacks, and additional sledgehammer attacks.  Plot  Trine takes place in a forsaken and ruined kingdom. After enjoying a period of great peace, the king died without leaving an heir, plunging the kingdom into political instability. Taking advantage of the chaos, an undead army suddenly appeared and attacked, forcing the inhabitants to abandon the realm, save for those few souls brave enough to face the perils that had now befallen it. The game's story is primarily told by an all knowing narrator voiced by Terry Wilton. Speaking after the fact, he fills in plot details in between the levels, as well as introducing and concluding the game. After some time, the Astral Academy, an institution of magical studies, is evacuated due to the undead menace; Zoya the Thief sees this as an opportunity to search the academy for treasure. Unknown to her, Berlin the Wizard is just waking up after sleeping for a fortnight due to a backfired potion he prepared while trying to learn the fireball spell; he realizes he must escape immediately. Finally, Pontius the Knight had also arrived, convinced that it was his duty to protect the academy. The three meet at the shrine of ancient treasure and, touching a magical object at the same time, disappear. The Wizard recalls that the treasure is actually an artifact called the Trine, which has the power to bind souls. This results in only one of them being able to physically exist, with the other two being forced to remain inside the Trine. Berlin also remembers that the Trine was connected to the legend of a guardian, whose tomb could be found under the Astral Academy. Searching for a way to free themselves of the Trine's effect, the three heroes explore the catacombs under the academy, finding the guardian's tomb. The Wizard deciphers some of the inscriptions inscribed on it and discovers that there were once three artifacts: one for the soul, one for the mind and one for the body, each protected by a guardian. The guardians used the three objects to maintain peace throughout the kingdom. Berlin believes that reuniting the three artifacts might undo the spell binding their souls. The inscriptions also suggest that the artifact of the mind was guarded in the castle of the old king. The trio searches the castle; while they do not find the artifact, they learn from the king's journal that the three relics were originally created in some ruins immersed in a large forest, the home of the three guardians. In the ruins, one of the guardians give the heroes visions of the past. These ruins were the resting place of the artifact of body, but an earthquake left its shrine vulnerable and it was stolen. It was then somehow paired with the artifact of the mind. Without the Trine, the artifact of souls, the other two became tainted and gave birth to an evil tower and the undead, creatures with a physical body and capable of thought, but devoid of purpose and righteousness. The trio ascends the tower, avoiding the obstacles created by the tormented soul of the old king and combines the Trine with the two lost artifacts, unbinding their souls. The undead are cleansed through the kingdom, allowing it to eventually recover, with the Wizard, the Thief and the Knight proclaimed as its heroes. The game ends with the narrator describing what happens to the three heroes; Pontius gives in to his true passion and becomes the new king's royal ale provider, Zoya is given reign over the forest ruins, and Berlin marries a lady called Margaret, who gives birth to triplets that master the fireball as infants.  Development  Trine was originally started as a side-project by Jukka Kokkonen, Frozenbyte's senior programmer, while the rest of the team was working on another project. The other project ran into publisher and funding problems however, and the team decided to focus their efforts instead on developing Trine. Release The game was first released for Windows on July 3, 2009. The PlayStation Network version was to be released in July 2009, but last-minute bugs discovered in testing caused a delay. It was released on September 17, 2009 in Europe and on October 22, 2009 in North America. A port of the game to OS X was released on November 2, 2010. The game was later ported to Linux by Alternative Games, with the finished port being first released as part of the Humble Frozenbyte Bundle.The Humble FrozenByte Bundle! Linux Gaming News, April 12, 2011 (Article by Maxim Bardin) A version for Xbox Live Arcade was being developed by Atlus, but ‚Äúmost likely won't happen‚Äù according to Frozenbyte. On June 18, 2014 a beta for Trine: Enchanted Edition was released. It ports the game to Trine 2 engine and adds online multiplayer. It was officially released on July 24, 2014. Trine: Enchanted Edition was released on PlayStation 4 and Wii U. Partnered with GameTrust, Trine: Enchanted Edition was announced and released on the Nintendo Switch on November 9, 2018.  Reception and legacy Trine received generally favorable reviews, according to review aggregator Metacritic. Trine won GameSpot \\"Best Downloadable Game\\" Editor's Choice award at Electronic Entertainment Expo 2009. PC Format magazine praised the game's \\"stunning attention to detail throughout\\", and added that its \\"beautifully fluid game mechanics are impossible not to appreciate.\\" IT Reviews recommended Trine, and concluded: \\"Trine is an aesthetically pleasing and well executed puzzle platformer, with a distinct addictive streak when it comes to fully exploring the levels in order to upgrade your characters to their maximum power. When you're done with single player, the multiplayer mode adds extra life to the game, as the experience is genuinely different.\\" IGN was more reserved, saying that \\"a lack of enemy variety, disappointing conclusion, and the wonky multiplayer keep Trine from greatness, but this is still a highly recommended puzzle platformer.\\" The Australian video game talk show Good Games reviewers both gave Trine 15/20. In February 2011, Frozenbyte announced Trine had sold approximately 400,000 copies across all platforms. Later that year on December 8, shortly before the release of the sequel, they stated that sales of the game had by then grown to 1.1 million copies. In October 2014, Frozenbyte announced that the Trine series had sold 7 million copies by then. In November 2013, an announcer pack featuring the voice of the narrator was released for the multiplayer online battle arena game, Dota 2. Sequels To date, three sequels to Trine have been developed by Frozenbyte. Trine 2 was released in December 2011 for Windows, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360, with later ports to the Wii U, PlayStation 4, and Nintendo Switch. Trine 2 included the series' first downloadable content pack, the Goblin Menace. Trine 3: The Artifacts of Power was released for personal computers in August 2015 with later ports for the PlayStation 4 and Nintendo Switch. Trine 3 veered from the previous games by making the gameplay based on 3D platforming, rather than the 2.5D of the previous two games, and generally was not as well-received due to this change. Trine 4: The Nightmare Prince was released in October 2019 for personal computer, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch, with a return to the 2.5D style of the first two games. Alongside Trine 4, the Trine: Ultimate Collection will be released as a retail package, containing all four games and additional physical goodies.

Both states tried to exert control over the independent-minded Cossacks. While the early uprisings were against the Commonwealth, as the Russian Empire gained increasing and then total control over the Ruthenian (Ukrainian) lands where the Cossacks lived, the target of Cossacks uprisings changed as well. The origins of the first Cossacks are disputed. Traditional historiography dates the emergence of Cossacks to the 14th to 15th centuries. Towards the end of the 15th century, the Ukrainian Cossacks formed the Zaporozhian Sich centered on the fortified Dnipro islands. Initially a vassal of Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, the increasing social and religious pressure from the Commonwealth caused a series of uprisings, and the proclamation of an independent Cossack Hetmanate, culminating in a rebellion under Bohdan Khmelnytsky in the mid-17th century. While the Cossacks were useful to the Polish-Lithuanian states in the war periods, they proved to be more problematic in the peacetime, due to their raids on the Commonwealth neighbours (primarily, the Ottoman Empire and its allies). Further, the Polish nobility tried to assert control over the Cossack territories, turn them into feudal latifundia, limit the growth of the militant Cossacks, and even reverse it, by turning the Cossacks into serfs. Afterward the Khmelnytsky Uprising, the Treaty of Pereyaslav brought most of the Cossack Hetmanate under Russian control. The Zaporozhian Cossacks were not the only notable group of Cossacks; others included the Don Cossack Host, Dlobodsk Cossacks, Terek Cossacks and Yaik Cossacks. As the Tsardom of Muscovy took over the disputed Cossacks lands from the Poland-Lithuania, eventually all Cossacks came under the Russian rule, but the Tsarist and later Imperial government had only a limited control over the Cossacks. The Cossacks provided refugee for runaway serfs and bandits, and often mounted unauthorized raids and pirate expeditions against the Ottoman Empire. While the Cossack hosts in the Russian Empire served as buffer zones on its borders, the expansionist ambitions of the empire relied on ensuring control over the Cossacks, which caused tension with their traditional independent lifestyle. As the empire attempted to limit Cossacks autonomy in the 17th and 18th centuries this resulted in rebellions led by Stenka Razin, Kondraty Bulavin and Yemelyan Pugachev. In extreme cases, whole Hosts could be dissolved, as was the fate of the Zaporozhian Sich in 1775. In this last phase of their history, the Cossacks lost most of their autonomy to the Russian state. Cossack uprisings, like the Cossack people themselves, have been portrayed variously in the Polish, Russian and Ukrainian historiographers.

Within the state of Ohio, the route runs from US 6 in Sandusky to the West Virginia border at Bridgeport. Route description In Ohio, U.S. 250 is an important cross-state corridor linking Sandusky (on Lake Erie) to Bridgeport (on the Ohio River). From a regional/traffic perspective, the route can roughly be divided into five sections linking major regions and routes of the state: * US 6 in Sandusky to US 20 at Norwalk * US 20 at Norwalk to US 30 at Wooster * US 30 at Wooster to I-77 at Strasburg * I-77 at New Philadelphia to US 22 at Cadiz * US 22 at Cadiz to I-70 at Bridgeport =Sandusky to Norwalk= US 250 begins in Sandusky, Ohio at an intersection with US 6 (Cleveland Road). It begins carrying the name Sycamore Line, but US 250 leaves this road shortly for Milan Road. This part of the route carries much traffic connecting to the Ohio Turnpike, and during the summer, people bound for Cedar Point. It is the most heavily developed section of the road, lined with big box stores, a regional shopping mall, an outlet mall, and numerous hotels, indoor waterparks and restaurants. US 250 crosses SR 2 as it travels south and eventually crosses the Ohio Turnpike on Interstate 80 (I-80) and I-90. It then picks up SR 13 before passing west of Milan. After a short stretch, it enters Norwalk on Milan Avenue. It turns onto League Street and travels southwest to Whittlesey Avenue, which becomes Benedict Avenue as the street travels southeast through the center of the city. =Norwalk to Wooster= Much of this section of the route is rural and two-lane, but it carries a high level of truck and regular traffic. US 250 exits Norwalk and crosses US 20/SR 18 (Norwalk Bypass) at a diamond interchange. The route heads in a generally southeasterly direction until Fitchville, where it enters on Wooster Street. SR 13 finally separates from US 250 before the latter turns onto Mill Street Extension, turning south off said road shortly after. US 250 continues southeast until it meets SR 60, and the two routes enter Savannah on North Main Street and pass straight through town. They continue together toward Ashland, where it meets an intersection with Cottage Street. SR 60 continues south on Cottage Street, while US 250 turns east, meeting US 42 east of the city and forming an overlap as it turns south. Upon meeting Main Street, US 250 leaves US 42 at an interchange and turns east. It passes through sparse development outside the city until it interchanges with I-71. US 250 continues east on Ashland Road in open countryside, passing through small communities. West of Wooster, US 250 enters US 30, carrying the name Lincoln Way, and bypasses the city to the south, exiting at a partial cloverleaf interchange which sends it south on SR 83. US 250 then turns east on Dover Road south of the city. =Wooster to Strasburg= On Dover Road, US 250 follows a two-lane alignment as it passes through mostly open fields on its path to Strasburg. The route forms the main streets of several communities as it passes through them, such as Apple Creek, Mount Eaton, and Wilmot. It intersects SR 21 just before entering town, which it does on Wooster Avenue. This densely populated stretch of US 250 in Strasburg has been proposed for a bypass, but the project has not been selected for further work as of 2008. After passing through Strasburg, US 250 enters I-77. The two routes then travel south concurrent with one another. =New Philadelphia to Cadiz= I-77 and US 250 travel in a southern direction until reaching New Philadelphia. The two highways form a bypass of the city, with the concurrency forming the west side and US 250 along forming the south side, as I-77 separates from US 250 in the southwest corner of the city. SR 800 joins the freeway at Broadway outside of New Philadelphia as it follows the Dennison/Uhrichsville freeway bypass of US 250. The two routes follow a four-lane, divided highway toward Uhrichsville, where US 250/SR 800 turns west at an interchange with US 36\\\\. At the end of the dual highway, SR 800 turns south toward Dennison, and US 250 turns north, following a two-lane, curvy alignment en route to Cadiz. Approximately halfway between Dennison and Cadiz, US 250 follows Tappan Lake for several miles on a series of causeways built during the construction of the lake by the Muskingum Watershed Conservancy District in the 1930s. This route is generally of good quality (albeit without shoulders), although ODOT is studying replacement or upgrade through its Macro-Corridors Project. Near Cadiz, it merges onto the Cadiz Bypass, where it runs concurrent with US 22. It then turns onto Lincoln Avenue and passes through the city of Cadiz. US 250 then turns onto Market Street and follows it south out of town. =Cadiz to Bridgeport= From Cadiz, US 250's name changes to Cadiz-Harrisville Road, heading south-southeast. Shortly after exiting the city, US 250 begins to curve and wind sharply, with several hairpin turns. For much of this distance, the road is surrounded by dense residential areas and runs on ridge tops. After it passes through Harrisville, the road becomes less curvy but is fronted densely with homes for almost the remainder of its route within the state, save the forest at its south end, where it features another hairpin curve. It continues southeast to Bridgeport, where it features a partial interchange with SR 7\\\\. US 250 then joins US 40 and crosses the Ohio River into West Virginia. The poor alignment of this section of the highway, along with the fact that it runs through Cadiz as opposed to bypassing it, limits the usefulness of this section of the road as a through route. To resolve these issues, the Ohio Department of Transportation is developing plans to construct a Super 2 replacement for this route. A bypass of Cadiz was planned for construction in 2004, although it has not been built as of 2017. The new route is to roughly parallel SR 9 and SR 331, running from Cadiz to a point near Saint Clairsville. At this point, it is expected that US 250 will be realigned to follow I-70 east to Wheeling, West Virginia.

Life and Education Rabbi Luban was born and raised in Holyoke, Massachusetts. His brother is Rabbi Yaakov Luban, the rabbinic coordinator of the Orthodox Union's Kashruth division. He attended the flagship high school of the Rabbinical Seminary of America (RSA) in Queens during the early 1970s. After completing high school he studied for a year at the Seminary's affiliate in the Sanhedria Murchevet section of Jerusalem, Israel. While there he learned with Rabbi Avrohom Kenarek and Rabbi Shia Grodzitski, both students of the saintly Rabbi Boruch Ber Leibowitz, the dean of the pre-World War Two rabbinical seminary which was known as Kaminetz. Rabbi Luban then returned to America where he studied for over 15 years at RSA under the tutelage of Rabbi Henoch Leibowitz one of the greatest sages of his generation. He received his rabbinic ordination in the early 1980s. Career In 1988 Rabbi Luban moved with his family to Jerusalem, Israel where he took a position as a teacher at Yeshiva Chofetz Chaim-Israel Branch. This was a particularly auspicious event for Rabbi Luban as he was now serving on the staff of his former school. He worked in conjunction with both Rabbi Kenarek and Rabbi Dovid Chait inspiring his students to grow to great heights in both Torah and Mussar. While there he incorporated the concept of a Mussar Vaad- a approach to help students deal with life's challenges. In the fall of 2000 Rabbi Luban was offered a position as Rosh Yeshiva of RSA's affiliate in North Miami Beach. After asking and getting a blessing of success from his beloved Rebbe, Rabbi Leibowitz, he picked up his family and moved to Florida to assume the position. Under his auspices, the student body at the Bais Medrash level more than tripled. Rabbi Luban began publishing his original Talmud ideas while a student at RSA. Since then, he has published works on at least eight tractates of the Talmud. Some have been published in several editions, as he is continuously expanding and revising those works. The name of his Sefer (book) is called Biurim Veiyunim. He has also published Rabbi Leibowitz's sermons on the Pentateuch. The name of the Sefer is called the Chiddushei Haleiv.

When the child only lives with one parent, in a sole custody arrangement, then the parent with which the child lives is the custodial parent while the other parent is the non- custodial parent. The non-custodial parent may have contact or visitation rights. In a shared parenting arrangement, where the child lives an equal or approximately equal amount of time with the mother and father, both are custodial parents and neither is a non-custodial parent. A \\"child-custody determination\\" is a judgment, decree, or other order of a court providing for the legal custody, physical custody, or visitation with respect to a child. A custody determination can be made through a permanent or temporary order, or as part of an initial custody determination or later modification of a prior custody order. A custody determination may be made at the same time as an order for child support or a similar financial obligation for a parent, but is separate from a child support order.See, e.g.,  Child custody and visitation  There are two kinds of child custody: legal custody and physical custody. Physical custody, designates where the child will live, whereas legal custody gives the custodial person(s) the right to make decisions for the child's welfare. Often one parent will retain physical custody, while sharing joint legal custody with the other parent. The noncustodial parent is typically required to pay child support, and visitation is arranged. Where the child will live with both parents, joint physical custody is ordered, and both parents are custodial parents. In the case of joint physical custody a 50/50 equal shared parenting schedule is typically not required, therefore the joint custodial parent may have the minority of time with the child but not be said to be a non-custodial parent. For example, states such as Alabama, California, and Texas do not necessarily require joint custody orders to result in substantially equal parenting time, whereas states such as Arizona, Georgia, and Louisiana do require joint custody orders to result in substantially equal parenting time where feasible. The noncustodial parent might live in the same city as their child or reside in another city, state or country. Most airlines offer ‚Äúunaccompanied minor‚Äù services for children traveling without a parent, guardian, or another trusted adult. The age requirements generally used by the airlines are between the ages of five and eleven years old (and sometimes up to 15 ‚Äî it is always advisable to contact the airline to make sure that they accept unaccompanied minors as passengers).  United States  = Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) = Within the United States, family law differs from state to state, and noncustodial parents are a diverse population, with many factors affecting custody arrangements, from which parent is awarded custody to negotiating visitation schedules. A noncustodial may have difficulty in accessing medical records, educational status and other information regarding their child, but there is some federal legislation which supports the rights of a noncustodial parent who retains legal custody of their child. Student education records are official and confidential documents protected within the United States by strong privacy protection laws, most notably the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA). FERPA, also known as the Buckley Amendment, defines education records as all records that schools or education agencies maintain about students. FERPA gives parents the right to review and confirm the accuracy of education records and applies to public schools and state or local education agencies that receive Federal education funds, both paper and computerized records. In addition to the Federal laws that restrict disclosure of information from student records, most states also have privacy protection laws that reinforce FERPA. State laws can supplement FERPA, but compliance with FERPA is necessary if schools are to continue to be eligible to receive Federal education funds. FERPA gives both parents, custodial and noncustodial, equal access to student information unless the school has evidence of a court order or state law revoking these rights. When students reach the age of 18, or when they become students at postsecondary education institutions, they become \\"eligible students\\" and rights under FERPA transfer to them. However, parents retain access to student records of children who are their dependents for tax purposes. In the case of divorce or separation, a school district must provide access to both natural parents, custodial and non-custodial, unless there is a legally binding document that specifically removes that parent's FERPA rights. Custody or other residential arrangements for a child do not, by themselves, affect the FERPA rights of the child's parents. One can best understand the FERPA position on parents' rights by separating the concept of custody from the concept of rights that FERPA gives parents. Custody, as a legal concept, establishes where a child will live, and often, the duties of the person(s) with whom the child lives. The FERPA, on the other hand, simply establishes the parents' right of access to and control of education record related to the child. Generally, a school is not required to provide parents copies of records. However, if the distance is great enough to make it impractical for the parent to visit the school to review the record, the school must make copies of the record and send them to the parent when that parent requests access to the record.

Background  = Mid-century railroading = Following a disastrous experiment with state-financed railroad construction in the 1830s and 1840s the people of Michigan had expressly outlawed the direct investment in or construction of \\"any work of internal improvement\\" in the state constitution of 1850. Out of that calamity had come two railroads which would dominate the Michigan landscape: the Michigan Central Railroad and the Michigan Southern Railroad (which would become the Lake Shore and Michigan Southern Railway). A second wave of construction came in the 1850s as federally sponsored land grants encouraged the development of new routes such as the north-south Grand Rapids and Indiana Railroad and the Flint and Pere Marquette Railroad, which traversed the lumber-rich region of northern Michigan. The third wave developed during the 1860s as communities in southern Michigan sought railroad connections. Railroads were believed to spur economic growth and offered better transportation than plank roads; additionally, those communities which already possessed railroads desired additional lines to promote competitive rates between railroad companies. Private finance, however, proved lacking: \\"there seemed to be little chance that southern Michigan communities hoping for a railroad could get one without some form of public subsidy.\\" Seeking aid, local communities petitioned the state legislature for permission to loan money to railroads. Initially, this was done on an individual basis. A typical example was the city of Saginaw, which sought and obtained permission by an act of legislature to \\"issue bonds and loan up to $40,000 to the Amboy, Lansing and Traverse Bay Railroad,\\" subject to approval by local voters. By 1867 there were dozens of such requests pending before the state legislature. = Detroit and Howell Railroad = The Detroit and Howell Railroad (D&H;) was incorporated on June 17, 1864, at a meeting of Howell businessmen in New Hudson. The D&H; intended to construct a line from Detroit to Howell. Part of the proposed route passed through Salem Township, which is located in Washtenaw County, north of Ann Arbor. Under an act passed in 1864, the people of Salem Township voted to provide aid to the D&H; in the form of bonds. The township authority, however, refused to issue the bonds, claiming the act was unconstitutional, prompting the railroad to apply for a writ of mandamus.  Decision  Writing for the majority, Justice Thomas M. Cooley struck down the law on the grounds that railroads were a private enterprise and the public funding thereof violated the Michigan constitution. Cooley enunciated three principles which formed the basis of taxation: #It must be used for a public purpose. #It must be imposed \\"not arbitrarily or by caprice.\\" #If imposed specifically on a locality (as opposed to a statewide tax), the tax must be of benefit for the locality itself. Cooley rejected the notion that railroads were a \\"public highway,\\" writing: > They are not, when in private hands, the people's highways; but they are > private property, whose owners make it their business to transport persons > and merchandize in their own carriages, over their own land, for such > pecuniary compensation as may be stipulated. These owners carry on, for > their own benefit, a business which has, indeed, its public aspect, inasmuch > as it accommodates a public want, and its establishment is consequently, in > a certain sense, a public purpose.

Reflecting on the state constitution's bar on the funding of internal improvements, Cooley stated that > what the state as a political community cannot do it cannot require the > inferior municipalities to do. When the case is found to stand entirely > outside the domain of taxation, state burdens and township burdens are alike > precluded' no township vote and no township majority however large, can > affect the principle.  Impact  The immediate impact of the decision was to throw the development of railroads in the state of Michigan into chaos and to call into question the validity of all municipal bonds already issued. The latter question would eventually be taken up by the Supreme Court of the United States, which held in Taylor v. Ypsilanti (1881) that bonds issued prior to the Michigan court's ruling were valid and had to be honored: > ... we are of opinion that the rights of the plaintiff, as the owner of > bonds issued under a statute which, when passed, was valid by the laws of > Michigan, as declared and acted upon by the several departments of its > government, are not affected by decisions of the Supreme Court of the State > rendered after the railroad company, to whose rights the plaintiff > succeeded, has earned the bonds under contract with the city made in > conformity with the statute. Far from terminating local funding of railroads, the ruling forced municipalities and railroad companies to change their approach. In lieu of direct aid, railroads sought stock subscriptions from private citizens directly. So-called \\"promoters\\" roamed the state, drumming up support for various railroad schemes, many of which never came to fruition. In the same year as People v. Salem, the D&H; merged with the Howell and Lansing to form the Detroit, Howell and Lansing under James F. Joy. After this the D&H; ceased to exist as an independent company.

Bodily mutilation is most usually portrayed in the context of horror, but is also used in other genres, such as medical dramas or war films. It is used primarily either to shock or fascinate the audience of a film, or to add a sense of realism to a film. Improved special effects in recent decades have seen an increase in the prevalence of bodily mutilation in film. Brief history =Early years= Lon Chaney as the phantom in the 1925 film The Phantom of the Opera In the early years of motion picture history, horror was often used in order to attract and intrigue audiences. To frighten and fascinate the audience was the goal. Lon Chaney was well known for his portrayals in various horror films, but the subject in focus is his use of makeup to create his ghastly visages. He was known as ‚Äúthe man of 1,000 faces.‚Äù (Rickett 2000) Chaney was arguably one of the forerunners of makeup use in horror films. Some others include actors Boris Karloff and Lon Chaney Jr. But it was the man behind their makeup, Jack Pierce, who made them what they were (Rickett 2000). While these movie makers didn't make films rife with violence and mutilation, their influence on later film makers was great. Early horror movies focused on suspense and monsters but as realism has progressed, movie makers have focused more on realistically portraying the horrible fate of whoever is unfortunate enough to fall victim to the fell devices. =Advent of Horror= Although there was a boom of monster and alien flicks in the 50s and movie makers using make up more for realistic depictions of violence and gore in the 60s,Rickett 2000, p. 212 the advent of realism in horror as we now know it arguably began with the 1973 film The Exorcist. This was the first of its kind as far as special effects used realistically to portray gruesome scenes. This movie, created by director William Friedkin with make up master Dick Smith directing the effects set the stage for countless other such films to be made. After the release of The Exorcist and its subsequent popularity scary movies began to shift and the violent horror flick became a major genre. With effects greats Kevin Yagher, Dick Smith, and Tom Savini behind such classic horror films as Friday the 13th (1980), A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984), Halloween (1978), and Dawn of the Dead (1978) this genre gained immense popularity (Rickett 2000). This craze peaked during the 80's went down a little in the 90's but with the movie Scream (1996) horror movies were back in. As special effects continue to get better, so the horror films continue to grow even more violent, gruesome, and realistic in their portrayals of human mutilation as can be seen in the recent Saw films (2004,2005, 2006, 2007) as well as others such as Hostel (2005) and Hostel: Part II (2007). However horror films are not the only movies that have worked to realistically portray bodily mutilation. =War Films= War movies have often romanticized battle and violence for glory; but after the Vietnam War, many movies worked to portray war in its true form, all the violence, brutality, and even the psychological distress included. This is shown in several films including The Deer Hunter (1978) and Casualties of War (1989). A great example is the classic film Saving Private Ryan (1998). In the beginning of this movie there is a 15-minute scene showing the landing of American troops at Omaha beach. In this scene there are untold amounts of blood and gore as German machine guns literally rip the U.S. soldiers apart. Other war movies such as Flags of Our Fathers (2006), Enemy at the Gates (2001), and Letters from Iwo Jima (2006) work to show the effects of battle on the human body. =Modern Media= Nowadays, you can find body mutilation in many different kinds of movies. Some of the more common examples are in movies or shows that depict hospital or law enforcement. As hospital and police movies and TV shows gain popularity and attempt to make the situation more real, they have utilized techniques to make operations and crimes as realistic as possible. This includes breaks, burns, cuts, surgery, and violent attacks. This portrayal is often graphic, but accurate. Regardless of intent, movies have progressed greatly from the early years of Chaney and Pierce in the realistic portrayals of bodily mutilation. Notable names =Lon Chaney= Lon Chaney Sr., still from The Miracle Man (1919) Although not a pioneer when it comes to mutilation, Lon Chaney was the inspiration for many film makers who were. Born on April 1, 1883 in Colorado Springs, Colorado to deaf mute parents, Lon Chaney did not have the easiest childhood (Anderson 1997). However, this did not prevent him from becoming a magician with makeup. Throughout many various films, Chaney perfected his craft. He did his makeup for all the films he was in. Chaney's makeup kit set the standard for later makeup departments in Hollywood.Anderson 1997, p. 101 While his most widely known films are The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1923) and The Phantom of the Opera (1925), perhaps some of his most important contributions to modern horror films and their emphasis on the mutilation came from his work in lesser known films. For example, Chaney used collodian to make realistic scars and deformities for his characters Singapore Joe in The Road to Mandalay (1926), Ricardo in Victory (1919), and Tiger Haynes in Where East is East (1929). Chaney died on August 26, 1930 in Los Angeles, California due to complications with throat cancer (Anderson 1997). =Jack Pierce= Jack Pierce did the makeup man behind popular monster creatures Frankenstein (1931), The Mummy (1932), and The Wolf Man (1941) (Rickett 2000). =Dick Smith= Born on June 26, 1922, Dick Smith is one of the most influential men on the art of makeup. As John Caglione Jr. put it, ‚ÄúNo one will ever take over for Dick Smith. In forty-five years of doing makeup, I don‚Äôt think anyone‚Äôs touched him. He is the heavyweight champion of makeup (Timpone 1996).‚Äù Master of makeup, Smith helmed many movies‚Äô special effects, but he excelled in prosthetics and age makeup. Notable examples are that of Marlon Brando as the Don in The Godfather (1972) and F. Murray Abraham as Salieri in Amadeus (1984). He also did age makeup for Max von Sydow as Father Merrin in The Exorcist making this 44-year- old look 74 (Multimedia Publications 1986). In this movie he made maybe his greatest contribution to modern mutilation technique with the 360¬∞ turn of Linda Blair's head. This scene complete with vomit spewing and severe facial distortions set the bar for future film makers. Although possibly his greatest contribution to horror, it was not his last. He later worked on other films including the 1977 film The Sentinel in which he coordinated the effects for a gruesome nose and eye slashing (Timpone 1996) among other things. A picture of Tom Savini =Tom Savini= Known as the King of Splatter (Rickett 2000), Tom Savini has quite a reputation for his work in horror movies much of which has included severe bodily mutilation in many circumstances. According to Anthony Timpone in his book Men, Makeup, and Monsters, Savini started his career young. Earlier makeup artists provided him with inspiration. ‚ÄúLon Chaney became a hero,‚Äù he said.Timpone 1996 p. 63 Drafted into the military during the Vietnam War, he became a combat photographer. He would practice his craft on the men he was with, but also got a taste of true gore. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve seen the real stuff.‚ÄùTimpone 1996 p. 65 While in Vietnam, Savini saw many gruesome sights including bodies in rigor mortis and even a dismembered arm. This may have provided him with material he would later use in his movies. And he did use gore and violence in his movies. Perhaps this is stated best by Timpone. ‚ÄúPrior to Savini‚Äôs work on Dawn of the Dead, realistic screen slaughter had rarely gone to the unrated extremes it would soon reach in the early 80s with Savini‚Äôs guidance. Via his macabre tricks, heads were severed, scalped, axed, exploded, and pierced. Machetes hacked off limbs, fangs tore through chunks of human flesh, and blood bags sprayed gallons of grue. Zombies, ghouls, demons, hideously disfigured maniacs, and other assorted Savini-created monsters racked up endless body counts.‚Äù This master of splatter was behind many horror films‚Äô effects including Martin (1978), Maniac, Friday the 13th (1980), Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter (1984), Day of the Dead (1985), The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 (1986), and Two Evil Eyes (1990). ‚ÄúMy job is to create the stuff as realistically as possible.‚Äù =Rick Baker= Rick Baker is known mainly for his work making ape films (Timpone 1996). However, he is well known for his work on An American Werewolf in London (1981), specifically the on screen transformation of the main character into a werewolf (Multimedia Publications 2986). While this may not be considered mutilation, the transformation is a radical change from human to monster and therefore evokes many of the same emotions. =Kevin Yagher= Mastermind behind the psychotic doll Chucky, Kevin Yagher is known for his work with animatronics (Timpone 1996). He also did effects for the Nightmare on Elm Street movies 2-4. =Bob Keen= Bob Keen did effects on the movies Hellraiser (1987) and Nightbreed (1990) =Greg Nicotero= Movies and television shows The Exorcist (1973) With the Linda Blair head turn and accompanying effects, this film inspired many film makers. Martin (1978) The scene where Martin, the title character, slits the wrist of an unconscious girl shows a trick used to fool the audience into believing in the realism of the action. Dawn of the Dead (1978) This film was very original. In fact, according to effects man Tom Savini, this film was largely improvised during its making. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôd be sitting around thinking of ways to kill a zombie.‚Äù These ways include stabbing one in the ear with a screwdriver, and cutting one's head to pieces with a helicopter's rotors.Timpone 1996, p. 66 Halloween (1978) and sequels Friday the 13th (1980) and sequels The Howling (1981) With its full on screen transformation and a scene where Eddie Quist gets acid flung into his face before a transformation, this movie shows the human body realistically distorted, and mutilated in the case of the acid, in a way new to film at the time. An American Werewolf in London (1981) Released in the same year as The Howling, this movie also showed the change from man to wolf. It also shows some pretty gruesome undead. While released later than The Howling this movie used some innovative techniques developed by Rick Baker and who went on to win an Oscar for his makeup on the film. (Hollywood tricks of the trade page 133) The Evil Dead (1981) This movie may not have been particularly successful or popular, but the makers were creative when faced with production problems, including having to come up with their own formula for fake blood. This consisted of corn syrup, food coloring, and instant coffee to thicken it (Multimedia Publications 1986). A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984) and sequels Scream (1996) and sequels ER (1994-2009) Saving Private Ryan (1998) CSI: Crime Scene Investigation (2000- ) and spin offs (Miami, New York, etc.) Black Hawk Down (2001) Saw (2004) and sequels Hostel (2005) and sequels Hatchet (2006) and sequels Techniques The tricks of the trade are what make these effects convincing. The following are a few basic techniques or tricks that have been used to create the image of mutilation. A jar of fake blood =Blood= Fake blood can be made in many different ways. One of the cheapest and easiest can be made with varying recipes including corn syrup and food dye. For example, in the movie The Evil Dead the makers used a mixture consisting of corn syrup, food coloring, and instant coffee.Multimedia Publications 1986, p. 148 Fake blood is used in nearly every, if not every single, movie that has shown bodily mutilation, be it human or otherwise. Some effective uses of fake blood include use of a squib, or small explosive device, with a metal plate between the actor and the squib and a packet of fake blood to simulate the blood splatter that would accompany a gunshot for example. Another used for fake blood is seen in the movie Martin when the main character cuts the wrist of a girl. This trick is accomplished by hiding a syringe or bulb behind the fake weapon and squeezing out the fake blood as the weapon is drawn across the victim.Multimedia Publications 1986, p. 128 =Scar effects= Fake scars can be made in many different ways. Actor Lon Chaney used collodian.Anderson 1997, p. 123 In more recent years, with the advent of latex and plastics there are many ways to make fake flesh and scarring. A light burn =Burns= Burns are used in many films and correct technique can create a more effective visual. For first degree burns, merely put down a red foundation with a little purple on top. Use skin colored powder to prevent the ‚Äúburn‚Äù from shining. For a second degree burn create fake blistering surrounded by the standard first degree reddening. To create the blistering, you can use petroleum jelly in saran wrap, or using pure gum latex and lifting the center after drying. Third degree burns are severe and should reflect that in the effect. The skin is charred and broken. This effect can be achieved with the latex, plastic wax material, or other plastic appliance. Be sure to color the burned flesh convincingly, then gradient from third degree burn, to second degree to first.Kehoe 1995, p. 234-235 =Latex= Latex is a synthetic rubber often used in special effects. Foamed latex is sometimes considered the \\"ultimate in prosthetic appliance.\\"Kehoe 1995 p. 192 It can be used in an inflatable bladder effect to make it seem like the actor's skin is moving or rippling like Rick Baker's werewolf change effect An American Werewolf in London. This is accomplished by covering an inflatable balloon of some type underneath a covering made of latex, urethane, or plastic molding.Kehoe 1995 p. 191 Latex can also be used to make scar effects or other more blatant mutilation. For example, with latex prosthetics, movie makers can make an actor appear to have more or less limbs than he should. They can also make the actor appear to be horribly wounded with flesh hanging and large gashes. To accomplish these tricks, the actor must first have a mold made of the part of him that will be replicated using latex. Take, as an example, one of the zombies in Dawn of the Dead. To make this actor seem to be rotting, they need to make a cast. The technicians prep the area of the body, say the face, to be cast. They must cover the hair and coat the eyebrows, eyelashes, and any other hair that can't be covered with petroleum jelly. Then they must apply the alginate or other comparable substance, completely covering the molding area, keeping the mouth, nose, or both open for breathing. When that is finished, they layer the area with plaster bandages to create the cast. When all of it has dried and settled, they remove the cast from the actor and put it together again to create the mold. After this, they pour plaster of Paris into the mold to create a cast that is exactly like the actors face. From the cast they can get another mold which they then can use to sculpt any prosthetic attachments they need.Kehoe 1995 p. 174-176 This can include fake limbs, fake skin, or growths. It is important to use the a good adhesive to apply the prosthetic. In his book Vincent Kehoe recommends one that is \\"easy to apply, set[s] rapidly, be dilutable for use, and be removable with a solvent that is not harmful to the skin.Kehoe 1995 p. 210 References =Print sources= * Rickett, Richard ‚ÄúSpecial Effets: The History and Technique‚Äù New York; Billboard Books, 2000 * Timpone, Anthony ‚ÄúMen, Makeup, and Monsters: Hollywood‚Äôs Masters of Illusion and FX‚Äù New York; St. Martin's Press, 1996 * Anderson, Robert G. ‚ÄúFaces, Forms, Films‚Äù New York; A.S.

The show don't had loud music and heavy VFX. The show had high emotional content and the characters were relevant to housewives. The character of Khushi Gill played by Manasi Salvi had many related qualities with Indian house wives as she was full of emotions and took decisions by heart not by brain. The show had a reality element while showing the friendship bond. The character of Sanjana played by Aparna Tilak was showcased as an over-confident and smart girl mixture that seems very real. The characters were neither shown in heavy saris and bindis nor was there any over-the-top drama. The bonding showed among the three friends was appreciable as it was the main focus of the show. The show had good TRPs and viewership unless the complete focus of story didn't shifted to Shruti and Tushar. The show was introduced as a story of three friends and their strong bonding even under hard circumstances but suddenly the complete focus was shifted to Shruti's life and show started losing viewership. A twist introduced of Tushar's murder and show again continued its smooth ride until the story reached more than 150 episodes, after which ratings declined and the show was cancelled. =Awards= Won * Manasi Salvi won Best Actress at 10th Kalakar Awards in the year 2002. * Rekhha Modi won Best Dialogue Writer at 1st Indian Telly Awards in the year 2002. * The Show won Best New Serial at 1st Indian Telly Awards in the year 2002. * The Show won Best Serial at 11th Kalakar Awards in the year 2003.

Biography Born to a Hassidic family, Rabbi Gliksberg studied in a yeshiva in Miedzyrzec Podlaski and later in the Tomchei Torah institution of Minsk, founded by The Great One of Minsk.Five Years in Minsk by Rabbi Shimon Yaakov Halevi Gliksberg He was ordained as a rabbi by the esteemed Rabbi Yosef Hacohen Ravitz, the rabbi of Rastovich, by Rabbi Haim Yehuda of Smorgan and Rabbi Moshe Shaul Shapira of Bobruysk. For several years, he assisted his father-in-law, Rabbi Mordechai Dovid Alpert, the head of a rabbinical court in the district of Minsk who was known as \\"Yad Mordechai,\\" the name of his most important book. In Minsk, Rabbi Gliksberg was one of the leaders of the Shlomei Emunei Zion group, which later became the Mizrachi movement. He was among the delegates to the movement's founding meeting in Vilna in the winter of 1902 representing his home town of Miedzyrzec Podlaski. He became a member of the Central Committee and was chosen together with Rabbi Ze'ev Yavetz to draft an organizational plan, to choose a name for the movement and to outline a platform for the new Zionist religious party. From that moment on, he continued to act as an advocate for the Mizrahi. When Rabbi Gliksberg came back to Miedzyrzec Podlaski to present his report on the conference, an audience of thousands assembled to hear him in the large Beis Midrash, where he had studied as a youth.Miedzyrzec Podlaski Izkor Book Rabbi Sh. R., Son of Reb Meir Gliksberg, of Blessed Memory by M. R. Slodki Rabbi Gliksberg accepted a position of a rabbi in Pinsk in 1902. He was a delegate to the Russian Zionist Conference in Minsk and to the Sixth Zionist Congress in Basel in 1903. After the death of Theodor Herzl he traveled to various large cities as a representative of Mizrahi to eulogize the visionary of the Jewish state. In 1906 Rabbi Gliksberg became a rabbi in Odessa. He devoted himself more than ever to Zionist activities and became the chair of the Mizrahi movement. He was also an active member of the Hovevei Zion organization. He was renowned for his extensive knowledge of Judaism and Jewish literature, and for being a brilliant interpreter and preacher. His sermons at the city's main synagogue and at the Zionist synagogue Yavneh drew crowds of young men who listened attentively to his every word as he spoke in a deeply convincing and captivating manner that had much popular appeal. In addition to his official duties as a rabbi he was active in the domains of education and social work. He was one of the founders of the Shomrei Torah yeshiva, and his efforts led to the establishment of public schools for impoverished Jewish children in affiliation with various synagogues. He was also a founder of the Ezrat Holim charitable organization. He published a pamphlet in Yiddish and Russian called Ezrat Holim about concepts of charity and about support for ailing members of the community. The pamphlet was distributed in thousands of copies. In 1917 Rabbi Gliksberg was a delegate to the National Congress of Ukrainian Jews.Russian Jewish Encyclopedia Volume I - Biographies, Epos, 1994 That same year he became a member of the Odessa City Council and was officially appointed as the city's chief rabbi. He continued to serve as Odessa's chief rabbi until 1937. In the 1920s Rabbi Gliksberg came to prominence in the course of seven ‚Äúreligious debates‚Äù with Anatoly Lunacharsky, members of Yevsektsiya, Russian religious leaders such as Alexander Vvedensky and others. The debates took place in stadiums and theaters of Odessa with thousands of people present. During one of the debates Anatoli Lunacharsky, the Commissar of Culture and Education, said, \\"My faith in collective redemption gives me such power in the future as cannot be given by any religion.\\" Rabbi Gliksberg replied, \\"The faith you have is precisely of the religious kind.\\"Rabbi Abraham Bick Glowing Embers: Maintaining Religious Jewish Life in the U.S.S.R., Tradition: A Journal of Orthodox Thought, 24(1), Fall 1988 During the debates Rabbi Gliksberg impressed the crowds with his erect posture, rhetorical talent, religious enthusiasm and apt remarks, as well as with his wide-ranging knowledge of philosophy, science and literature. Indeed, his power of conviction made him into what one of his opponents called a \\"dangerous debater.\\" In 1937 Rabbi Gliksberg moved to Eretz Israel where he was the head of the Rabbinical court of Tel Aviv.National Library of Israel Archives/Glicksberg, Shimon A great scholar and virtuous man, pure in spirit and thought, he ruled the religious court in a moderate, considerate, and pleasant manner. He was also a member of the Mizrahi's court of honoraries. For several years he served as one of the judges who awarded the Rabbi Kook Prize. After Rabbi Gliksberg's death a street in Tel-Aviv was named after him and his son, artist Chaim Gliksberg. Personal life Rabbi Gliksberg married Cypa Mejta Alpert, daughter of Rabbi Mordechai Dovid Alpert, A.B.D. Svisloch, who was a grandson of Aryeh Leib Epstein (Ba'al ha-Pardes) of K√∂nigsberg. They had 7 children, 4 daughters and 3 sons. His son Chaim Gliksberg moved to Eretz Israel in 1925 and became a renowned artist and author. The rest of Rabbi Gliksberg‚Äôs children lived in the Soviet Union until the day they died. The oldest daughter Eneta became a teacher and taught at Yevrabmol experimental school in Odessa. Daughter Eugenia became a well-known physician and medical researcher who published an impressive volume of work and received a Doctoral degree based on those publications. She served in the medical corps during World War II becoming a Major of Medical Corps and earning two Orders of the Red Star for bravery. Daughter Judith became a prominent child care specialist and daughter Sulamith was an infectious disease specialist. Rabbi‚Äôs son Shmuel died when he was 7 years old from scarlet fever.

The First Shaarei Shamayim Madison's Shaarei Shamayim congregation was founded in 1856 by Jewish immigrants from Germany. In 1863, they built a synagogue that was designed by August Kutzbock, a recent German immigrant, in the Rundbogenstil style, a nineteenth-century German form of Romanesque revival. 2019 article update. Kutzbock also used this distinctive style for the Carrie Pierce and Van Slyke Houses in the adjacent Mansion Hill district. The building now ranks as the eighth-oldest surviving synagogue building in the United States. The Panic of 1873 forced the lease of the building to a Unitarian congregation, and in subsequent years it was repurposed to house the Women's Christian Temperance Union, other churches, and a funeral home. Modern Use of the Building Gates of Heaven Synagogue was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1970, . and in 1971, thanks to the efforts of local citizens, the building was purchased by the city, restored, and moved to James Madison Park.

The second mutation can either be a loss-of- function mutation (equivalent to a knockout) or a gain-of-function mutation. Synthetic rescue could potentially be exploited for gene therapy, but it also provides information on the function of the genes involved in the interaction Types of genetic suppression =Dosage-mediated suppression= Dosage- mediated suppression occurs when the suppression of the mutant phenotype is mediated by the over expression of a second suppressor gene. This can occur when the initial mutations destabilize a protein-protein interaction and over expression of the interacting protein bypass the negative effect of the initial mutation. =Interaction-mediated suppression= Interaction-mediated suppression occurs when a deleterious mutation in a component of a protein complex destabilizes the complex. A compensatory mutation in another component of the protein complex can then suppress the deleterious phenotype by re- establishing the interaction between the two proteins. It usually means that the deleterious mutation and the suppressive mutation occurs in two residues that are closely located in the tridimensional structure of the multi-protein complex. As thus, this kind of suppression provides indirect information on the molecular structure of the proteins involved. =Experimental observation of theoretical prediction= The strongest form of synthetic rescues, in which the deleterious impact of a gene knockout is mitigated by an additional genetic perturbation that is also deleterious when considered in isolation, was modeled and predicted theoretically for gene interactions mediated by the metabolic network. This strong form of synthetic rescue has been recently observed in experiments in both Saccharomyces cerevisiaePartow S. H., Hyland P. B., and Mahadevan K., Synthetic rescue couples NADPH generation to metabolite overproduction in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Metab. Eng. 43, 64 (2017). and Escherichia coli.Wytock T. P. et al., Experimental evolution of diverse Escherichia coli metabolic mutants identifies genetic loci for convergent adaptation of growth rate, PLoS Genetics 14(3), e1007284 (2018). Patient survival analysis was also shown to predict synthetic rescues and other types of interactions. =tRNA-mediated suppression= Genetic suppression can be mediated by tRNA genes when a mutation alters their anticodon sequence. For example, a tRNA designated for the recognition of the codon TCA and the corresponding insertion of serine in the growing polypeptide chain can mutate so that it recognize a TAA stop codon and promote the insertion of serine instead of the termination of the polypeptide chain. This could be particularly useful when a nonsense mutation (TCA >TAA) prevents the expression of a gene by either leading to a partially completed polypeptide or degradation of the mRNA by nonsense-mediated decay. The redundancy of tRNA genes makes sure that such mutation would not prevent the normal insertion of serines when the TCA codon specifies them.

The book argues that for more than a decade Prime Minister John Howard took advantage of international crises and local anxieties to stay in government and significantly reshape Australian public life. The authors outline a theory that despite its conservative background the Howard Government was postmodernist, skeptical of organised politics and committed to policies based on a relative assessment of Australian cultural values rather than more universal international ideals. These characteristics, casting the government in a \\"radical conservative\\" mould, are presented as an explanation for the government's electoral success.

Life and career Rosenbloom co- edited The Insider with William Goldenberg and Paul Rubell; the film was directed by Michael Mann. The three editors were interviewed by Scott Essman in 1999 about the making of The Insider. Rubell noted that, \\"the camera work is kind of chaotic. It is the opposite of what you would call a controlled visual style. The camera is always moving and it is very jittery and when you look at the dailies, you see that the operators had great latitude in what they could physically do with the camera; they tried some wild things and Michael loved that. He would sort of control the chaos and shape it, but he allowed the chaos to occur.\\" Rosenbloom added, \\"I never worked with a director who gave such precise notes - the fact that the notes were precise and that there were so many of them made them imprecise because you couldn't possibly do everything that the note said to do. If you did, you would have 24 versions of the scene. The notes provided you with a road map and oftentimes the chaos in the editing was trying to figure out the one way that you could first put the scene together.\\" Rosenbloom's earlier television work garnered several additional Eddie and Emmy Award nominations.

At the age of 18, she began training with a Filipino dance troupe which performed in Japan. During her stay in Japan she met Toshiya Nishiumi and they married in Tokyo in 1993. In 1995, a Filipino friend who hosted the small online news program, WINS Japan, asked her to audition as a reporter. Although her Nihongo language skills were poor at the time, she still went on to try and eventually landed the job. She was later hired as a host reporter for the Oh Tokyo information program for the WINS Filipino-Japanese cable channel. It involved Nishiumi travelling to various tourist attractions in Tokyo and interviewing its locals in Japanese while she presents the show in Tagalog. The series ran for eight years starting from 2000 to 2008, until the channel's closure.

After US 25 breaks away and goes north toward the Blue Grass Army Depot, KY 21 continues to the east and intersects US 421 in Bighill before ending at the Jackson County line. Route description KY 21 begins at an intersection with KY 52 near Paint Lick in Madison County, heading southeast as two-lane undivided Paint Lick Road. The road passes through farmland with some trees and homes, curving south before heading back to the southeast. The route continues south and then southeast through more rural areas and comes to an intersection with the eastern terminus of KY 954. Following this, KY 21 heads east into wooded areas with some fields and residences, curving to the northeast. The road heads into Berea and enters commercial areas, curving east and coming to an interchange with I-75, at which point it is five lanes wide with a center left-turn lane. Past this interchange, the route becomes Chestnut Street and becomes a four- lane divided highway, intersecting US 25. At this point, US 25 joins KY 21 for a concurrency and the two routes pass through residential areas as a two-lane undivided road. The road passes over a CSX railroad line and heads northeast into the downtown area of Berea before it passes more homes.

The name \\"tenientes de Artigas\\" or \\"Companions of Artigas\\" honours the 19th-century freedom-fighter Jos√© Gervasio Artigas. The statutes governing the order were further modified in 1980, and ultimately repealed on 6 March 1985. In 1991, the government of Uruguay established the Medal of Military Merit as the highest military decoration of the Army of Uruguay. It uses the same ribbon as the Military Order of Merit of the Companions of Artigas.

Several known Marian images with the same title exist around the world while a particular Hispanic image is pontifically designated by Pope Benedict XV as the Patroness of Cuba. The present image, of the Madonna and Child, is enshrined in the National Shrine Basilica of Our Lady of Charity of El Cobre, built in 1926 and situated in the village El Cobre, near Santiago de Cuba. Pope Pius XI granted a Canonical Coronation for the image on 20 December 1936. The feast day of Our Lady of Charity is September 8; the solemn Nativity of the Blessed Virgin Mary.Our Lady of Charity: Nuestra Se√±ora del la Caridad del Cobre Various similar Marian images predating the Cuban image have a similar title as well as having been granted a canonical coronation by the Popes and can be found in the Spanish cities of Cartagena, Villarrobledo, Illescas, Loja, La Garrovilla, and Toledo, Spain along with its replicated copies in Basilica Minore of Our Lady of Charity in Agoo, and the image of Bantay Church in Ilocos Sur, Philippines. History A devotional rendering image of Our Lady of Charity, featuring the \\"two Indians\\" and an African passenger on its legendary ship. The history of the La V√≠rgen de la Caridad del Cobre, began around 1612. The image is thought to have been brought by Spaniard colonists from the town of Illescas, a province in Toledo, Spain where a similar statue of the Virgin Mary of Charity was already well-venerated. Local legend recalls the Spanish captains who bring with them religious Marian images to guide and protect them from English pirates at sea. Two Native American or Indian brothers, Rodrigo and Juan de Hoyos, and an African slave child, Juan Moreno, set out to the Bay of Nipe for salt. They are traditionally given the moniker the \\"three Juans\\". They needed the salt for the preservation of the meat at the Barajagua slaughter house, which supplied the workers and inhabitants of Santiago del Prado, now known as El Cobre. While out in the bay, a storm arose, rocking their tiny boat violently with incoming waves. Juan, the child, was wearing a medal with the image of the Virgin Mary. The three men began to pray for her protection. Suddenly, the skies cleared, and the storm was gone. In the distance, they saw a strange object floating in the water. They rowed towards it as the waves carried it to them. At first they mistook it for a bird, but quickly saw that it was what seemed to be a statue of a girl. At last they were able to determine that it was a statue of the Virgin Mary holding the child Jesus on her left arm and a gold cross in her right hand. The statue was fastened to a board with an inscription saying \\"Yo Soy la V√≠rgen de la Caridad\\" or \\"I am the Virgin of Charity.\\" Much to their surprise, the statue remained completely dry while afloat in the water. The Minor Basilica of Our Lady of Charity of El Cobre, built in 1926. Overjoyed by what they had discovered, they hurried back to Barajagua. They showed the statue to a government official, Don Francisco S√°nchez de Moya, who then ordered a small chapel to be built in her honor. One night, Rodrigo went to visit the statue, but discovered that the image was gone. He organized a search party, but had no success in finding Our Lady of Charity. Then, the next morning, she was back on the altar, as if nothing had happened. This was inconceivable as the chapel had been locked. This event happened three times. The people of Barajagua came to the conclusion that she wanted to be in a different spot, so they took her to El Cobre. She was received with much joy in El Cobre, and the church there had its bells ring on her arrival. It was at this point that she became known as \\"Nuestra Se√±ora de la Caridad del Cobre\\" or \\"Our Lady of Charity of El Cobre\\". Much to the dismay of people in El Cobre, the disappearance of the statue continued to happen.\\"Story of Our Lady of Charity\\", Sanctuario Nacional Ermita de La Caridad One day, a young girl named Jabba was playing outside, pursuing butterflies and picking flowers. She went towards the mountains of the Sierra Maestra, where she came across the statue on top of a small hill. There were those who did and those who did not believe the little girl's testimony, but in the end, the Virgin was taken to the spot of her discovery, where a church was erected for her. Before the famous image on 19 May 1801, a royal edict from king Charles IV of Spain decreed that Cuban slaves were to be freed from the El Cobre copper mines. The story circulated around the island quickly. Many felt that the Virgin purposely chose to have her sanctuary in El Cobre because it is located in Oriente Province. Later folk legends associated the taking of copper materials to their homes after having it blessed near the Virgin's sanctified image as a form of souvenir and miraculous healing. Description The Cuban statue venerated measures about 16 inches tall; the head is made of baked clay covered with a polished coat of fine white powder. Her feet rest on a brilliant moon, while angels spread their golden wings on a silver cloud. The child Jesus raises his right hand as in a blessing, and in his left hand he holds a golden globe. A popular image of Our Lady of Charity includes a banner above her head with the Latin phrase ‚ÄúMater Caritatis Fluctibus Maris Ambulavit‚Äù (Mother of Charity who walked on the road of stormy seas). Originally, the robes on the image were white in color. Newer robes are embroidered with gold and silver, which includes the national shield of Cuba. Among Cuban religious devotees, the image is given the familiar title of La Cachita. Pontifical approbations An antiquated image of Our Lady of Charity and her Cuban seers composed of mixed Mulatto races. Cuban revolutionary leader Carlos Manuel de C√©spedes presented the Cuban banner to the image along with his soldiers who wore a similar medal while Cuban general Calixto Garcia bowed at the image during a Holy Mass in honor of Mambises resistance. Our Lady of Charity acquired the title La V√≠rgen Mambisa or the Virgin for Cuban Independence. On 24 September 1915 the Cuban revolutionaries wrote a letter petitioning the Pope Benedict XV to honor her as Patroness of their country. * Pope Benedict XV declared Our Lady of Charity of El Cobre Patroness of Cuba on 10 May 1916 at the written request of the soldier veterans of the Cuban War of Independence.Our Lady of the Exile : Diasporic Religion at a Cuban Catholic Shrine pp. 22-24 - Thomas A.

Ryan, Ernest Hemingway keeps a promise with the Virgin Mary, MysticPost.com The medal was stolen in 1986, but was recovered days later upon the threat of Raul Castro that it be returned or the thieves suffer the consequences. After its return, it was, for some time, hidden from view. The medal is very rarely present in the image and only worn during solemn and Papal occasions. Our Lady of Charity venerated in other countries Our Lady of Charity, Official Patroness of La Garrovilla, Spain. Circa 1494. =Spain= An earlier image of Our Lady of Charity predating and sourcing the Cuban image is venerated in the town of Illescas, Toledo, Spain. Legend recalls that it was copied from a \\"Saint Luke\\" image from Antioch and brought by Saint Paul the Apostle to Toledo between the year 50 and 60 A.D. From that date, the image remained when the Archbishop of Toledo Eugenius II of Toledo, who placed the image in a Benedictine monastery. In the 16th century, the image was transferred to a local Hospital of Charity where a famed miraculous healing of paralyzed patient Francesca de la Cruz took place in 1562. During the same time, the image was revised, separating the heads and hands of the Virgin from its fully formed or detallado style, in order to allow vestments and jewels to fit the image. The image was granted a Canonical coronation on 12 October 1955 at the orders of Pope Pius XII through the Papal legate, Cardinal Enrique Pla y Deniel. Many copies of this image was sent out into the territories in the Kingdom of Spain, one being the famous Cuban version. The image celebrated its 50th anniversary of papal recognition with a Pontifical High Mass in October 2005. =France= For centuries, Notre-Dame- de-La-Charit√© was the second biggest church in Europe. La Charit√©-sur-Loire was the home of the Abbaye de la Charit√©, a very large and famous Cistercian monastery. When the priory church, Notre-Dame-de-La-Charit√©, was built in the 11th century, it was the second largest building in Europe, only surpassed by the church at Cluny Abbey. The nave was shortened after the fire of 1559 destroyed its roof. The church has been on the list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites since 1998. It currently serves as a parish church dedicated to Notre Dame de la Nativit√©. John Eudes founded the Order of Our Lady of Charity of the Refuge to give reformed prostitutes a place to go. The order survives today with many other charitable activities. Offshoot orders include both apostolic and contemplative Sisters of Our Lady of Charity of the Good Shepherd, which have now been joined back together as one order. There was a pilgrimage chapel of Our Lady of Charity near St.-Laurent-sur-La-Plaine which was destroyed by order of the French revolutionary government in 1791. Shortly afterward, the Virgin Mary was reported to be seen on the ruined altar and in a nearby oak tree.France and the Cult of the Sacred Heart by Raymond Jonas This set off more pilgrimages and became part of the unrest leading up to the War in the Vendee. =Philippines= Our Lady of Charity, Patroness of Cartagena, Spain.

Minor Basilica of Agoo, Philippines, granted a canonical coronation by Pope Paul VI through the Papal nuncio Carmine Rocco on 1 May 1971. In the Philippines, Our Lady of Charity is known by its Spanish predecessor, the original Our Lady of Lacara (circa 1494), later known as Apo Caridad in Ilocano language. The Marian title is not associated with the Cuban image, but rather the older Marian image venerated in Toledo, Spain. * The image of Our Lady of Charity, Apo Caridad de Bantay is enshrined at the Bantay Church in Bantay, Ilocos Sur in Northern Luzon and was officially crowned by Pope Pius XII on 12 January 1956. * The image of Our Lady of Charity is also within the Minor Basilica of Our Lady of Charity in Agoo, La Union is the Apo Caridad ng Agoo. The image was granted a canonical coronation on 1 May 1971 under the Papal nuncio Carmine Rocco at the mandate of Pope Paul VI. =United States= Our Lady of Charity, Patroness of Villarrobledo, Spain. Circa 1777. On 8 September 1961, the Archdiocese of Miami celebrated the feast of Our Lady of Charity with 30,000 Cuban exiles at Miami Stadium where a 16-inch replica of the statue of Our Lady of Charity was smuggled out of Cuba. Due to the overwhelming Cuban devotion to this Marian title in 1966, the Archdiocese of Miami announced the construction of the Shrine of Our Lady of Charity. Construction was begun on the shrine, known as La Ermita de la Caridad, the following year on the shores of Biscayne Bay in the Coconut Grove section of Miami. The shrine was completed in 1973, built with donations by new Cuban exiles.

Therefore, to manufacture these devices it is necessary to manage many processes while accurately controlling the level of impurities and particles. The finished product quality depends upon the many layered relationship of each interacting substance in the semiconductor, including metallization, chip material (list of semiconductor materials) and package. # The problems of micro-processes, and thin films and must be fully understood as they apply to metallization and wire bonding. It is also necessary to analyze surface phenomena from the aspect of thin films. # Due to the rapid advances in technology, many new devices are developed using new materials and processes, and design calendar time is limited due to non-recurring engineering constraints, plus time to market concerns. Consequently, it is not possible to base new designs on the reliability of existing devices. # To achieve economy of scale, semiconductor products are manufactured in high volume. Furthermore, repair of finished semiconductor products is impractical. Therefore, incorporation of reliability at the design stage and reduction of variation in the production stage have become essential. # Reliability of semiconductor devices may depend on assembly, use, and environmental conditions. Stress factors affecting device reliability include gas, dust, contamination, voltage, current density, temperature, humidity, mechanical stress, vibration, shock, radiation, pressure, and intensity of magnetic and electrical fields. Design factors affecting semiconductor reliability include: voltage, power, and current derating; metastability; logic timing margins (logic simulation); timing analysis; temperature derating; and process control.  Methods of improvement  Reliability of semiconductors is kept high through several methods. Cleanrooms control impurities, process control controls processing, and burn-in (short term operation at extremes) and probe and test reduce escapes. Probe (wafer prober) tests the semiconductor die, prior to packaging, via micro-probes connected to test equipment. Final test tests the packaged device, often pre-, and post burn-in for a set of parameters that assure operation. Process and design weaknesses are identified by applying a set of stress tests in the qualification phase of the semiconductors before their market introduction e. g. according to the AEC Q100 and Q101 stress qualifications.AEC Documents Parts Average Testing is a statistical method for recognizing and quarantining semiconductor die that have a higher probability of reliability failures. This technique identifies characteristics that are within specification but outside of a normal distribution for that population as at-risk outliers not suitable for high reliability applications. Tester- based Parts Average Testing varieties include Parametric Parts Average Testing (P-PAT) and Geographical Parts Average Testing (G-PAT), among others. Inline Parts Average Testing (I-PAT) uses data from production process control inspection and metrology to perform the outlier recognition function. Bond strength measurement is performed in two basic types: pull testing and shear testing. Both can be done destructively, which is more common, or non destructively. Non destructive tests are normally used when extreme reliability is required such as in military or aerospace applications.  Failure mechanisms  Failure mechanisms of electronic semiconductor devices fall in the following categories # Material-interaction-induced mechanisms. # Stress-induced mechanisms. # Mechanically induced failure mechanisms. # Environmentally induced failure mechanisms. = Material-interaction-induced mechanisms = # Field-effect transistor gate-metal sinking # Ohmic contact degradation # Channel degradation # Surface-state effects # Package molding contamination‚Äîimpurities in packaging compounds cause electrical failure = Stress-induced failure mechanisms = # Electromigration - electrically induced movement of the materials in the chip # Burnout - localized overstress # Hot Electron Trapping - due to overdrive in power RF circuits # Electrical Stress - Electrostatic discharge, High Electro-Magnetic Fields (HIRF), Latch- up overvoltage, overcurrent = Mechanically induced failure mechanisms = # Die fracture - due to mis-match of thermal expansion coefficients # Die-attach voids - manufacturing defect‚Äîscreenable with Scanning Acoustic Microscopy. # Solder joint failure by creep fatigue or intermetallics cracks. # Die- pad/molding compound delamination due to thermal cycling = Environmentally induced failure mechanisms = # Humidity effects - moisture absorption by the package and circuit # Hydrogen effects - Hydrogen induced breakdown of portions of the circuit (Metal) # Other Temperature Effects‚ÄîAccelerated Aging, Increased Electro-migration with temperature, Increased Burn-Out See also * Transistor aging * Failure analysis * Cleanroom * Burn-in * List of materials-testing resources * List of materials analysis methods  References  * http://documentation.renesas.com/eng/products/others/rej27l0001_reliabilityhb.pdf * http://parts.jpl.nasa.gov/mmic/4.PDF * http://www.enre.umd.edu/publications/rs&h.htm;  Bibliography   MIL- HDBK-217F Reliability Prediction of Electronic Equipment * MIL-HDBK-251 Reliability/Design Thermal Applications * MIL-HDBK-H 108 Sampling Procedures and Tables for Life and Reliability Testing (Based on Exponential Distribution) * MIL-HDBK-338 Electronic Reliability Design Handbook * MIL- HDBK-344 Environmental Stress Screening of Electronic Equipment * MIL-STD-690C Failure Rate Sampling Plans and Procedures * MIL-STD-721C Definition of Terms for Reliability and Maintainability * MIL-STD-756B Reliability Modeling and Prediction * MIL-HDBK-781 Reliability Test Methods, Plans and Environments for Engineering Development, Qualification and Production * MIL-STD-1543B Reliability Program Requirements for Space and Missile Systems * MIL-STD-1629A Procedures for Performing a Failure Mode, Effects, and Criticality Analysis * MIL-STD-1686B Electrostatic Discharge Control Program for Protection of Electrical and Electronic Parts, Assemblies and Equipment (Excluding Electrically Initiated Explosive Devices) * MIL-STD-2074 Failure Classification for Reliability Testing * MIL-STD-2164 Environment Stress Screening Process for Electronic Equipment Semiconductor device fabrication ","title":"Reliability (semiconductor)"},{"id":"20575543","text":"The Alexander Hills are a mountain range in the Mojave Desert near Death Valley, in northern San Bernardino County, California.

The plane involved in the crash was a Tupolev Tu-154 operated by Russian airline Baikal Airlines. The plane was carrying 115 passengers and 9 crew members and was en route to Moscow when one of the engines suddenly burst into flames. The crew then tried to return to Irkutsk, but lost control of the plane and crashed into a dairy farm near the town of Mamony. All 124 people on board and one person on the ground were killed in the crash. Accident Flight 130 took off from Irkutsk International Airport at 11:59 local time. The Tupolev Tu-154 was operated by a crew of nine, including Captain Gennadiy S. Padukov (with over 16,000 hours' flight time), co-pilot A. G. Zhavoronkov (over 14,000 hours), navigator V. I. Molnar, flight engineer Ilya Petrovich Karpov (over 13,000 hours), purser O. V. Likhodyevsky, and four flight attendants. The flight experienced trouble before it even took off. It took the crew nearly 17 minutes to start the engines, and they received multiple warnings that there were problems with the starter on the No. 2 engine, but ignored them as false alarms. The cockpit reference manual contained no guidance for the crew on how to respond to the engine starter warnings. The crew proceeded to take off without realizing that the No. 2 engine starter was still engaged. Around 3 minutes and 45 seconds after taking off from Irkutsk, at an altitude of 4,000 ft, the No. 2 engine suddenly failed. The starter had continued to operate at high revolutions (over 40,000 rpm) with open air bleed valves from the engines, resulting in a critical failure of the starter. The turbine's fan disk flew apart, sending shrapnel into the No. 2 engine and compartment area. This ultimately led to the destruction of the left engine's fuel lines and hydraulic lines. The fuel supply for the fuel injectors stopped, which led to the ignition of fuel in the No. 2 engine. Thus, a fire broke out that became uncontrollable.James, Barry. \\"Don't Fly in Ex-Soviet Union, Passenger Group Warns.\\" International Herald Tribune. Thursday 14 April 1994.Seward, Deborah. \\"120 Killed In Russian Air Crash; Safety Concerns Rise in Ex-U.S.S.R..\\" The Washington Post. 4 January 1994. A10. After receiving a fire alarm in engine No. 2, the crew disconnected the autopilot and applied all the fire-extinguishing system lines. This failed to stop the fire, and the pilot turned towards Irkutsk and requested an emergency landing. The plane's flight controls failed because of the lack of hydraulic fluid, and although the crew attempted to keep pressure in the hydraulic lines, they were not able to prevent a catastrophe. At 12:07 local time, co-pilot Zhavoronkov reported a complete loss of control. A minute later Flight 130, at a speed of 510 km/h, crashed into a dairy farm in the village of Mamony, 15 kilometers from Irkutsk airport. The cockpit and the first passenger cabin were destroyed, and the second passenger cabin and tail were propelled 400 meters beyond the initial point of impact. All 115 passengers and 9 crew members on board were killed. The dairy farm was destroyed. At the time of the disaster there were 2 people in the building‚Äîone was killed, another injured, and several dozen cattle were killed. A total of 125 people died. From 125 people who were killed in the disaster, only 74 were identified. Investigation The Russian investigation revealed that during Flight 130's take off, the Tupolev Tu-154's No. 2 engine failed. Investigators noted that the plane had been involved in a similar incident during a flight to Guangzhou, China, in which the No. 2 engine failed. Due to the incident, the crew had to conduct an emergency landing. They later wrote a post-flight complaint, in which they noted the \\"unsatisfactory work\\" of the engine. During the day of the disaster, the crew could only turn on the engine after their fifth attempt, as the last four attempts had failed to light the engine. The CVR recorded the conversation between the captain and the crew in the cockpit, discussing the faulty engine. Two minutes before take-off, one of the crew stated: > \\"Tell the engineer who prepared the engines that the engines are very poorly > prepared. They won't start.\\" Four kilometers from the airport, the No. 2 engine starter \\"collapsed\\". According to investigators, the destruction was caused due to foreign objects. A foreign object, presumably a fragment of the casing of the APU gas collector which was located under the control flap of the starter, entered the engine and sliced the fuel lines, hydraulic lines, and oil lines. The tightly closed damper of the turbine of the starter continued to untwist during its take-off, which caused the detachment. Added by the operation of the engine, which was operating over its permitted maximum rpm, this caused the destruction of the engine which led to the subsequent fire and loss of control.

Description Pseudanthias bartlettorum has a somewhat elongated, moderately compressed body which is around 3 times as long (in standard length as it is deep. The males have a thickened upper lip which is a little pointed and can be moved up and down. It has a moderately large, obliquely angled mouth in which the maxilla extends to the rear edge of the eye. On females the mouth is terminal but the thickening of the upper lip causes the mouth to slightly point downwards. The lateral line is curved and follows the curve of the dorsal profile. The dorsal fin has 10 spines and 17-18 soft rays while the anal fin has 3 spines and 7 soft rays. The upper two fifths of the head and body are bright yellow and the remainder of the body is lavender, fading on the fish's underside. The portion of the head behind the eye is lavender becoming whitish ventrally. There is a dark orange band on the head which runs from the snout to the lower part of the eye before fading behind the eye. The iris is dark orange.

Description Pseudanthias parvirostris has a somewhat elongated, moderately compressed body which is around 3 times as long (in standard length as it is deep. The males have a thickened upper lip which is a little pointed and can be moved up and down, although this is less marked in this species than in related Pseudanthias. It has a moderately large, obliquely angled mouth in which the maxilla extends to the level of or beyond the rear edge of the eye. The lateral line is curved and follows the curve of the dorsal profile. The dorsal fin has 10 spines and 15-16 soft rays amd the anal fin has 3 spines and 7 soft rays. The upper third of the body is yellowish in colour in males while the rest of the body is pinkish and there is a magenta stripe which runs between their eyes and from the upper margin of the eyes to the origin of the dorsal fin. The dorsal fin and lobes of the caudal fin are magenta. The females are overall yellow, sometimes a darker yellowish-orange, with a similar magenta stripe between the eyes as the male. It grows to a maximum standard length of . Distribution Pseudanthias parvirostris is found in the Indian Ocean and the Western Pacific Ocean. Its range extends from Japan south as far as Australia, west to the Madives and east to the Solomon Islands. In Australia it is found in the Coral Sea and at Rowley Shoals in Western Australia. Habitat and biology Pseudanthias parvirostris is found on outer reef slopes at depths between , most commonly at depths of more than . They are usually found in small aggregations close to the bottom, where there are patch reefs on slopes dominated by sand or rubble. The social grouping is that there is a dominant male which guards a harem made up of a small group of females. They are nonadric protogynous hermaphrodites and when the dominant male is lost themost dominant female changes sex and colour to that of the male. which takes around two weeks, and takes over the harem/ Where they are sympatric P. parvirostris may mix with groups of Pseudanthias smithvanizi. Taxonomy Pseudanthias parvirostris was first formally described as Anthias parvirostris by John E. Randall and Roger Lubbock in 1981 with the type locality given as the outer reef slope on the western side of Alite Reef, off Malaita in the Solomon Islands. The specific name parvirostris refers to the relatively small snout developed by the males of this species. Some authorities classify this species within the subgenus Mirolabrichthys, and also that it is intermediate between that subgenus and the subgenus Pseudanthias. Utilisation Pseudanthias parvirostris is rare in the aquarium trade, although they are among the easier Pseudanthias species to keep, although as they are relatively deep water fish they require dimly lit aquaria.

It is endemism to the Red Sea. It occasionally makes its way into the aquarium trade. It grows to a size of 13 cm (5 inches) in length. Description Pseudanthias heemstrai has the typical elongate body shape of the anthias, the body being just under three times as long as it is deep. It has a large mouth in which the maxilla extends past the level of the centre of the eye and the lower jaw projects slightly beyond the upper jaw. The dorsal fin 15-17 rays while the anal fin has 7 rays and is enlarged and pointed in both sexes, reaching to beyond the caudal fin base. The caudal fin has a slightly truncate or emarginate margin in females and in males this is convex or truncate with some males having the lower rays exposed beyind the membrane. The males also have vety elongated pelvic fins which have their first two rays enlarged and may extend beyond the base of the anal fin. The bodies of males are largely reddish above with each scale having a yellow spot and a red edge. The sides of the head are dull orange becoming reddish pink towards the top of the head and the gill cover is golden. The lower parts of head and the body are pale pink, with a scarlet streak on the middle of the throat. They have pale bluish grey anal and pelvic fins which have irregular yellow spotting. The caudal fin is dark red with a yellow or lit blue-grey rear margin. When breeding the pinkish red scale margins on the flanks of the males intensify tog scarlet and the yellow spot in the scale centres of the scales becomes darker, they also develop an irregular, diffuse, mid-lateral white band which starts to the rear of the gill cover and gradually becomes broader as it reaches the tail, this band is widest above the anal fin where it covers the upper half of the base of the caudla fin and the caudal peduncle creating an obvious white oval spot on the upper part of the caudal peduncle. This white band has also observed on territorial males. There is a pale orange band running from end of the upper mandible to the origin of the dorsal fin and this intensifies dark orange red in breeding males. When looked at from above this band joins the folded dorsal fin to make an extended red band along the back. The rear margin of the caudal fin changes colour from whitish or yellow to bright red. In the females the body is yellow towards the back with lavender scales each with a yellow spot in the centre. The lower half of the body is pale purple to white, with a red streak on the centre of the throat. The pectoral and pelvic fins pinkish-blue while the rest of the fins are yellow. The maximum total length attained is . Distribution Pseudanthias heemstrai is endemic to the Red Sea where it has been recorded in the Gulf of Aqaba, north of Dahab and off the Red Sea coast of Yemen. Habitat and biology The natural environment is fore-reef slopes where they form small loose aggregations. Usually they distribute at depths between 50 and about 200 feet (15 ‚Äì 60 m) where it feeds on zooplankton. Aquaculture They can be maintained in aquaria with some rocky caves and strong water movement that has a large unencumbered area for schooling, which will occur in the upper third of this area. Tank mates of Pseudanthias heemstrai should be peaceful and all should be last to enter the aquarium. As the diet they can eat most regular aquarium foods, like finely chopped various frozen or fresh meaty foods such as mysis, fish flesh, shrimp, squid, clam, etc. The diet should be offered at least twice a day and release into the upstream, so water currents carry food to their location. When they difficult to get feeding, fortified live adult brine shrimp may be necessary for their diet until they accept other types of aquarium foods like fresh marine fish and invertebrate flesh.

Corman Railroad Group, a Nicholasville, Kentucky-based railroad services and short line operating company. Early life Corman was born and died in Nicholasville, Kentucky. The son of a state highway worker, he grew up in a home not far from his company's future headquarters in Nicholasville. He first went into business at age 11, when his paternal grandfather made him a 25% partner in a business hauling cattle, goods, and junk. According to a 2011 profile in Fortune, \\"high school utterly bored him\\"; he missed 105 of 173 possible school days during his senior year but still graduated in 1973. Business career In 1973, immediately after graduating from high school, he started performing railroad construction jobs for L&N; Railroad with a single backhoe and dump truck. He quickly developed a reputation for his fast and thorough work. Within a few years, another opportunity came when friends in the rail industry asked his company to step in and take over derailment work after a Columbus, Ohio, company that had done this work left the city. Throughout the next few years, Rick established a railroad construction company and then a derailment company under the banner of R. J. Corman. When larger railroads began contracting out their derailment and construction work in order to cut costs, Rick was able to provide them with the high-quality service that they were looking for. Though the early years of the business were financially difficult, Corman worked diligently to gain support for his companies. After Congress passed the Staggers Rail Act in 1980, Rick started a railroad company after he purchased the Bardstown Line. A year later, he began operating My Old Kentucky Dinner Train on that line using a car that had been part of the funeral procession for Dwight Eisenhower in 1969. Corman's company acquired more short lines over time, and was operating over 600 miles of track when Corman died in 2013. Rick went on to establish six more companies and acquire eight more short lines and before his passing in 2013. Although Corman technically retired in 1997, he remained intimately involved in his company's day-to-day affairs for the rest of his life. He spent his final years planning for the company's future after his death. While he received many purchase offers, he refused them all out of loyalty to his employees. His company continues to provide a variety of services for the railroads. In 2011, BNSF Railway CEO Matt Rose said about Corman, \\"He's kind of like an oilfield firefighter. He's the Red Adair of the railroad industry.\\" Personal life Corman was married three times in all, and had five children. His two oldest, a daughter and a son, bear his name, but were born to a woman he never married. The three youngest, a son and two daughters, are from his third marriage. He spent the last 11 years of his life in a relationship with Tammie Taylor, an executive in his company. He was also a significant University of Kentucky sports booster. In his final years, Corman became a close friend of UK men's basketball head coach John Calipari, who came to call him \\"a brother\\". Corman first met Calipari in 2009, when he sent one of his private jets to take Calipari and his wife from Memphis to Calipari's introductory press conference in Lexington. Shortly after Corman's death, Calipari recalled that they spent almost the entire flight \\"talking about anything other than basketball\\" once Corman made it clear he knew virtually nothing about the sport. Corman occasionally attended UK practices; Calipari noted that Corman was the only person he ever allowed into a UK practice wearing a red shirt, the color of UK's archrival, the University of Louisville. Corman's support was not limited to the men's basketball team; he also used a personal jet to deliver Mark Stoops to Lexington for his 2012 introduction as UK's new football head coach. As a tribute to Corman, Calipari announced that he would wear red for at least one home game in the 2013‚Äì14 season. Illness and death Corman was diagnosed with multiple myeloma in 2001, after feeling excruciating back pain while running in Amsterdam. He entrusted much of his care to Kathleen Martin, a Lexington gastroenterologist whom he had previously dated, and the two then set on a journey that eventually led to the Dana‚ÄìFarber Cancer Institute in Boston. When they arrived at Dana‚ÄìFarber, the institute's lead myeloma researcher told him, \\"If you come here, we will do everything possible to see that you grow old gracefully and die of something other than multiple myeloma.\\" For the rest of his life, Corman contributed heavily to Dana‚ÄìFarber, and also set up a trust to run his company following his death that reportedly had the institute as a beneficiary. He had two bone marrow transplants as part of his treatment, the first in 2001 and the second in 2008. The cancer returned again in 2011; after a final turn for the worse in 2013, Corman died on August 23 at his home in Nicholasville.

The AFPA has sole autonomous political and industrial coverage for all employees within the Australian Federal Police which includes sworn Federal Agents; Police Officers; Protective Service Officers; and non- sworn support staff deployed nationally and overseas. The Australian Federal Police Association also provides industrial coverage for the Australian Crime Commission and the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity. History Between 1942 and 1982 the industrial interests of the Commonwealth law enforcement were represented by the Defence Establishments Guard Association (1942‚Äì1943), the Peace Officer Guard Association (1943‚Äì1958), and the Commonwealth Police Officers' Association (1958‚Äì1982). The ACT Police Officers' Association (1933‚Äì1979) and subsequently the Federal Police Association (1979‚Äì1982) represented the industrial interests of the ACT police until 1982. In July 1982 the Australian Federal Police Association (AFPA) was established following a merger between the Commonwealth Police Officers' Association [CPOA] and the Federal Police Association [FPA]. The impetus for the AFPA was the proclamation of the Australian Federal Police Act on 15 June 1979 that established the Australian Federal Police [AFP]. The AFP was a merger of the Commonwealth police, Narcotics Bureau and the ACT police. In 1998 the AFPA changed its rules to establish the Police Federation of Australia, which now incorporates Branches for all State, Territory and Federal Police and is affiliated with the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU). The PFA is the peak lobbying body on behalf of all Australian Police Associations/unions. The PFA provides additional research & lobbying capacity for the AFPA on an ongoing basis. The AFPA is affiliated with Australia's national police charity, the AUSPOL - Police Welfare Foundation. Member services The AFPA National office provides its members with a full range of services including: *Industrial support; *Legal support including full funding for federal and criminal court matters (subject to legal advice) *Non- exclusion based life assurance cover *Trauma Cover *Group Journey Injury Cover *Welfare support; *AUSPOL health plan; *Discount services; The AFPA also lobbies government on a variety of law enforcement issues. Federal policing issues =The Haneef Inquiry= The AFPA made substantial contributions to the debate surrounding the detainment of Dr Mohamed Haneef . AFPA CEO Jim Torr (Resigned October 2012) stated that the AFPA's members were tired of the negative public comments about the AFP Commissioner and the Australian Federal Police that were pre-emptive of the Clarke Inquiry Report. In their submission to the Clarke Inquiry the AFPA recommended that the Australian Federal Police be placed under the scrutiny of a Parliamentary Joint (statutory) Committee. The Australian Government responded to the Clarke Inquiry Report by accepting the recommendations of the AFPA, undertaking to create a Parliamentary Joint Committee on Law Enforcement to extend parliamentary oversight to include the Australian Federal Police and enabling the Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security to extend inquiries to include the Australian Federal Police. =The Federal Audit of Policing Capabilities= In May 2009, the AFPA made its major report titled 'Enforcing Against Risk' to the Federal Audit of Policing Capabilities which was commissioned by the Minister for Home Affairs, the Hon. Bob Debus MP in January 2009 to report by the end of June 2009.

Its range extends from Indonesia in the east, Samoa in the west, north to the Ryukyu Islands, and south to Rowley Shoals and New Caledonia, as well as throughout Micronesia. As with many reef fish, it is a sequential hermaphrodite, beginning life as a female, and transitioning to male in response to environmental and social factors. The males and females normally occur sexually separate aggragations in the vicinity of drop-offs where there are strong currents, while the solitary juveniles stay close to shelter. Mixed sex aggregations are known.

From 29 December 1930 ‚Äì 23 March 1933 he served as Administrator of Affairs of the Council of People's Commissars, and was the second person to fill that post.

He gained experience of mass theatre in Europe and anglophone countries during a period of exile. He was influenced by Percy MacKaye, Richard Wagner and Alexandr Bogdanov.Bolshevik Festivals, 1917‚Äì1920, accessed 7 December 2008 He was in New York City in 1916, living in the same boarding house as Padraic Colum.https://www.opendemocracy.net/uk/brendan-mcgeever/easter-rising-and- soviet-union-untold-chapter-in-ireland-s-great-rebellion Returning to Russia in 1917, he was a leading figure in the Proletkult movement, and head of ROSTA, forerunner of the TASS news agency. He had articles published in Vestnik Teatra, the Journal of the Theatre Department of Narkompros based in Moscow. In 1921, when Proletkult was taken under party control, on Lenin's instructions, and its founder, Alexander Bogdanov was ousted, Kerzhentsev was appointed Ambassador in Sweden. He returned in 1923, and criticised Bogdanov in Pravda where he focused on The Organizational Principles of a Uniform Economic Plan a text submitted to the First Conference on Scientific Organization of Labour (January 1921). In 1923-25, he ran an institute that studied labour organisation. He opposed piece work and other incentives which he believed would create a 'working class aristocracy. He was Soviet ambassador in Italy in 1925-26, and deputy head of the Central Statistical Administration, 1926-28. In 1928. Kerzhentsev was appointed deputy head of Agitprop and head of the culture and science department of the CPSU Central Committee, and for the next ten years was a major figure in the administration and censorship of the arts. A champion of proletarian art, he took a particular dislike to the prominent Russian playwright, Mikhail Bulgakov. In January 1929, he played a pivotal part in getting Bulgakov's fourth play, Flight, banned. He then wrote an article that appeared in Pravda on 7 February 1929, alleging that the Ukrainian people were being insulted by a play performed at the Moscow Arts Theatre, his obvious target being Bulgakov's first and best known play, The Day of the Turbins known to western audiences as The White Guard, set in Kiev, and attacked the People's Commissar for Enlightenment, Anatoli Lunacharsky for allowing it to be staged. The play was suppressed in March 1929, but later revived, because Stalin liked it. Kerzhentsev was President of the All Union Radio Committee. In January 1936, he was appointed Chairman of the State Committee on the Arts, which meant that he was responsible for music, as well as other art forms, during the campaign initiated by Stalin against Dmitri Shostakovich, who turned to Kerzhentsev for advice, and was told to write less complex music that the masses could understand. He resumed his campaign against Bulgakov, whose latest play, Moliere, the first two performances of which, in February 1935, had sold out. Kerzhentsev wrote to Stalin, alleging that the play was an allegory which drew a parallel between Moli√®re's humiliating treatment by Louis XIV and the treatment of Soviet artists - which very likely was Bulgakov's intention. The play was immediately banned. Kerzhentsev was dismissed in 1938, but survived the great purge without being arrested. He died of heart failure. .

It comes from the Western Central Pacific Ocean. It occasionally makes its way into the aquarium trade. It grows to a size of 12 cm in length. Description Pseudanthis huchti is a very distinctively colour member of the genus Pseudanthias, as well as having the third dorsal fin spine and elongated caudal fin lobes. The males possess an obvious orange stripe which runs from their eye to the centre of their pectoral fin and a broad maroon band on the forward margin of the pelvic fin. The females and juveniles are greenish-yellow in colour. There are 10 s[pines in the dorsal fin and 17 soft rays while the anal fin contains 3 spines and 7 soft rays. The maximum recorded total length for a male is and for a female it is half that. Distribution Pseudanthias huchtii is found in the Western Pacific Ocean from the Maluku Islands and the Philippines east to Vanuatu, south as far the Great Barrier Reef in the Tasman Sea, as well as the Scott Reef and the Ashmore Reefs in the Timor Sea their distribution extends as far east as Palau in Micronesia. Habitat and ecology Pseudanthias huchtii is found in aggregations at drop offs around the outer crests of coral reefs. Like all species of Pseudanthias they are nonandric protogynous hermaphrodites in which all the fish are born female and the largest and most dominant females will change sex to become males. The males are territorial and guard a harem of females. They will interact with Pseudanthias squamipinnis. Taxonomy Pseudanthias huchti was first formally described in 1857 as Anthias huchti by the Dutch ichthyologist and herpetologist Pieter Bleeker (1819‚Äì1874) with the type locality given as Ambon Island. Bleeker named this species in honour of Mr. G.J.L. van den Hucht of Batavia, who owned a fine collection of Moluccan fishes, and who gave specimens to Bleeker.

During the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War (1846‚Äì1848), many Irish immigrants in the United States abandoned their posts and joined Mexican forces because of what they felt was discrimination and persecution of their Catholic faith by non-Catholic Americans.

On 10 January 1974, both nations established diplomatic relations. At first, Mexico was accredited to Ireland from its embassy in London and Ireland was accredited to Mexico from its embassy in Washington, DC. In 1990, both nations agreed to open resident diplomatic missions and in June 1991, Mexico opened its embassy on Raglan Road, Dublin and Ireland followed suit by opening its embassy in Mexico City in September 1999.

Baker's widow died in 1932, leaving Nugent in full control. Unlike Baker, Nugent cared more about winning than saving money. However, even with his income from his other businesses, he did not have the financial means to get the Phillies out of the National League basement. He was forced to trade what little talent the team had to make ends meet and had to use some creative financial methods to be able even to field a team at all. The one highlight of his ownership was a 78‚Äì76 record in 1932, the only time that the Phillies finished with a winning record between 1918 and 1948. One notable step Nugent took, in mid-season 1938, was to abandon Baker Bowl, the club's 52 year old home which had become severely run down. The Phillies moved five blocks west to become tenants at Shibe Park, home of the Athletics. Nugent finally reached the end of his rope in 1942. A year after posting a 43‚Äì111 record, the worst in franchise history, the Phillies needed an advance from the league just to be able to take part in spring training. Realizing that there was no way he could operate the team in 1943, he reached an agreement in principle that February to sell the team to Bill Veeck, who planned to bring in Negro League stars in an effort to turn the moribund franchise around. However, when Baseball Commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis, an intractable opponent of integration, got wind of it, he pressured National League President Ford Frick to quash the deal and take over the team. A week later, the league sold the Phillies to lumber broker William D. Cox. This story was initially refuted by a 1998 article in the Society for American Baseball Research's The National Pastime, which argued that Philadelphia's black press made no mention of a sale to Veeck. However, new evidence has surfaced that suggested Nugent did indeed plan to sell the Phillies to Veeck.

History  Dueholm Priory was founded in 1370 by Bishop Sven of B√∏rglum, the diocese of northernmost Jutland at the time. It lay just outside the town of Nyk√∏bing. The priory was dedicated to St John the Baptist and Mary Magdalene. The property on which it was later built had been given to the diocese by Lady Mette Pedersdatter before 1370. In 1380 the Hospitallers were given the rights to St Clement's Church in Nyk√∏bing. At its height in the early 16th century the priory consisted of twelve brother priests led by a prior, who was often a secular nobleman who served as advocate in worldly matters. The hospital was operated by brothers of the order who were not monks, but living a religious life in conjunction with their service at the hospital. One detail that becomes evident from Dueholm's archive letters is that the population of the priory was quite transitory. Noble families often placed younger sons at Dueholm for a time. Upon their majority they either left the monastery to marry or go to war, join the lay brothers in the hospital, or apply to become knight-monks and enter the priesthood. Dueholm had a school that stood between the mill and the town that was the second school, the first had been built during the reign of Christian II. Dueholm also oversaw St J√∏rgen's Leper House outside Nyk√∏bing, though it was a separate institution with its own staff of lay brothers who specialized in the treatment of the lepers. The knight-priests of St John took turns saying mass each day there. Dueholm Priory had a long struggle with the town over Holy Ghost Hospital, which was established by the citizens of the town for the care of the poor and sick, and manned by lay brothers of the Order of the Holy Ghost who lived a religious life of service at the hospital. The argument with the Hospitallers came when in 1445 Christopher of Bavaria, King of Denmark, recognized the town's rights to the hospital property which they had built. The priory had obtained a papal bull which granted them permission to finish Holy Ghost Chapel at Holy Ghost Hospital in St Clements parish. The arguments came down to control of income for the hospital and who actually had rights to it. Bishop Gert stood solidly in Dueholm's corner forbidding laymen or helpers from receiving benefit of donations to the hospital. The dispute grew so hot that Christian I stepped in to order that the parish priest at St Clemens was not to be prohibited from saying mass in the hospital chapel, thereby giving St Hans Priory, who chose the priest for the parish church, spiritual control over the hospital. St Hans Priory triumphantly took over Holy Ghost Hospital from the town. In time the priory came to own many properties in the town and in the surrounding area. Unlike many contemporary monastic houses, parts of Dueholm's archives have been preserved in two 'letter books'. The older collection was copied before 1527 with letters covering the period from 1371 to 1539. The copies were made of letters in deteriorating condition for future reference. The 1370 foundation grant from Bishop Sven is included, one of few such documents. Often the founding grants documents were confiscated when monasteries were closed in the 1520s and 1530s. The 'younger' letter book was copied in 1527. It contains among other letters, the list of arrivals to the priory and the places from which they came. A 1591 inventory of the archive lists a host of documents still in existence after the closure of the priory. There is also an inventory of Tinity Chapel's Archive. The two books fell into the possession of 'the honorable and well-born lady Elle Krastrup, the widow of Thygge Sandberg of Kvelstrup and were preserved by her and then after 1587 passed on to the local magistrate. The letter books were recopied in the 18th century and passed on to government officials for their value in determining land ownership. Unfortunately, the entire archive from Dueholm was moved to Dueholm Castle where it went up in flames in the sack of the castle in 1627. The two surviving Dueholm letters provide glimpses into the everyday life of medieval monks and the surrounding community. In 1527 St J√∏rgens House was closed and torn down including its chapel. Its mill became known afterwards as St Hans Mill for the 'Johanitter', the nickname for the Hospitallers. In 1528 the old argument about Holy Ghost Hospital surfaced again when the town wrote to Frederick I, a reform-minded monarch about the pope's unlawful gift of the hospital to the priory accusing the order of not helping the poor and sick at the hospital as they should. The Reformation in Denmark brought an end to all religious houses, though changes in belief and practice came later to the north of Jutland. But in 1536 Dueholm Priory and its income properties reverted to the crown. Since the main work of the brothers was to run the town hospitals, citizens had an interest in the continuance of medical services. The priory was simply secularized and the work of the hospitals continued. At the death of the last secular prior, Jakob Jensen in 1556, the priory was disbanded though the work of the hospitals continued. When Thisted county was organized, the priory buildings were converted into a manor house for the local magistrate. Over time the manor estate was broken into smaller holdings. By 1901 only the west range of the former priory was preserved with some of its Gothic arched windows intact. Dueholm's Priory's west range was restored and today houses the Morslande Historiske Museum. There are several other remnants of walls and foundations which have been incorporated into other buildings.

Samuel Spring (1746‚Äì1819) was an early American Revolutionary War chaplain and Congregationalist minister.A portrait of Rev. Spring, Old South Church, Newburyport Early life and education Spring was born in Uxbridge in the Massachusetts Colony on February 27, 1746. His father was John Spring (1706‚Äì1794), a militia man and local wealthy farmer, and his mother was Sarah Read (1716‚Äì1800). He was a great-great grandson of John Spring, a Founder and early settler of Watertown, Massachusetts, who travelled to America under the patronage of his cousin Sir William Spring, 1st Baronet, and was the great- grandson of John Spring of Lavenham and the great-great grandson of Thomas Spring of Lavenham. John later commanded the company of militia from Uxbridge in the American Revolution. His father was the town's moderator, selectman, and surveyor of highways, but John lacked even a rudimentary education. Sarah remained determined that Samuel would have the best education possible. Spring studied under the Rev. Nathan Webb, founding pastor of the first Congregational church begun in the First Great Awakening period of the Massachusetts Colony. Webb's early training of Spring helped prepare him to enter New Jersey College (now Princeton University), where he graduated in 1771. He took advanced theological studies from Samuel Hopkins of Newport, Rhode Island. His former mentor, Rev. Webb died in 1772. Spring was licensed as a minister in 1774 on the eve of the American Revolution. Aaron Burr was one of his classmates in Theological Studies at Princeton, who went on to study law. Revolutionary War service When the Revolution's stirrings began, the Provincial Congress required the militia to have chaplains. Spring took up his colony's call. He served in both the Siege of Boston and in the invasion of Canada. He initially served in the regiment commanded by Colonel John Fellows of Sheffield. Burr also served at the Siege of Boston. When Colonel Benedict Arnold convinced General George Washington to open a second front against the British in Canada, Spring and Burr both joined this force under Colonel Benedict Arnold. Ships sailed from Newburyport, Massachusetts to Maine. At Fort Western, near what is now Augusta, Maine, Spring counseled Private James McCormick, who was sentenced to death, only to be reprieved. The trip through Maine left a tattered, very ill army to invade Quebec. French Canadians helped the Americans with supplies and clothing. At Quebec Senter took possession of the hotel Dieu on the banks of the St. Charles River. Spring converted the hotel to a hospital and chapel. Benedict Arnold's leg was shattered in the siege of Quebec, during the ill-fated New Year's Eve assault on the fortress city walls. Spring carried Benedict Arnold from the battlefield to the Hotel Dieu (the hospital). American troops occupied Montreal and Trois-Rivi√®res and maintained the Siege on Quebec. Colonel John Patterson's regiment was dispatched to Quebec to shore up American positions. The American troops retreated back to the Lake Champlain area at Mt. Independence. Regrouped soldiers heard Spring's sermon on November 3, 1776, at this encampment. Chaplain Spring was discharged from the Continental Army at the end of 1776. Marriage and later work Reverend Spring returned to Newburyport and married Hannah, daughter of Rev. Samuel Hopkins of Hadley, Massachusetts, on November 4, 1779. He was a founder of the Massachusetts Missionary Society in 1779 and of the Andover Theological Seminary in 1808. He was very influential in a fundamentalist wing of the Congregational Church and many of his sermons and discourses were printed and widely disseminated. John Quincy Adams was one of many who disagreed with Spring's teachings; Adams wrote that Spring's views were \\"extremely contracted and illiberal\\" and that he had the \\"enthusiasm of a bigot\\". Spring maintained contacts with Uxbridge. He and his wife had 11 children, although several died young: # Margaret Stoddard Spring was born April 26, 1783. In August 1807 she married Bezaleel Taft, Jr., a politician from Uxbridge. She died on July 25, 1816, and her widower married her cousin Hannah Spring. # Rev. Dr. Gardiner Spring was born February 24, 1785, and became an influential minister in his own right. # Hannah Spring was born September 6, 1788, and died March 16, 1796. # Walton Spring was born September 15, 1790, and died May 8, 1809. # Rev.

She worked as a research scientist for American Cyanamid from 1951 to 1954. From 1954 to 1984, Newman worked for FMC Corp., for fifteen years (1954‚Äì1969) as a patent attorney and in-house counsel, and for another fifteen years (1969‚Äì1984) as director of the Patent, Trademark and Licensing Department. From 1961 to 1962 Newman also worked for the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) as a science policy specialist in the Department of Natural Resources. She served on the State Department Advisory Committee on International Intellectual Property from 1974 to 1984 and on the advisory committee to the Domestic Policy Review of Industrial Innovation from 1978 to 1979. From 1982 to 1984, she was Special Adviser to the United States Delegation to the Diplomatic Conference on the Revision of the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property. Over her career, Newman has received honors including the Wilbur Cross Medal of Yale University Graduate School, and the Award for Outstanding Contributions to International Cooperation from the Pacific Industrial Property Association. Federal judicial service Newman was nominated to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit by President Ronald Reagan on January 30, 1984, to a seat vacated by the decision of Judge Philip Nichols Jr. to take senior status. She was confirmed by the United States Senate on February 27, 1984, and received her commission the following day. Newman thus became the first judge appointed directly to the Federal Circuit, all of her predecessors having come to the court through the merger of the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals and the appellate division of the United States Court of Federal Claims. She has also been an adjunct professor at the George Mason University School of Law. Jurisprudence Newman has authored a number of important opinions setting forth the law of patents in the United States. In Arrhythmia Research Technology, Inc. v. Corazonix Corp.,958 F.2d 1053 (Fed. Cir. 1992). she wrote an opinion for the panel finding that the use of an algorithm as a step in a process did not render the process unpatentable. In In re Recreative Technologies Corp.,83 F.3d 1394 (Fed. Cir. 1996). she wrote the opinion finding that the Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences exceeded its authority when it considered a claim of obviousness in the reexamination of a patent previously held by the examiner not to be obvious with respect to the references cited. In Intergraph Corporation v. Intel Corporation,Intergraph Corporation v. Intel Corporation, 195 F.3d 1346 (Fed. Cir. 1999). she highlighted the right of a patent owner to refuse to license, even to a party that has become completely dependent on the patent. In Jazz Photo Corp. v. United States International Trade Commission,264 F. 3d 1094 (Fed. Cir. 2001). she clarified the law of repair and reconstruction (permitting the owner of a patented item to fix the item when it breaks, but not to essentially build a new item from the parts of an old one), writing that it was not a patent infringement for one party to restore another party's patented \\"one-use\\" camera to be used a second time. With respect to the court's federal contracts jurisprudence, in 2010 she wrote a dissenting opinion in M. Maropakis Carpentry, Inc. v. United States. Stanfield Johnson has called her the court's \\"great dissenter\\". He has said that her dissents in the area of federal contracts \\"consistently reflect the view that a primary responsibility of the court is to serve 'the national policy of fairness to contractors'\\". He writes: > At the core of Judge Newman's dissenting jurisprudence is the premise that > the sovereign as a contracting party should be accountable for its actions, > subject only to limited exceptions not to be presumed, unnecessarily > expanded, or imposed in a formalistic doctrinaire way that ignores or masks > the facts of government conduct.

At international level, he represented the Italy national football team at the 1988 and the 1996 Summer Olympics. Club career A determined and physically powerful player, Crippa began his playing career during the 1981‚Äì82 season, with A.C. Meda Mobil, in the Prima Categoria, where he spent two seasons in the first squad. He later moved to play in the Eccellenza Lombardy - the sixth tier of Italian club football - with FBC Saronno for two seasons before moving to his hometown club, Seregno. His performances earned him a move to nearby Serie C2 club Pavia in the summer of 1986. After only one season with the club, he moved to Torino in Serie A. In the 1987‚Äì88 season he scored three goals for the Turin club in 29 league appearances. Crippa left Torino in the summer of 1988 to join Napoli. Playing behind Diego Maradona, who was at the peak of his abilities, Crippa joined a strong midfield that also included Alem√£o, Fernando De Napoli and Francesco Romano. In his first season with the club, Crippa helped Napoli to finish second in Serie A and to win the UEFA Cup, beating VfB Stuttgart in the final. He helped Napoli to fend off the challenge of A.C. Milan to win the Scudetto in the following season. He scored a goal as Napoli defeated Juventus 5‚Äì1 in the 1990 Supercoppa Italiana. Crippa moved to Parma in the summer of 1993 and in his first season he was part of the team that won the UEFA Super Cup over two legs against A.C. Milan. Parma lost the first leg, played at the Stadio Ennio Tardini, 0‚Äì1, but won the second leg 2‚Äì0 with Crippa scoring the decisive goal in extra time. Crippa won his second UEFA Cup at the end of the 1994‚Äì95 season as Parma defeated Juventus 2‚Äì1 on aggregate. Parma had finished second behind Juventus in that season's Serie A, and would do so again in the 1995‚Äì96 season. Crippa was part of Parma's first ever Champions League campaign during the 1997‚Äì98 season. In 1998, Crippa returned to Torino, who were playing in Serie B; the team were promoted in his first season back at the club. He returned to the Eccellenza Lombardy in 2000 with Canzese playing until 2002. He finished his career in 2003 playing for Seregno, the club of his city. International career After playing for the under-21 team, Crippa went on to make 17 appearances for Italy between 1988 and 1996. He made his debut in a 2‚Äì0 home win over Scotland on 22 December 1988, and he scored his only international goal in a 3‚Äì1 friendly win against Turkey on December 14, 1994. Crippa also represented Italy at two Olympic Games: Seoul 1988, and Atlanta 1996, under manager Cesare Maldini. He scored the decisive goal in the 2‚Äì1 quarter-final victory against Sweden at the 1988 Olympics, as Italy reached the semi-finals, eventually finishing the tournament in fourth place. Style of play A hard-working and physically strong team-player, Crippa was known for his dedication, power, tenacity and stamina on the pitch, which enabled him to excel as a ball-winner in midfield and support his more creative and offensive-minded teammates. Managerial career Crippa was appointed the sporting director of Renate in Lega Pro Seconda Divisione in the summer of 2010, a position which he currently holds.

His mother, a native of Hu·∫ø, was daughter of a royal physician under Emperor Kh·∫£i ƒê·ªãnh (B·∫£o ƒê·∫°i's father). He went to school in Hu·∫ø, and was many years chosen as one of the best schoolboys to receive awards presented by Empress Nam Ph∆∞∆°ng (B·∫£o ƒê·∫°i's wife).Empress Nam Ph∆∞∆°ng :vi:Nam Ph∆∞∆°ng He had, at the age of 13, his first poems and short stories published in various famous magazines in H√† N·ªôi, the then literary capital of the country. He also was politically influenced by his teacher, Tr√°ng C·ª≠, son of Prince C∆∞·ªùng ƒê·ªÉ, who had been in Japan, operating against the French colonialists in Vietnam. His first years of high school was at the well-known Qu·ªëc H·ªçc ‚Äì Hu·∫ø High School for the Gifted.  French occupation & B·∫£o ƒê·∫°i's puppet administration  The French rulers were ousted by the Imperial Japanese Army in March 1945; then Emperor B·∫£o ƒê·∫°i was dethroned by the Vietnamese Communist Party (Vi·ªát Minh) in August that year. When World War II ended, the French expeditionary forces re-occupied most parts of Vietnam. From 1947 to 1954, L√™ Xu√¢n Nhu·∫≠n co-operated with the various newspapers in Hu√© City, especially the two opposition bi-weeklies C√¥ng L√Ω (Justice) and D√¢n ƒêen (The Pariah) issued throughout the Central Vietnam Region.

When he wrote the fictitious novel Trai Th·ªùi Lo·∫°n (Wartime Youths), implying resistance to the French who wanted to re-establish their domination over Vietnam, and ex-Emperor B·∫£o ƒê·∫°i who wanted to restore his reign, Nhu·∫≠n was consequently arrested and imprisoned, in 1949. In 1954, he was mobilized, as a professional (writer/journalist), into the French- supported Vietnamese National Army.

The Geneva Conference (1954) resulted in dividing the country into two, putting North Vietnam under the Vietnamese communists. L√™ Xu√¢n Nhu·∫≠n realized that Diem was supported by the United States, and the US wanted to help South Vietnam get rid of the French colonists and fight against the Communists. He refused to obey orders by Nguy·ªÖn VƒÉn Hinh and Tr∆∞∆°ng VƒÉn X∆∞∆°ng, the Second Military Region Commander, who tried to step up the campaign against Ng√¥ ƒê√¨nh Di·ªám.

A documentary film may also be written in a procedural style to heighten narrative interest. Television programs in this genre focus on how crimes are solved, and are centered around a law enforcement agency, legislative body, or court of law. Some dramas include a lab or high-tech conference room where the main characters meet to work out the problem. Shows usually have an episodic format that does not necessarily require the viewer to have seen previous episodes. Episodes typically have a self-contained, also referred to as stand-alone, plot that is introduced, developed, and resolved within the same episode. The procedural format is popular around the world. In 2011, the director of a TV consultancy said, \\"The continuing trend is for procedurals because they use a predictable structure.\\" Due to their stand-alone episodic nature, they are more accessible to new viewers than serials. Self-contained episodes also make it easier for viewers to return to a show if they have missed some episodes. In general, procedural dramas can usually be re-run with little concern for episode order. Procedurals are often criticized for being formulaic. Procedurals are also generally less character-driven than serialized shows. However, some procedurals have more character emphasis than is typical of the format. Some may occasionally feature a storyline stretching over several episodes (often called a story arc). A popular subgenre is the police procedural.  Types of media  = Television =  Fiction  In television, \\"procedural\\" specifically refers to a genre of programs in which a problem is introduced, investigated and solved all within the same episode. These shows tend to be hour-long dramas, and are often (though not always) police or crime related. The general formula for a police procedural involves the commission or discovery of a crime at the beginning of the episode, the ensuing investigation, and the arrest or conviction of a perpetrator at the end of the episode. Modern examples of this genre are the Law & Order, CSI & NCIS franchises. House is an example of a non-crime-related procedural. * Procedural dramas are generally very popular in broadcast syndication because the lack of long-term storylines makes it easier for viewers to tune in for just one episode without feeling lost. * Procedurals are sometimes noted for their lack of character development, with little attention being paid to the lives of the recurring characters outside of their jobs.  Non-fiction  * Non-fiction science procedurals such as the PBS Secrets of the Dead series or Court TV's Forensic Files take a viewer step-by-step through an investigation, much like a fictional procedural.https://www.pbs.org/wnet/secrets/ = Literature = * Police procedural: the best known variety, a large subgenre of mystery fiction. Lawrence Treat's 1945 novel V as in Victim is cited as perhaps the first \\"true\\" police procedural. * Military procedural: a term used by Publishers Weekly in 1989https://www.amazon.com/dp/0671676687 referring to Ralph Peters' novel Red Army * War procedural: an example is the film The Dam Busters, 1955, which was called a war procedural by Richard Gilliam in Allmovie.https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B000H1RFSM ** Tom Clancy's novels are sometimes called war procedurals or political procedurals. * Science procedural: Science fiction novels or stories may have sequences of scientific procedure. An example would be Timescape, written by the scientist and author Gregory Benford. * A relatively recent subgenre is the presidential procedural; a novel which focuses on the office of the US presidency, and the activities of its occupant. Examples would be Executive Orders by Tom Clancy, The President's Plane Is Missing by Robert Serling, and Maximum Vigilance by Steve Pieczenik.

It is found in the Indi-Pacific where it is associated with reefs. It is sometimes found in the aquarium trade. Description Cephalopholis formosa ha a body which is between two and a half to just under three times as long (fish measurementstandard length) as it is deep. It has a rounded, finely serrated preopercle rounded which has a fleshy lower edge. There are 47 to 51 in the lateral line There are 9 spines and 15-17 soft rays in the dorsal fin while the anal fin has 3 spines and 7-8 soft rays. The caudal fin is rounded. The scales on the body, including the abdomen, are ctenoid. The body is dark brown to yellowish brown in colour with thin blue stripes. There are small black blue spots on the lips. snout, lower part of the head and the chest. They attain a maximum total length of . Distribution Cephalopholis formosa is found in the shallow, coastal waters of the continent and continental islands of the eastern Indian Ocean and the Western Pacific Ocean, the only oceanic islands where it is found are the Lakshadweep Islands. It is found from the Lakshadweeps and Sri Lanka east to the Philippines. It extends as far north as Honshu in Japan and south to Australia, where it is been recorded only from the North West Shelf of Western Australia. Records from the Mascarenes are probably misidentifications of Cephalolophis polleni while those from the Great Barrier Reef probably refer to C. boenak. It has also been recorded in the Persian Gulf. Habitat and biology Cephalopholis formosa is found in shallow waters over silty or dead reefs. It is a solitary species. It is found at depths between . It is a predatory species which feeds on other fishes and crustaceans. Taxonomy Cephalopholis formosa was first formally described as Sciaena formosa in 1812 by the English naturalist George Shaw (1751-1813) with the book he wrote with the illustrator Frederick Polydore Nodder, The Naturalist's Miscellany, or coloured figures of natural objects; drawn and described from nature with the type locality given as Vizagapatam in India. Utilisation Cephalopholis formosa is relatively small species of grouper is not normally a target for commercial fisheries. Local artisanal and subsistence fisheries take these fish as a bycatch using by hook and line, traps and trawls. In India it is exploited for food but it is also prized as an aquarium fish and fishing effort for this purpose is expected to increase. It may have been introduced outside of its range due to escapes or releases from aquaria.

It is found in the western Atlantic. It is associated with reefs and is a quarry species for commercial and recreational fisheries. It can be found in the aquarium trade. Description Bicoloured phase Cephalopholis fulva has an oblong-shaped, robust body with a snout that is longer than the diameter of the eye. It has large and round eyes, sitting above a pointed snout. The dorsal profile is flat to convex between the eyes and the posterior end of the upper mandible is exposed when the mouth is closedforming a bony knob. The closed mouth reaches beyond the rear margin of the eye. The majority of the teeth are movable. It has a rounded preopercle which is finely serrated but does not have any spines or notches. There are 46-54 scales in the lateral line. The dorsal fin has 9 spines and 14-16 soft rays while the anal fin has 3 spines and 9 soft rays. There are deep notches between the spines in the dorsal fin. The caudal fin is convex with angles at the corners. The maximum recorded total length recorded is . There are three colour phases in this species: a deep water red phase, a shallow water bicoloured or orange-brown phase and a xanthic or yellow phase which can be found in shallow to deep water. The bicoloured phase is the normal red or brownish orange above a line which runs from the tip of the snout to the rear rays of the dorsal fin and pale below this. In the red and bicoloured morphs, there is a patterning of small blue spots with fark margins which covers the head and body. In the yellow morph these spots are restricted to the head and the anterior part of the body and there are less of them. There are two small black spots on top of caudal peduncle and another two at tip of lower jaw which are present in all three colour morphs. The bicoloured pattern shown by the shallow-water morph seems to be an excitement pattern, and it the fish can switch this pattern on and off in a few seconds. At night they generally adopt a pale colouration with irregular vertical bars and a dark forked line between the eyes. When breeding the male has a horizontal dark brown band which runs from the lower end of base of the pectoral fin to the tip of the caudal fin, a black margin to the soft-rayed part of the dorsal fin, a dark stripe through eye and a white spot on the body near the centre of the base of the dorsal fin. The juveniles are either bicoloured or uniformly gold and have a white spot on the middle of the back and have four black spots on the lower lip and two white spots on upper base of the caudal fin. Distribution Cephalopholis fulva occurs in the western Atlantic Ocean from South Carolina and Bermuda to the Bahamas and into the Gulf of Mexico where it is found in Florida from the Florida Keys as far north as Cedar Key, Florida and the Flower Garden Banks. In the west of the Gulf of Mexico it is found from Tuxpan in Mexico south along the coast of the northern Yucatan Peninsula and off northwestern Cuba. It also occurs throughout the Caribbean Sea and along the northern coast of South America, with a gap in the region of the Amazon Delta, to southern Brazil, It is also found around the Fernando de Noronha Archipelago, St. Paul‚Äôs Rocks and Trinidae Island. Habitat and biology Cephalopholis fulva are found in coral reefs and clear water, at depths of , and it may also be found over rocks and coral heads, but only infrequently in the water column. During the day it normally shelters in caves or under ledges. It emerges at night to feed on small fish and crustaceans. They have been known to follow moray eels and snake eels to feed on prey flushed by these predators. The juveniles are mimics of damselfish. The coney is a protogynous hermaphrodite, the females attain sexual maturity at a total length of and when they attain a total length of they begin to change sex to become males. In Bermuda, females have been reported to be mature at 4 years old. The males are territorial and guard harems of females. Spawning akes place at dusk and occurs over a few days. Small groups made up a male and a number of females take part in the spawning. The breeding season can be as long as ten months off central Brazil although briefer breeding seasons were noted in other areas. On the Abrolhos Bank off Brazil, breeding is from July to August, in Pernambuco it runs from August to October and in Fernando de Noronha spawning occurs July and August, but may extend into September. In Bermuda, spawning has been recorded from May to July. They are reported to have a long larval period which allows for effective and long range dispersal of young. They are thought to grow most rapidly in their early life, attaining around 60% of their possible maximum size in their first year, then the growth rate reduces markedly over the remainder of its life. They have been reported to reach an age of 25 years off Brazil while in tropical areas they grow more quickly and live shorter lives. The oldest fish recorded was from Bermuda and this was 28 years old, Bermudan fish are also the slowest growing. Utilisation Cephalopholis fulva is a small species which means that it is of little interest to commercial fisheries although it appears in markets throughout the West Indies where it is caught by hook and line and traps. It is commercially fished for in Brazil and is exported It is also captured as juveniles for the aquarium trade.

The dorsal fin contains 9 spines, with the third spine being the longest, and 14-15 soft rays while the anal fin has 3 spines and 8 soft rays. The membrane of the dorsal fin is notched between the front spines. The adults have a pale grey-brown body with around 9 dark vertical bars along the flanks. The head is dark with diagonal pale bands, a patterning of blue and orange spots and a large dark blotch just to the rear of the eye. The dorsal fin spines are dark while the membrane is pale while the soft rayed part of that fin is dark with a pale line along its base. The caudal fin and anal fin are dark. Juveniles have a medium blue grey body, a pale blue-grey lower head which is marked with orange spots and lines with the upper part of the head and the spiny part of the dorsal fin being green.

Habitat and biology Cephalopholis panamensis is found in rocky shore habitats, preferring shallower, warmer water than many other species in the genus Cephalopholis. They can also be found in coral reefs. It feeds on fishes and crustaceans. They are protogynous hermaphrodites, the males are larger and older than the females with the sex ratio biased towards there being more females. They form harems made up of a single male and several females. They form pairs to court in the evening. Spawning takes place around the full moon and they spawn between May and September, peaking in July to August in the central Gulf of California. The females attain sexual maturity at around when they ar a year and a half old, the change to male takes place when they are and at least three years old. They can live for up to 16 years. They are the commonest grouper species within their range. Taxonomy Cephalopholis panamensis was first formally described as Serranus panamensis in 1876 by the Austrian ichthyologist Franz Steindachner (1834-1919) with the type locality given as Panama. Utilisation Cephalopholis panamensis was of little interest to fisheries in the past but, in the Gulf of Mexico, its importance as a commercial species has increased as the populations of larger groupers has decreased through overfishing.

As a small boy Evgraf Litkens met Trotsky, when his father harboured Trotsky following the defeat of the 1905 Revolution. He subsequently graduated from the University of St Petersburg. The Litkens Commission In 1917 he was given a mandate from the Central Committee of the Russian Communist Party to reorganise Narkompros, making it a more efficient organisation. This was only completed in late 1920. He proposed splitting Narkompros into an Academic Centre, dealing with policy, and an Organisational Centre, dealing with the administration of the ministry. Whilst the Commissar, Anatoly Lunacharsky would maintain overall supervision and head the Academic Centre, an additional Assistant Commissar, i.e. Litkens, would run the Organisational Centre and have administrative control. The proposal was criticised by both Lenin and Krupskaya, but it was nevertheless implemented with some amendments by Sovnarkom in mid-February 1921. Lunacharsky, as Commissar retained overall control, but the Academic Centre was to be headed by Mikhail Pokrovsky as an Assistant Commissar alongside Litkens heading the Organisational Centre. Whereas Lithens had proposed three departments within Narkompros, Glavsotsvos for school education, Glavprofobr for technical training and higher education and Glavpolitprosvet for political education, Sovnarkon introduced a fourth Gosizdat, the State Publishing House.

The wide variety of programmes available recognises the differing abilities and needs of those attending the school, and ensures that all students have the chance to succeed at their own level and in their chosen field. Huntly College is a small school, with a current roll of approximately 350 students. The roll peaked in the early 1980s with student numbers at that time in excess of 800. This number was associated with the development of the Huntly Power Station and the operation of several state-owned coal mines. By 1991 the roll had dropped to around 500 students, and has continued to decline. The small nature of the current roll allows the school to offer small class sizes. The ages range from Year 9 - Year 13. The area is home to its original inhabitants, the Tainui people, to whom the Waikato River and Taupiri Mountain are sacred. Huntly College roll is 72% Maori. Students participate in camps, trips, extra curricular activities (drama, dance, kapa haka) and a range of sports. Huntly College is close to two major New Zealand cities, Hamilton 35 km to the south and Auckland, New Zealand's largest city (population of over one million), is approximately 90 km north. The college is also less than one hour's drive to either the west or east coasts. The school's motto, \\"ma te pono ka watea\\", is a Maori translation of \\"the truth shall set you free\\".

It spreads over a length of 174 km east‚Äìwest. The valley extends in north‚Äìsouth direction with varying width of 27 km in the west, 40 km - in the central part, and 3-7 km - in the east. The altitude of the valley ranges from 2,440 m near Karamyk to 3536 m at Toomurun Pass with an average altitude of about 3000 m. The area of the valley is 8400 km2. The north side is the Alay Mountains which slope down to the Ferghana Valley. The south side is the Trans-Alay Range along the Tajikistan border, with Lenin Peak, (7134 m). The western 40 km or so is more hills than valley. On the east there is the low Tongmurun pass and then more valley leading to the Irkestam border crossing to China. The eastern Kyzyl-Suu ('Red River') flows from the Tongmurun rise past Irkestam toward Kashgar. The western Kyzyl- Suu flows west from the Tongmurun rise and drains most of the valley, flowing on the north side. It exits through the Karamyk pass and a gorge into Tajikistan, where, under the name of the Vakhsh River it flows southwest into the Amu Darya. Highway A371 runs along the valley. The western pass to Tajikistan is closed to foreigners, but the eastern pass to China is open. A371 intersects the M41 highway north to Osh at Sary-Tash. To the south, M41 (Pamir Highway) becomes very rough and leads to the 4,280m Kyzyl-Art pass to Murgab in Tajikistan, a route that requires considerable preparation and paperwork. The valley has a population of approximately 17,000 and is almost entirely Kyrgyz with a few pockets of Tajik population. One traveler says \\"with no jobs, a harsh winter climate, and poor conditions for agriculture, life is immensely tough here, and most of the adult male population have left to seek work elsewhere.\\"Laurence Mitchell, Kyrgyzstan, Bradt Travel Guides, 2008 Places in or near the valley : Irkestam, Nura, Sary-Tash, Achiktash, Lenin Peak, Sary-Mogol, Kashka-Suu, Bordobo, Karakavak, Kyzyleshme, Daroot- Korgon, Chak, Dzharbashy, Karamyk, Achyk-Suu.

In Newman, MG; Takei, HH; Carrana FA, editors: Carranza‚Äôs Clinical Periodontology, 9th Edition. Philadelphia: W.B. Saunders Company, 2002. page 8. Biography Willoughby D. Miller Memorial at the University of Michigan, by Samuel Cashwan Willoughy D. Miller was born in Alexandria, Ohio, and studied mathematics and physics at the University of Michigan. He traveled to Edinburgh to continue his studies, but financial problems caused him to move to Berlin where he was assisted by an American dentist Frank Abbot. Miller later married Abbot's daughter, Caroline. Becoming interested in his father-in-law's profession, Miller returned to the United States to train as a dentist at the Pennsylvania Dental College. This college merged with the University of Pennsylvania Department of Dentistry in 1878, and Miller was one of the members of the first graduating class in 1879. After graduating, Miller returned to Berlin where he worked at first in Abbot's dental office and pursued his interest in the emerging science of microbiology. In his later years, he was appointed Dean of the University of Michigan School of Dentistry in 1906, but he died in 1907 following an operation for appendicitis, prior to assuming the position. Miller worked during the golden age of microbiology. Pasteur had discovered that bacteria can ferment sugars into lactic acid, and another Frenchman, Emil Magitot, showed that fermentation of sugars could dissolve teeth in the laboratory. Bacteria had been observed inside carious dentin by Underwood and Miles in 1881, and these researchers also proposed that bacterial acids were necessary for removing the mineral of teeth. It was against this background that Miller developed his oral microbiological research, soon becoming appointed Professor of Operative Dentistry at the University of Berlin. He worked in the microbiological laboratory of Robert Koch in Berlin and began numerous research projects that introduced modern biological principles to dentistry.Miller, WD: The human mouth as a focus of infection. Dent Cosmos 1891; 33:689, 789, 913. In 1890 Miller formulated the chemo-parasitic theory of caries (tooth decay). This theory held that caries is caused by acids produced by oral bacteria following fermentation of sugars. The principles of the chemo-parasitic theory were bolstered by the descriptions of bacterial plaque on tooth surfaces independently by GV Black and by JL Williams in 1898. The biomass of plaque helps localize acids at the tooth surface and prevent dilution by saliva. Miller thought that no single species of bacteria could cause caries. This idea was supplanted in the 1950s when the role of Streptococcus mutans as a primary pathogen in caries was established. More recent examination of the microbiology of carious lesions using 16S rRNA sequencing and high throughput DNA sequencing indicates that communities of diverse organisms may be more important than individual species. A second major contribution of WD Miller was the focal infection theory. Miller proposed that oral microorganisms or their products have a role in the development of a variety of diseases in sites removed from the oral cavity, including brain abscesses, pulmonary diseases and gastric problems. Although Miller did not suggest removal of teeth to eliminate the focus of infection and advocated treating and filling root canals, the complete removal of teeth became accepted practice. As this rarely produced a positive health benefit, the concept of oral focal infection gradually lost credibility. However, in the 1980s epidemiological studies began to indicate an association between periodontal disease and coronary artery disease, and associations with other serious systemic conditions soon followed. It is now generally accepted that oral bacteria can gain access systemically and cause disease at remote sites, or cause a general perturbation of the immune system leading to disease.Lamont, RJ, Jenkinson, HF: Oral Microbiology at a Glance 2010, Wiley- Blackwell Once again Miller's contributions have been shown to be correct.

Williams later passed examinations for the DDS degree at the Baltimore College of Dental Surgery and the equivalent LDS degree in Ireland. He joined the Maine Dental Society and used the opportunity to borrow their microscope to study the histology and pathology of tooth enamel. In the early 1880s, common crown and bridge techniques were not well known or widespread. Williams sought to make information on these techniques available to all dentists through the pages of The Dental Cosmos. In 1885, he embarked on a journey to improve the state of dental prostheses by designing more aesthetic artificial teeth that better matched the overall facial dimensions of the patient. He convinced an American artificial tooth manufacturer to take up his cause and produce his designs, on the condition that other dentists would embrace the new forms. Williams also practiced dentistry in London and was one of the founders of the International Association for Dental Research. He also was the author of The Home and Haunts of Shakespeare and had an interest in anthropology, including the Piltdown Man. \\\\- See also footnote 62 in chapter 3 of References Signature of James Leon Williams External links * - Williams as a photographer 1852 births 1932 deaths Periodontists ","title":"James Leon Williams"},{"id":"20576860","text":"Mar√≠a Romero Meneses (13 January 1902 ‚Äì 7 July 1977) was a Nicaraguan Roman Catholic religious sister and a professed member from the Salesian Sisters of Don Bosco dubbed the \\"Social Apostle of Costa Rica\\". The beatification process started on 20 September 1988 and she was titled as a Servant of God before being named Venerable on 18 December 2000. Pope John Paul II beatified her on 14 April 2002. Life Signature. Mar√≠a Romero Meneses was born in Nicaragua in 1902 as one of eight children to middle-class parents ‚Äì her father was a government minister. Her parents were F√©lix Romero Arana and Ana Meneses Blandon and one sister was Chila. Her baptism was held on the 20th of the month. She received her Confirmation on 23 July 1904 from Sim√©on Pereira y Castell√≥n and received her First Communion on 8 December 1909. Meneses was found to have a talent for art and music and so her parents saw to it that she was trained on the piano and the violin. She later attended the Salesians Sisters of Don Bosco's school, although in 1914 she was stricken with a long bout of rheumatic fever which she suffered until 1915 and it left her heart damaged for the remainder of her life. When she recovered it was deemed to be miraculous in nature and this led to a total confidence in the Madonna and to the vision of her vocation to the order. The hopeful girl joined the Marian association Daughters of Mary Help of Christians on 8 December 1915, to follow her Marian call. In 1920 she joined that congregation and left for El Salvador for her period of novitiate, receiving the habit of the order on 16 January 1921. Her spiritual director was Father Emilio Bottari who gave her a prophetic recommendation: \\"Even though difficult moments will come and you will feel torn to pieces, be faithful and strong in your vocation\\". These words sustained her for the rest of her religious life. On 6 January 1929 in Nicaragua she made her final profession. Her writings indicate that she attempted to live the religious interior life after the example of John Bosco. In 1931 she went to San Jos√© in Costa Rica which became her second homeland and at 1933 was a teacher of music and art as well as typing in a school for the daughters of rich families. A great number of her students were won over to her mode of life and worked with her to help the poor and the abandoned. Her focus was on social development while helping the rich to see if the latter could help the poor with their wealth. She set up recreational centers in 1945 as well as food distribution centers in 1953. She also set up a school for poor girls in 1961 and a clinic in 1966 for ill people. In 1973 she organized the construction of seven homes which became the foundation of the village of Centro San Jos√® ‚Äì a place where poor families could have decent homes. Meneses died of a heart attack in mid-1977 in the Salesian Sisters house in Leon where she had been sent for a rest. Her mortal remains were sent back to San Jos√© in Costa Rica to be buried in the chapel at a Salesian house. Beatification The beatification process started on 20 September 1988 once the Congregation for the Causes of Saints issued the nihil obstat to the cause and titled her as a Servant of God, which allowed for the diocesan process to span from 18 November 1988 until its closure on 6 May 1992; the C.C.S. validated the process on 8 January 1993 and then received the Positio in 1997 for inspection. Theologians approved the cause on 7 March 2000 and the C.C.S. did so as well on 3 October 2000. She was named as Venerable on 18 December 2000 after Pope John Paul II approved that she had lived a life of heroic virtue. The process for investigating a miracle spanned from 1997 until 1998 and was validated on 9 October 1998 which allowed for a medical board to approve it on 30 March 2000 and theologians to do so as well on 30 January 2001; the C.C.S. issued their approval on 3 April 2001 which led to the pope granting final approval on 24 April 2001. John Paul II beatified Meneses on 14 April 2002 in Saint Peter's Square. Meneses was the first individual from Central America to be beatified. The current postulator for this cause is the Rev. Pierluigi Cameroni.

Topography Mount Skokomish Wilderness is located in the southeast corner of Olympic National Forest, just north of Lake Cushman. It consists of two long rocky ridges running roughly northeast to southwest. Elevations range from about to at the peak of Mount Skokomish on the northwest boundary. The northern ridge rises to Mounts Skokomish, Lincoln, and Cruiser, with Sawtooth Ridge, a popular rock-climbing location,stretching between Lincoln and Cruiser. The southern ridge includes the summits of Mounts Pershing, Washington, Rose, Ellinor, Jefferson Peak, and Tran Spire. Between the ridges lies the headwaters basin of the Hamma Hamma River,which gathers its waters from Mildred Lakes and tributary streams in the western portion to flow east across the Wilderness. Vegetation Common vegetation in Mount Skokomish Wilderness include old-growth western hemlock, western red cedar, and Douglas fir in the lower elevations. Higher elevations display various species of firs, pines, and dwarf juniper. Wildlife Common wildlife found in Mount Skokomish Wilderness include elk, black-tailed deer, black bear, mountain lion, marmot,and mountain goat. Recreation Common recreational activities in Mount Skokomish Wilderness include backpacking, mountain climbing, fishing, and camping. There are over of trail inside the wilderness. The Mildred Lakes Trail is a primitive trail that has extremely steep pitches and is the major access into the Wilderness. The elevation gain on this trail is 2,100 feet and it is 4.5 miles in length. The Mt.
