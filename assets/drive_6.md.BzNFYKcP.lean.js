It is bordered by the University of Memphis to the north, Audubon Park to the east, Park Avenue and the Sherwood Forest neighborhood to the south, and Highland Street to the west. History Until the early 20th century, the neighborhood was part of an area known as the Eckles Tract. In 1911, construction of the new normal school began in the neighborhood. To serve the construction, the Southern Railroad built a stub track northward from its main line. A streetcar line was extended eastward to serve the site. When the school opened in 1912, the railroad converted the terminus of its stub line into an official stop and built a waiting station in front of the school, near what is now the intersection of Highland Street and Southern Avenue, to serve passengers using the railroad and the streetcars. The neighborhood took on the name of the railway station, Normal Station. It was common in the outlying areas around Memphis for neighborhoods and small towns to get their names from land owners, landmarks and railway stations. The custom is also seen today in areas such as Buntyn Station, White Station, and Bray Station. The Normal railway station closed in 1949 and was demolished the following year. Campus neighborhood The athletic department, student fitness center, and south parking lots of the University of Memphis are located in this neighborhood. Because of the proximity to the University, a large proportion of the neighborhood population are students and faculty. Most of the homes in this neighborhood are one-story single-family homes and duplexes built after World War II, but there are small apartment complexes and some larger, older homes interspersed within. The neighborhood's ZIP code is 38111.  The Highland Strip  The Highland strip is the restaurant and shopping hub in the Normal station neighborhood. It is situated on the western border of the neighborhood. There is live music regularly at Newby's Memphis and The Bluff. This is a local gathering place for many U of M students.

She was used by the Union Navy as a gunboat assigned to patrol Confederate waterways.  Built in Pennsylvania in 1862  St. Clair, a wooden, stern-wheel, river steamer built in 1862 at Belle Vernon, Pennsylvania, was purchased on 13 August that year by the Navy Department from R. D. Cochran et al., at St. Louis, Missouri. She was fitted out and commissioned on 24 September 1862 at Carondelet, Missouri, Act. Vol. Lt. J. S. Hurd in command.  Civil War operations  = Assigned to Mississippi River operations = The next day, she sailed in company with Brilliant for Cairo, Illinois. For many months previous, Flag Officer Foote and Commodore C. H. Davis had commanded the victorious Western Flotilla for the U.S. War Department, gaining control of the Mississippi River from Cairo, Illinois, to Memphis, Tennessee. On 1 October 1862, the Western Flotilla was transferred to the Navy Department, as the Mississippi Squadron, and was placed under the command of Acting Rear Admiral David D. Porter on the 15th. Davis, who had relieved Foote when the latter was incapacitated by wounds, was now appointed Chief of the Bureau of Navigation. Admiral Porter began to augment the gunboat squadron with many shallow-draft vessels, including St. Clair, and to expand Union operations on the western rivers. The squadron assembled at Cairo, from which they were dispatched to and stationed along the Mississippi, Cumberland, Tennessee, and upper Ohio Rivers. = Objectives of the Mississippi Squadron = The objectives of the Mississippi Squadron were to cooperate with and support Generals William Rosecrans, Ambrose Burnside, Ulysses S. Grant, and others in combating guerrillas along the river banks; to stop the transport of arms and munitions from Mississippi to Arkansas; to punish rebel supporters living in and around the river communities; and to escort Federal troop and supply transports on the waterways. To these ends, St. Clair and her sister gunboats were successful throughout the war. = Assigned reprisal and indemnity duties = St. Clair was sent up the Ohio River on 23 October 1862 to assess rebel inhabitants of Caseyville, Kentucky, for robbery of the transport, Hazel Dell, and to close the ferries and curtail cross-river communications. She was ordered to effect reprisals against those persons known to shelter and supply guerrillas by confiscating goods and destroying property as a lesson to others. Failing to receive an indemnity of 35,000 dollars from the townspeople, St. Clair's crew arrested those who could not prove loyalty and held them on board to turn them over to the Union Army. Among those arrested were an official named William Pemberton and a notorious sutler, J. M. Scantlin, who dealt in gunpowder with the Confederates. Operating with Fairplay and Brilliant, St. Clair then engaged in providing protection for loyal citizens. During December, she operated in the Green, Cumberland, and Tennessee Rivers to restrict commerce. = Supporting General Rosecrans Tennessee operations = In January 1863, St. Clair provided convoy protection on the Cumberland to Nashville, Tennessee, to support General William Rosecrans. In February, she participated in the relief of Fort Donelson. On 3 February, while convoying Army troop transports with Fairplay, Lexington, Brilliant, Robb, and Silver Lake, St. Clair engaged in a three-hour duel with rebels who were attacking Union troops under Col. Harding near Dover, Tennessee. Driving the enemy from their positions, the gunboats followed their retreat up the river, shelling the woods. Though firing at supposed positions and blinded by the wooded river banks, it was later found that the rebels were never able to avoid the shelling and suffered several hundred casualties. Through March, she continued convoy operations. = St. Clair comes under fire at Palmyra and is disabled = On 3 April, at Palmyra, Tennessee, while in convoy, St. Clair was fired on by Confederate batteries and disabled when accurate shots crippled her machinery. She was safely towed away by Fairplay and later repaired at Cairo, Illinois. The following day, her sister gunboats returned to Palmyra and burned the town in retaliation. = Assigned to support Mississippi River operations = On 19 June, St. Clair was designated as Gunboat No. 19. Following repair, she departed Cairo late in June to resume escort duty for convoys bringing supplies to forces besieging Vicksburg. After the fall of that strong Confederate river fortress, the Mississippi Squadron and the Western Gulf Squadron were able to control the entire Mississippi River, though not on all of its tributaries. St. Clair was sent south in mid-September to operate between Donaldsonville, Louisiana, and New Orleans, Louisiana, in support of Union Army operations. On 17 February 1864, St. Clair was on the Mississippi River above New Orleans when a strong wind drove the U.S. 218-ton sidewheel paddle steamer Hope into her. Hope sank as a result of the collision.Gaines, W. Craig, Encyclopedia of Civil War Shipwrecks, Louisiana State University Press, 2008, , p. 66.}} Early in 1864, plans were laid down for a joint Army-Navy operation on the Red River with the prime purpose of restoring Federal control in Texas. Admiral Porter's Mississippi Squadron was to convey General William Tecumseh Sherman's forces up the river to Alexandria, Louisiana, timed with the movement of forces under General Nathaniel P. Banks and General Steele between there and Shreveport, Louisiana. The operation was to be carried out during expected high water conditions in mid-March. = Clearing out the Red River and its tributary, the Black River = The major portion of Porter's fleet entered the mouth on 12 March and moved up the river. Unexpected strength in the Confederate ranks, unusual low water conditions for the year, and difficulty in coordinating movement of separate large forces overland brought about failure, to some extent, for the campaign. A portion of the fleet, some 14 vessels, became entrapped in the upper river as the Army was withdrawing from actions at Sabine Crossroads and Pleasant Hill. Only the determination of Admiral Porter and the resourcefulness of the Army engineers saved the fleet. As they were constructing dams to raise the river to float the boats over the rocks and falls, St. Clair was ordered from Baton Rouge, Louisiana, to Alexandria, Louisiana, to bolster defenses. On 21 April, she engaged rebels below Alexandria, and from 25 April to 3 May protected barges between Fort De Russy and Alexandria while silencing gun positions at Dunn's Bayou and Wilson's Bend. Admiral Porter now had his fleet reassembled at Alexandria and strengthened with the addition of three ironclads and a part of Farragut's detached squadron. General Banks arrived on 7 May, and they began to clear out the Red River and its tributary, the Black. St. Clair escorted the transports back to the Mississippi River and engaged rebel troops at Eunice's Bluff on the 15th. The transports safely reached Simmesport, Louisiana, at the mouth on the 21st, and St. Clair proceeded to Baton Rouge. = Final operations of the war = The Yazoo River now became for a short time the focal point of Porter's squadron operations, while St. Clair continued patrol and convoy duty in the lower Mississippi until August when she steamed to Mound City, Illinois, for repairs. St. Clair spent the remainder of the year at Mound City. In January 1865, she escorted convoys on the Tennessee River and carried dispatches between General Thomas's headquarters and Johnsonville, Tennessee. She remained in the Tennessee River until May and was reassigned to the 3d Division of the Mississippi Squadron to operate between Grand Gulf and New Orleans.  Post-war decommissioning, sale and civilian career  In July, she returned to Mound City where she was decommissioned on the 12th and dismantled. On 17 August 1865, St. Clair was sold at public auction to J. H. Stearn at Mound City. She was redocumented on 27 September 1865 and operated in merchant service until abandoned in 1869.

Both schools are charter members of the Southeastern Conference (SEC), and both universities' sports teams have competed in the SEC's Western Division since the conference was split into two divisions in 1992.  Series history  Sideline picture of Alabama vs LSU on November 5, 2011 The series started in 1895, with a 12‚Äì6 win for LSU in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. The rivalry has been played in Baton Rouge; New Orleans, Louisiana; Birmingham, Alabama; Montgomery, Alabama; Tuscaloosa, Alabama; and Mobile, Alabama. The teams began playing each other on an annual basis in 1964, with Alabama playing its home games at Legion Field in Birmingham and LSU playing its home games on campus at Tiger Stadium. The series has been marked by long stretches where the home team has struggled. Alabama is 28‚Äì9‚Äì2 against LSU in Baton Rouge; they went 16‚Äì1‚Äì1 from 1965‚Äì98. Alabama has gone 7‚Äì12 in games played in Alabama since 1982. LSU has gone 4‚Äì16‚Äì1 in games played in Louisiana since 1982. There have been two overtime games each in Tuscaloosa (2005, 2011) and Baton Rouge (2008, 2014) respectively; the road team has won each time. In fact, in the series history, only 39% of games have been won by the team playing in its home state (excluding ties). In 1988, Alabama began playing its home game in the series on their Tuscaloosa campus at Bryant‚ÄìDenny Stadium; LSU won the first game in the series after the move 19‚Äì18. While Alabama controlled most of the series' early history by going 31‚Äì11‚Äì4 against LSU, the intensity and competitiveness has grown during the last three decades. Since Bear Bryant's retirement in 1982, Alabama leads the series 22‚Äì15‚Äì1. Four games in the last ten seasons have also been decided in overtime. A 2009 poll of SEC fan bases found that over 60% of LSU fans singled out Alabama as their most bitter rival, while Alabama fans mostly did not consider it to be a rivalry. In 2007, the meeting was even more heated following Alabama's hiring of head coach Nick Saban, who had coached LSU to a National Championship; many media outlets dubbed the 2007 meeting the \\"Saban Bowl.\\" Alabama leads the series 10‚Äì4 in the games played so far during the \\"Saban Bowl\\" era. In their 2011 regular season matchup, No. 1 LSU beat No. 2 Alabama 9‚Äì6 in overtime at Bryant‚ÄìDenny Stadium in Tuscaloosa, on November 5. Later, during the 2011 post season, the two were selected by the Bowl Championship Series to play each other again in the 2012 BCS National Championship Game, which was the first time since 1986 that the two teams played in a location other than Baton Rouge or Tuscaloosa. Alabama, a controversial selection to the game after failing to win the conference title, proved its legitimacy and won the game 21‚Äì0. The rematch was the first BCS Championship Game to feature two teams from the same conference (as well as the same division), and was also the first shutout of any BCS bowl game in the BCS's 14-year history. In 2012, #5 LSU and #1 Alabama met each other at Tiger Stadium on November 3, 2012. Alabama took a 14‚Äì3 lead into halftime, but LSU running back Jeremy Hill ran for a touchdown to cut the lead to 14‚Äì10. QB Zach Mettenberger threw a touchdown pass to wide receiver Jarvis Landry early in the 4th quarter for a 17‚Äì14 lead. LSU held twice on defense, but kicker Drew Alleman missed a key field goal. Alabama then quickly drove downfield on completion by quarterback AJ McCarron to wide receiver Kevin Norwood of 18, 15, and 11 yards to the LSU 28. On 2nd and 10, McCarron threw a screen pass to running back TJ Yeldon, who weaved through LSU defenders for a game-winning touchdown with 51 seconds left. LSU failed to do anything, and Alabama won 21‚Äì17. In 2014, the #16 Tigers met the #5 Crimson Tide at Tiger Stadium on November 8, 2014. Alabama clawed to a 10‚Äì7 lead in a defensive battle, but LSU tied at 10 entering the 4th quarter. With 50 seconds left, LSU kicker Colby Delahoussaye kicked a 39-yard field goal for a 13‚Äì10 lead. Facing a second loss, and elimination from the first College Football Playoff, Alabama drove to the LSU 10, where sophomore kicker Adam Griffith made a 27 yarder to send the game into overtime tied 13‚Äì13. On the first possession of overtime, Alabama QB Blake Sims found DeAndrew White in the end-zone for a 20‚Äì13 lead. LSU threw 4 straight incomplete passes, and Alabama escaped Baton Rouge with a 20‚Äì13 win. In 2015, one of the biggest matchups in recent history involved LSU and Alabama. 7‚Äì0 #2 LSU was led by Heisman favorite Leonard Fournette, who ran for 200 yards against Auburn and Syracuse on national TV. 7‚Äì1 #4 Alabama had lost 43‚Äì37 to Ole Miss earlier in the season. Alabama had its own Heisman candidate in running back Derrick Henry. The Rebels had slipped up and lost 38‚Äì10 to Florida and 53‚Äì52 to Arkansas, meaning that the winner would have control of the SEC West. Alabama struck first with an Adam Griffith field goal and a 3‚Äì0 lead. After a punt, Derrick Henry had a 40-yard run to the LSU. He plunged in on the next play, and Alabama led 10‚Äì0. LSU struck back when QB Brandon Harris found wide receiver Travin Dural for a 40-yard TD to cut the Bama lead to 10‚Äì7. After a punt, LSU kicker Trent Domingue nailed a 39 yarder to tie the game 10‚Äì10. Adam Griffith then kicked a career long 55 yard field- goal, and Bama led 13‚Äì10 at the half. To open the 3rd quarter, Harris threw an interception to Dillon Lee. Henry then ran for a score to put Bama up 20‚Äì10. After 3 punts, Henry ran for a 7-yard TD for a 27‚Äì10 lead for Alabama. LSU never recovered. They had 2 field goals in the 4th quarter, but Bama won convincingly 30‚Äì16. Spectator picture of Alabama vs LSU on November 9, 2019 In 2019, the two teams met for their second Game of the Century of the decade as #1 LSU faced off against #2 Alabama. The game featured the top two NFL quarterback prospects and Heisman Trophy candidates at the time in Alabama's Tua Tagovailoa and LSU's Joe Burrow. Although the matchup was fairly even in the first quarter, the Tigers never trailed over the course of the game and outscored Alabama 23‚Äì6 in the second quarter to lead 33‚Äì13 at halftime. The Tide pulled within one score multiple times in the fourth quarter, but LSU's high scoring offense would prove to be too much for Alabama to overcome with the Tigers winning 46‚Äì41. The game snapped an eight-game losing streak in the series for LSU and virtually ensured both an SEC West title win and a College Football Playoff berth barring a total collapse. For Alabama, it set up the first time since the founding of the Playoff that they would not make an appearance. The 46 points given up by the 'Bama defense was the most points scored in the Nick Saban era (later surpassed in the same season in the 2019 edition of the Iron Bowl) and the most given up by any Alabama team since October 25th, 2003 against Tennessee. The game was the most viewed match-up of the 2019 regular season by over four million viewers, it also topped all conference championship games by a significant margin.

The battle featured the most advanced warships of its day, including the Mexican steamer Guadalupe and the equally formidable Montezuma which engaged a squadron of vessels from the Republic of Yucatan and the Republic of Texas. The latter force consisted of the Texas Navy flagship sloop-of-war Austin, commanded by Commodore Edwin Ward Moore, the brig Wharton, and several schooners and five gunboats from the Republic of Yucat√°n, commanded by former Texas Navy Captain James D. Boylan. Texas had declared its independence in 1836 but by 1843 Mexico had refused to recognize it. In Yucat√°n, a similar rebellion had begun and was fought off-and-on from 1836 to 1846. The battle ended in a combined Yucatecan and Texan victory.Jordan, Jonathan W., Lone Star Navy: Texas, the Fight for the Gulf of Mexico, and the Shaping of the American West (Potomac Books 2007) A scene from this battle is engraved on the cylinder of every Colt 1851 Navy and 1861 Navy revolver. Background Commodore Edwin Ward Moore had been waging a campaign against Mexican interests in the Gulf and disrupting commerce, because it was thought the Mexican army was planning an amphibious assault on Texas in order to recapture the province. Moore could only fully refit and rearm his ships by expending his own funds when he put in at New Orleans. The government of Texas refused him more funds and Sam Houston ordered him back to Texas so the fleet could be sold. The fleet, upon being put up for auction in Galveston, was not sold at that time because the citizens of Galveston rioted, thereby preventing the auction. Moore disregarded Houston's orders, and allied himself with the government of the Republic of Yucatan, which was then under siege from the central Mexican government. Yucatan paid Texas $8,000 a month for the services of the Texas Navy. Moore, now fully funded, sailed to lift the Mexican naval blockade of the port of Campeche. Battle The brig Wharton depicted on Texan currency. The battle began on April 30, and involved the Texas-Yucatan force that had been attacking and clearing the Gulf of Mexico of Mexican merchant and fishing boats, against a small Mexican squadron which consisted of sailing ships and a small steamer, the Regenerator. The initial battle lasted a few hours and was a draw, as both sides retired. After rearming, the Texan ships, including the 600 ton flagship Austin, on May 16 encountered a much stronger Mexican squadron, which included the modern 878 ton iron-hulled (not \\"ironclad\\") paddle frigate Montezuma and the wooden paddle frigate Montezuma, each armed with two 68-pounder Paixhans guns able to fire exploding shells, commanded by British officers and manned by British and Mexican seamen.

Her deck is lined with figures front and aft. One of her two 68-pounder Pivot Guns is visible in her stern. Seagulls effortlessly skim the choppy waves, lending a lively atmosphere to the portrait. After three hours of broadsides, the battle was essentially a draw, with both sides again withdrawing after sustaining considerable damage and casualties. The Texas ships suffered some physical damage, but the Mexican and British sailors suffered many more casualties of both dead and wounded. The Mexican steamship Regenerator and its battered attendant squadron rejoined the Guadalupe and the Moctezuma flotilla about May 19, and withdrew from the area, and the Texas squadron retired to Galveston. They were acclaimed as heroes on their return, even though Texas President Sam Houston had declared Commodore Moore and the ships' captains and crew pirates for sailing against his wishes. However, after a court martial, Commodore Moore was acquitted of all piracy charges. Having fought the ironclad Mexican steamships essentially to a draw using only wooden sailing ships was an achievement for Commodore Moore, the Naval Battle of Campeche becoming the only naval battle in world history in which sailing ships held their own against steam-powered ships in combat. The battle scene was memorialized by Samuel Colt in an engraving on the cylinder of the famed 1851 and 1861 Colt Navy Revolvers and the Colt 1860 Army Revolver. This was in expression of gratitude to Commodore Moore who in 1837 had purchased Colt Paterson Revolvers for the Republic of Texas Navy. By the time of the Battle of Campeche, however, Colt's enterprise was bankrupt. He would make a comeback in 1847 when under Colonel John C. Hays he was rescued from oblivion and put back to work making guns the Texas Rangers would use in the Mexican War.

Goulding attended St Paul's School in London and later studied Literae Humaniores at Magdalen College, Oxford.  Career  = HM Diplomatic Service = Goulding entered HM Diplomatic Service in 1959 and was, in 1961, posted to the British Embassy in Kuwait. He returned to the United Kingdom in 1964, where he worked in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. In 1968, he was once more posted overseas, as the Head of Chancery of the British Embassy in Tripoli, Libya, and later of the Embassy in Cairo, Egypt. Goulding spent the following few years in the UK, working first in the Foreign Office as Private Secretary to three Ministers of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs ‚Äì including Roy Hattersley and Julian Amery, Baron Amery of Lustleigh ‚Äì and then in the Cabinet Office. He was posted to the British Embassy in Lisbon, Portugal, in 1977, and to the United Kingdom Mission to the United Nations in New York City in 1979. In 1983, he was appointed Ambassador for the United Kingdom to Angola and S√£o Tom√© and Pr√≠ncipe, and served in this capacity until 1985. = United Nations = On 1 January 1986, Goulding became Under-Secretary-General (USG) of the United Nations for Special Political Affairs, serving under Secretary-General Javier P√©rez de Cu√©llar. From then until March 1993, he headed peacekeeping operations for the UN, and presided over the creation of the Department of Peacekeeping Operations in 1992, during the term of Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali. According to Simon Chesterman of the New York University School of Law, the period of Goulding's service as head of UN peacekeeping ‚Äì which saw the initiation of sixteen new missions ‚Äì \\"may come to be regarded as its heyday\\". In March 1993, Goulding became USG for Political Affairs. During his tenure at the UN, which ended in July 1997 during the first term of Secretary- General Kofi Annan, he was \\"effectively the second most powerful man in the UN\\". = St Antony's College, Oxford = Goulding became Warden of St Antony's College at the University of Oxford on 1 October 1997, having been appointed in November of the previous year. He held this position until his retirement on 30 September 2006.  Post-UN political activities  Goulding was one of 52 former British diplomats who, in 2004, signed a letter criticising British policy in the Middle East. While the government discounted the criticisms raised in the letter, Goulding suggested that the opinions expressed therein were also held by current employees of the Foreign Office. He had also, on a separate occasion, called for the withdrawal of American military forces from Iraq and the transfer of authority over security operations to a UN-sanctioned multinational force from Arab and Muslim countries.  Publications  Goulding was the author of Peacemonger (2003), an account of the inner workings of the United Nations and its activities during his tenure. He has also published articles in various academic journals, including African Affairs and International Affairs. Goulding was a recipient of the Duke of Westminster's Medal for Military Literature, awarded by the Royal United Services Institute for authorship of books that make \\"a notable and original contribution to the study of international and national security and defence\\".

The road takes a sharp turn west with an intersection with KY 467 in DeMossville. The road then heads in a western/northwestern direction, up to Walton, where it meets KY 14\\\\. Having picked up the name Madison Pike at the Kenton County line several miles south of KY 14, it heads north toward Independence.

KY 17 was rerouted to the south of downtown Independence.

It is located in what is now part of the Shimizu-ku ward of Shizuoka, Shizuoka Prefecture, Japan. It is one of four former post stations located in Shimizu-ku. History The original Kanbara- juku was decimated by a flood in the early part of the Edo period, but was rebuilt shortly thereafter.Kanbara-juku ~ Yui-shuku. Accessed November 5, 2007. The classic ukiyo-e print by And≈ç Hiroshige (H≈çeid≈ç edition) from 1831‚Äì1834, depicts a mountain village at nightfall, through which three people are struggling under deep snow. It is a rather strange composition, as Kanbara is located in a very temperate area warmed by the Kuroshio current offshore, and even a light snowfall is extremely rare. In Japan (as everywhere), many villages in different parts of the country have the same name. Hiroshige intended his print to represent the Kanbara which was the 15th post station on the Tokaido Road, which ran from Edo and Kyoto. But in creating his portfolio The 53 stations of the Tokaido Road, apparently he often relied on existing prints and guidebooks.

History China‚ÄìZimbabwe relations date back to January 1979, during the Rhodesian Bush War. The Soviet Union supported Joshua Nkomo's Zimbabwe African People's Union, and supplied them with arms; Robert Mugabe's attempts to gain Soviet support for his Zimbabwe African National Union were rebuffed, leading him to enter into relations with Soviet rival Beijing, culminating in a January 1979 meeting in Mozambique in which both sides affirmed their intent to cooperate more closely. The two countries formally established diplomatic relations on 18 April 1980, the day of Zimbabwe's independence. Two months later, Zimbabwe's foreign minister Simon Muzenda visited Beijing to express his thanks; he was followed by Zimbabwean president Robert Mugabe himself the next year. Mugabe placed great importance on Zimbabwe's relations with China, especially after the 2003 standoff with the European Union resulted in capital flight and economic depression. Ties have deepened inline with Zimbabwe's political isolation from the European Union; China has been described as the \\"only major international supporter\\" of Zimbabwe, due to their principle of non-interference in internal affairs such as human rights issues. However, there are increasing signs that China remain apprehensive about their relations with Zimbabwe and prefer to concentrate their political capital on countries with oil reserves. Chinese president Hu Jintao did not visit Zimbabwe on his February 2007 tour of southern Africa, though his schedule took him to a number of countries near Zimbabwe, including Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, and Zambia. A delegation of Chinese businessmen did visit Zimbabwe around that time; however, the Zimbabwe Tourism Authority put up signs with messages in Korean to welcome them. Spokesmen stated that they would hire Chinese translators in the future to avoid such errors. The Zimbabwean side are also ambivalent about the increasing Chinese influence on the economy; Zimbabweans have complained about the low quality of Chinese goods, including buses. Nyasha Chikwinya, a spokeswoman for Zanu PF Women's League, asserted that the Chinese had become the most active group in the non-official exchange of foreign currency, ahead of Nigerians and Indians, and called for those who \\"fueled the foreign currency black market\\" to be arrested. Robberies aimed at Chinese businessmen are on the rise. The 2017 coup in Zimbabwe deposed Mugabe. The new provisional President Emmerson Mnangagwa is thought to have a close, if challenging, relationship with China. Political ties Zimbabwe's \\"Look East\\" policy, which aimed to expand bilateral and trade relations and offer priority to investors from not just China but Malaysia, Singapore, Vietnam, Japan, South Korea, India, and Russia, has focused increasingly on China, to the exclusion of other countries. It is reported by Forum on Africa-China Cooperation that Mugabe's visit in 2006 is his 11th time visiting China. There are no reported official visits to China by Mugabe in 2008 and 2009. The 12th and 13th visits happened in 2010 and 2011. Mugabe also visited China in August 2014. The People Republic of China's (PRC) stated foreign policy of non-intervention in the internal affairs of countries has made them a popular foreign policy partner in Harare. Human rights In June 2020, Zimbabwe was one of 53 countries that backed the Hong Kong national security law at the United Nations. Economic ties China has become the biggest buyer of Zimbabwean tobacco, purchasing over 13,000 tonnes of tobacco between January and October 2007. The Zimbabwean trade deficit with China amounted to US$189 million in the first half of 2007; Zimbabwe exported US$16 million of goods to China. The Zimbabwean government also purchases large amounts of military hardware from China, including a US$13 million radar system, six Hongdu JL-8 jet aircraft, twelve JF-17 Thunder fighter aircraft, and 100 military vehicles since June 2004. The national airline Air Zimbabwe have also increased their recruitment of Chinese-speaking flight attendants and training of existing flight attendants in the Chinese language, and Zimbabwe, since having been added to China's official list of approved tourism destinations, aims to expand the number of Chinese tourists from 10,000 to 25,000. Trade is often conducted on barter terms due to Zimbabwe's shortage of hard currency. China are especially interested in Zimbabwe's supply of platinum. In November 2007 the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe bought agricultural equipment from several countries, but mostly from the PRC, and distributed the materials through the Agricultural Mechanization Program. Zimbabwe's Road Motor Services, a subsidiary of the National Railways of Zimbabwe, purchased 97 trucks from the Camco International, a Chinese manufacturing company, on December 30. The trucks consist of 68 North Benz tractor trucks, 16 North Benz delivery trucks, eight triaxle tipper trailers and five fuel tankers, each type of varying carrying capacity. This shipment is expected to replace the trucks currently used by RMS. RMS previously purchased trucks from Camco in February 2006. Acting President Joseph Msika praised the Chinese government for its continued support in the face of economic sanctions imposed by Western nations. In 2015, China accounted for the largest share of foreign direct investment into Zimbabwe by far (74%). Chinese development finance to Zimbabwe From 2000 to 2012, there are approximately 128 Chinese official development finance projects identified in Zimbabwe through various media reports. These projects range from a loan of US$670 million to expand a hydroelectric dam on Lake Kariba,Strange, Parks, Tierney, Fuchs, Dreher, and Ramachandran, China‚Äôs Development Finance to Africa: A Media-Based Approach to Data Collection. to a US$500 million deal to finance Zimbabwe's local cotton production,Strange, Parks, Tierney, Fuchs, Dreher, and Ramachandran, China‚Äôs Development Finance to Africa: A Media-Based Approach to Data Collection or a loan agreement for the provision of agricultural machinery to Zimbabwean farmers.Strange, Parks, Tierney, Fuchs, Dreher, and Ramachandran, China‚Äôs Development Finance to Africa: A Media-Based Approach to Data Collection In 2016 the PRC forgave US$40 million in debt. Culture ties On January 6, 2010, the Chinese government announced plans to award scholarships to 32 students from Zimbabwe to study in China. The scholarship program was announced by the Chinese Ambassador to Zimbabwe, Xin Shunkang.Strange, Parks, Tierney, Fuchs, Dreher, and Ramachandran, China‚Äôs Development Finance to Africa: A Media-Based Approach to Data Collection Although originally Chinese firms were exempt from Zimbabwe's indigenisation laws they have increasingly come under pressure by 2016 to grant at least 51 percent ownership in local ventures to black Zimbabweans in accordance with indigenisation policies. The South African-based Institute for Security Studies believes that under the leadership of President Xi Jinping the PRC's relationship with Zimbabwe has become more distant due to concerns over the long term stability of ZANU-PF rule.

Korat Thai people call themselves Thai Boeng ( ; also spelled or Tai Beung), Thai Doeng ( ; Tai Derng, Tai Deung), or Thai Khorat. Other tribes in northern Thailand also refer to them by those names. Theories of the origin of the name Thai Boeng are: #Boeng means 'some' or 'few'. Thai Khorat people lived in three major kingdoms: central Thai kingdoms (Ayutthaya, Thonburi, and Bangkok), Lao Kingdom, and Cambodia Kingdom. People who live in the Khorat area are of different origin‚Äîe.g., Thai, Lao, Khmer, Kui‚Äîand blended their cultures and beliefs together into their own culture. # It may be from their commonly used word, boeng is a word unique to the Thai Khorat people, and it is frequently used in their conversation. Thai Khorat people have their own traditions and cultures called Khorat culture, which is similar to the culture of Thai people on the central plain, but their own unique words, dialect, costumes, songs, and beliefs are different from the rest of the Tai-speaking peoples. In spite of their Isan domicile, populated by northeast Thai speakers, the Khorat Thai speak Central Thai. Their fluency in the official Thai language means has meant that the group does not appear on official lists of ethnic groups in Thailand. The group was however acknowledged in Thailand's 2011 report to the UN Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination. Population In 1999, Joachim Schliesinger estimated the number of Khorat Thai living in Thailand at 10,000. According to the Christian missionary Joshua Project, the population mainly inhabits two villages, Ban Nung Thap Prang and Ban Nong Samrong, both in the Chok Chai District about 20 kilometres (12 miles) south of the provincial capital. About 4,000 Khorat Thai live in each village. A few thousand Khorat Thai live in smaller villages in and around Nakhon Ratchasima City. Thailand's 2011 report to the UN Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination estimated the number of Thai Korat at 600,000, based on the 2005 Ethnolinguistic Maps of Thailand. In addition to Nakhon Ratchasima Province, Thai Khorat also inhabit adjacent provinces: # Nakhon Ratchasima Province: all districts, except for the northern part, e.g., Non Sung District, Bua Yai District. # Saraburi Province: Wang Muang District # Lopburi Province: Phatthana Nikhom District, Chai Badan District, Khok Samrong District and Sa Bot District # Phetchabun Province: Si Thep District and Wichian Buri District # Chaiyaphum Province: Chatturat District and Bamnet Narong District # Buriram Province: Mueang Buriram District, Nang Rong District, Lahan Sai District, Nong Ki District, Chamni District and Lam Plai Mat District History The Khorat Thai can be traced back at least to the late-18th century, when King Narai of the Ayutthaya Kingdom ordered a new city built as the eastern fortress of his kingdom. This was the origin of Nakhon Ratchasima city. The city thus marked the boundary between Ayutthaya and the Lao regions. The Khorat Thai are closely related to the Thai people. Some claim they are descended from Thai soldiers who married Khmer women, though evidence proving this is lacking.

The experiments were sponsored both by the sugar industry and the dentist community, in an effort to determine whether carbohydrates affected the formation of cavities. The experiments provided extensive knowledge about dental health and resulted in enough empirical data to link the intake of sugar to dental caries. However, today they are considered to have violated the principles of medical ethics.  History  The National Dental Service in Sweden was started in 1938. The dental health in Sweden at that time was not well observed, and cases of cavities were widespread. It was suspected that diets rich in sugar caused tooth decay, but there was no scientific proof. In 1945 the then-Medical Board commissioned a study. This was the start of the Vipeholm experiments. Vipeholm, outside Lund, was the country‚Äôs largest facility for \\"uneducable retards\\" and was chosen to be the site of the largest experiment ever run on humans in Sweden at that time. Up until 1947, Vipeholm employees had also been part of the experiment, but this was stopped, since it was soon found that there was no way of monitoring their intake of sweets. What began in 1945 as government-sanctioned vitamin trials were converted in 1947 without the knowledge of the government. The researchers decided, in consultation with the Medical Board, to start to use sugar instead, to encourage tooth decay by using an extremely sweet and sticky diet. From 1947-1949, a group of mental patients were used as subjects in a full-scale experiment designed to bring about tooth decay. They were fed copious amounts of sweets, some which was not available commercially but specially formulated toffee to make it stick better to teeth, which resulted in many of them having their teeth completely ruined. Nonetheless, the researchers felt that, scientifically speaking, the experiment was a huge success. The sugar experiment lasted for two years. In 1949, the trials were revised again, now to test a more \\"normal\\" carbohydrate- rich diet. By then, the teeth of about fifty of the 660 subjects in the experiment had been completely ruined. One of the practical results of the study was the recommendation that it was better for children's teeth to eat sweets once per week, compared to a smaller total amount spread out over most of the week. This practice established itself in Swedish society, and still today many parents only allow their children sweets, or l√∂rdagsgodis, on a Saturday.  Delayed results  The confectionery industry donated huge sums of money and tons of chocolates and caramels to fund the experiments. Because the experiments had shown a clear link between sugar intake and dental caries, the industry was not pleased with the results, and the researchers delayed their publication. When the study was finally made public in 1953, a critical debate arose about why they had been held back for so long. The scientists were accused of having been bought by the industry. However, at the time there was not any public debate about the ethics of the experiments themselves. Modern attitudes in the dental profession are very different: a participant in the Vipeholm Study, B. Krasse, writes \\"It is obvious that a research ethics committee would not accept a project like the Vipeholm Study today.\\" He explains \\"The need for the study was obvious to us as dentists\\" and states that the Swedish Parliament and then the news media debated the ethics of the study as early as 1953.  Revelations  It was not until the 1990s that studies appeared about the ethical aspects of the Vipeholm experiments.Petersson B (1993). The mentally retarded as research subjects. A research ethics study of the Vipeholm investigations of 1945-1955. In: Studies in Research Ethics. No. 3. Hallberg M, editor. G√∂teborg: Centre for Research Ethics, pp. 1-32. In 2000, the Swedish ombudsman for the disabled reported that the \\"excesses\\" of the study were not justified by the results. Elin Bommenel, a historian and doctoral student at Link√∂ping University, performed a thorough study of the Vipeholm experiments in her dissertation, published in 2006.Sugar experiments of mental patients, Innovations Report 2006-03-31 She was the first researcher to gain access to the original documents from the experimental period at Vipeholm. Her research describes how the scientists found themselves caught between the divergent goals of research and patient care as well as being under immense pressure from both political and economic interests.

Background and description The Japanese called these ships Kaib≈çkan, \\"ocean defence ships\\", (Kai = sea, ocean, Bo = defence, Kan = ship), to denote a multi-purpose vessel. They were initially intended for patrol and fishery protection, minesweeping and as convoy escorts. The ships measured overall, with a beam of and a draft of .Chesneau, p. 205 They displaced at standard load and at deep load. The ships had two diesel engines, each driving one propeller shaft, which were rated at a total of for a speed of . The ships had a range of at a speed of .Jentschura, Jung & Mickel, p. 186 The main armament of the Shimushu class consisted of three Type 3 guns in single mounts, one superfiring pair aft and one mount forward of the superstructure. They were built with four Type 96 anti-aircraft guns in two twin-gun mounts, but the total was increased to 15 guns by August 1943. A dozen depth charges were stowed aboard initially, but this was doubled in May 1942 when their minesweeping gear was removed. The anti-submarine weaponry later rose to 60 depth charges with a Type 97 trench mortar and six depth charge throwers. Construction and career Shimushu participated in the landings in Thailand, escorting the 55th IJA Infantry Division to landings at Nakhon on 8 December 1941. She also escorted various other invasion convoys to Malaya, Sumatra, and Palembang. Using her sonar, she located the British battlecruiser on 29 January 1942, being the first ship to locate the submerged wreck. Shimushu participated in the HI-40 convoy disaster of 19‚Äì24 February 1944, in which all six oilers that were escorted by her ‚Äî and only her, as she was the lone escort vessel ‚Äî Nampo Maru were torpedoed and sunk by the American submarines and . After that convoy disaster, the Naval General staff discontinued assigning only one escort to convoys and organized larger convoys with more escorts. Shimushu participated in the TA No. 2 and 3, the Japanese effort to hold Leyte island, and claimed one of the five B-25 Mitchell medium bombers lost in the first wave. On 25 November, Shimushu was torpedoed by the submarine and lost her bow, and was repaired by 20 January 1945. The ship spent more than a year on repatriation duty and was ceded to the Soviet Union on 5 July 1947. The ship served in the Soviet Pacific Ocean Fleet as patrol ship EK-31 (1947), dispatch ship PS-25 (1948), repair ship PM-74 (1957). She was decommissioned on 16 May 1959 and scrapped.

The first missionaries were two Germans, Reverend Friedrich Hagenauer and Reverend F.W. Spieseke (c. 1821‚Äì1877). In 1861 the Victorian Colonial Government gazetted as a reserve for the Ebenezer Mission Station. The mission was established a few years after the failure of the Moravian Lake Boga mission in Wemba-Wemba territory. Horatio Cockburn Ellerman, an early settler who established Antwerp Station, suggested the site where the mission station was established rather than the three sites suggested by the Government. The site selected was known as \\"Banji bunag\\", and had traditional meaning for the Wotjobaluk, being a corroboree ground according to elder Uncle Jack Kennedy, and also contained the grave for an Aboriginal woman shot dead, the mother of William Wimmera.Robert Kenny, pg 134-145, The Lamb Enters the Dreaming - Nathaniel Pepper and the Ruptured World, Scribe Publications, Melbourne, 2007.

In 1902 the State Government of Victoria decided to close the Ebenezer Mission due to low numbers. The mission closed in 1904, and most of the land was handed back to the Victorian Lands Department and made available for selection in 1905. In the following twenty years, many Wergaia people were forcibly moved to Lake Tyers Mission in Gippsland under police escort, along with closure of all rations to Ebenezer Mission and seizure of children.

The castle is situated on the edge of the town of Tizac-Curton, which takes its name from the first Seigneurs (lords) of Curton.  History  The earliest member of the Curton family documented in official texts is Raimond de Curton appearing in the 11th century,1, Grand Cartulaire de La Sauve Majeure, C. Higounet, no 26 appearing as a Lord from the beginning of the 12th century. From the end of the 12th century, Regin de Curton made ties with the English Royal Family, signing a treaty in London.3, Histoire de Libourne et des autres villages et bourgs de son arrondissement, Raymon Guinodie In the 13th century, the Curton Castle and its Lord, Amanieu de Curton appear in the records.4, Gallia Christiana = During the Hundred Years' War = At the beginning of the Hundred Years' War, Edward III of England asked Arnaud, Lord of Curton, to remain loyal to him and defend Guyenna against the French attacks. As a reward, he granted him jurisdiction over the four parishes around Ch√¢teau de Curton, Daignac, Espiet, Gr√©zillac and Tizac de Curton. Later, two descendants of the Lord of Curton became famous during the war, Petiton de Curton who was a knight, and Sennebrun de Curton who fought along Edward, the Black Prince. At the beginning of the 15th century, some sources state that the Lords of Curton went to England and are related to the present Cureton Family. The Ch√¢teau de Curton became the property of Louis de Beaumont before being captured by the French and was given to Jacques de Chabannes, Lord of Lapalice, who died in his new castle after becoming wounded at the Battle of Castillon. = French Revolution = Ch√¢teau de Curton remained the property of the Family Chabannes de Lapalice. In 1563, Curton Castle was made a marquisat for Fran√ßois de Chabannes. The castle was confiscated during the French Revolution and sold as national property to Citizen Rabeau. From this time, it was passed on through successive sales and weddings. =Present= Since 1926, Ch√¢teau de Curton has been registered as a French National Monuments. It is a private property. Although there are no organized tour for visitors, the castle, a self-catering apartment is equipped inside the castle and available for guest rental.  Winery  There are several types of wine produced, namely a Bordeaux Red wine AOC special vintage matured in oak barrel, a Bordeaux Red wine AOC, a Bordeaux Clairet AOC and a White wine. The vineyard area, located across the villages of Daignac, Grezillac, Guillac and Lugaignac, consists of 42 hectares, of which 33 hectares are dedicated to red wine production, with the grape varieties of 85% Merlot, 10% Cabernet Sauvignon, and 5% Cabernet Franc. 9 hectares dedicated to white wine consist of 94% S√©millon, 5% Sauvignon blanc and 1% Muscadelle.

Rhetorical stance would then be the position of a speaker or writer in relation to audience, topic, and situational context. \\"Rhetorical Stance\\" involves taking a position, and effectively developing an argument in favor of that position, in order to persuade an audience. This article describes the importance of the Author/Speaker, Audience, Context, and Purpose to one another in an attempt to convince or persuade said audience, using the tools of the rhetorical triangle and tetrahedron to help simplify the abstract idea of rhetorical stance. Purpose Most scholars agree that the persona, audience, and context of a rhetorical piece are all interrelated. It is also accepted by rhetorical scholars that the use of these concepts can help an author to determine which arguments and rhetorical tropes are appropriate to use in the piece that they are composing. According to James Golden, Goodwin Berquist, and William Coleman, authors and speakers can use only the arguments and communication skills available to them to convey their purpose. Aristotle argues that the arguments available for any given topic are specific to that particular rhetorical situation. Lloyd Blitzer contends that the availability of arguments depends on the relationships between author, audience, context, and purpose. For example, some communicators may decide to include or exclude certain points from their argument or will adjust their tone in relation to which audience they may be addressing. Many scholars agree that the utilization of rhetorical stance can help to better the argument presented, leading to a better rhetorical piece.  Author/Speaker  Wayne Booth described rhetoric as \\"the art of persuasion.‚Äù According to Booth, an effective author or speaker of rhetorical stance balances three essential elements within their rhetoric: speaker, argument, and audience. A speaker accomplishes this balance by using proper voice that implies character, as well as explicitly stating all pertinent arguments about the subject matter, and by taking into account the audience's distinct characteristics and personality traits. Booth goes on to say that a creator who ignores the relationship between them and their audience, and whose argument is based solely on the information they are putting out about their subject, \\"will produce the kind of essay that soils our scholarly journals, written not for readers but for bibliographies.\\"  Context  Authors position themselves in relation to their audience based on the relevant inter-relational contextual elements that affect the communicative situation. Brian Street argues for a broad definition of \\"context\\" to include \\"conceptual systems, political structures, economic processes, and so on, rather than simply a 'network' or 'interaction.'\\" Stephen Levinson has narrower definition, which limits relevant contextual elements to immediate and observable events. Neither of these views are wrong, as context is important to rhetorical stance because it carries information from outside the direct situation or work that can help elaborate the meaning behind it. Some examples of worldly \\"context\\" that could influence an author/speaker are: current affairs/politics, natural disasters, religious/social standards, or war.  The Rhetorical Triangle & Tetrahedron  Rhetorical Triangle Aristotle established the classic triad of ethos, pathos and logos (the Aristotelian triad of appeals) that serves as the foundation of the rhetorical triangle. The rhetorical triangle has evolved from its original, sophistic model into what rhetorician, Sharon Crowley, describes as the \\"postmodern\\" rhetorical triangle, the rhetorical tetrahedron. The expanded rhetorical triangle now emphasizes context by integrating situational elements. The original version includes only 3 points: the writer/speaker (ethos), the audience (pathos), and the message itself (logos), as shown in the bottom image to the right. The \\"Ethos\\" section represents the creator and any aspects that influence their work. The \\"Pathos\\" section is who the creator will be putting their point across to. The \\"Logos\\" section represents what the creator makes, such as their claims and information. All of these 3 points affect one another, as shown in the simpler image. The rhetorical tetrahedron, on the other hand, carries those 3 points, along with adding context into the picture, as shown in the top image to the right. Simply put, context can help explain the \\"why\\" and \\"how\\" something is written by introducing the setting in which it was created. As seen in the more complex image, a tetrahedron is a triangular pyramid, and the rhetorical tetrahedron adds another dimension of detail to the situation or work. Audience According to Aristotle as well as 20th-century rhetoricians such as Golden, Berquist, and Coleman, experienced rhetors begin their process of adopting rhetorical stance with an analysis of the audience. Professional authors and speakers utilize their knowledge of the subject and establish credibility to help influence how well their message is received. Scottish Enlightenment rhetorician, George Campbell touches on this matter by explaining how one can gain power over and appeal to their audience by applying argumentative and emotional tones. Aristotle emphasizes the consideration of human nature and emotion in order to achieve a successful understanding of one‚Äôs audience and the establishment of the relationship necessary for achieving persuasion. According to Kenneth Burke, the author creates this impression by demonstrating an understanding of the audience‚Äôs needs and by ‚Äúsubstantiating‚Äù intellectual and empathetic relationships between oneself and the audience. Following Aristotle‚Äôs theory, Cicero explains that by adapting to the emotions of the audience, one can be successful in gaining their respect and attention. Plato‚Äôs ‚Äúnoble aims‚Äù of rhetoric require the author to strive for a moral elevation of both author and audience. In Academic Communities In academia, several courses offered at institutions incorporate rhetorical stance. Speech and English departments, especially, have implemented this tactic in their educational plans. In speech classes, rhetorical stance is used when the speaker, the student presenting, is addressing the audience, his/her classmates. According to Ross Winterowd, speakers and authors adjust their rhetorical stance to accommodate a particular audience. When the speaker is talking, they alter their rhetorical stance and use various techniques for different audiences based on the particular situation. There are several ways that a speaker or writer can make their audience feel a connection or relation to them. Speakers use anchorage and relay to appeal to their audience. Anchorage uses images to assist the speaker/author get specific points across, while relay uses moving images, such as videos, comic strips, etc. to do the same. A particular pronoun can make the audience feel either included or excluded. If the author says, for example, ‚ÄúAll of us Europeans are well traveled,‚Äù it implies that all of ‚Äúus‚Äù Europeans agree with the fact that \\"we\\" are well traveled. However, if a non- European reads this or listens to it in a speech, they will not feel a connection to the speaker or author, making them feel very antagonistic.  In Non-Academic Communities  An author or speaker takes a rhetorical stance in all communications, not only public address, formal argument, or academic essays. Although one finds the bulk of the discussion on rhetorical stance in academia, myriad ‚Äúother-than-academic communities,‚Äù such as business, the law, journalism /media, religious institutions, and politics, utilize and discuss theories of rhetorical stance.

The gene is also referred to as proto-oncogene B-Raf and v-Raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B, while the protein is more formally known as serine/threonine- protein kinase B-Raf. The B-Raf protein is involved in sending signals inside cells which are involved in directing cell growth. In 2002, it was shown to be faulty (mutated) in some human cancers. Certain other inherited BRAF mutations cause birth defects. Drugs that treat cancers driven by BRAF mutations have been developed. Two of these drugs, vemurafenib and dabrafenib are approved by FDA for treatment of late-stage melanoma. Vemurafenib was the first approved drug to come out of fragment-based drug discovery.  Function  Overview of signal transduction pathways involved in apoptosis. The role of Raf proteins like B-Raf is indicated in the center.B-Raf is a member of the Raf kinase family of growth signal transduction protein kinases. This protein plays a role in regulating the MAP kinase/ERKs signaling pathway, which affects cell division, differentiation, and secretion.  Structure  B-Raf is a 766-amino acid, regulated signal transduction serine/threonine-specific protein kinase. Broadly speaking, it is composed of three conserved domains characteristic of the Raf kinase family: conserved region 1 (CR1), a Ras-GTP-binding self- regulatory domain, conserved region 2 (CR2), a serine-rich hinge region, and conserved region 3 (CR3), a catalytic protein kinase domain that phosphorylates a consensus sequence on protein substrates. In its active conformation, B-Raf forms dimers via hydrogen-bonding and electrostatic interactions of its kinase domains. = CR1 = Conserved region 1 autoinhibits B-Raf's kinase domain (CR3) so that B-Raf signaling is regulated rather than constitutive. Residues 155‚Äì227 make up the Ras-binding domain (RBD), which binds to Ras-GTP's effector domain to release CR1 and halt kinase inhibition. Residues 234‚Äì280 comprise a phorbol ester/DAG-binding zinc finger motif that participates in B-Raf membrane docking after Ras-binding. = CR2 = Conserved Region 2 (CR2) provides a flexible linker that connects CR1 and CR3 and acts as a hinge. = CR3 = Figure 1: Inactive conformation of B-Raf kinase (CR3) domain. P-Loop (orange) hydrophobic interactions with activation loop (gray) residues that stabilize the inactive kinase conformation are shown with sticks. F595 (red) blocks the hydrophobic pocket where the ATP adenine binds (yellow). D576 (orange) is shown as part of the catalytic loop (magenta). Figure modified from PDB id 1UWH. Conserved Region 3 (CR3), residues 457‚Äì717, makes up B-Raf's enzymatic kinase domain. This largely conserved structure is bi-lobal, connected by a short hinge region. The smaller N-lobe (residues 457‚Äì530) is primarily responsible for ATP binding while the larger C-lobe (residues 535‚Äì717) binds substrate proteins. The active site is the cleft between the two lobes, and the catalytic Asp576 residue is located on the C-lobe, facing the inside of this cleft.  Subregions  P-Loop The P-loop of B-Raf (residues 464‚Äì471) stabilizes the non-transferable phosphate groups of ATP during enzyme ATP-binding. Specifically, S467, F468, and G469 backbone amides hydrogen-bond to the Œ≤-phosphate of ATP to anchor the molecule. B-Raf functional motifs have been determined by analyzing the homology of PKA analyzed by Hanks and Hunter to the B-Raf kinase domain. Nucleotide-Binding Pocket V471, C532, W531, T529, L514, and A481 form a hydrophobic pocket within which the adenine of ATP is anchored through Van der Waals attractions upon ATP binding. Catalytic Loop Residues 574‚Äì581 compose a section of the kinase domain responsible for supporting the transfer of the Œ≥-phosphate of ATP to B-Raf's protein substrate. In particular, D576 acts as a proton acceptor to activate the nucleophilic hydroxyl oxygen on substrate serine or threonine residues, allowing the phosphate transfer reaction to occur mediated by base-catalysis. DFG Motif D594, F595, and G596 compose a motif central to B-Raf's function in both its inactive and active state. In the inactive state, F595 occupies the nucleotide-binding pocket, prohibiting ATP from entering and decreasing the likelihood of enzyme catalysis. In the active state, D594 chelates the divalent magnesium cation that stabilizes the Œ≤- and Œ≥-phosphate groups of ATP, orienting the Œ≥-phosphate for transfer. Activation Loop Residues 596‚Äì600 form strong hydrophobic interactions with the P-loop in the inactive conformation of the kinase, locking the kinase in its inactive state until the activation loop is phosphorylated, destabilizing these interactions with the presence of negative charge. This triggers the shift to the active state of the kinase. Specifically, L597 and V600 of the activation loop interact with G466, F468, and V471 of the P-loop to keep the kinase domain inactive until it is phosphorylated.  Enzymology  B-Raf is a serine/threonine-specific protein kinase. As such, it catalyzes the phosphorylation of serine and threonine residues in a consensus sequence on target proteins by ATP, yielding ADP and a phosphorylated protein as products. Since it is a highly regulated signal transduction kinase, B-Raf must first bind Ras-GTP before becoming active as an enzyme. Once B-Raf is activated, a conserved protein kinase catalytic core phosphorylates protein substrates by promoting the nucleophilic attack of the activated substrate serine or threonine hydroxyl oxygen atom on the Œ≥-phosphate group of ATP through bimolecular nucleophilic substitution. = Activation =  Relieving CR1 autoinhibition  The kinase (CR3) domain of human Raf kinases is inhibited by two mechanisms: autoinhibition by its own regulatory Ras-GTP-binding CR1 domain and a lack of post-translational phosphorylation of key serine and tyrosine residues (S338 and Y341 for c-Raf) in the CR2 hinge region. During B-Raf activation, the protein's autoinhibitory CR1 domain first binds Ras-GTP's effector domain to the CR1 Ras-binding domain (RBD) to release the kinase CR3 domain like other members of the human Raf kinase family. The CR1-Ras interaction is later strengthened through the binding of the cysteine-rich subdomain (CRD) of CR1 to Ras and membrane phospholipids. Unlike A-Raf and C-Raf, which must be phosphorylated on hydroxyl-containing CR2 residues before fully releasing CR1 to become active, B-Raf is constituitively phosphorylated on CR2 S445. This allows the negatively charged phosphoserine to immediately repel CR1 through steric and electrostatic interactions once the regulatory domain is unbound, freeing the CR3 kinase domain to interact with substrate proteins.  CR3 domain activation  After the autoinhibitory CR1 regulatory domain is released, B-Raf's CR3 kinase domain must change to its ATP-binding active conformer before it can catalyze protein phosphorylation. In the inactive conformation, F595 of the DFG motif blocks the hydrophobic adenine binding pocket while activation loop residues form hydrophobic interactions with the P-loop, stopping ATP from accessing its binding site. When the activation loop is phosphorylated, the negative charge of the phosphate is unstable in the hydrophobic environment of the P-loop. As a result, the activation loop changes conformation, stretching out across the C-lobe of the kinase domain. In this process, it forms stabilizing Œ≤-sheet interactions with the Œ≤6 strand. Meanwhile, the phosphorylated residue approaches K507, forming a stabilizing salt bridge to lock the activation loop into place. The DFG motif changes conformation with the activation loop, causing F595 to move out of the adenine nucleotide binding site and into a hydrophobic pocket bordered by the Œ±C and Œ±E helices. Together, DFG and activation loop movement upon phosphorylation open the ATP binding site. Since all other substrate-binding and catalytic domains are already in place, phosphorylation of the activation loop alone activates B-Raf's kinase domain through a chain reaction that essentially removes a lid from an otherwise-prepared active site. = Mechanism of catalysis = Figure 2: Base-catalyzed nucleophilic attack of a serine/threonine substrate residue on the Œ≥-phosphate group of ATP. Step 1: chelation of secondary magnesium ion by N581 and deprotonation of substrate Ser/Thr by D576. Step 2: nucleophilic attack of activated substrate hydroxyl on ATP Œ≥-phosphate. Step 3: magnesium complex breaks down and D576 deprotonates. Step 4: release of products. To effectively catalyze protein phosphorylation via the bimolecular substitution of serine and threonine residues with ADP as a leaving group, B-Raf must first bind ATP and then stabilize the transition state as the Œ≥-phosphate of ATP is transferred.  ATP binding  B-Raf binds ATP by anchoring the adenine nucleotide in a nonpolar pocket (yellow, Figure 1) and orienting the molecule through hydrogen-bonding and electrostatic interactions with phosphate groups. In addition to the P-loop and DFG motif phosphate binding described above, K483 and E501 play key roles in stabilizing non-transferable phosphate groups. The positive charge on the primary amine of K483 allows it to stabilize the negative charge on ATP Œ±- and Œ≤-phosphate groups when ATP binds. When ATP is not present, the negative charge of the E501 carboxyl group balances this charge.  Phosphorylation  Once ATP is bound to the B-Raf kinase domain, D576 of the catalytic loop activates a substrate hydroxyl group, increasing its nucleophilicity to kinetically drive the phosphorylation reaction while other catalytic loop residues stabilize the transition state.(Figure 2). N581 chelates the divalent magnesium cation associated with ATP to help orient the molecule for optimal substitution. K578 neutralizes the negative charge on the Œ≥-phosphate group of ATP so that the activated ser/thr substrate residue won't experience as much electron-electron repulsion when attacking the phosphate. After the phosphate group is transferred, ADP and the new phosphoprotein are released. = Inhibitors = Since constitutively active B-Raf mutants commonly cause cancer (see Clinical Significance) by excessively signaling cells to grow, inhibitors of B-Raf have been developed for both the inactive and active conformations of the kinase domain as cancer therapeutic candidates.  Sorafenib  Figure 3: B-Raf kinase domain locked in the inactive conformation by bound BAY43-9006. Hydrophobic interactions anchor BAY43-9006 in the ATP binding site while urea group hydrogen-bonding traps D594 of the DFG motif. The BAY43-9006 trifluoromethyl phenyl ring further prohibits DFG motif and activation loop movement to the active confermer via steric blockage. BAY43-9006 (Sorafenib, Nexavar) is a V600E mutant B-Raf and C-Raf inhibitor approved by the FDA for the treatment of primary liver and kidney cancer. Bay43-9006 disables the B-Raf kinase domain by locking the enzyme in its inactive form. The inhibitor accomplishes this by blocking the ATP binding pocket through high-affinity for the kinase domain. It then binds key activation loop and DFG motif residues to stop the movement of the activation loop and DFG motif to the active conformation. Finally, a trifluoromethyl phenyl moiety sterically blocks the DFG motif and activation loop active conformation site, making it impossible for the kinase domain to shift conformation to become active. The distal pyridyl ring of BAY43-9006 anchors in the hydrophobic nucleotide-binding pocket of the kinase N-lobe, interacting with W531, F583, and F595. The hydrophobic interactions with catalytic loop F583 and DFG motif F595 stabilize the inactive conformation of these structures, decreasing the likelihood of enzyme activation. Further hydrophobic interaction of K483, L514, and T529 with the center phenyl ring increase the affinity of the kinase domain for the inhibitor. Hydrophobic interaction of F595 with the center ring as well decreases the energetic favorability of a DFG conformation switch further. Finally, polar interactions of BAY43-9006 with the kinase domain continue this trend of increasing enzyme affinity for the inhibitor and stabilizing DFG residues in the inactive conformation. E501 and C532 hydrogen bond the urea and pyridyl groups of the inhibitor respectively while the urea carbonyl accepts a hydrogen bond from D594's backbone amide nitrogen to lock the DFG motif in place. The trifluoromethyl phenyl moiety cements the thermodynamic favorability of the inactive conformation when the kinase domain is bound to BAY43-9006 by sterically blocking the hydrophobic pocket between the Œ±C and Œ±E helices that the DFG motif and activation loop would inhabit upon shifting to their locations in the active conformation of the protein.  Vemurafenib  Figure 4: Structures of Vemurafenib (right) and its precursor, PLX 4720 (left), two inhibitors of the active conformation of the B-Raf kinase domain PLX4032 (Vemurafenib) is a V600 mutant B-Raf inhibitor approved by the FDA for the treatment of late-stage melanoma. Unlike BAY43-9006, which inhibits the inactive form of the kinase domain, Vemurafenib inhibits the active \\"DFG-in\\" form of the kinase, firmly anchoring itself in the ATP-binding site. By inhibiting only the active form of the kinase, Vemurafenib selectively inhibits the proliferation of cells with unregulated B-Raf, normally those that cause cancer. Since Vemurafenib only differs from its precursor, PLX4720, in a phenyl ring added for pharmacokinetic reasons, PLX4720's mode of action is equivalent to Vemurafenib's. PLX4720 has good affinity for the ATP binding site partially because its anchor region, a 7-azaindole bicyclic, only differs from the natural adenine that occupies the site in two places where nitrogen atoms have been replaced by carbon. This enables strong intermolecular interactions like N7 hydrogen bonding to C532 and N1 hydrogen bonding to Q530 to be preserved. Excellent fit within the ATP-binding hydrophobic pocket (C532, W531, T529, L514, A481) increases binding affinity as well. Ketone linker hydrogen bonding to water and difluoro-phenyl fit in a second hydrophobic pocket (A481, V482, K483, V471, I527, T529, L514, and F583) contribute to the exceptionally high binding affinity overall. Selective binding to active Raf is accomplished by the terminal propyl group that binds to a Raf-selective pocket created by a shift of the Œ±C helix. Selectivity for the active conformation of the kinase is further increased by a pH-sensitive deprotonated sulfonamide group that is stabilized by hydrogen bonding with the backbone peptide NH of D594 in the active state. In the inactive state, the inhibitor's sulfonamide group interacts with the backbone carbonyl of that residue instead, creating repulsion. Thus, Vemurafenib binds preferentially to the active state of B-Raf's kinase domain.  Clinical significance  Mutations in the BRAF gene can cause disease in two ways. First, mutations can be inherited and cause birth defects. Second, mutations can appear later in life and cause cancer, as an oncogene. Inherited mutations in this gene cause cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome, a disease characterized by heart defects, mental retardation and a distinctive facial appearance. Mutations in this gene have been found in cancers, including non-Hodgkin lymphoma, colorectal cancer, malignant melanoma, papillary thyroid carcinoma, non-small-cell lung carcinoma, adenocarcinoma of the lung, brain tumors including glioblastoma and pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma as well as inflammatory diseases like Erdheim- Chester disease. The V600E mutation of the BRAF gene has been associated with hairy cell leukemia in numerous studies and has been suggested for use in screening for Lynch syndrome to reduce the number of patients undergoing unnecessary MLH1 sequencing. = Mutants = More than 30 mutations of the BRAF gene associated with human cancers have been identified. The frequency of BRAF mutations varies widely in human cancers, from more than 80% in melanomas and nevi, to as little as 0‚Äì18% in other tumors, such as 1‚Äì3% in lung cancers and 5% in colorectal cancer. In 90% of the cases, thymine is substituted with adenine at nucleotide 1799. This leads to valine (V) being substituted for by glutamate (E) at codon 600 (now referred to as V600E) in the activation segment that has been found in human cancers. This mutation has been widely observed in papillary thyroid carcinoma, colorectal cancer, melanoma and non- small-cell lung cancer. BRAF-V600E mutation are present in 57% of Langerhans cell histiocytosis patients. The V600E mutation is a likely driver mutation in 100% of cases of hairy cell leukaemia. High frequency of BRAF V600E mutations have been detected in ameloblastoma, a benign but locally infiltrative odontogenic neoplasm. The V600E mutation may also be linked, as a single- driver mutation (a genetic 'smoking gun') to certain cases of papillary craniopharyngioma development. Other mutations which have been found are R461I, I462S, G463E, G463V, G465A, G465E, G465V, G468A, G468E, N580S, E585K, D593V, F594L, G595R, L596V, T598I, V599D, V599E, V599K, V599R, V600K, A727V, etc. and most of these mutations are clustered to two regions: the glycine- rich P loop of the N lobe and the activation segment and flanking regions. These mutations change the activation segment from inactive state to active state, for example in the previous cited paper it has been reported that the aliphatic side chain of Val599 interacts with the phenyl ring of Phe467 in the P loop. Replacing the medium-sized hydrophobic Val side chain with a larger and charged residue as found in human cancer(Glu, Asp, Lys, or Arg) would be expected to destabilize the interactions that maintain the DFG motif in an inactive conformation, so flipping the activation segment into the active position. Depending on the type of mutation the kinase activity towards MEK may also vary. Most of the mutants stimulate enhanced B-Raf kinase activity toward MEK. However, a few mutants act through a different mechanism because although their activity toward MEK is reduced, they adopt a conformation that activates wild-type C-RAF, which then signals to ERK.  BRAF-V600E  * BRAF V600E is a determinant of sensitivity to proteasome inhibitors. Vulnerability to proteasome inhibitors is dependent on persistent BRAF signaling, because BRAF-V600E blockade by PLX4720 reversed sensitivity to carfilzomib in BRAF-mutant colorectal cancer cells. Proteasome inhibition might represent a valuable targeting strategy in BRAF V600E-mutant colorectal tumors. = BRAF inhibitors = As mentioned above, some pharmaceutical firms are developing specific inhibitors of mutated B-raf protein for anticancer use because BRAF is a well-understood, high yield target. Vemurafenib (RG7204 or PLX4032) was licensed by the US Food and Drug Administration as Zelboraf for the treatment of metastatic melanoma in August 2011 based on Phase III clinical data. Improved survival was seen, as well as a response rate to treatment of 53%, compared to from 7-12% with the former best chemotherapeutic treatment, dacarbazine. In clinical trials, B-Raf increased metastatic melanoma patient chance of survival. In spite of the drug's high efficacy, 20% of tumors still develop resistance to the treatment. In mice, 20% of tumors become resistant after 56 days. While the mechanisms of this resistance are still disputed, some hypotheses include the overexpression of B-Raf to compensate for high concentrations of Vemurafenib and upstream upregulation of growth signaling. More general B-Raf inhibitors include GDC-0879, PLX-4720, Sorafenib, dabrafenib and LGX818  Interactions  BRAF (gene) has been shown to interact with: * AKT1, * C-Raf, * HRAS, and * YWHAB.

They are often identified as Kiwiana.  History  Charles Diver's original recipe The Regina Confectionery Company in Oamaru first introduced pineapple chunks around 1952‚Äì54. Charles Diver, the confectionery chief and floor production-manager at Regina who would later formulate other classic Kiwi sweets, had the task of using up waste product from other lollies of the time. One sweet in particular ‚Äî an early version of the chocolate fish with a pineapple-flavoured marshmallow middle ‚Äî resulted in the most marshmallow left over, which Diver used to create pineapple chunks. The product's name was changed to pineapple lumps by Regina in the early 1960s to give it a more catchy name. Cadbury obtained the pineapple lumps name and began manufacturing and selling them under its Pascall brand. In 1995, Regina was bought by Nestl√© NZ which shut down the Oamaru factory in 2001. Innovex Holdings purchased the factory from Nestl√©, and in June 2001, established Rainbow Confectionery. Rainbow sells pineapple chunks under its own brand and, in 2013, it also released pineapple chunks based on a slightly-modified version of Diver's original recipe under the Regina brand. Pascall's Pineapple Lumps were the last product manufactured at the Cadbury factory in Dunedin until its closure by Mondelez International in March 2018. Since the sale of all New Zealand- made stock, all Pascall Pineapple Lumps sold in New Zealand have been imported from Australia.  Related products  , Pams markets a product similar to pineapple chunks using the name \\"Pineapple Bites\\". In 2013, Fonterra released a limited edition Pineapple Lumps-flavoured milk in New Zealand after signing a licensing deal with Cadbury In 2017, Jaffas Lumps were released in New Zealand by Cadbury for a limited time. In 2019, Cadbury produced a fusion between Perky Nana bars and Pineapple Lumps called Perky Nana Lumps which were released as a limited edition product in New Zealand. In 2019, Cadbury released a limited edition Dairy Milk chocolate block with Pascall Pineapple Lumps inside. Released initially in New Zealand, it was later also released in Australia. In 2020, Cadbury produced a limited edition mashup of Snifters and Pineapple Lumps, known as Snifters Lumps.

He was notable for his role in the development of the Brazilian Traction, Light and Power Company Limited (later Brascan Limited, then amalgamated into Brookfield Asset Management) and for his links with the \\"Peterborough Methodist Mafia\\" of George Albertus Cox. Life and career Wood was born in Peterborough, Ontario, to a Northern Irish father (John W. Wood) and a Scottish mother (Jane Porter). He married Agnes Euphemia Smart in Toronto on July 18, 1891. They had a son, William (nicknamed Wy ‚Äì died at six months), and a daughter, Mildred. In his early teens, Wood joined the Great North Western Telegraph Company owned by Peterborough's mayor, George Albertus Cox (later a member of the Senate of Canada). After completing school, Wood joined Cox's financial firm, the Central Canada Loan & Savings Company. In 1898, both men incorporated the National Trust Company in Toronto. National Trust became part of the Bank of Nova Scotia as Scotia Trust in 1997. In 1901, Cox and Wood formed Dominion Securities (now part of the Royal Bank of Canada) with the purpose of underwriting and retailing provincial, municipal, and utility bonds. In 1902, Wood shifted Dominion Securities into industrial finance by financing Dominion Iron & Steel and Dominion Coal. In 1910, he formed Dominion Steel Corporation, where his younger brother Frank Porter Wood was a President. He was at that time a leading financier and also became active in philanthropy, as well as in volunteer endeavours for the University of Toronto, Toronto General Hospital, Art Gallery of Ontario and the YMCA. Wood family residences Wymilwood, now Falconer Hall Glendon Hall, the final residence of Edward Wood The home of Frank P. Wood on Bayview Avenue, north of Glendon Hall Edward and Euphemia \\"Pheme\\" Wood built and lived in Wymilwood (named for their children, Wy and Mildred) at 84 Queen's Park from 1902 to 1924. They donated Wymilwood, an Elizabethan style mansion now called Falconer Hall, to the University of Toronto, and it is now part of the University of Toronto Faculty of Law. From 1920 to 1924, they planned, built and moved to Glendon Hall on Bayview Avenue. Wood's younger brother Frank P. Wood and his wife Emma later built an estate nearby that is now occupied by Crescent School. In 1950, by then a widow, Pheme Wood died and bequeathed Glendon Hall to the University of Toronto, with the intent that it be used by the Department of Botany for a university (not a public) botanical garden. Following ten years of mixed academic use, the university turned over the estate in 1961 to its newly created affiliate, York University. Edward Wood died in Toronto in 1941. He and his wife are buried in Mount Pleasant Cemetery, Toronto, adjacent to the grave of George Albertus Cox. References Court, John P.M.

The terms slow-motion discoFrom the name of a 2006 compilation by DJ Mooner, Elaste Vol. 1: Slow Motion Disco, released on the Compost Records label. and Elettronica MeccanicaCampbell 2006. Elettronica Meccanica is the name of a series of mixtapes and planned records by DJ Beppe Loda, and in the interview, he says ‚ÄúHere are some of the artists and styles I like best: ‚Ä¶Conrad Schnitzler; Meccanica Popular (the latter two inspiring my Elettronica Meccanica style)‚Ä¶‚Äù are also associated with the genre. Italian DJs Beppe Loda and Daniele Baldelli both independently claim to have invented the genre and mixing style. Descriptions The Afro/cosmic mixing style is freeform in that it allows for short hip-hop style transforms as well as long, beat-matched segues; it sometimes incorporates added percussion and effects; and it permits major speed variations to force songs into a 90‚Äì110 BPM range.Wang. ‚ÄúThe tempo is often between 105 and 110 bpm.‚ÄùWang. (Baldelli:) ‚Äú‚Ä¶the music was very slow. I mean, in that period, the music was like 90‚Äì105 bpm.‚Äù Baldelli would also play 45 RPM records at 33 and vice versa. The cosmic sound included a very diverse range of musical styles, from electro and funk to jazz fusion and Brazilian music. Peter Shapiro described Baldelli's music as a \\"combination of spaced-out rock and tribal percussion.\\" One genre that was usually not part of this mix was Italo disco, which Baldelli believes was generally too mainstream and commercial. In a 2005 feature on Daniele Baldelli, one of the style's founding DJs, music journalist Daniel Wang describes Baldelli's style as ‚Äúpsychedelic, churning, hypnotic.‚Äù In the interview, Baldelli emphasizes playing diverse selections of classical, African and Brazilian folk, and synth-pop at improper speeds, mixed with effects and drum machines: Cosmic music has been cited as a \\"touchstone\\" for contemporary \\"space disco\\" artists like Lindstr√∏m collaborator Prins Thomas and Andy Meecham of Chicken Lips. It has also been cited as an influence on some later Italian house songs, such as Sue√±o Latino. Etymology \\"Cosmic\\", \\"cosmic disco\\", or \\"the cosmic sound\\" derives from Cosmic Club; referring to the sound of that venue.Campbell. (Loda:) ‚ÄúIn Italy, until 1982, people used to define music by the club‚Äôs name: Typhoon sound (Beppe Loda), Les Pois sound (Daniele Mix), Chicago sound (Ebreo, Fari and Spranga), Cosmic sound (Daniele Baldelli and TBC), Les Cigales sound (Meo, Rubens, Daniele Mix and Joele), Arena sound (DJ Lollo), and so on.‚Äù As such, the term is principally associated with Baldelli, who makes a claim to its invention.Wang. (Baldelli:) ‚ÄúFrom 1980‚Äì84 ‚Ä¶ My passion and instinct for music drove me to create a sound ‚Äî some people have called it ‚Äòafro‚Äô music, but this term is incorrect. It‚Äôs better to call it the Cosmic Sound, ‚Äî that is what they say now ‚Äî the sound that Daniele Baldelli created in the Cosmic Disco.‚Äù \\"Afro\\" is Loda‚Äôs term for 1. his selections from African-influenced disco, soul, funk and jazz fusion genres; 2. his selections of alternative and experimental dance music that typically comprised the first hour of his sets; 3. his general mixing style; and 4. a 1982‚Äì1984 series of his mixtapes. In recent interviews, he has suggested a preference for the term \\"freestyle\\" rather than Afro, and he makes a distinction between cosmic and his style, claiming that cosmic music is the sound of mid-1980s and later pretenders, is a misnomer popular only outside of Italy, and isn‚Äôt even a real genre.Ashton. (Loda:) ‚ÄúMost people around the world consider me a ‚Äòcosmic‚Äô DJ but this is not true. ‚ÄòCosmic‚Äô music is a kind of music and also a sort of German collective (founded by an Austrian DJ) with whom I have no connections. In fact, cosmic music doesn‚Äôt actually exist! Most people outside the Italian borders consider cosmic music a mixture of electronic/pop/progressive and new-wave which I played during the first hour at Typhoon club. It‚Äôs obviously also popular in the Cosmic Club itself. Personally, I think that this terminology is reductive and I don‚Äôt like it because the movement which also included cosmic was much wider and articulated and was more commonly known as ‚ÄòAfro‚Äô. This movement was based in the North of Italy in the Typhoon disco, a popular meeting point for many DJs and a starting point for new kinds of music, at least until 1987‚Ä¶‚ÄùCampbell. (Loda:) ‚ÄúI think the term cosmic music (often used outside of Italy) is not the most accurate way to define the melange of electronic/new wave/prog/pop that was very popular here in the 80‚Äôs (and which I played a lot at cosmic and during the first hour of my sets).‚ÄùTantum. ‚ÄúThe Afro sound is sometimes lumped in with the similar ‚Äòcosmic disco‚Äô, another wide-ranging sonic cioppino that was centered around Lazise, Italy‚Äôs Cosmic Club in the same era, championed by DJs such as Daniele Baldelli and Stefano Secchi. But Loda disavows any connection (even though he briefly played at Cosmic), or that cosmic even ranks as a genre. ‚ÄòI say that the so-called cosmic style doesn‚Äôt exist at all,‚Äô he claims. ‚ÄòIt‚Äôs just a completely wrong designation, mainly used outside Italy, to indicate that mix of electronica, new wave, pop and progressive that I used to play at Cosmic.‚Äô‚Äù Baldelli claims that during his military service around 1984, there was a ‚Äúguest‚Äù DJ who became famous playing Baldelli‚Äôs selections at Cosmic Club.Wang. (Baldelli:) ‚ÄúWell, at first I was the sole resident DJ, and only after 2 years did we have to bring in another person, because I had military service. But people know that this guy ‚Äî let‚Äôs call him Tibicci ‚Äî just played records which I chose for him. I don‚Äôt know why ‚Äî well, because I would spend all day in the shop looking for music, stay at home listening to records, and then in the evening I would say to him, you can play this, this record will work for you. He also got a bit famous from doing this, but now, I no longer have any connection with this person. He‚Äôs not really a good friend anymore.‚Äù Baldelli's prot√©g√©, Claudio ‚ÄòTBC‚Äô Tosi Brandi, performed at Cosmic Club around that time, as did Beppe Loda. Loda counters that no one person invented the genre and style of mixing; he says he coined the term Afro in 1979 to collectively refer to the eclectic, African-influenced music that he and other Northern Italian DJs were playing at the time,Campbell. (Loda:) ‚Äú‚Ä¶each of us would lean more in one direction: towards electronic music, jazz, funk, Brazilian music, African music, reggae, etc. No one had yet defined what we were doing as a group, though. I ‚Ä¶ developed an interest in African/tribal music. I was very impressed by a mixed (European/African) group of percussionists I saw in Amsterdam. I also noticed the ‚ÄúAfro‚Äù hair salons in the Pigalle neighborhood of Paris. Many of us loved and played a lot of afrobeat (Fela, Dibango, Olatunji) and I realized, when you think about it, almost all the music we were playing had African roots. People kept asking me, ‚ÄòWhat do you call this melting pot of music?‚Äô I connected the dots and my Afro series of mix tapes was born. So you see, no one DJ can claim to be the originator of the Afro style. It is the result of the ideas and efforts of a group of DJs. I can only claim to have contributed my part and a general term to define it. My new style of DJing was born at Le Cupole in 1979 and, yes, it was a mix of different styles, but it was not the Afro style as a whole.‚Äù and later applied it to the integration of Baldelli‚Äôs electronic style with his own.Campbell. (Loda:) ‚ÄúMy short residence at Cosmic would be crucial to what people now call Cosmic music. It was at that time that Baldelli‚Äôs electronic style melded with my own Afro style ‚Äî a term I came up with before Typhoon while playing at Le Cupole in Manerbio.‚ÄùNishimura. (Loda:) ‚ÄúBy 1979, I had started a weird mix of musical genres at Le cupole discotheque at Manerbio and proceeded with such musical proposals at Bisbi and Good Moon ‚Ä¶ I kept these same vibes at ‚ÄòTyphoon‚Äô thereby improving both the proposal and the techniques, and in 1982, ‚ÄòAfro‚Äô music got to ‚Ä¶ success thanks in the beginning, also to a series of my tapes known of course as ‚ÄòAfro‚Äô. The term ‚ÄòAfro‚Äô was born out of the need to define with a single keyword, the mix of various alternative musical genres the other DJs and I used to play in that period. ‚ÄòAfro‚Äô is therefore a container holding various alternative musical genres and which well identifies the DJ‚Äôs mixed style.‚Äù The liner notes of a mid-2000s Cosmic Club tribute album featuring Baldelli uses both Afro and cosmic in reference to the music. ‚ÄúAll of the trend setters of the Peninsula booked a Saturday evening at Cosmic, anxious to participate and listen to that musical phenomenon labelled ‚ÄòAfro‚Äô. Naturally, even if it is still used today, this term was inappropriate, unless one considers Afro as the only root which influenced the various musical styles of Daniele Baldelli. In fact, even if various periods in the history of ‚Äòcosmic‚Äô can be distinguished (that of funky‚Äìdisco in the first year to that of electronic in 1980‚Äì82, followed by moments more influenced by reggae, fusion, jazz and Brazil), [here the author clearly borrows one of Baldelli's quotes from the Wang interview] Daniele Baldelli‚Äôs Afro style was expressed when he played Ravel‚Äôs bolero overlapping it with a track by Africa Djola, or an experimental piece by Steve Reich on which he would mix a Malinke chant from New Guinea. Mixing the T-Connection with Moebius and Rodelius, discovering in the album Izitso the only hypnotic- tribal track by Cat Stevens, extracting Africa from Depeche Mode by playing them at 33 rpm or vice versa by creating music using a Reggae voice played at 45 rpm. Mixing 20 or so African tracks on the same electronic drum pattern or by playing them together in batucada with Kraftwerk, using the same electronic effects of a synthesiser to overlap pieces by Miram Makeba, Jorge Ben or Fela Kuti and also by uniting the Indian melodies of Ofra Haza or Sheila Chandra with the German electronic sounds of SKY RECORD.‚Äù The term \\"afro-cosmic\\" was also used by one music journalist in 2006 to describe the late-1960s/early-1970s music of saxophonist Pharoah Sanders. Regional variations and gatherings In 1983, after hearing the music in Italy, Austrian DJ Enne and Stefan \\"Cosmic-Dieter-Bohlen\\" Egger brought it to the club Galaxy in Innsbruck, Austria, and at some point introduced it to German audiences while on tour. Beginning in 1987, Egger started mixing it with more straightforward, slightly faster (but still relatively slow) dance records of the day. His style, once dubbed \\"Eben cosmic music\\" by Hannes Alshut & Rob Neureiter, remains popular in Austria and Southern Germany to the present day.

IGFBP-3 is one of six IGF binding proteins (IGFBP-1 to IGFBP-6) that have highly conserved structures and bind the insulin-like growth factors IGF-1 and IGF-2 with high affinity. IGFBP-7, sometimes included in this family, shares neither the conserved structural features nor the high IGF affinity. Instead, IGFBP-7 binds IGF1R, which blocks IGF-1 and IGF-2 binding, resulting in apoptosis.  Function  IGFBP-3 was first isolated, characterized, and quantitated in human plasma, in 1986. It has well-documented functions in the circulation, in the extracellular environment, and inside cells. It is the main IGF transport protein in the bloodstream, where it carries the growth factors predominantly in stable complexes that contain the binding protein, either IGF-1 or IGF-2, and a third protein called the acid-labile subunit or ALS. For IGFs to reach the tissues from the bloodstream, the circulating complexes are believed to partly dissociate, possibly enhanced by limited proteolysis of IGFBP-3. The IGF-1/IGFBP-3 ratio has sometimes been used as an index of IGF bioavailability in the human circulation, but this ignores IGF-1 binding to other IGFBPs (so the ratio is affected by the concentrations of all six IGFBPs), and the fact that IGF-2, which is three times more abundant than IGF-1 in the bloodstream of adults, occupies the majority of binding sites on circulating IGFBP-3. Within tissues, IGFBP-3 can bind IGF-1 and IGF-2 released by many cell types, and block their access to the IGF-1 receptor (IGF1R), which is activated by both IGFs. IGFBP-3 also interacts with cell-surface proteins, affecting cell signaling from outside the cell or after internalization, and also enters the cell nucleus where it binds to nuclear hormone receptors and other ligands. High levels of IGFBP-3 within tumors are associated with increased cancer severity (or worse outcome) for some cancers, but decreased severity or better outcome for others. No cases of IGFBP3 gene deletion in humans have been reported, but mice lacking the gene show near-normal growth.  Gene and protein structure  The IGFBP3 gene (or IBP3), on human chromosome 7, is organized into four protein-coding exons with a 5th exon in the 3‚Äô untranslated region. It is located adjacent to the IGFBP1 gene in tail-to-tail orientation, separated by 20 kb. The encoded protein includes a 27-residue signal peptide followed by the 264-residue mature protein. IGFBP-3 shares with the other five high-affinity IGFBPs and a 3-domain structure: # A conserved N-terminal domain containing a cysteine rich region (12 cysteine residues) with multiple intra-domain disulfide bonds, an IGFBP motif (GCGCCXXC), the primary site of IGF binding. # A highly variable central or linker domain (only 15% conservation between IGFBPs). # A conserved C-terminal domain containing secondary IGF binding residues, a cysteine rich region (6 cysteine residues), an 18 residue basic motif that binds heparin, the acid labile subunit (ALS), and a nuclear localization sequence. The linker domain is the site of most post-translational modification, which include glycosylation, phosphorylation, and limited proteolysis. By electrophoretic analysis IGFBP-3 appears as a doublet, owing to the occupancy of either two or three of its N-glycosylation sites by carbohydrate. Hypoglycosylated IGFBP-3 may be seen after extended glucose starvation. Many proteases are known to cleave IGFBP-3 at single linker-domain sites, and in the circulation of pregnant women, IGFBP-3 is entirely proteolyzed, yet still capable of carrying normal amounts of IGF-1 and IGF-2. Binding capacity appears to be retained after proteolysis because of a cooperative interaction between the two proteolyzed fragments, that together maintain an active IGF-binding site.  Sites and regulation of production  IGFBP-3 mRNA is expressed in all tissue examined, with kidney, stomach, placenta, uterus and liver showing highest expression in rat tissues. Rat liver IGFBP-3 mRNA is found in nonparenchymal cells including sinusoidal endothelium, but not in hepatocytes. In contrast, human hepatocytes do express IGFBP-3. IGFBP-3 levels in human serum are, like IGF-1, dependent on growth hormone (GH); for example, serum IGFBP-3 is increased in acromegaly and low in GH-deficient children. However, IGFBP-3 gene expression in human liver is GH- independent. Because it is stabilized in human serum by forming complexes with IGF-1 and ALS, which are both GH-dependent, serum IGFBP-3 also appears regulated by GH. Its production by some non-hepatic tissues may also be directly GH-regulated. Immunoassays for serum IGFBP-3 are often used as part of the diagnosis of childhood GH-deficiency. The most widely studied IGFBP3 polymorphism, at nucleotide-202 in the promoter region, is significantly associated with circulating IGFBP-3 levels, although the mechanism is unclear. In some studies circulating IGFBP-3 also appears to be nutritionally regulated, although this may not be seen at the mRNA level. IGFBP-3 has been identified in human lymph, nipple aspirate, milk, amniotic fluid, follicular fluid, seminal plasma, urine, peritoneal dialysate, synovial fluid, tear fluid, and cerebrospinal fluid, in addition to serum. Many factors increase IGFBP-3 production by cells, including transforming growth factor-Œ≤ (TGFŒ≤), tumor necrosis factor-Œ±, vitamin D, retinoic acid, IGF-1, and stimuli such as chemotherapy that activate the tumor suppressor p53. Estrogen inhibits IGFBP-3 production, and its tissue levels are lower in estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancers than in ER-negative cancers.  Interactions  The main IGFBP-3 ligands in the circulation are IGF-1 and IGF-2, and the acid-labile subunit (ALS). The serum proteins transferrin, fibronectin, and plasminogen are also known to bind IGFBP-3. In the cell and tissue environment many other interactions have been described (see Table). Two unrelated cell-surface proteins have been designated as IGFBP-3 receptors: low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1), also known as alpha-2-macroglobulin receptor or type V TGFŒ≤ receptor and the transmembrane protein TMEM219. Both are believed to mediate antiproliferative effects. Functional interactions with the EGF receptor and the type I/type II TGFŒ≤ receptor system have also been reported, and other cell-surface proteins such as proteoglycans also bind IGFBP-3. IGFBP-3 can enter cells by both clathrin-mediated and caveolin- mediated endocytosis. possibly involving the transferrin receptor. IGFBP-3 enters the cell nucleus by a mechanism that is incompletely understood, but involves its binding to importin-Œ≤. Within the nucleus, it can modulate nuclear hormone receptor activity by direct binding to retinoid X receptor, retinoic acid receptor, vitamin D receptor, PPARŒ≥, and nur77, IGFBP-3 also interacts with DNA-dependent protein kinase within the nucleus to promote the repair of DNA damage.  Cellular actions  IGFBP-3 exerts antiproliferative effects in many cell types by blocking the ability of IGF-1 and IGF-2 to activate the IGF1R (which stimulates cell proliferation). For example, in esophageal epithelial cells, responsiveness to IGF-1 stimulation is suppressed by secreted IGFBP-3 and restored when IGFBP-3 is downregulated by epidermal growth factor. IGFBP-3 can also inhibit cell function by mechanisms that are independent of effects on IGF1R signaling, even in cells that entirely lack IGF1R. IGF (or IGF1R) independent effects are commonly studied using mutant forms of IGFBP-3 with decreased IGF binding affinity. Thus, IGFBP-3-induced apoptosis in differentiating chondrocyte precursor cells is seen equally with a non-IGF binding IGFBP-3 mutant, demonstrating that the mechanism does not involve IGF binding. IGF1R-independent growth inhibition by IGFBP-3 may involve the induction of pro-apoptotic proteins such as Bax and Bad and may be mediated by ceramides (pro-apoptotic lipids), or potentiate ceramide action IGFBP-3 interaction with nuclear hormone receptors may also lead to inhibition of cell proliferation. Contrasting with the typical growth-inhibitory effects of IGFBP-3, stimulation of cell proliferation by IGFBP-3 has also been observed. This can occur either by enhancing IGF-stimulated proliferation or in the absence of IGF-1. In endothelial cells and mammary epithelial cells, the stimulatory effect of IGFBP-3 has been shown to involve activation of the enzyme sphingosine kinase, and generation of the bioactive lipid, sphingosine-1-phosphate, which promotes growth by transactivating the EGFR receptor.  Role in cancer  Based on cell growth experiments, animal cancer models, and epidemiological studies, it appears that IGFBP-3 functions as a low-penetrance tumor suppressor gene. Dysregulation of IGFBP-3 has been implicated in many cancers. IGFBP-3 is sometimes referred to as a tumor suppressor, and downregulation of its tissue expression by promoter hypermethylation in some cancers, such as hepatoma. and non-small cell lung cancer may be associated with poor patient outcome. However, consistent with the dual inhibitory and stimulatory roles of IGFBP-3 seen in cell culture, there are other cancer types, such as breast cancer, pancreatic cancer, and clear cell renal cell cancer in which high tissue IGFBP-3 expression has been linked to poor prognostic features or patient outcome. The mechanisms regulating these contrasting effects of IGFBP-3 in vivo are not well understood. Since IGFBP-3 is abundant in the bloodstream of healthy adults (typically 2‚Äì4 mg/L), and is largely stabilized by its complex formation with IGFs and ALS, it is unlikely that tumor-derived IGFBP-3 has a large influence on circulating levels. There have been many studies linking circulating IGFBP-3 levels to the presence, or risk, of various cancers, or to patient outcomes. but unequivocal conclusions have often been lacking. For example, high plasma IGFBP-3 levels were associated with a reduced prospective risk of colorectal cancer in women. but in a study including men and women, colon cancer risk was positively associated with plasma IGFBP-3, while there was no significant association for rectal cancer. A large systematic review concluded that circulating IGFBP-3 levels showed a modest association with increased risk for a number of cancers, but the results vary among sites. IGFBP-3 protein levels decrease during the progression of prostate cancer from benign to metastatic disease For IGFBP-3 it refers to although production of the protein does not cease completely. IGFBP-3 is still made (at a lower level) by prostate cancer cells and secreted into the surrounding environment. However, instead of the full length, functional protein, IGFBP-3 is found to be cleaved. This decreases the affinity of IGF binding to IGFBP-3, making the growth factors more likely to bind the IGF1R and promote cell survival.

Family and early life Wilmot was the second son of Robert Wilmot (1669‚Äì1738), of Osmaston Hall, near Derby, and his wife Ursula, who was the daughter of Sir Samuel Marow, Bt, of Berkswell, Warwickshire. His paternal grandfather was Sir Nicholas Wilmot (1611‚Äì1682), a serjeant-at-law knighted in 1674. His elder brother Robert (c.1708‚Äì1772) was another lawyer who went into the service of the crown, was knighted in 1739 and created a baronet (Wilmot of Osmaston) in 1772. John Eardley Wilmot was educated at Derby School, then with Dr John Hunter at Lichfield, where his contemporaries included Samuel Johnson and David Garrick. He then went to Westminster School and Trinity Hall, Cambridge, where he matriculated in 1727, before studying law in London at the Inner Temple, as his father and older brother had done before him, and was called to the bar in 1732. On 3 April 1743, Wilmot married Sarah Rivett (1721‚Äì1772), a daughter of Thomas Rivett of Derby, with whom he had three sons and two daughters. His eldest son, another Robert, died in Bengal, while his younger son, John Eardley Wilmot, became a barrister and wrote his father's memoirs.J. E. Wilmot, Memoirs of the life of the Right Honourable Sir John Eardley Wilmot (1802, 2nd edition 1811) One of his daughters, Maria, married the Jewish City of London banker Sampson Gideon, who changed his surname to Eardley and in 1789 became Sampson Eardley, 1st Baron Eardley.Lot 60: Benjamin West, Portrait of Sir Sampson Gideon, Bt., later Lord Eardley at invaluable.com (accessed 5 November 2007)Leigh Rayment's Peerage Page: Eames to Emly at angeltowns.com (accessed 5 November 2007) Another daughter Elizabeth married Thomas Blomefield, Inspector of Artillery and Superintendent of the Royal Brass Foundry on 27 July 1788. John Eardley Wilmot's grandson Sir John Eardley Eardley-Wilmot, 1st Baronet, (1783-1847), served as a member of parliament and as Lieutenant-Governor of Van Diemen's Land (or Tasmania), was created a baronet in 1821 and published An Abridgment of Blackstone's Commentaries (1822).John Eardley Eardley-Wilmot in Dictionary of Australian Biography online (accessed 5 November 2007) (This example of a judge having an eminent grandson \\"where the son is not eminent\\" was quoted by Francis Galton in his study of the hereditary genius in 1869, and he proposed that the odds on such an occurrence were thirty to one against.)Hereditary Genius by Francis Galton (1869), p. 86 (accessed 5 November 2007) Career Bartolozzi after Sir Joshua Reynolds As a young barrister, John Eardley Wilmot was taken up by Charles Talbot, 1st Baron Talbot, who was Lord Chancellor from 1733 to 1737, Philip Yorke, 1st Earl of Hardwicke, the next Lord Chancellor, 1737 to 1756, and Sir Dudley Ryder, an Attorney General and Lord Chief Justice. Bishop John Hough of Worcester wrote to Wilmot's aunt on 4 May 1737: He joined the Midland Circuit and was an advocate at the Derby Assizes. Dudley Ryder appointed Wilmot a junior counsel to the Treasury, and in 1753 he was offered promotion to King's Counsel and to serjeant-at-law, but declined and returned to Derbyshire. However, in February 1755 he accepted the appointment as a judge of the King's Bench and serjeant-at-law, and was knighted. In 1756, he became a Commissioner of the Great Seal and was proposed as Lord Chancellor, but said he didn't want it. On 15 March 1757, when he was holding the assizes at Worcester, he narrowly escaped death when the roof of the courthouse collapsed, killing several people and injuring many more.J. Noake, Notes and Queries for Worcestershire (Longman and Co., London 1856/OutlookVerlag GmbH, Frankfurt am Main 2018), p. 119 (Google). William Blackstone, author of the famous Commentaries on the Laws of England (four volumes, 1765‚Äì1769) was one of Wilmot's close friends. Blackstone wrote to him on 22 February 1766, after the publication of the first volume of the Commentaries: \\"Sir, Lord Mansfield did me the honour to inform me, that both you and himself had been so obliging as to mark out a few of the many errors, which I am sensible are to be met with in the Book which I lately published. Nothing can flatter me so much as that you have thought it worth the pains of such a revisal.\\" In August 1766, Wilmot became Chief Justice of the Common Pleas, and in September 1766 joined the Privy Council. In 1770, he again refused appointment as Lord Chancellor, and in January 1771 resigned as Chief Justice. In the aftermath of the American Revolutionary War, Wilmot was appointed as a royal commissioner to investigate claims by American Loyalists for compensation for the losses they had suffered as a result of the war.Benjamin West, John Galt, and the biography of 1816 by Susan Rather in The Art Bulletin, June 2004 (accessed 5 November 2007)Eardley-Wilmot, J.

He took part in and later led several expeditions, surveying and mapping the geology of Eastern Siberia. He was released from exile in 1875, and in 1876 took up the post of custodian in the Mineralogical Museum of the Academy of Sciences.  Biography  Aleksander Czekanowski was born on 12 February 1833 in Krzemieniec, Volhynia. His father Wawrzyniec ran a boarding house and was an honorary assistant in a zoological office at a high school. Shortly after the birth of Alexander, his family moved to Kiev. In 1850 Alexander began studying medicine at the Faculty of Medicine in Kiev. While there he also attended lectures on natural science and participated in local fieldtrips during which he developed a strong interest in geology. After receiving a doctor's diploma in 1855 but without a taste for medicine, the 25-year-old Czekanowski moved to Tartu to study mineralogy for two years. It was at this time that he joined the oldest student corporation Polonia. After graduating in 1857 he returned to Kiev where he started working at Siemens and Halske, which was at the time engaged in the construction of a telegraph line from Russia to India. The work was involved frequent trips which gave him the opportunity to conduct scientific research. In addition to his main work, he also systematised the paleontological collections of the University of Kiev. Shortly before the January Uprising, the elite of local Polish youth gathered in his apartment. Accused of participating in the uprising, Czekanowski was arrested and sentenced to indefinite exile in Siberia, whereupon he was sent on foot from Kiev to Tobolsk. Upon his arrival in Tobolsk, he was sent into exile in Tomsk where he contracted typhoid fever, the consequences of which were periodic mental disorders. After recovering a little from the disease, in 1866 he was exiled to Bratsk where he became interested in the local geology. He was then deported to near Chita, Zabaykalsky Krai in Transbaikalie west of Lake Baikal. During his deportation he began to collect and classify insects he found along the way using a magnifying glass made from a broken carafe. Transferred to the surroundings of Bratskii Ostrog on the Angara, he lived in misery for several years, but despite the harsh climate and hard work among the local peasants, he continued his scientific work provided the academic museums with natural history collections. He studied the geology of the region around Angara and made meteorological observations using instruments of his own design. At this time, the academician Fedor Bogdanovich Schmidt, an acquaintance from Tartu, who saved him from this difficult situation. Having had a business trip Academy of Sciences to Siberia, found out about the fate of Chekanovski in Irkutsk and informed prominent scientists in St Petersburg. He bought a collection from Czekanowski and ordered more, as well as providing him with books. After using all his influence for two years, he obtained from the authorities the release of Czekanowski, his transfer from Padun to Irkutsk, and assignment to the Siberian Department of the Russian Geographical Society. It was then that Czekanowski began exploring the southern part of Irkutsk Oblast. = Expeditions to Siberia (1869‚Äì1872) = From 1869 to 1875 he made several expeditions to Eastern Siberia. to study the geological structure of Irkutsk province. Between 1869‚Äì1871 Chekanovski conducted work on the study of Baikal Mountains and Siberian lands from Baikal to Yenisei and Sayan Mountains, and also studied Irkutsk province. In 1869, he defined the Primorsky Range (1728 m), which stretches along the western shore of Lake Baikal, as an independent morphographic unit. In 1871 together with Wiktor Godlewski and Benedykt Dybowski he explored the northern part of the shore of Lake Kh√∂vsg√∂l in Mongolia. His stay in Irkutsk was marked by a number of scientific discoveries that brought him the glory of ‚Äúone of the outstanding geologists of Russia‚Äù. Published in 1872, his monograph on the Irkutsk province was awarded a gold medal, and the collections collected in Ust-Baley formed the basis of the famous work on the Jurassic flora, written by professor Geer of the University of Zurich. = Research between the Yenisei River and the Lena River (1872‚Äì1875) = In 1872, Czekanowski proposed to the Geographical Society to explore the area between Yenisei and Lena, which at the time was still a \\"big white spot\\" in terms of hyrodgraphy and relief. The company commissioned him to lead a small research expedition lasting two years, to which Ferdinand Ferdinandovich Miller was appointed to its staff as astronomer and physicist. From 1872 to 1875, the two explored Central Siberian Plateau. The first expedition began in March 26 1873 when Czekanowski went from Irkutsk to the source of the Lena, where he studied the geological structure of the banks of the upper reaches of the Lena and Angara rivers. When the ice drift began on the Angara, physicist Miller and the Nakhalny topographer joined him from Irkutsk. May 12 the group moved in boats along the Angara River to the headwaters Lower Tunguska. Over the three summer months of 1873, travellers traced the entire course of the Lower Tunguska to its mouth, plotting it on a map and determining its length (2989 km). It was the second scientific expedition to the Lower Tunguska after Daniel Messerschmidt (1723). In September 1873, the expedition, having passed the Arctic Circle, reached the Yenisei and by November 5 had returned to Irkutsk. The main result of this expedition was the discovery of a huge trap cover (the Middle Siberian Traps), traced by him along the valley of the Lower Tunguska for over 1900 kilometers. In addition, Czekanowski's ‚ÄúAdditional information to the map of the Lower Tunguska River\\" for the first time described the territory along the river as a plateau ‚Äì a hill with characteristic table mountains. He had in fact made the scientific discovery of the Central Siberian Plateau and described the relief of its central part. A new second expedition was hastily prepared, which was to cross the Arctic Circle and conduct research to the still unknown river Olenek. On 25 December 1873 Czekanowski and Miller left Irkutsk with two local guides travelled to Dolna Tunguska and proceeded on to 63¬∫ N, before continuing north-northwest to reach the springs of the river Vilyuy (). The journey lasted two months, and finally, in April, the expedition reached the shores Syurungna (Vilyui). After several weeks of exploring the shores of Lake Yakongna, June 6 1874, the expedition reached a fairly significant river. Czekanowski, having decided that it was Olenek, however, the local Evenks explained that it was Moyero (the right tributary of the Kotuya from the Khatanga basin), and Olenek was located to the northeast. From Moyero, the two crossed the hill Bukochan that acts as a low watershed, and crossed to the Oleneok about 150 kilometres below the source, and in July began rafting down on the river on a raft. At the end of September they reached 70¬∫ 30\` N, and when the river froze they continued downstream with reindeer herds, crossing the Central Siberian Plateau in a northeast direction and reaching the river mouth in early November. Then they returned again to 70¬∫ 30\` N, ascend one of the right tributaries of Olenyok, crossed watershed and between Olenyok and Lena and descend on the latter to the village of Bulun. From there in Verkhoyansk they reached Yakutsk and in January 1875 returned to Irkutsk. Czekanowski established that there are no high mountains along Olenek, and according to his definition, the length of the river was about 2350 kilometres (according to the latest data ‚Äì 2292 kilometers). Miller was the first to measure the heights of Eastern Siberia. = Study of the Lena River (1875) = Organising his third Siberian expedition, A. L. Czekanowski intended to \\"go along the banks of the Lena to the mouth and, if possible, then go to the mouth of Olenka from the sea.\\" He hoped to have time to conduct geological exploration of the banks of the Lena River before the onset of winter, but a short summer frustrated his plans. From a barge Czekanowski conducted an investigation of the banks of the Lena from Yakutsk to Bulun exploring the Lena River at a distance of about 1,200 km, from Yakutsk to the mouth of its left tributary.. At first, the path ran along the deep and wide bay of the Ayakit River, and then along the rocky and mountainous watershed area lying between Lena and Olenek and descending along the Kelimyar River to Olenyok. In this way he discovered a hill, which was later named Chekanovski) at the suggestion of Edward Tol (350 km, 529 m). From Kelimyar he traced the course of Olenka to its mouth. August 26 from the top of Mount Karanchat they saw the ocean. September 18 the expedition was already in Bulun. Having safely crossed the frozen Lena. The expedition reached Verkhoyansk by reindeer from where they went through the mountains and tundra December 20 1875 and reached Irkutsk. Thus ended the three expeditions of A. L. Czekanowski, the zoological results of which were recognised as ‚Äúthe richest of all that have ever been undertaken in Siberia. The reports of the expedition, rich in content, being translated into different languages, became the property of science, and the maps compiled by him significantly changed and supplemented the map of Asian Russia. ‚Äù He wrote the first reliable data on the geology of this region (1873), the southern course of the Leno and the Oleniok region (1874‚Äì75). He also discovered coal and graphite deposits over the Lower Tunguzka River. = Final Years (1875‚Äì1876) = Upon his return from his last expedition, he received notice that he was amnestied, and returned to St Petersburg, to handle the processing of materials collected by him during the expeditions from the point of view of geography, geology and paleontology.. In the same year, he presented to the Academy of Sciences a project of an expedition in which he set out to geologically explore all the large Siberian rivers in the territory between the Yenisei, Lena, Anabar, Khatanga and Pyasina. However, the expedition's equipment required large sums of money, and the project of Czekanowski met with serious objections. This provoked an exacerbation of his mental disorder and on October 18 (30), 1876 Czekanowski committed suicide by taking a large dose of poison. His materials were not published until 1896 under the title ' Diary of the expedition on the rivers Nizhny Tunguska, Olenek and Lena in 1873 ‚Äì 1875 \\"\\" (St. Petersburg, 1896). His botanical and zoological collections have been the subject of studies by numerous scientists since. Awards and Honours In 1870 he received a gold medal from the Russian Geographical Society. He also received a medal in 1875 from the International Geographical Congress in Paris for his mapping of Eastern Siberia.

Tala railway station and Bagbazar railway station on Kolkata Circular Railway line are also located nearby. Economy =Gun and Shell Factory= The more than two centuries old Gun and Shell Factory at Cossipore is the oldest surviving factory in the Indian subcontinent. It was set up in 1802 and functions under the Ordnance Factories Board. Along with technological evolution, the plant has successfully altered its product mix to suit the requirements of changing times. The plant has recently undergone large scale modernisation. Its product-mix ranges from big barrel guns to small barrel pistols, different varieties of shells and fuses and civil trade items. It started off as Gun Carriage Agency, but after shifting of the agency first to Allahabad in 1814, and then to Fatehgarh in 1816, its importance was diminished. Finally in 1829, all the machines were shifted to Fatehgarh. However, it had the strength of springing back to life again and again. The vacant space was utilised for the much-needed expansion and renovation of the Gun Factory of Fort William. Besides casting of brass guns, it also took up manufacture of iron shot and shells. Around 1855, breech-loading steel rifled guns had got its way to the British arsenal, but the Cossipore plant was not properly equipped to undertake manufacturing of such guns. The mini-bullet factory was transferred to Dumdum. It had little work and there were suggestions for its closure but it survived. The rifled guns, imported from England, required new elongated shells. It was decided that Cossipore would be utilised for manufacturing of the new shells. It underwent some expansion and the name ‚ÄòGun Foundry‚Äô was changed to ‚ÄòFoundry and Shell Factory‚Äô in 1872. Along with the manufacturing of new elongated shell, there was requirement of undertaking manufacturing of modern fuses and cartridges to match the newly introduced breech-loading guns. So further expansion took place in 1887 and 1890. In 1892, steel was, for the first time cast in India, at Cossipore by a Siemen's Martin Open Hearth Plant. In 1896, a rolling mill was erected. However, the metallurgical units were shifted to Ishapore in 1903 as no further space for expansion was available at Cossipore. In 1890, a shop was erected for the manufacture and repair of fittings of imported breech-loading guns. The plant undertook the manufacture of quick-firing guns in 1905. With the return of the manufacturing of guns, the name of Cossipore unit got the present name of ‚ÄòGun and Shell Factory‚Äô in 1905. Cossipore Electric Generating Station New Cossipore Generating station started producing electric for CESC from the year 1949 and has current capacity of 100 MW. This is older and uses non Pulverized Fuel to generate electricity. This unit plays a major part creating an economic eco system in its own. There are a lot of people live in Cossipore who are part of that ecosystem. But in 2015 it was closed. Culture Cossipore Udyanbati The branch of the Ramakrishna Math at Cossipore is popular as Udyanbati.Udyanbati This garden house was sanctified by Ramakrishna's stay with his disciples during the last few months of his life, as also by his mahasamadhi.

It is run by an Indian company of the same name on a dedicated website, and is also available within the social networking site Facebook. The Scrabulous website was launched in 2005, and the game was added to Facebook as an application in 2007, quickly becoming the most popular game on Facebook. Due to copyright infringement lawsuits, the game was removed from Facebook in 2008,'Scrabulous' disappears from Facebook after Hasbro suit, CNET, Retrieved December 01, 2013 first for North American users and later worldwide, with the Scrabulous website following suit. A ruling by Delhi High Court allowed Calcutta-based Rajat and Jayant Agarwalla to retain the right to post their word game online, but they were not allowed to use Scrabulous, Scrabble or any other ‚Äúsimilar sounding‚Äù name. Thus on 27 September 2008, a new website was launched using the new moniker \\"Lexulous\\". It has a live version and practice mode, and an option for play by email. On 20 December 2008, Hasbro withdrew their lawsuit against RJ Softwares. On 1 January 2009, Lexulous was activated on Facebook. As of 23 March 2009, the application had about 585,000 monthly active users. Electronic Arts' version had about 586,000 while RealNetworks' version had 357,000 users. History The Scrabulous company was founded by Rajat and Jayant Agarwalla, both commerce graduates of St. Xavier's College, Kolkata, India. The Scrabulous website was created at the end of 2005, after the Agarwalla brothers, Rajat and Jayant, who had won numerous Scrabble tournaments, felt the need for a free gaming site where the popular game could be played. It was initially made available as \\"BingoBinge\\", with the site moving to Scrabulous on 5 July 2006. In 2006 the website had 20,000 registered users, but after the developers made an application for the popular social networking website Facebook it had been added to 840,000 user pages, with more than 500,000 users daily,, facebook.com giving it \\"the most active users of any game that can be played over Facebook\\". =Legal and copyright issues= A game in progress on Facebook Scrabulous faced legal issues due to its resemblance to Scrabble along with a similar name. It also copied the board layout, rules, and at one stage the number of tiles. These issues forced the removal of the game from Facebook in mid-2008 and its eventual rebranding. The rights to Scrabble are currently owned within the US and Canada by Hasbro, and throughout the rest of the world by Mattel. According to Anthony Falzone ‚Äî head of the Fair Use Project at Stanford University ‚Äî copyright laws do not allow someone to freely copy the particular expression of an idea. In his article in the Wall Street Journal, Jamin Brophy-Warren has said that Hasbro Inc. has refused to comment on legal matters, while the creators have mentioned informing the company about their site. The former Scrabulous website made several references to Scrabble, and previously provided a link to the rules of Scrabble and promoted itself as the best place to play Scrabble online. It was reported that Hasbro made an attempt to acquire Scrabulous in January 2008 for an undisclosed sum in the range of $10 million. The game had been generating advertising revenue of over $25,000 a month for the Agarwalla brothers, however they refused to sell their application to Hasbro, instead requesting a \\"multiple\\" of $10 million.India Knowledge@Wharton  Scrabble over Scrabulous, Livemint, Aug 31 2008, Retrieved December 1, 2013 It was reported that the Agarwallas had also been looking for other potential suitors who would be willing to pay higher premiums. =Fan protest= As of October 2007, the term Scrabulous was registered as a trademark and service mark with the United States Patent and Trademark Office, but on February 2008 it was officially abandoned by the applicant. Hasbro threatened to shut Scrabulous down via legal means in January 2008. Facebook was also asked to pull Scrabulous from its site's application database, but initially demurred. In reaction to the news that the Facebook application was in legal jeopardy, two groups made a \\"SCRABULOUS\\" music video spoof of the Fergie song \\"Glamorous.\\" The video from web entertainment group TastesLikeTV.com professes \\"L, T, S, and R / Ain't gonna get you very far,\\" while the YouTube video created by Team Awesome Productions says that Scrabulous is the \\"swappy, swappy.\\" Both viral web videos were mentioned in the February 22, 2008 issue of Entertainment Weekly. Mattel launched its official version of online Scrabble, Scrabble by Mattel, on Facebook in late March 2008. As Hasbro controls the rights to Scrabble for North America with Mattel holding them for the rest of the world, the Facebook application is available only to players outside the United States and Canada. Scrabulous users reacted by creating a group called Save Scrabulous, asking Facebook to shut down the game on its site. Reportedly more than 54,000 fans have joined this group. It had also been reported that Scrabulous fans had written to Hasbro and Mattel demanding that the companies make \\"the right decision\\", and threatened to stop buying Mattel and Hasbro products if they shut down Scrabulous. =Lawsuit= On 24 July 2008, Hasbro formally sued Rajat and Jayant Agarwalla, along with their company, RJ Softwares. The suit claimed Scrabulous violated the Digital Millennium Copyright Act and infringed upon Hasbro's intellectual property rights. On 29 July 2008, Scrabulous was shut down on Facebook for users in North America, with the error message, \\"Scrabulous is disabled for US and Canadian users until further notice.\\" Less than a month later, the game was also pulled in all other countries but India. On 26 September 2008, the Scrabulous web site was suspended. This followed a ruling by the Delhi High Court that although the game Scrabble itself could not be copyrighted, and the Agarwalla brothers could therefore continue to offer their similar game online, they were however not permitted to use the name Scrabulous or any other name similar to that of Scrabble. =Launch of Lexulous= The day after the Delhi High Court ruling, the game was once more made available online under the new name \\"Lexulous\\". Whilst the game had an appearance overhaul, it still maintained the essential elements of the Scrabulous version including all of its past records, user IDs, and saved information. Lexulous also altered the layout of the game to differentiate it more from Scrabble. This change occurred on 3 December 2008, and saw score multipliers moved around the board, and the point score of tiles no longer matching those of Scrabble. In addition a player is now given 8 tiles to play with instead of the traditional 7 tiles. A 4x multiplier had been added to the game, however this feature was removed the next day. As of early 2011, one of the original Lexulous features, ordinary seven-letter Scrabble (including solitaire and versus the robot) became available again on the Lexulous website for users outside of USA and Canada. Wordscraper Wordscraper is a Scrabble-based word game application available on Facebook, also created by the Agarwalla brothers, which received an influx of people from the closure of Scrabulous in North America. It was reported inaccurately that Wordscraper was released after Scrabulous was shut down; however the application has been available since January 2008. Media and popularity As one of the first applications launched on Facebook, Scrabulous enjoyed relatively large popularity. It was featured in PC World's 100 best products of 2008.Sullivan, Mark, ed.

He won New Zealand championship titles on track and on road. Born in 1909, Pratney was originally named Wiremu Paratene. His mother died giving birth to him and he was initially raised by his grandmother who also died a few years later. He was then raised in an orphanage and named William Pratney. As a teenager he won local running and cycling races and decided to concentrate on cycling. However, in 1930 he was involved in a head-on bicycle crash with other racing cyclists and, after being in a coma for three days, doctors predicted he would never cycle again. Three months after the accident he was back on his bike and in 1934 he won fastest time in the 120 mile Taranaki Round-the-Mountain Race. His road racing career peaked in 1937 when he beat the great Harry Watson in the New Zealand 100-mile Road Championships. Perhaps the most fascinating thing about Pratney's cycling career was its length. In 1950, he won the Waimate to Christchurch (217 km) and in 1955 he won the Timaru to Christchurch (160 km). He took up racing again in his 70s and his last big ride was a 330 km ride in Australia at the age of 86. Pratney also served on the Manurewa Borough Council and was an inaugural member of the Manukau City Council. He died in Auckland in 2001 and was buried at Purewa Cemetery.

She applied Gellner's ideas and concepts to a particular case, that of the predominantly rural Romanian society, and, in this context, linked them to the conclusions of Liah Greenfeld. According to Greenfeld and Livezeanu, although nationalism was generated by economic and social development in England, it grew independently from that point on, and was equally able to impose itself in less underdeveloped regions. Irina Livezeanu applied these concepts to the study case of Greater Romania, and, in particular, to the process of Romanianization associated with the latter regime. She thus concluded that, although Transylvania, Bukovina and Bessarabia joined the Kingdom of Romania on the basis of ethnic and cultural links, the governments and cultural establishment in Bucharest also directed a process of centralization and cultural assimilation. Maria Bucur, \\"Ora Rom√¢niei\\", in Revista 22, Nr.897, May 2007; retrieved November 5, 2007Thomas J. Hegarty, \\"Book Review. Irina Livezeanu: Cultural Politics in Greater Romania. Regionalism, Nation Building, and Ethnic Struggle, 1918-1930\\" , in Ethnos-Nation Online , 6 (1998), at the University of Cologne; retrieved November 5, 2007 According to historian Constantin Iordachi, this pro-Romanianization stand was equivalent to \\"a Kulturkampf\\", and often meant \\"sacrificing democratic and pluralistic values on the altar of historically-motivated nationalism.\\" Based on the book, University of Tampa professor Thomas J. Hegarty argued that \\"Romania's swollen bureaucracy, in alliance with the nationalist intelligentsia for whom it provided employment, attempted to compensate for the thinness of ethnic Romanian urban civil society with an interventionist strategy of cultural activism.\\" This process was also connected to the underrepresentation of Romanians among the elites of the newly acquired territories, a situation which, despite Romania having committed itself to the Minority Treaties at the Paris Peace Conference, Romanianization policies attempted to overturn. Irina Livezeanu's analysis was also noted for evidencing the role of alternatives to unionism in the Romanian-inhabited regions of Austria-Hungary, including House of Habsburg loyalism, advocates of regional autonomy, and federalists endorsing the United States of Greater Austria. She cites examples of Romanian nationalists such as Aurel Popovici and Constantin Tomaszczuk, whose discourse, standing as an alternative to unionism, was marginalized by most other historians. Livezeanu has also developed an original take on the rise of fascism and the far right in interwar Romania, which she connected with the impact of nationalist discourse in Romanian culture and society. She sees the Iron Guard, Romania's main fascist group, as an autonomous development, largely independent from its Italian fascist or Nazi counterparts, but dependent on its contacts with the local middle class, bureaucracy and intelligentsia. Building on the conclusions of Israeli historian Zeev Sternhell, as well as on her interpretation of texts by fascist politician Nichifor Crainic, she proposed that Romanian fascism was actually a revolutionary-minded aspect of earlier conservative nationalism. In analyzing the transformations undergone in Greater Romania, she also points to the rise in antisemitism as a direct consequence of the land reform, arguing that the \\"national issue\\" (of Romanian versus foreigners) replaced references to the \\"social issue\\" (of peasants versus other classes), allowing Romanian nationalists to identify with the peasantry and contrast it with the local Jewish community. Livezeanu thus indicated that the contrast was generally being made between Romanian peasants and the Jewish element, perceived as not just foreign, but also \\"cosmopolitan and capitalist\\". One of Livezeanu's main conclusions deals with the competing social and political projects of the period, and specifically with the contrast between, on one side, the urbane and capitalist goals of National Liberal theorists such as ≈ûtefan Zeletin, and, on the other, rural protectionist and populist ideas both right-wing and left-wing (from the Iron Guard and the peasant theocracy imagined by Nae Ionescu to socialist-influenced Poporanism). She noted that liberalism, capitalist integration in the rural sphere, and industrialization had failed to impose themselves by the start of World War I, and that some of the early reforms associated with the National Liberals were in fact censored by protectionists. However, she proposed that the education reform carried out by the National Liberal politician Spiru Haret, often seen as a victory of Poporanism, was actually proof of the party having an elaborate plan to modernize the rural areas. Thus, she argued, the policies of Haret and his colleague Constantin Anghelescu were partly overturned by supporters of rural protectionism, both populist (Alexandru Averescu) and fascist (the Iron Guard's National Legionary State). Livezeanu's thesis on the birth of Romanian fascism was criticized by Constantin Iordachi, who argued that the link between the local middle class and far right movement was only obvious in the cases of fascist intellectuals such as Nae Ionescu and Crainic, whereas the Iron Guard is known to have engaged in an open conflict and, eventually, a bloody battle with moderate nationalist groupings. He nonetheless praised Cultural Politics in Greater Romania for its innovative approach, while noting that: \\"the examination of the civil society concept in the interwar context presents a special interest for contemporary Romanian society, given that it evidences the measure in which the obsession over historical justice, the excessive centralization, xenophobia and ethnocentrism undermine the development of democratic pluralism, alienate any potential sentiment of loyalty the national minorities might have toward the Romanian state, bereaving Romanian society of important creative forces.\\" Historian Ovidiu Pecican also cited Livezeanu's study, alongside those of Jean Ancel, as evidence that the image of interwar Romania as \\"solely nimbed by the progresses following stately unification\\" needed to be amended. Ovidiu Pecican, \\"Un istoric al Rom√¢niei interbelice\\", in Revista 22, Nr.915, September 2007; retrieved November 5, 2007 At a conference hosted by the Romanian Cultural Institute in 2007, Livezeanu spoke against what she called \\"historic and historiographic autarky\\" in contemporary Romanian culture, arguing that it was a still-surviving consequence of censorship imposed by the Romanian communist regime. She proposed that the reemergence of nationalist themes in writing history after the Revolution of 1989 was owed to the ongoing influence of various \\"nationalist-communist\\" ideologues, as well as to the prominence of nationalist thinkers during the interwar, but argued that the phenomenon was on the decline, and that younger Romanian historians were able to relate to such topics \\"as mere researchers\\". She argued that, given the moment, \\"I believe that any study which would question and deconstruct rather than defend, excuse or accuse various institutions [...] is worth the effort.\\" Works *Cultural Politics in Greater Romania: Regionalism, Nation Building, and Ethnic Struggle, 1918‚Äì1930, Cornell University Press, 1995 and 2000. *with June Pachuta Farris, Mary Zirin, Christine D.

He was one of the conspirators involved in the overthrow of three Ilkhanate khans, and placed the short-lived Baidu on the throne in 1295.  Background  Taghachar was a member of the Suquai'ud branch of the Baarin tribe. His father was Qutu Buqa, a t√ºmen commander operated under Hulagu and Abaqa and died in battle against Golden Horde. He also had an elder brother called Taiju, who died in infancy. His other relatives, including his grandfather Tem√ºge Noyan who was emir and uncle Jangqun who was head of security force looking after security of roads were all important emirs of Mongol armies. When Hulegu entered Persia in 1256, Taghachar commanded a battalion of his western wing. He was mainly stationed in province of Fars.  Career under Abaqa and Tekuder  His main rise to prominence began after Battle on Aƒüsu banks against Golden Horde on 19-20 July 1265. Although Prince Yoshmut's army defeated Nogai, his father Qutu Buqa died in this battle. Just like Buqa, as an orphaned person whose father died in battle he was given great importance and care by Abaqa, later he became his inaq - a trusted follower and a member of keshig. As new position as vizier Majd al-Mulk Yazdi's overseer, he imprisoned Ata-Malik Juvayni on behalf of Abaqa in 1281, accusing him of embezzling the treasure - a charge that was brought by Majd al-Mulk. Soon after Abaqa's death in 1281, Taghachar was among the commanders who appeared on Tekuder's election with new ilkhan's mother Qutui Khatun. Nevertheless, he supported Arghun later, who believed Juvayni brothers were responsible for his father's death by poisoning. Tekuder seeing Arghun as a strong rival, he seized Taghachar among other emirs who supported Arghun and kept imprisoned in Tabriz. He was released after Tekuder's arrest on 26 July 1284 and became one of the prominent emirs under Arghun.  Under Arghun  Arghun rewarded Taghachar by making him a commander of Qara'unas and appointing him as atabeg of his youngest son Khitai-Oghul. Taghachar soon took action against Buqa in 1289, who harnessed absolute power in his hands. Arghun's first step was to investigate former non-paid Salghurid taxes. As a result, he appointed Taghachar to as new head of Fars province inju treasury and gained over 1.5 million dinars from the province. After Buqa's death, his associates including Georgian king Demetre II were executed. His 16 year old son, David was put in Taghachar's household. Taghachar's status was so strengthened that he became of the recipients of letters from Nicholas IV as person of power. In 1290, he participated in Arghun's army in battles against Golden Horde khan Mengu Timur on Caucasus. Moving from capital on 28 March, he arrived on banks of Karasu river (on north of the Derbent) and was victorious against Mengu Timur's commander Toqay Noyan and Terktay Bahadur. Following the victory, Taghachar was sent to Khorasan front in April. Towards the end of Arghun's reign, Taghachar allied himself to other powerful emirs like Tugel, Toghan and Qoncuqbal in order to remove powerful vizier Sa'ad al-Dawla in 1291. Arghun was seriously ill and apparently couldn't speak, which gave Taghachar his allies the opportunity of removing their rivals in court, starting with Sa'ad al-Dawla. He invited the Arghun's senior emirs Orduqiya, Josh, and Qujan to a feast in honor of his ward Khitay‚Äôs birthday on 4 March, where they were arrested. Sa'ad al-Dawla was found in suburban Tabriz and was executed in Taghachar's house next day.  Under Gaykhatu  After death of Arghun, Taghachar and his allies supported Baydu, feeling the candidate Gaykhatu would replace them with his subordinates in Anatolia, lying him that Baydu was already taken the throne. Suspicious Gaykhatu tortured envoy to learn truth and sent 10.000 men ahead upon learning it, while himself moved to Arran and Azerbaijan. In any case, Baydu refused the throne. Gaykhatu took Taghachar's tumen and gave it to Shiktur Noyan of Jalairs in 1291. However, he could stay much in capital and had to leave for Anatolia hearing news of Turcoman rebellion, appointing Shiktur Noyan as regent of the state while confirming Prince Anbarchi (son of M√∂ngke Tem√ºr) as viceroy of East stationed in Ray. His absence in Iran was followed by a conspiracy led by Taghachar and his follower Sa'ad al-Din Zanjani. They falsely informed viceroy Anbarchi - via Sad al-Din's brother Qutb al-Din, who was Anbarchi's vizier - of Gaykhatu's defeat by Turcomans in Anatolia and called him to take the throne. While ambitious, Anbarchi regarded this news with suspicion. After contacting Shiktur Noyan who was residing near Karachal, Anbarchi had them imprisoned by Shiktur. Taghachar was only pardoned by Gaykhatu in 1292, even appointing Sa'ad al-Din Zanjani to the post of vizier on 18 November 1292 and his ward David as king of Georgia. After his release, Taghachar continued to serve Gaykhatu. He was mentioned by Rashid al-Din as Gaykhatu's second-in-command in June 1292 in Syria and an enforcer of Jiaochao in Tabriz. Seeing growing resentment against Gaykhatu, Taghachar changed his allegiance secretly to Baydu again. When Gaykhatu sent Taghachar against Baydu on 17 March 1295, he changed sides openly and led Baydu's armies against Gaykhatu, finally placing former on the throne on 24 March 1295.  Under Baydu  Being a kingmaker of Baydu, Taghachar achieved viceroyalty of Anatolia and Diyar Bakr in 1295. However, seeing advances of Nawruz against Baydu and his protege Sa'ad al-Din Zanjani's loss of vizierate, he against changed sides and joined Ghazan. A civil war ensued, led by Ghazan Khan, who executed Baydu on the 5 October 1295.  Under Ghazan  Ghazan confirmed Taghachar as viceroy in R√ªm on 9 December because he had concerns over his continued loyalty and thought it safer to keep him at a distance. Meanwhile Nawruz became naib of Ilkhanate and headed Ghazan's army against Chagatai khan Duwa's invasion of Khorasan in 1295. However, Ilkhanid prince Sogai (son of Yoshmut) refused to join campaign in Khorasan, believing this was Nawruz's plot further deprive nobility of their possessions. Taghachar was thought to have been implicated in the rebellion of Prince Sogai and was declared a rebel. Taghachar strengthened himself in Tokat and resisted against Ghazan's commanders Harmanji, Baltu and Arap (son of Samagar). He was soon arrested by Baltu near Delice and was delivered to Ghazan in 1296. Shortly afterwards Ghazan reluctantly ordered the murder of Taghachar; he recognised that he had been a help and that he was not an imminent threat, and explained his decision by reference to Chinese story about execution of a commander who saved a future emperor by betraying a former one.  Family  It is not known to whom Taghachar was married but he had at least two sons: Mubarak and Jaruq. Mubarak died in his youth but apparently Jaruq was alive during reigns of Ghazan and √ñljait√º.

Gaipa was a well known actor of Italian cinema as well as dubbing voices. However, he was widely known for his role as Don Tommasino in The Godfather. Biography Born in Palermo, Gaipa enrolled in the Silvio d‚ÄôAmico Academy of Dramatic Arts, where he studied for three years and performed an adaptation of the play You Can't Take It with You. He then graduated in 1946. In 1948, Gaipa joined a theatre group based in Rome and he began doing radio dramas which were broadcast in many cities across Italy such as Turin, Florence and Milan. He also appeared in many films such as the 1969 film That Splendid November. Internationally, he was well known for having played Don Tommasino the 1972 film The Godfather directed by Francis Ford Coppola. While also active on stage, radio and television, he was mainly active as a voice actor and a dubber. As for Gaipa's activity as a voice actor, he was the Italian voice of Obi-Wan Kenobi (portrayed by Alec Guinness) in the Star Wars original trilogy as well as Bagheera in the Italian-Language version of The Jungle Book. He also dubbed over the voices of Lionel Stander, Eli Wallach, Peter Ustinov, Rod Steiger, Orson Welles, Burt Lancaster and Spencer Tracy. He also assisted with the foundation of a dubbing company in the 1970s alongside Renato Turi, Giancarlo Giannini, Valeria Valeri, Oreste Lionello and other historical dubbers.Cronologia fondamentale dell'epoca d'oro del doppiaggio italiano Dagli albori agli anni 1970 (in Italian) Illness and death In Gaipa's later years, he suffered serious health problems. He went from using a walking stick to using a wheelchair and he died in Rome on September 21, 1989, at the age of 64. At the time of his death, he had just signed to reprise the role of Don Tommasino in The Godfather Part III. The role was instead passed on to Vittorio Duse.

Neuer (born 1969/1970 (\\"The sane voice at the UN: An interview with lawyer Hillel Neuer (In Hebrew)) is a Canadian-born international lawyer, writer, and the executive director of UN Watch, a human rights NGO and UN watchdog group based in Geneva, Switzerland. Neuer is the founding chairman of Geneva Summit for Human Rights and Democracy, a coalition of 25 NGOs from around the world. He has written on law, politics and international affairs for the International Herald Tribune, Juriste International, Commentary, The New Republic, Christian Science Monitor, and the Jerusalem Center For Public Affairs. Neuer was selected as one of the \\"top 100 most influential Jewish people in the world\\" by Israeli newspaper Maariv, and by the Algemeiner Journal in 2017. He is an outspoken defender of Israel and critic of the UN's human rights councils' actions. Early life Neuer is from Montreal, Canada. He holds a BA in intellectual history and political science from Concordia University, a Bachelor of Civil Law and a Bachelor of Laws from the McGill University Faculty of Law, which he graduated in 1997, and a Master of Laws in comparative constitutional law from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Neuer worked at the pro-Israel think tank Canadian Institute for Jewish Research while he was an undergraduate at Concordia. He practiced commercial and civil rights litigation at the international law firm of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP. Neuer is a member of the New York bar and co-author of the Annotated Copyright Act of Canada and Directors and Officers - A Canadian Legal Manual. Career =Legal career= Neuer served as a law clerk to the Supreme Court of Israel and a Graduate Fellow at the Shalem Center think tank. =Advocacy for Darfur victims at United Nations= Neuer advocated at the United Nations for human rights victims in Darfur. Neuer chaired the NGO Activist Summit For Darfur in 2007. He challenged Sudan in 2007 for its rejection of human rights experts in Darfur and demanded justice for child victims in Darfur in 2005. In August 2007, Neuer was the keynote speaker at the Save Darfur Canada rally in Montreal, along with Gen. Lewis MacKenzie, former commander of UN peacekeepers in the Balkans; Prof. Payam Akhavan, international law professor at McGill, and former senior advisor to the Chief Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court; Simon Deng, a black Christian from the south of Sudan who was sold into slavery in the Muslim north; Miss World Canada Nazanin Afshin-Jam; and Ayaan Hirsi Ali, author of Infidel. =United Nations human rights testimony= Neuer has represented human rights victims in testimony before the UN Human Rights Council, a body which he highly criticized. Neuer is noted for his \\"scathing commentary\\" on UNHCR's track record on human rights. His outspoken advocacy for student Yevgeniya \\"Jenya\\" Taranenko preceded her release from a Russian prison. Neuer debated Zimbabwe's UN ambassador on CNN over the Mugabe regime's dismal human rights record. In 2007 he spoke out for the Arab, Kurdish, and Bah√° º√≠ victims of violations in Iran. In 2004 he spoke out on victims of torture and censorship in C√¥te d'Ivoire, Zimbabwe, Cuba, Nepal, Myanmar, and Pakistan. Neuer also spoke out for the Lebanese victims of Syrian political assassinations and against the rape and enslavement of women in Syria and Iraq; state-sanctioned limits on the movements, education and employment of women in Iran; and the repression of speech in Saudi Arabia. Neuer is known in particular for criticizing the attitude of the UNHCR towards Israel, in his view, the UNHCR seeks \\"to demonize Israeli democracy, to delegitimize the Jewish state, to scapegoat the Jewish people. They also seek something else: To distort and pervert the very language and idea of human rights.\\" =Erroneous arrest during 2007 U.S. visit= On November 1, 2007, Neuer presented a report on the United Nations and antisemitism at the invitation of Yale University. The day after giving his presentation, Neuer visited a local restaurant in Needham, Massachusetts, where an employee called the police and falsely reported that Neuer was carrying a gun, leading the police to take him into custody. On the next business day, the Norfolk County court fully cleared Neuer and ruled that the police had acted without probable cause. Initial media reports of a \\"stand-off\\" were found to be false and police confirmed that Neuer himself had called 911 twice seeking to exit from the police action that he believed was in pursuit of criminals near the restaurant. \\"Mr. Neuer was an innocent victim who went to a restaurant in Needham and was traumatized and almost killed,\\" said Neuer's attorney David G. Eisenstadt. On March 31, 2008, the Town of Needham, on behalf of the police, sent Mr. Neuer a full apology, saying he was \\"an innocent victim caught up in the events of that day.\\" =2009 Toronto Film Festival= In 2009 Hillel Neuer became involved in the controversy over Israel's marketing campaign at the 2009 Toronto International Film Festival. Neuer spoke out against the involvement of activist Naomi Klein in protests. Neuer wrote: \\"Supporters of liberal democratic values may have a hard time understanding why anti-globalization activist Naomi Klein has recruited Jane Fonda and other stars to boycott the Toronto International Film Festival for the crime of showing films from Tel Aviv.\\" Neuer's UN Watch published a report on its website entitled \\"Naomi Klein Exposed: The Unauthorized Biography\\". National Post published a response from Judy Rebick. Rebick wrote: \\"Naomi Klein didn't start the protest, but she used her contacts and her celebrity to make it more effective. The focus is on her because she is today one of the most prominent Jewish intellectuals in the world, and she is starting to be vocal in her criticism of Israeli human rights violations. She is risking a lot to speak out so passionately on this subject.\\" Coverage and reception Neuer has appeared before the UN Human Rights Council for a range of causes including the rape victims of Darfur, political prisoners in Cuba, and Middle East peace. He testified as an expert witness before hearings of the U.S. Congress on UN reform in 2007 and 2011, and is regularly quoted by major media outlets including the New York Times, Al Jazeera, Die Welt, Le Figaro, Reuters, Al Ahram and Fox News. Neuer has debated UN human rights issues on CNN, BBC and Al Jazeera, and some of his talks at the UN panel went viral. While working at Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison, Neuer was cited by the U.S. Federal Court for the high quality of his pro bono advocacy. In a 2014 article in The Jerusalem Post, Yisrael Medad described Neuer as a man who \\"struggles valiantly and successfully to expose the truth about human rights as practiced in the United Nations and other so-called civil rights NGOs.\\" He is a regular on the speaking circuit. In 2016, the City of Chicago and Mayor Rahm Emanuel adopted a resolution declaring \\"Hillel Neuer Day\\"Chicago - Office of the City Clerk - Record #: R2016-690 recognizing \\"one of the world‚Äôs foremost human rights advocates,\\" and for his contributions to \\"promote peace, justice and human rights around the world.\\" In 2017, the Algemeiner Journal selected him as one of \\"the top 100 people positively influencing Jewish life\\". In June 2018, Neuer was the recipient of McGill University's highest honorary doctorate degree, Doctorate of Laws, for his work at the Geneva Summit for Human Rights and Democracy. He dedicated the award to dissidents and political prisoners, among them was Chinese activist Yang Jianli who praised Neuer as \\"one of the world‚Äôs most committed, energetic human rights leaders.\\" However, he is also criticized by the International Relations Center on its \\"Right Web\\" page for his actions in the previous section of the article: \\"UN Watch‚Äôs director Hillel Neuer has helped spur criticism of the group through his confrontational commentary.[...]Under Neuer, however, UN Watch has increasingly taken on the mantle of many hardline critics of the international body.\\" References External links  * *Articles by Hillel Neuer at New York Daily News *Articles by Hillel Neuer at The Hill *Hillel Neuer's blog at the Times of Israel *Papers published by Neuer in Azure (magazine) *Israel, the Palestinians, and the United Nations: Challenges for the New Administration, testimony by Hillel Neuer, Committee on Foreign Affairs, U.S. House of Representatives, February 2, 2017 Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people Category:Canadian human rights activists Category:Concordia University alumni Category:McGill University alumni Category:Hebrew University of Jerusalem alumni Category:Jews from Quebec Category:Canadian non-fiction writers Category:Critics of the United Nations Category:Writers from Montreal ","title":"Hillel Neuer"},{"id":"14083276","text":"A smart toy is a toy which effectively has its own intelligence by virtue of on-board electronics. These enable it to learn, behave according to pattern, and alter its actions depending upon environmental stimuli. Typically, it can adjust to the abilities of the player. A modern smart toy has electronics consisting of one or more microprocessors or microcontrollers, volatile and/or non-volatile memory, storage devices, and various forms of input‚Äìoutput devices. It may be networked together with other smart toys or a personal computer in order to enhance its play value or educational features. Generally, the smart toy may be controlled by software which is embedded in firmware or else loaded from an input device such as a USB flash drive, Memory Stick or CD-ROM. Smart toys frequently have extensive multimedia capabilities, and these can be utilized to produce a realistic, animated, simulated personality for the toy. Some commercial examples of smart toys are Amazing Amanda, Furby and iDog.  Common confusions  Smart toys are frequently confused with toys for which it is claimed that children who play with them become smarter. Examples are educational toys that may or may not provide on- board intelligence features. A toy which merely contains a media player for telling the child a story should not be classified as a smart toy even if the player contains its own microprocessor. What best distinguishes a smart toy is the way the on-board intelligence is holistically integrated into the play experience in order to create simulated human-like intelligence or its facsimile.  History  Modern smart toys have their early roots in clockworks such as those of the eighteenth and nineteenth century cuckoo clocks, music boxes of the nineteenth, and Disney audio-animatronics of the twentieth. Perhaps the biggest early contribution is from novelty and toy makers from the 1800s who made automatons such as Vaucanson's mechanical duck, von Kempelen's The Turk, and the Silver Swan. All pre-twentieth-century precursors had in common that they were mechanical contrivances. By the second half of the 1900s toys featuring built-in media players became common. For example, Mattel introduced a variety of dolls in the 1960s and 1970s that used a pull string activated talking device to make the dolls \\"talk\\" such as the talking Crissy doll and Chatty Cathy. However, it remained until the introduction of the microprocessor in the mid-1970s for smart toys to come into their own. Texas Instrument's Speak & Spell which came on the market in the late 1970s was one of the first full-featured smart toys. The device is similar to a very limited laptop with LED read-out. It is used for spelling games and guessing a \\"mystery code\\". It speaks and makes a variety of sound effects. Another early example is Teddy Ruxpin, a robotic teddy bear which came out in the 1980s. It reads children's stories via a recording device built into its back and swivels its eyes and mouth. Even the earliest toys, from the nineteenth century on, have in common with their modern-day smart toy counterparts that they appear to be sentient and lifelike, at least to the extent possible using the technology available at the time. Contemporary smart toys utilize speech recognition and activation; that is, they appear to comprehend and react to words that are spoken. Through speech synthesis, smart toys speak prerecorded words and phrases. These kinds of technologies, when combined together, animate the toys and give them a lifelike persona. Another hardware feature of modern smart toys is sensors which enable the smart toy to be aware of what is going on in its environment. These permit the toy to tell its orientation, determine if it is being played with indoors or outdoors, and know who is playing with it based upon the strength of the squeeze the child's hand gives it or similar factors. A typical example is Lego Mindstorms, a series of robotic-like devices, which integrate LEGO pieces with sensors and accessories. These toys include microcontrollers which control the robots. They are pre-programmed by a personal computer and utilize light and touch sensors along with accelerometers. Accelerometers and temperature, pressure and humidity sensors, can also be used to create various effects by smart toy designers. The development of smart toys received a major boost in 1998 when semiconductor manufacturer, Intel, and toy maker, Mattel, Inc. entered into a joint venture to open a Smart Toy Lab in Portland, Oregon. This led to products that were marketed under the Intel Play brand. The first product in the line was the QX3 Computer Microscope. The Lab evolved into a toy company known today as Digital Blue, a division of Prime Entertainment, Inc. of Marietta, GA.  Controversies  Widespread commercialization of smart toys is mainly a 21st-century phenomenon. As they have gained acceptance in the marketplace, controversy has been brewing. One of the chief criticisms has been that despite often being technical marvels, many smart toys have only limited play value. In short, these toys neither involve the child in play activity nor do they stimulate his or her imagination. Consequently, regardless of store-shelf attractiveness, the child tires quickly of them after only one or two play sessions, and the parents' investment is largely wasted. Stevanne Auerbach, in her book Smart Play‚ÄîSmart Toys introduces the notion of Play Quotient or simply PQ. Auerbach criticizes smart toys for often having low PQs. PQ is a rating system based upon a weighted average constructed from a comprehensive list of play value attributes. Playthings with higher PQs are desirable from the standpoint of stimulating the child's imagination, creativity, and inquisitiveness. Generally, children choose to play with these products over and over again. Those toys with low PQs are quickly set aside. The child finds them boring and uninteresting. Many child development experts prefer open-ended toys such as construction toys, blocks, dolls, etc. over smart toys. For example, a cardboard box that the child turns into a pretend play house will be played with continuously by the child for many hours whereas an expensive smart toy can quickly exhaust the child's interest once its novelty has worn off. Jillian Trezise typifies the attitude often taken by child development specialists and educators towards smart toys, \\"...if kids can't take their expensive toys to the sandpit or open them up to see how they work, then they don't provide much educational value. All they do is entertain and they don't hold young people's attention for very long.\\" Another implicit concern about smart toys is that even when they hold the child's attention they could become so entertaining that parents may be tempted to turn over some of the child-rearing to the smart toys. Thus, children will be deprived of needed parental attention. In other words, because of their strong multimedia capabilities children may watch presentations provided by the smart toys and be entertained, but will not really play with the devices nor be otherwise engaged by them. Judy Shackelford, a toy industry veteran, has a more positive view regarding smart toys. She cautions that children may even be deprived should they be not exposed to them. She sees smart toys as part of the surrounding environment that children will need to adapt to as they mature. Should they not be given access to these kinds of toys, they may become less well adapted to thrive and benefit as technology evolves. Smart toy advocates also point to research indicating that children learn more effectively with good interactive software. This seems to support the idea that smart toys may have many educational benefits as well.Gibson, op. cit. There have been increasing concerns that smart toys, especially ones that directly connect to the Internet, are becoming easy targets for cybercriminals, who can use hacking to easily obtain personal data collected from a smart toy, especially personal names.  Industry  Market research company GfK Australia found that parents are spending record amounts on electronic and interactive toys.Gibson, op. cit. Mark Allen states that the greatest impediment to the further growth of the smart toy industry is the lack of development of artificial intelligence and speech recognition. At their present stage of evolution smart toys really can't learn so they are limited to predefined actions and speech. Present artificial intelligence capabilities are too expensive to implement in a toy, but this will change as computational power and speed come down in price. Eventually, this will result in cheaper technology, enhanced functionality, and a richer play experience. Some toy designers think it could be five years or more before the technology is cheap enough to be widely available. Others have cited the high cost of MEMS-based sensors and actuators as a factor constraining the rapid development of smart toys. These costs are expected to come down eventually also, thereby helping toy companies to hit their price targets.Henderson, op. cit. According to figures from the NPD Group, at the end of 1999, the smart toy segment made up 2.5 percent of the $23 billion toy market. The smart toy industry grew out of several other product categories, which include children's software, electronic toys, and video games. A 2001 Forrester Research study projected that the smart toy segment would grow to more than $2 billion by the year 2003. Factors enhancing the growth of the smart toy segment include the greatly more sophisticated tastes of children today as well as the spread of home PCs.Goldstein, op. cit. A 2005 market research study by Tangull America LLC of New York, NY indicated that toys with embedded information technologies‚Äîthat is, nano, bio and cognitive technologies‚Äîare growing over 15% annually, and will grow to sales of US $146 billion by 2015. As an example, one of the \\"smart toys\\" the study cites are \\"interactive puppets\\" that become \\"real playmates\\" through the combination of artificial intelligence and ultrafine sensors. The latter can measure changes in facial expressions, movements, and environment and the puppets react accordingly.  Selection criteria  The issue of balance is often mentioned in connection with smart toys‚Äînamely, that their use should be kept in proportion with other play activities. They should also be age appropriate and not become a substitute for interaction with parents. Playing with smart toys should be a supplement, not a replacement, for traditional play activities. Stevanne Auerbach emphasizes smart toys which have strong play value for the child, and are the \\"right toy at the right time.\\" She does not favor those toys which fail to encourage discovery and exploration. Auerbach quips that \\"a toy playing with a child, as opposed to a child playing with a toy, is not beneficial for the child.Gibson, op. cit. Those toys that give the child control over interaction are best according to some child development researchers. Kiely Gouley argues that \\"...some of these toys are very entertaining and they make the child a passive observer.\\" She continues: \\"...you want the child to engage with the world. If the toy does everything if it sings and beeps and shows pictures, what does the child have to do?\\" Smart toys should have very clean, easy-to-understand and navigate user interfaces. Claire Lerner, a child-development specialist, says that pretend play can be inhibited by highly structured toys: \\"They superimpose someone else's story on the kids. So kids don't develop their imaginations.\\" In her view, simpler toys are preferable, because they are more flexible.Carroll, op. cit. From a designer of smart toy's viewpoint, this means that in order to achieve simplicity technologies need to be combined so as to render a very naturalistic user interface within the limits of other design constraints. Children by nature are unpredictable and often fail to follow the same rules followed by adults. One of the tasks of the designer is to anticipate ways that interaction with children can fail to be as expected and to guide the user into one of the expected responses. This can be achieved by giving the child options to select and other types of cues to follow. For parents and child development specialists alike, the task remains to select the right toys at the right time. However, from the toy designer's standpoint, the challenge is to identify the best technologies at a feasible cost, and then to develop products around those capabilities and limitations of the technologies used in smart toys. Anthropologist David Lancy argues that parent-child play is largely an artifact of wealthy developed countries not practiced by most of the world's population. It results from competitive pressures to ready children for survival in an information-based economy. He views the promotion of interaction between parents and children in \\"play activities\\" as a form of cultural imperialism practiced by the upper and upper middle class upon lower income socioeconomic strata. This is possibly one reservation on a completely unrestricted view that parents should always be involved in selecting appropriate smart toys for their children.

It was founded in 1968 by the Government of the State of Israel. 50% of its manufacturing activities and 70% of its consolidated revenues derive from global operations. Its core holdings are fertilizers and specialty chemicals, energy, shipping and transportation. Israel Corp is a constituent of the TA-35 Index of leading shares of the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange. Two of its major holdings, Israel Chemicals and Oil Refineries Ltd are also constituents of the TA-35 Index. History The Israel Corp was founded by the government of Israel together with Shaul Eisenberg in 1968, who was one of the first strategic foreign investors in Israeli history, under the initiative of then Minister of Finance, Pinchas Sapir of the Israeli Labor Party, who changed the Encouragement of Capital Investments Law to attract foreign investment. The change ensured that the company's owners were exempt from taxes for 30 years and received other benefits. In 1975, the director general of Israel Corp, Michael Tzur, was sentenced to 15 years in prison after he was convicted on 18 counts of embezzlement, theft, fraud and bribery. He was released from prison in 1981. Shares of the company were offered to the public in 1969, 1970, 1974 and 1982, and the company was listed on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange in 1982. After Eisenberg's death in 1998, the family sold control of the company to the Ofer family. In 2007, 55% of the equity of the company was held by the Ofer Brothers Group, 18% by Bank Leumi and the remainder by the public. The Israeli government holds the so-called 'golden share' in Israel Corps., meaning that any sale of a holding in Israel Chemicals needs a thorough examination to determine if it's in the interest of the state.Potash-Israel Chemicals Merger Faces Government Obstacles By David Wainer and Gwen Ackerman November 01, 2012, Bloomberg Major holdings Israel Corp's major holdings are Israel Chemicals, Oil Refineries Ltd, Tower Semiconductor, Kenon Holdings and Zim Integrated Shipping Services. Criticism The Israel Corporation was criticized in a documentary film examining the influence of big business on Israeli politics. The movie The Shakshuka System chronicles the history of the company, and how it had allegedly benefited from a \\"revolving-door\\" practice between the public and the private sector, from its extensive network of connections in Israel's political system and economic circles, and from a high degree of influence on local media to squelch potential criticism. Among the major allegations presented by the film was the Bazan sale incident, in which the company's stake in the country's largest oil refinery was bought out by Israel's treasury, for what many considered to be an overvalued sum, especially since Israel Corp. was bound by an agreement to return its holding of Bazan to the state without compensation. The company had allegedly blocked the film from being broadcast on any of Israel's commercial TV channels, and it was finally broadcast on Channel One.

Life The son of a ship's master, Fawcett was apprenticed at age 14 for seven years to William Forth, a Bridlington bookseller and printer. In 1831 he started his own business in Middle Street, Driffield, as music seller, bookbinder and printer, bookseller and stationer. He married Mary Ann Woodmansey in 1830, with whom he had two sons before her death in 1834. He was married again in 1848, to the scientific illustrator and artist Martha Porter, and raised a large family of four daughters and six sons. Benjamin Fawcett died in January 1893, a few weeks before his associate Francis Orpen Morris. Works His early works were mostly children's books published by Webb & Millington of Leeds. In about 1845 he formed a close working association with Francis Orpen Morris. This relationship would last nearly 50 years and have a profound effect on British ornithology. Morris wrote the text for books which were financed and printed by Fawcett, and were engraved by Alexander Francis Lydon (1836-1917), who had started his career as Fawcett's apprentice. Colour printing was a major change from the much-admired monochrome work of Thomas Bewick (1753-1828). At first wood-engraving illustrations were coloured by hand, but later a system of colouring from multiple wood blocks was used. \\"White-headed Woodpecker\\", wood-engraving by Fawcett, drawing by T. W. Wood Hand-coloured wood engraving started with an accurate painting of the subject. This picture was then carved on a wooden block, standing proud in order to pick up the ink. The block was then placed in a printing press to give a black-and-white print, which was then hand-coloured. The wooden print blocks were carved with great attention detail. Pear and boxwood were sufficiently hard and fine-grained, making them durable and capable of showing fine detail. Most of the joint works of Fawcett and Lydon were published by Groombridge, of London. Fellow engraver W. D. Ridley wrote: \\"Benjamin Fawcett was undoubtedly a born genius in the best sense of the word; for in a remote country town in the early days of railway facilities, when it must have been difficult to buy high-grade colour inks, he brushed all difficulties aside, purchased his own boxwood shipped direct from Turkey, matured it, sawed it in slices, surfaced it accurately, drew the whole of his work, Morris's British Birds, upon these blocks himself, and with the aid of his clever wife, actually produced the first edition so far as the blocks were concerned, ....\\" > \\"If there was a secret which produced the fine results it would have been... > Benjamin Fawcett engraving every one of the three hundred and sixty plates > for this work on wood with his own hand ... making the inks himself from the > costliest powders and the most expensive varnishes procurable....and each > specimen plate for the colourers painted by his wife.

In the United States, the high duration of the therapy has also made the therapy not able to get reimbursed in most clinical environments. However, distributed or \\"modified\\" CIT protocols have enjoyed similar efficacy to CIMT, have been able to be administered in outpatient clinical environments, and have enjoyed high success rates internationally. Types of constraint The focus of CIMT is to combine restraint of the unaffected limb and intensive use of the affected limb. Types of restraints include a sling or triangular bandage, a splint, a sling combined with a resting hand splint, a half glove, and a mitt. Determination of the type of restraint used for therapy depends on the required level of safety vs. intensity of therapy. Some restraints restrict the wearer from using their hand and wrist, though allow use of their non- involved upper extremity for protection by extension of their arm in case of loss of balance or falls. However, restraints that allow some use of the non- involved extremity will result in less intensive practice because the non- involved arm can still be used to complete tasks. Constraint typically consists of placing a mitt on the unaffected hand or a sling or splint on the unaffected arm, forcing the use of the affected limb with the goal of promoting purposeful movements when performing functional tasks. The use of the affected limb is called shaping.  Duration and timing of \\"traditional\\" versus \\"modified\\" CI therapy programs  Traditionally, CIMT involves restraining the unaffected arm in patients with hemiparetic stroke or hemiparetic cerebral palsy (HCP) for 90% of waking hours while engaging the affected limb in a range of everyday activities However, given concerns with compliance (both among patients and clinicians), reimbursement, and patient safety, studies have varied on hours of restraint per day and length of therapy. More specifically, CIMT involves the person performing supervised structured tasks with the affected limb 6 hours a day for 10 days over a 14-day period, in addition to wearing the restrictive mitt or sling for 90% of waking hours. Alternatively, modified constraint induced movement therapy protocols have been found to be equally effective as \\"traditional\\" CI therapy protocols. The most established, commonly used, and evidence based form of modified CI therapy that has been found to be effective in improving motor control asks patients to attend goal directed therapy sessions lasting a half hour per day, on 3 days/week over a 10-week period. Concurrently, patients wear a mitt on the less affected limb for 5 hours/weekday during the same 10-week period. In addition to providing more practice with the affected limb than \\"traditional\\" CI therapy over the 10-week period, the regimen is in greater accord with outpatient therapy regimens around the world, is less costly, and the efficacy has been shown to be comparable to a more intensive CI therapy schedule. Practitioners say that stroke survivors disabled for many years have recovered the use of their limbs using CIMT. However, it has been shown that receiving CIMT early on (3‚Äì9 months post-stroke) will result in greater functional gains than receiving delayed treatment (15‚Äì21 months post- stroke), with no benefits associated with its administration acutely (< 3 months post stroke). However, modified CI therapy protocols have shown larger treatment effects when administered in the acute phase. Mechanism of change CIMT was developed by Edward Taub of the University of Alabama at Birmingham. Taub argues that, after a stroke, the patient stops using the affected limb because they are discouraged by the difficulty. As a result, a process that Taub calls \\"learned non-use\\" sets in, furthering the deterioration. Learned non-use is a type of negative feedback. Individuals are unable to move their affected limb or the movements are inefficient and clumsy and in response to this a suppression of movement occurs. It is this process that CIMT seeks to reverse. The American Stroke Association has written that Taub's therapy is \\"at the forefront of a revolution\\" in what is regarded possible in terms of recovery for stroke survivors. As a result of the patient engaging in repetitive exercises with the affected limb, the brain grows new neural pathways. This change in the brain is referred to as cortical reorganization or neuroplasticity. One study by Deluca et al. showed that using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) that the excitable cortex of the affected cortex in adults patients with HCP doubled in size after 12 days of therapy. Recently, the possible benefits of cortical reorganization has led to studies of CIMT on children because neuroplasticity is even greater among children than adults. Particular interest is growing in CIMT for children who have cerebral palsy where one arm is more affected than the other. As with adults, however, the plausibility of administering CIMT in pediatric models is low except in specialized, for profit, clinics, due to its intensive parameters, and it has been noted that compliance is especially low in most community-dwelling children. Application of constraint-induced movement therapy Both CIMT and modified CIMT may be applicable to up to 20‚Äì25 percent of stroke patients, and the amount of improvement produced by either regimen appears to diminish as the initial motor ability of the patient decreases. Both CIMT and modified CI therapy has been shown to be an effective means of stroke rehabilitation regardless of the level of initial motor ability, amount of chronicity, amount of prior therapy, side of hemiparesis, or infarct location. This suggests that plasticity may work irrespective of the pathways in the damaged motor network. Although, due to the duration of this treatment, patients who have suffered profound upper extremity paralysis from their condition are normally not eligible for constraint-induced upper extremity training. A consistent exclusion criterion for CIMT and modified CI therapy has been the inability to perform voluntary wrist and finger extension in the involved hand. As stated above, this criterion typically limits the population eligible for this family of therapies to 20‚Äì25% of the entire stroke population. CIAT (Constraint Induced Aphasia Therapy) is an adaptation of CIMT for people with Aphasia. It can be used for clients with either expressive or receptive aphasia. Like CIMT, treatment is intensive and usually occurs over a ten-day period for several hours per day. In CIAT, patient must use verbal communication without gestures or pointing in order communicate. The constraints are placed on the use of gestures with the aim of improving verbal communication. Also like CIMT, CIAT has been shown to not be feasible in most clinical environments due to its parameters and distributed protocols are now being investigated. Both constraint-induced movement therapy (CIMT) and modified CI therapy coupled with intensive and varied exercise training has proven to be effective in reducing spasticity and increasing function of the hemiplegic upper extremity in chronic stroke patients. The effects of constraint-induced movement therapy and its modified versions have been found to improve movements that not only remain stable for months after the completion of therapy, but translate well to improvements of everyday functional task. Limitations to implementation As stated earlier, the \\"traditional\\" form of constraint-induced movement therapy (CIMT) has not been incorporated as part of standard practice for the rehabilitation of the hemiplegic upper extremity. Most notably, concerns have been cited over the reimbursement, intensity, and both patient and clinician compliance with the therapy, especially in light of equally-effective, less intense alternative forms. Concerns have also been raised over the generalizability of the results obtained from research, as selection criteria for CIMT research has excluded patients with a moderate or more severe stroke, due to balance problems, serious cognitive deficits, and global aphasia, which may reduce understanding of safety instructions and interfere with a patient's ability to communicate difficulties. The cost of resources needed to conduct CIMT treatment protocol are high. Costs are generated due to the intensity of therapy required for CIMT, as participants typically receive up to 6 hours of one-on-one therapy at least 5 days per week for 2 weeks. CIMT can be prohibitively expensive for patients paying out-of-pocket or for publicly funded health care systems attempting to make this program available to all eligible stroke survivors. Therapist apprehension directed at safety issues with constraint use, lack of facilities, the cost of providing one-on-one therapy sessions, and the opportunity costs associated with the therapist's inability to see and treat other patients during that time has contributed to the resistance of adopting the CIMT protocol. The patient's ability to tolerate the intensity and duration of the therapy sessions is a limiting factor to protocol adoption. Stroke patients have commonly expressed the length of time wearing the constraint and time-consuming hours of therapy as reasons they wish not to participate. While the CIMT protocol results in improved function in its target population, it is unknown whether the combination of constraint and therapy is necessary to achieve the outcome seen or whether the benefit is due to exposure to high-intensity, task-specific activities focused on the use of the more affected limb. Additionally, the therapy only appears to work on stroke survivors with some initial movement in their wrists and fingers; about 25% of the entire population of stroke survivors.

The second place competitor scored 350 points. Riders placing between third and 10 were awarded points on an incremental scale down to 15. And riders also received the points they earned for a qualified ride.2014 PBR Media Guide, PBR Tours - PBR Bull Riding Basics - Built Ford Tough World Finals Scoring-In 2004 New Scoring System, p.29. There were six rounds in the PBR World Finals. All of the riders competed in the first five rounds. The top 15 riders advanced to the Championship Round. The rider who won the Finals event received 2,500 BFTS points and $250,000. Second place received 2,250 points. And the riders placing between 3rd and 10th received points on an incremental scale down to 250.2014 PBR Media Guide, PBR Tours - PBR Bull Riding Basics - Built Ford Tough World Finals Scoring-New Scoring System World Finals, p.29.  2005 season change  In 2005, a change was made to the tour. Wherein upon the conclusion of every fifth event on the series, the five lowest ranked riders were sent down to the Challenger Tour. It was based on money earned. Then the top five Challenger Tour riders were sent up to the BFTS. This shifting ensured the best riders competed at the right levels of competition. The Challenger Tour was used as a means as providing talent to the BFTS. Additionally, BFTS riders could freely compete in the Challenger Tour and the Hump n' Horns Tour events assuming no conflicts would occur. BFTS riders might have done this because money earned at lower level tours also counted towards reaching the desired top-ranked 45 riders standings.  2007 season change  In 2007, the Built Ford Tough Series practiced the \\"First to Fail\\" format, where the order of the top 5 riders going into the championship round of the event was reversed, meaning the leader would ride first and the 5th-place rider would ride last. This format proved unpopular with fans and the championship round was reverted to its original format in 2008.  2009 season change  In 2009, the PBR BFTS World Champion was determined by the bull rider who earned the most BFTS points. The world finals event champion was determined by the highest aggregate score from 8 rounds.  2014 season changes  In 2014, the BFTS was then known as the nationally televised elite tour of the PBR. At that time, the tour was composed of the world's top 35 bull riders facing down the world's toughest bulls. The tour made 27 stops in 19 states that year. It opened with its first event at the Madison Square Garden in New York City, New York. It concluded in Las Vegas, Nevada, with the PBR BFTS World Finals. The PBR BFTS World Finals were bull riding's richest and it awarded almost $2.3 million that year if the $1 million bonus to the world champion is counted as well as the $10,000 belt buckle.2014 PBR Media Guide, PBR Tours - Built Ford Tough Series-Elite Tour, p.45. In 2014, the BFTS followed these rules. The PBR BFTS World Champion was the bull rider who accumulated the most points while competing in events in the regular season and in the world finals event. The BFTS used the point system to be certain the most consistent rider became the World Champion Bull Rider. Points were earned at each event for a rider's finish in each round and in the event. First place received 100 points. Second place received 90 points. Remaining riders between third and 10th place received points on an incremental scale.2014 PBR Media Guide, PBR Tours - Built Ford Tough Series-2014 Rules, p.45. Each BFTS event contained a round with 35 bull rides. For a two-day event, the 35 bull riders will compete in Round 1 and 2. The top 15 scores advanced to the BFTS Championship Round. The event winner was the rider with the highest combined score from all three rounds. The winner received 300 points. The second place finisher received 270 points. Riders placing between third and 10th received points in an incremental scale down to 30.2014 PBR Media Guide, PBR Tours - Built Ford Tough Series-Two Day Event Rules, p.45. For a three-day event, the 35 bull riders completed in Rounds 1, 2, and 3. The top 15 scores advanced to the BFTS Championship round. The event winner was the rider with the highest combined score from all four rounds. The winner received 400 points. The second place finisher received 260 points. Riders placing between third and 10th received points in an incremental scale down to 40.2014 PBR Media Guide-Rules, PBR Tours - Built Ford Tough Series-Three Day Event Rules, p.45. In 2004, the PBR introduced an enhanced scoring system to the BFTS World Finals to make sure the champion is not determined prior to the event. These rules were still followed until 2015, when they were slightly modified by removing qualified ride scores from World Standings points totals. First, 5,500 potential points were available, that ensures any of the top ten riders heading to the event had a chance to win the title. The first place competitor in a round scored 400 points. The second place competitor scored 350 points. Riders placing between third and 10 were awarded points on an incremental scale down to 15. And riders also received the points they earned for a qualified ride.2014 PBR Media Guide, PBR Bull Riding Basics - Built Ford Tough Series Scoring-2004 Rule Change, p.29. There were six rounds in the PBR World Finals. All of the riders competed in the first five rounds. The top 15 riders advanced to the Championship Round. The rider who won the Finals event received 2,500 BFTS points and $250,000. Second place received 2,250 points. And the riders placing between 3rd and 10th received points on an incremental scale down to 250.2014 PBR Media Guide, PBR Bull Riding Basics - Built Ford Tough Series Scoring-World Finals Rule Change, p.29. Riders could qualify for the PBR BFTS World Finals in several ways. One way was by competing in BFTS events throughout the season. They could also compete in the Tour Pro Division and international events. Countries where they could compete are Australia, Brazil, Canada, and Mexico.2014 PBR Media Guide, PBR Bull Riding Basics - Built Ford Tough Series Scoring-Qualification, p.29.  2015 season changes  For 2015 and beyond, the PBR modified the PBR BFTS points system. The BFTS World Champion Bull Rider is the one who accumulated the most world points during the regular season and the World Finals combined. Prior to 2015, the points system was focused on making sure the most consistent rider became the World Champion. However, the PBR's founders have always desired the bull rider who wins consistently be the one who wins the most events; thus, the championship. So starting in 2015, a new points system went into effect. The change affected all of the PBR's tours, the 15/15 Bucking Battle, and the international tours in Australia, Brazil, Canada, and Mexico. Qualified ride scores no longer were included in the World Standings point totals. They were, however, used to determine placements in event rounds and event aggregates, and to determine both event and World Standings.2016 PBR Media Guide, PBR Bull Riding Basics - Built Ford Tough Series Scoring-2015 Rule Change, p.28. Each BFTS event contained a round with 35 bull rides. For a two-day event, the 35 bull riders will competed in Round 1 and 2. The top 15 scores advanced to the BFTS Championship Round. The event winner was the rider with the highest combined score from all three rounds. For a three-day event, the 35 bull riders will completed in Rounds 1, 2, and 3. The top 15 scores advanced to the BFTS Championship round. The event winner was the rider with the highest combined score from all three rounds.2016 PBR Media Guide, PBR USA Tours - Built Ford Tough Series-Elite Tour, p.43. There were four events on the BFTS that were considered major events. They are New York City, New York; Arlington, Texas; Las Vegas, Nevada; and Nashville, Tennessee. Major events offer competition in different formats, bonus bulls, and more prize money. These major events are broadcast on CBS. Together, these four major events compose the PBR Grand Slam Series.2016 PBR Media Guide, PBR USA Tours - Built Ford Tough Series-PBR Majors, p.43. The 15/15 Bucking Battles were offered at some PBR BFTS events. This type of event matched the top 15 bull riders in the PBR against the top 15 bulls at the event. The matching was random. There was a separate purse for this event. Points were earned at the rate of 1 and 1/2 times the round points. Points did not factor into the winner but did count toward the World Standings. The winner was the bull rider with the highest ride score.2016 PBR Media Guide, PBR USA Tours - Built Ford Tough Series-15/15 Bucking Battle, p.43. Qualifying for the PBR BFTS World Finals was based on points. Points could be earned on all of the PBR's tours: Built Ford Tough Series, Velocity Tour, Pro Touring Division and the International tours. International tours included Australia, Brazil, Canada, and Mexico. The top 35 ranked riders in the World Standings according to points earned competed at the World Finals. The Velocity Tour Champion, the top three highest ranked finishers at the Velocity Tour Finals, and the highest ranked finisher international rider at the Velocity Tour Finals also competed at the World Finals.2016 PBR Media Guide, PBR USA Tours - Built Ford Tough Series-World Finals, p.43. The PBR BFTS World Finals concluded in Las Vegas, Nevada. It awarded almost $2.2 million. This included the $1 million bonus to the World Champion. The World Champion also received a $10,000 championship belt buckle.2016 PBR Media Guide, PBR USA Tours - Built Ford Tough Series- Championship Awards, p.43.  Arena changes  The PBR hosted its inaugural World Finals in 1994 at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas, Nevada. They remained at the arena until 1998. In 1999, the PBR moved their World Finals to the Thomas & Mack Center. The PBR was stretching its current arena's limits and really needed a bigger arena. They wanted to stay in Las Vegas, and on the Thomas & Mack Center. The PBR BFTS was held at the Thomas & Mack Center in Las Vegas, Nevada, from 1999 until 2015. The 2015 World Finals was the 17th and last time it was hosted there. In 2016, the PBR moved their World Finals event from the Thomas & Mack Center to the T-Mobile Arena on the Las Vegas Strip.

His army managed to capture the capital briefly and forced the L√™ king to flee south.145 Tr·∫ßn Cao's first base ...\\"  Background  The L√™ Dynasty was established by Emperor L√™ L·ª£i in 1428 after expelling the Ming Dynasty of China, which had occupied Annam. In 1460, one of his successors, L√™ Th√°nh T√¥ng, rose to the throne, beginning what was regarded as a golden age in Vietnamese history. During his rule of 37 years, L√™ Th√°nh T√¥ng instituted wide-ranging political and structural organisation of the country, implementing a Confucian model of government, introducing a mandarin system of government, expanding education, science, and art. He also expanded ƒê·∫°i Vi·ªát's territory substantially. At the time, ƒê·∫°i Vi·ªát was confined to the area around the Red River Delta, but L√™ Th√°nh T√¥ng expanded ƒê·∫°i Vi·ªát's army and expanded south towards Hu·∫ø in what is now central Vietnam by conquering Champa territory. He also pushed westwards into the hills against the Tai. However, after his death, ƒê·∫°i Vi·ªát fell into disarray as a succession of weak emperors came and went, and palace intrigue crippled the country. This caused public discontent and set the scene for popular uprising. The first significant rebellion, that of Tran Tuan in 1511, is largely lost to history. However, it is known that he was a charismatic figure who quickly gathered thousands of followers in eastern H∆∞ng H√≥a and western S∆°n T√¢y provinces, and moved them directly against the capital ThƒÉng Long, now modern-day Hanoi. On arrival they defeated the army of Tr·ªãnh Duy S·∫£n, the head of aristocratic the Tr·ªãnh family which was part of the ruling dynasty. The royalists left ThƒÉng Long defenceless and its people in panic. Shortly after, Tuan was killed by unlucky chance and his rebels were massacred. He was reported to have been dressed in red at the time, suggesting that he may have been a Taoist sorcerer. One of his followers rebelled again in the same region the following year but was isolated and defeated.  Uprising  Like the Tran Tuan revolt of 1511, Tr·∫ßn C·∫£o's rebellion was also regarded as a simple peasant rebellion. Contrary views hold that both were revolts of the peripheral powers against the central administration led by charismatic figures bent on striking directly at the political and symbolic heart of the L√™ Dynasty. These two uprisings shared a pattern that set them apart from virtually all later Vietnamese peasant rebellions, which were much more locally oriented. Although they were clearly opposed to central control, later rebellions generally focused their discontent on local representatives by attacking district and provincial posts. They usually roamed the countryside intimidating landlords and pillaging opposing villages, allowing government forces in the capital enough time to organize an effective response. The Tr·∫ßn C·∫£o rebellion exhibited none of these characteristics. Cao based his bid for the throne on a combination of genealogical and spiritual platform that balanced maternal and paternal lineage and doctrinal Buddhist and folk elements. C·∫£o claimed direct descent from the founder of the former Tr·∫ßn Dynasty and membership of the family of L√™ Th√°nh T√¥ng's mother. Spiritually, he proclaimed himself as an incarnation of Indra and as the fulfillment of a popular prophecy. This combination quickly gave rise to a large following in his home district of Thuy Duong and the adjacent ƒê√¥ng Tri·ªÅu, where \\"all bowed down to him like grass before the wind\\". In early 1516, C·∫£o recruited fighters at Quynh Lam Pagoda in ƒê√¥ng Tri·ªÅu, a religious site reputed to have miraculous powers. After shaving their heads, he marched them unopposed, ten thousand strong, through the Kinh Bac districts of Que Duong and Ti√™n Du, down to the plains of Gia L√¢m to T·ª´ Li√™m in S∆°n T√¢y Province. This march took little more than ten days. With the insurgents only separated from the capital by the river, Tr·ªãnh Duy S·∫£n murdered the emperor L√™ T∆∞∆°ng D·ª±c and fled with his puppet successor L√™ Chi√™u T√¥ng, leaving the capital undefended. This time, chaos ensued. First a rival general, Nguy·ªÖn Ho√†ng D·ª• of the Nguy·ªÖn, turned his army loose to raze and loot. Then the inhabitants of the capital seized their chance to loot the palaces and administrative buildings of the hated former king, T∆∞∆°ng D·ª±c. Finally, Tr·∫ßn C·∫£o's forces marched into the capital, destroying the L√™ dynastic temple and proclaiming a new reign. These events dealt a heavy blow to L√™ prestige and legitimacy, as well as its capacity to rule. The court annals noted that \\"After Tran Cao entered the Capital and the tan mieu (the dynastic temple) was sacked, after [Nguy·ªÖn Ho√†ng D·ª•'s army] rebelled and the Capital was deserted\\", they wrote, \\"seeing this was enough to know that the Le could no longer prosper\\". Even when the Tr·ªãnh and Nguyen generals decided to combine against the rebels that threatened their privileges, it took months to push the rebels back to their H·∫£i D∆∞∆°ng-Kinh Bac border stronghold. There they fought at least one major battle, at Sung Nghiem, before retreating to a Kinh Bac area which they controlled until the royal forces finally overcame them in 1521. Before that, Tr·∫ßn C·∫£o had already transferred power to his son and become a monk. He then disappeared into the countryside, notwithstanding a reward of three hundred taels of gold and two thousand ares of land for his capture. The failure to apprehend him was despite the efforts of the populace who might have sought it, blaming him for the high death toll in ƒê√¥ng Tri·ªÅu, Giap Son, Yen Phong, Ti√™n Du, and Dong Ngan caused by starvation after vengeful L√™ royalists razed the area. He is believed to have died in far north-eastern Kinh Bac (later L·∫°ng S∆°n Province). At the end of the seventeenth century, nearly two hundred years later, three villages in B·∫£o L·ªôc district still worshipped his cult.

These methods quantify the number of interactions between genomic loci that are nearby in 3-D space, but may be separated by many nucleotides in the linear genome. Such interactions may result from biological functions, such as promoter-enhancer interactions, or from random polymer looping, where undirected physical motion of chromatin causes loci to collide. Interaction frequencies may be analyzed directly, or they may be converted to distances and used to reconstruct 3-D structures. The chief difference between 3C-based methods is their scope. For example, when using PCR to detect interaction in a 3C experiment, the interactions between two specific fragments are quantified. In contrast, Hi-C quantifies interactions between all possible pairs of fragments simultaneously. Deep sequencing of material produced by 3C also produces genome-wide interactions maps. History Historically, microscopy was the primary method of investigating nuclear organization, which can be dated back to 1590. Timeline of chromatin structure studies * In 1879, Walther Flemming coined the term chromatin. * In 1883, August Weismann connected chromatin with heredity. * In 1884, Albrecht Kossel discovered histones. * In 1888, Sutton and Boveri proposed the theory of continuity of chromatin during the cell cycle * In 1889, Wilhelm von Waldemeyer created the term \\"chromosome\\". * In 1928, Emil Heitz coined the term Heterochromatin and Euchromatin. * In 1942, Conrad Waddington postulated the epigenetic landscapes. * In 1948, Rollin Hotchkiss discovered DNA methylation. * In 1953, Watson and Crick discovered the double helix structure of DNA. * In 1961, Mary Lyon postulated the principle of X-inactivation. * In 1973/1974, chromatin fiber was discovered. * In 1975, Pierre Chambon coined the term nucleosomes. * In 1982, Chromosome territories were discovered. * In 1984, John T. Lis innovated the Chromatin immunoprecipitation technique. * In 1993, the Nuclear Ligation Assay was published, a method that could determine circularization frequencies of DNA in solution. This assay was used to show that estrogen induces an interaction between the prolactin gene promoter and a nearby enhancer. * In 2002, Job Dekker introduced the new idea that dense matrices of interaction frequencies between loci could be used to infer the spatial organization of genomes. This idea was the basis for his development of the chromosome conformation capture (3C) assay, published in 2002 by Job Dekker and colleagues in the Kleckner lab at Harvard University. * In 2003, the Human Genome Project was finished. * In 2006, Marieke Simonis invented 4C, Dostie, in the Dekker lab, invented 5C. * In 2007, B. Franklin Pugh innovated ChIP-seq technique. * In 2009, Lieberman-Aiden and Job Dekker invented Hi-C, Melissa J. Fullwood and Yijun Ruan invented ChIA-PET. * In 2012, The Ren group, and the groups led by Edith Heard and Job Dekker discovered Topologically Associating Domains (TADs) in mammals. *In 2013, Takashi Nagano and Peter Fraser introduced in-nuclei ligation for Hi-C and single-cell Hi-C. Experimental methods All 3C methods start with a similar set of steps, performed on a sample of cells. Comparison among 3C and its derived methods. First, the cell genomes are cross-linked with formaldehyde, which introduces bonds that \\"freeze\\" interactions between genomic loci. Treatment of cells with 1-3% formaldehyde, for 10-30min at room temperature is most common, however, standardization for preventing high protein-DNA cross linking is necessary, as this may negatively affect the efficiency of restriction digestion in the subsequent step. The genome is then cut into fragments with a restriction endonuclease. The size of restriction fragments determines the resolution of interaction mapping. Restriction enzymes (REs) that make cuts on 6bp recognition sequences, such as EcoR1 or HindIII, are used for this purpose, as they cut the genome once every 4000bp, giving ~ 1 million fragments in the human genome. For more precise interaction mapping, a 4bp recognizing RE may also be used. The next step is, proximity based ligation. This takes place at low DNA concentrations or within intact, permeabilized nuclei in the presence of T4 DNA ligase, such that ligation between cross-linked interacting fragments is favored over ligation between fragments that are not cross- linked. Subsequently, interacting loci are quantified by amplifying ligated junctions by PCR methods. =Original methods= 3C (one-vs-one) The chromosome conformation capture (3C) experiment quantifies interactions between a single pair of genomic loci. For example, 3C can be used to test a candidate promoter-enhancer interaction. Ligated fragments are detected using PCR with known primers. That is why this technique requires the prior knowledge of the interacting regions. 4C (one-vs-all) Chromosome conformation capture-on-chip (4C) captures interactions between one locus and all other genomic loci. It involves a second ligation step, to create self- circularized DNA fragments, which are used to perform inverse PCR. Inverse PCR allows the known sequence to be used to amplify the unknown sequence ligated to it. In contrast to 3C and 5C, the 4C technique does not require the prior knowledge of both interacting chromosomal regions. Results obtained using 4C are highly reproducible with most of the interactions that are detected between regions proximal to one another. On a single microarray, approximately a million interactions can be analyzed. 5C (many-vs-many) Chromosome conformation capture carbon copy (5C) detects interactions between all restriction fragments within a given region, with this region's size typically no greater than a megabase. This is done by ligating universal primers to all fragments. However, 5C has relatively low coverage. The 5C technique overcomes the junctional problems at the intramolecular ligation step and is useful for constructing complex interactions of specific loci of interest. This approach is unsuitable for conducting genome-wide complex interactions since that will require millions of 5C primers to be used.  Hi-C (all-vs-all)  Hi-C uses high-throughput sequencing to find the nucleotide sequence of fragments and uses paired end sequencing, which retrieves a short sequence from each end of each ligated fragment. As such, for a given ligated fragment, the two sequences obtained should represent two different restriction fragments that were ligated together in the proximity based ligation step. The pair of sequences are individually aligned to the genome, thus determining the fragments involved in that ligation event. Hence, all possible pairwise interactions between fragments are tested. =Sequence capture-based methods= A number of methods use oligonucleotide capture to enrich 3C and Hi-C libraries for specific loci of interest. These methods include Capture-C, NG Capture-C, Capture-3C, and Capture Hi-C. These methods are able to produce higher resolution and sensitivity than 4C based methods. =Single-cell methods= Single-cell adaptations of these methods, such as ChIP-seq and Hi-C can be used to investigate the interactions occurring in individual cells. =Immunoprecipitation-based methods= ChIP-loop ChIP-loop combines 3C with ChIP-seq to detect interactions between two loci of interest mediated by a protein of interest. The ChIP-loop may be useful in identifying long- range cis-interactions and trans interaction mediated through proteins since frequent DNA collisions will not occur. Genome wide methods ChIA-PET combines Hi-C with ChIP-seq to detect all interactions mediated by a protein of interest. HiChIP was designed to allow similar analysis as ChIA-PET with less input material. Biological impact 3C methods have led to a number of biological insights, including the discovery of new structural features of chromosomes, the cataloguing of chromatin loops, and increased understanding of transcriptional regulation mechanisms (the disruption of which can lead to disease). 3C methods have demonstrated the importance of spatial proximity of regulatory elements to the genes that they regulate. For example, in tissues that express globin genes, the Œ≤-globin locus control region forms a loop with these genes. This loop is not found in tissues where the gene is not expressed. This technology has further aided the genetic and epigenetic study of chromosomes both in model organisms and in humans. These methods have revealed large-scale organization of the genome into topologically associating domains (TADs), which correlate with epigenetic markers. Some TADs are transcriptionally active, while others are repressed. Many TADs have been found in D. melanogaster, mouse and human. Moreover, CTCF and cohesin play important roles in determining TADs and enhancer-promoter interactions. The result shows that the orientation of CTCF binding motifs in an enhancer- promoter loop should be facing to each other in order for the enhancer to find its correct target. =Human disease= There are several diseases caused by defects in promoter-enhancer interactions, which is reviewed in this paper. Beta thalassemia is a certain type of blood disorders caused by a deletion of LCR enhancer element. Holoprosencephaly is cephalic disorder caused by a mutation in the SBE2 enhancer element, which in turn weakened the production of SHH gene. PPD2 (polydactyly of a triphalangeal thumb) is caused by a mutation of ZRS enhancer, which in turn strengthened the production of SHH gene. Adenocarcinoma of the lung can be caused by a duplication of enhancer element for MYC gene. T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia is caused by an introduction of a new enhancer.

Circular plot of the bipartite mouse X chromosome, generated by the Epigenome Browser. Image from The different 3C-style experiments produce data with very different structures and statistical properties. As such, specific analysis packages exist for each experiment type. Hi-C data is often used to analyze genome-wide chromatin organization, such as topologically associating domains (TADs), linearly contiguous regions of the genome that are associated in 3-D space. Several algorithms have been developed to identify TADs from Hi-C data. Hi-C and its subsequent analyses are evolving. Fit-Hi-C is a method based on a discrete binning approach with modifications of adding distance of interaction (initial spline fitting, aka spline-1) and refining the null model (spline-2). The result of Fit-Hi-C is a list of pairwise intra-chromosomal interactions with their p-values and q-values. The 3-D organization of the genome can also be analyzed via eigendecomposition of the contact matrix. Each eigenvector corresponds to a set of loci, which are not necessarily linearly contiguous, that share structural features. A significant confounding factor in 3C technologies is the frequent non-specific interactions between genomic loci that occur due to random polymer behavior. An interaction between two loci must be confirmed as specific through statistical significance testing. = Normalization of Hi-C contact map = There are two major ways of normalizing raw Hi-C contact heat maps. The first way is to assume equal visibility, meaning there is an equal chance for each chromosomal position to have an interaction. Therefore, the true signal of a Hi-C contact map should be a balanced matrix (Balanced matrix has constant row sums and column sums). An example of algorithms that assumes equal visibility is Sinkhorn-Knopp algorithm, which scales the raw Hi-C contact map into a balanced matrix. The other way is to assume there is a bias associated with each chromosomal position. The contact map value at each coordinate will be the true signal at that position times bias associated with the two contact positions. An example of algorithms that aim to solve this model of bias is iterative correction, which iteratively regressed out row and column bias from the raw Hi-C contact map. There are a number of software tools available for analysis of Hi-C data. = DNA motif analysis = DNA motifs are specific short DNA sequences, often 8-20 nucleotides in length which are statistically overrepresented in a set of sequences with a common biological function. Currently, regulatory motifs on the long-range chromatin interactions have not been studied extensively. Several studies have focused on elucidating the impact of DNA motifs in promoter-enhancer interactions. Bailey et al. has identified that ZNF143 motif in the promoter regions provides sequence specificity for promoter-enhancer interactions.Bailey, S. D., Zhang, X., Desai, K., Aid, M., Corradin, O., Cowper-Sal¬∑lari, R., ‚Ä¶ Lupien, M. (2015). ZNF143 provides sequence specificity to secure chromatin interactions at gene promoters. Nature Communications, 2, 6186. Retrieved from https://doi.org/10.1038/ncomms7186 Mutation of ZNF143 motif decreased the frequency of promoter-enhancer interactions suggesting that ZNF143 is a novel chromatin-looping factor. For genome-scale motif analysis, in 2016, Wong et al. reported a list of 19,491 DNA motif pairs for K562 cell line on the promoter-enhancer interactions.K. Wong, Y. Li, and C. Peng, ‚ÄúIdentification of coupling DNA motif pairs on long-range chromatin interactions in human,‚Äù vol. 32, no. September 2015, pp. 321‚Äì324, 2016. As a result, they proposed that motif pairing multiplicity (number of motifs that are paired with a given motif) is linked to interaction distance and regulatory region type. In the next year, Wong published another article reporting 18,879 motif pairs in 6 human cell lines.Ka-Chun Wong; MotifHyades: expectation maximization for de novo DNA motif pair discovery on paired sequences, Bioinformatics, Volume 33, Issue 19, 1 October 2017, Pages 3028‚Äì3035, https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btx381 A novel contribution of this work is MotifHyades, a motif discovery tool that can be directly applied to paired sequences. = Cancer genome analysis = The 3C-based techniques can provide insights into the chromosomal rearrangements in the cancer genomes. Moreover, they can show changes of spatial proximity for regulatory elements and their target genes, which bring deeper understanding of the structural and functional basis of the genome.

From 2002 to 2017, he competed on the Professional Bull Riders (PBR) tour. He is the 2004 PBR World Champion. Lee announced his retirement from the PBR in January 2018. He now competes in the Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association (PRCA) and Tuff Hedeman Bull Riding Tour (THBRT). He also competed in Championship Bull Riding (CBR). Career milestones Lee rode bulls while growing up, and he joined the PBR Touring Pro Division when he was 18 years old. Lee also competed in the Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association and filled his permit within months. Lee first broke onto the PBR scene in 2002. He became the first rider to win both the PBR World Finals event title and World Championship simultaneously, which he accomplished in 2004. He is also the first rider to win the PBR World Championship without a regular-season event win. He qualified for the PBR World Finals every single year from 2002 to 2017. Lee was an early adapter among bull riders who favored a helmet to the familiar cowboy hat, which he attributes to avoidance and exacerbation of career and life-threatening injuries. He credits the helmet for having saved his life after incurring a severe head injury and skull fracture at a PRCA rodeo in Fort Smith, Arkansas, in 2003, which required brain surgery. Lee is the first world champion bull rider to compete his entire professional career with a helmet. The year 2007 was a difficult year professionally for him due to severe head injuries. On Saturday night, April 16, 2016, in the Stanley Performance In Action Invitational, in Billings, Montana (Lee‚Äôs place of birth), he joined Guilherme Marchi as the second bull rider in PBR history to complete 500 qualified rides. He rode Tahonta's Magic for 86.75 points during Round 2. At that time, Lee was 500-for-1,068 (46.82 percent) in his Built Ford Tough Series (BFTS) career. He has 14 event wins, 23 90-points rides, and one gold buckle (championship). He has obtained 50 or more qualified rides in a season three times. One time was a career best of 54 qualified rides in 2008. About all of his success at the time of his 500 ride accomplishment, Lee had this to say, \\"It is all thanks to God that I am still here,\\" Lee concluded. \\"Just to stay healthy and be blessed this much is something to be happy for and have joy for.\\" Lee qualified for the PBR World Finals a record sixteen consecutive times (2002-2017). In November, 2017 Lee announced via Facebook that he was going to focus his bull riding career in other associations. He rode in 2018 on the Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association (PRCA) and Tuff Hedeman Bull Riding (THBR) tours. Faith on the road Lee credits his successes to his Christian faith. \\"Taking a knee after each ride, no matter the outcome, Lee thanks God on the arena for safety and protection. Lee has a cross appliqu√© on his chaps and, whenever a fan asks for a signature, he accompanies it with three crosses\\". Lee was an instructor at the former Christian Bull Riding and Bull Fighting School which was held at the Frost Ranch in Lane, Oklahoma. It was an annual event in honor of Lane Frost, an iconic bull rider who died of injuries from a bucking bull in Cheyenne, Wyoming. On October 8, 2017, the school announced it was closing. It ran every June from 2005 to 2016. Personal life Lee was born in Billings, Montana, on June 11, 1983. When he was 4 years old, the family moved to Paradise, Texas. Later on, they moved to Decatur, Texas, where he still lives.

Historically, there has been an anthropocentric tendency to emphasize the study of animal psychopathologies as models for human mental illnesses.Owen, J. B., Treasure, J.L. & Collier, D.A. 2001. Animal Models- Disorders of Eating Behaviour and Body Composition. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Norwell; Massachusetts. But animal psychopathologies can, from an evolutionary point of view, be more properly regarded as non-adaptive behaviors due to some sort of a cognitive disability, emotional impairment or distress. This article provides a non-exhaustive list of animal psychopathologies. Eating disorders Animals in the wild appear to be relatively free from eating disorders although their body composition fluctuates depending on seasonal and reproductive cycles. However, domesticated animals including farm, laboratory, and pet animals are prone to disorders. Evolutionary fitness drives feeding behavior in wild animals. The expectation is that farm animals also display this behavior, but questions arise if the same principles apply to laboratory and pet animals. =Activity anorexia= Activity anorexia (AA) is a condition where rats begin to exercise excessively while simultaneously cutting down on their food intake, similar to human anorexia nervosa or hypergymnasia. When given free access to food and an exercise wheel, rats normally develop a balanced routine between exercise and food intake, which turns them into fit rats. However, if food intake is restricted and wheel access is unrestricted, rats begin to exercise more and eat less, resulting in excessive weight loss and, ultimately, death. The running cycles shift so that most of the running is done in hours before feeding is scheduled. In other conditions, AA does not develop. Unrestricted food access and restricted wheel access will not cause any significant change in either feeding or exercise routine. Also, if rats are restricted both in food intake and wheel access, they will adjust accordingly. In fact, if rats are first trained to the feeding schedule and then given unrestricted access to a running wheel, they will not develop AA behavior. Results support the notion that the running interferes with adaptation to the new feeding schedule and is associated with the reward system in the brain. One theory is that running simulates foraging, a natural behavior in wild rats. Laboratory rats therefore run (forage) more in response to food shortages. The effect of semi- starvation on activity has also been studied in primates. Rhesus macaque males become hyperactive in response to long-term chronic food restriction. =Thin sow syndrome= Thin Sow Syndrome (TSS) is a behavior observed in stalled sows that is similar to AA where some sows after early pregnancy are extremely active, eat little, and waste away, resulting very often in death. They suffer from emaciation, hypothermia, a depraved appetite, restlessness, and hyperactivity. The syndrome may mainly be related to social and environmental stressors. Stress in stalled sows is often perceived as the consequence of the restraint of animals that happens in intensive production units. The sows that suffer the most restraining conditions are those lactating or pregnant as they have very little room to move around because they are kept in barred gestation crates or tethered for the 16 weeks of pregnancy which prevents natural and social behaviors.Radostits, O.M. 2000. Veterinary Medicine: A Textbook of the Diseases of Cattle, Sheep, Pigs, Goats and Horses. Saunders Ltd.; 9th edition, pp. 1767. However, increased movement and freedom is also stressful for adult sows, which is usually the case after weaning. When placed into groups they fight vigorously, with one dominant sow emerging that eats voraciously. It is also likely that two subordinate sows make up part of the group who actively avoid competitive feeding situations and are bullied by the dominant sow. Affected sows have poor appetite but often show pica, excessive water intake (polydipsia) and are anemic. Studies on the effects of overcrowding were conducted in the 1940s by placing pregnant Norway rats in a room with plenty of water and food and observing the population growth. The population reached a number of individuals and did not grow thereafter; overcrowding produced stress and psychopathologies. Even though there was plenty of water and food, the rats stopped eating and reproducing. Similar effects have also been observed in dense populations of beetles. When overcrowding occurs, female beetles destroy their eggs and turn cannibalistic, eating each other. Male beetles lose interest in the females and although there is plenty of water and food, there is no population growth. Similar effects have been observed in overcrowded situations in jack rabbits and deer.Time Magazine website in the Health and Science section. A Self-Corrective for The Population Explosion? Published Feb. 28, 1964. http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,873834-1,00.html =Pica= Pica is the ingestion of non-nutritive substances and has so far been poorly documented. In non-human animals in the laboratory it has been examined through the ingestion of kaolin (a clay mineral) by rats. Rats were induced to intake kaolin by administering various emetic stimuli such as copper sulfate, apomorphine, cisplatin, and motion. Rats are unable to vomit when they ingest a substance that is harmful thus pica in rats is analogous to vomiting in other species; it is a way for rats to relieve digestive distress. In some animals pica seems to be an adaptive trait but in others it seems to be a true psychopathology like in the case of some chickens. Chickens can display a type of pica when they are feed-deprived (feeding restriction has been adopted by the egg industry to induce molting). They increase their non-nutritive pecking, such as pecking structural features of their environment like wood or wire on fences or the feathers of other birds. It is a typical response that occurs when feeding is restricted or is completely withdrawn. Some of the non- nutritive pecking may be due to a redirection of foraging related behavior. Another animal that has displayed a more complex pica example are cattle. Cattle eat bones when they have a phosphorus deficiency. However, in some cases they persist on eating bones even after their phosphorus levels have stabilized and they are getting adequate doses of phosphorus in their diet. In this case evidence supports both a physical and psychological adaptive response. Cattle that continue to eat bones after their phosphorus levels are adequate do it because of a psychological reinforcer. \\"The persistence of pica in the seeming absence of a physiological cause might be due to the fortuitous acquisition of a conditioned illness during the period of physiological insult.\\" Cats also display pica behavior in their natural environments and there is evidence to support that this behavior has a psychological aspect to it. Some breeds (such as the Siamese cat) are more predisposed to showing this type of behavior than other breeds, but several types of breeds have been documented to show pica. Cats have been observed to start by chewing and sucking on non-nutritive substances like wool, cotton, rubber, plastic and even cardboard and then progress into ingestion of these substances. This type of behavior occurs through the first four years of a cat's life but it is primarily observed during the first two months of life when cats are introduced into new homes is most common. Theories explaining why this behavior becomes active during this time suggest that early weaning and stress as a consequence of separation from the mother and litter-mates and exposure to a new environment are to blame. Eating wool or other substances may be a soothing mechanism that cats develops to cope with the changes. Pica is also observed predominately during 6‚Äì8 months of a cat's life when territorial and sexual behaviors emerge. Pica may be induced by these social stressors. Other theories contemplated include pica as a redirection of prey-catching/ingestion behavior as a result of indoor confinement, especially common among oriental breeds due to risk of theft. In natural environments pica has been observed in parrots (such as macaws) and other birds and mammals. Charles Munn has been studying Amazon macaws lick clay from riverbeds in the Amazon to detoxify the seeds they eat. Amazon macaws spend two to three hours a day licking clay.Alcock, J.2005. Animal Behavior: An Evolutionary Approach. Sinaur Associates, Inc; 8th Edition. Munn has found that clay helps counter the tannin and alkaloid in the seeds the macaws ingest, a strategy that is also used by native cultures in the Andes Mountains in Peru. Pica also affects domesticated animals. While drugs like Prozac are often able to diminish troublesome behaviors in pet dogs, they don't seem to help with this eating disorder. The following story about Bumbley, a wire fox terrier who appeared on 20/20 as a result of his eating disorder, is taken from a book by Dr. Nicholas Dodman:Dodman, Nicholas. 1999. Dogs Behaving Badly: An A-to-Z Guide to Understanding & Curing Behavioral Problems in Dogs. Bantam Books: New York. pp. 54-55 > This dog's presenting problem was light chasing (otherwise known as shadow > chasing). It chased shadows for hours on end, even excavating through > plasterboard walls to pursue its will-o'-the-wisp illusions...The one thing > that didn't come across clearly in the show was that Bumbley ate everything > in sight and the house had to be \\"Bumbley-proofed\\" against his relentless > ingestion of anything his owners left around...He had already had surgery to > relieve intestinal obstructions resulting from his habit and, each day, his > owners reentered their house with trepidation after work, fearing that > Bumbley might have eaten something else. Dodman talks about new research relating bulimia and compulsive overeating to seizural behavior in human patients. He suggests that anti-epileptic medication might be a possible treatment for some cases of pica in animals. Behavioral disorders Behavioral disorders are difficult to study in animal models because it is difficult to know what animals are thinking and because animal models used to assess psychopathologies are experimental preparations developed to study a condition. Can a monkey effectively communicate that he is sad or that he feels overwhelmed? Lacking the ability to use language to study behavioral disorders like depression and stress questions the validity of those studies conducted. It can be difficult to attribute human afflictions to non-human animals. =Obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD)= Obsessive compulsive behavior in animals, often called \\"stereotypy\\" or \\"stereotypical behavior\\" can be defined as a specific, unnecessary action (or series of actions) repeated more often than would normally be expected. It is unknown whether animals are able to 'obsess' in the same way as humans, and because the motivation for compulsive acts in non-human animals is unknown, the term \\"abnormal repetitive behaviour\\" is less misleading. A wide variety of animals exhibit behaviors that can be considered abnormally repetitive. Ritualized and stereotyped behaviors Though obsessive-compulsive behaviors are often considered to be pathological or maladaptive, some ritualized and stereotyped behaviors are beneficial. These are usually known as \\"fixed action patterns\\". These behaviors sometimes share characteristics with obsessive-compulsive behavior, including a high degree of similarity in form and use among many individuals and a repetitive dimension. There are many observable animal behaviors with characteristic, highly conserved patterns. One example is grooming behavior in rats. This behavior is defined by a specific sequence of actions that does not normally differ between individual rats. The rat first begins by stroking its whiskers, then expands the stroking motion to include the eyes and the ears, finally moving on to lick both sides of its body. Other behaviors may be added to the end of this chain, but these four actions themselves are fixed. Its ubiquity and high degree of stereotypy suggest that this is a beneficial behavior pattern which has been maintained throughout evolutionary history. Although humans and animals both have pathological stereotyped behaviors, they do not necessarily provide a similar model of OCD. Feather picking in orange-winged amazon parrots has both a genetic component, with the behavior being more likely in one sibling if the other does it, and more common in parrots close to a door when they were housed in groups. The same study found that feather picking was more common in females and that there was no social transmission of the behavior; neighbors of feather picking birds were only more likely to show the behavior as well if they were related. An evolutionary basis Some researchers believe that disadvantageous obsessive compulsive behaviors can be thought of as a normally beneficial process gone too far. Br√ºne (2006) suggests that change of various origin in striatal and frontal brain circuits, which play a role in predicting needs and threats that may arise in the future, may result in a hyperactive cognitive harm avoidance system, in which a person becomes consciously and unreasonably fearful of an unlikely or impossible event. This may also be true in other animals. Genetic factors Canine compulsions are more common in some breeds and behavioral dispositions are often shared within the same litter. This suggests that there is a genetic factor to the disorder. A questionnaire to dog owners and a blood sample of 181 dogs from four breeds, miniature and standard bull terriers, German shepherds, and Staffordshire bull terriers showed these to be more susceptible to compulsive and repetitive behaviors. It is suggested that the more we learn through studying OCD in dogs, the more we can to understand human biology and the genetics involved in the heredity of susceptibility to disorders such as OCD.Miller, J.A. (1992). Look who's clucking! Bioscience, (42:4), 257-259. A chromosome has been located in dogs that confers a high risk of susceptibility to OCD.Pharma Business Week. (January 2010). Canine compulsive disorder gene identified in dogs. Pp. 118. Canine chromosome 7 has been found to be most significantly associated with obsessive compulsive disorder in dogs, or more specifically, canine compulsive disorder (CCD). This breakthrough helped further relate OCD in humans to CCD in canines. Canine chromosome 7 is expressed in the hippocampus of the brain, the same area that Obsessive Compulsive Disorder is expressed in human patients. Similar pathways are involved in drug treatment responses for both humans and dogs, offering more research that the two creatures exhibit symptoms and respond to treatment in similar ways. This data can help scientists to discover more effective and efficient ways to treat OCD in humans through the information they find by studying CCD in dogs. Animal models Animals exhibiting obsessive and compulsive behaviors that resemble OCD in humans have been used as a tool for elucidating possible genetic influences on the disease, potential treatments, and to better understand the pathology of this behavior in general. While such models are useful, they are also limited; it is unclear whether the behavior is ego dystonic in animals. That is, it is difficult to evaluate whether an animal is aware that its behavior is excessive and unreasonable and whether this awareness is a source of anxiety. One study done by Simon Vermeier used neuroimaging to investigate serotonergic and dopaminergic neurotransmission in 9 dogs with Canine Compulsive Disorder (CCD) to measure the serotonin 2A receptor availability. When compared to the 15 non-compulsive dogs used as a control group, the dogs with CCD were found to have lower receptor availability as well as lower subcortical perfusion and hypothalamic availability. The results of this study provide evidence that there are imbalanced serotonergic and dopaminergic pathways in dogs. Similarities between other studies about human OCD provide construct validity for this study, which suggests that the research will be valid and useful in continuing to investigate brain activity and drug treatment in Obsessive Compulsive Disorder. Some treatment has been given to dogs with CCD to observe their reactions and how they are similar or different from how humans would react to the same pharmaceutical or behavioral treatment. A combination of the two approaches has been found to be most effective in lowering the intensity and regularity of OCD in both canines and humans. Pharmaceutically, clomipramine was found to be more effective than an alternative chemical, amitriptyline, in treatments for dogs. One study by Karen Overall discovered that by combining behavioral therapy with the more effective clomipramine, the symptoms of Canine Compulsive Disorder decreased by over 50% for all of the dogs involved in the study. Overall acknowledges that OCD is not something that can be completely cured, but studies like this are still important because Obsessive Compulsive Disorder can be controlled effectively enough so it does not interfere with one's life, a valuable and commonly sought after thing for those who suffer from the disorder. Alicia Graef's article Graef, A. (October 2013). Can dogs lead us to a cure for obsessive-compulsive disorder? Care 2 Make a Difference. http://www.care2.com/causes/can-dogs-lead-us-to-a-cure-for-obsessive- compulsive-disorder.html makes several bold claims that dogs are the future in understanding how to better diagnose, recognize, and treat Obsessive Compulsive Disorder in humans. There is evidence supporting her statements, but the connection between CCD and OCD is not clearly understood. So far, studies have proved that effective treatments in dogs are similarly effective for humans, but there are still so many things unknown. Obsessive Compulsive Disorder is a unique mental disorder that cannot be fully cured. It can be controlled and understood, and one possible way of better doing that might be through studying CCD in canines. Studying dogs that exhibit compulsive behaviors has led scientists to genetic breakthroughs in understanding more how biology and genetics factor into Obsessive Compulsive Disorder. By observing and studying how CCD manifests in the brain activity, behaviors, and genes of diagnosed canines, scientists have been able to use their newfound information to develop better diagnostic tests and more readily recognize symptoms and susceptible humans. The similar brain functions and behaviors of dogs with CCD and humans with OCD suggests they have a connection, not only in behavior and symptoms, but in reacting to treatments. Understanding Canine Compulsive Disorder in dogs has helped scientists to better understand and apply their learning to developing new and more effective ways to treat Obsessive Compulsive Disorder in humans. Some examples of ways in which rats and mice, two of the most common animal models, have been used to represent human OCD are provided below. Lever pressing in rats Certain laboratory rat strains that have been created by controlled breeding for many generations show a higher tendency towards compulsive behaviors than other strains. Lewis rats show more compulsive lever pressing behavior than Sprague Dawley or Wistar rats and are less responsive to the anti-compulsive drug paroxetine. In this study, rats were taught to press a lever to receive food in an operant conditioning task. Once food was no longer provided when they pressed the lever, rats were expected to stop pressing it. Lewis rats pressed the lever more often than the other two types, even though they had presumably learned that they would not receive food, and continued to press it more often even after treatment with the drug. An analysis of the genetic differences between the three rat strains might help to identify genes that might be responsible for the compulsive behavior. Rats have also been used to test the possibility of a problem with dopamine levels in the brains of animals that exhibit compulsive checking behavior. After treating rats with quinpirole, a chemical that specifically blocks dopamine D2/D3 receptors, compulsive checking of certain locations in an open field increased. Some components of the checking behavior, such as the level of stereotypy in the path animals took to checked locations, the number of checks, and the length of the checks indicated an increase in compulsivity as doses of quinpirole increased; other components, such as the time taken to return from the checked location to the starting point and the time taken to make that trip remained constant after the initial injection throughout the experiment. This means that there might be both an all-or-none and a sensitization aspect in the biology of the dopamine deficiency model of OCD. In addition, quinpirole might reduce a sense of satisfaction in the rats after they check a location, causing them to return to that location again and again. Estrogen deficiency in male mice Based on findings of changes in OCD symptoms in menstruating women and differences in the development of the disease between men and women, Hill and colleagues set out to research the effect of estrogen deprivation on the development of compulsive behavior in mice. Male mice with an aromatase Gene knockout who were unable to produce estrogen showed excessive grooming and wheel running behaviors, but female mice did not. When treated with 17Œ≤-estradiol, which replaced estrogen in these mice, the behaviors disappeared. This study also found that COMT protein levels decreased in mice that did not produce estrogen and increased in the hypothalamus after estrogen-replacement treatment. Briefly, the COMT protein is involved in degrading some neurotransmitters, including dopamine, norepinephrine and epinephrine. This data suggests that there may be a hormonal component and a hormone-gene interaction effect that may contribute to obsessive behaviors. Pets Lick granuloma from excessive licking Dr. Nicholas Dodman describes a wide variety of OCD-like behaviors in his book Dogs Behaving Badly.Dodman, Nicholas. 1999. Dogs Behaving Badly: An A-to-Z Guide to Understanding & Curing Behavioral Problems in Dogs. Bantam Books: New York. Such behaviors typically appear when the dog is placed in a stressful situation, including an environment that is not very stimulating, or in dogs with a history of abuse. Different breeds of dog seem to display different compulsions. Lick granuloma, or licking repeatedly until ulcers form on the skin, affects more large dogs, like Labradors, golden retrievers, Great Danes, and Dobermans, while bull terriers, German shepherds, Old English sheepdogs, Rottweilers, wire-haired fox terriers, and springer spaniels are more likely to snap at imaginary flies or chase light and shadows. These associations probably have an evolutionary basis, although Dodman does not clearly explain that aspect of the behaviors. Louis Shuster and Nicholas Dodman noticed that dogs often demonstrate obsessive and compulsive behaviors similar to humans. Canine Compulsive Disorder (CCD) is not only specific to certain breeds of dogs, but the breed may affect the specific types of compulsions. For example, bull terriers frequently exhibit obsessively predatory or aggressive behaviors.Anxiety and compulsive disorders in dogs. (2013). PetMD. http://www.petmd.com/dog/conditions/behavioral. Breed may factor into the types of compulsions, but some behaviors are more common across the canine spectrum. Most commonly, CCD is seen in canines as they repeat behaviors such as chasing their tails, compulsively chewing on objects, or licking their paws excessively, similar to the common hand-washing compulsion many people with Obsessive Compulsive Disorder have. Hallucinating and attacking the air around their head, as if there were a bug there, is another compulsion that has been seen in some dogs. Circling, hair biting, staring, and sometimes even barking are other examples of behaviors that are considered compulsions in dogs when taken to extreme, repetitive actions. Treatment (pharmaceutical) Dodman advocates the use of exercise, an enriched environment (like providing noises for dogs to listen to while owners are at work), and often Prozac (an SSRI used to treat OCD in humans) as treatments. Shuster and Dodman tested pharmaceutical treatment on canines with CCD to see if it would work as effectively as it does in humans. They used glutamate receptor blockers (memantine) and fluoxetine, commonly known as the antidepressant Prozac, to treat and observe the reactions of 11 dogs with compulsions. Seven of the 11 dogs significantly reduced their compulsions in intensity and frequency after receiving medication. Dodman includes a story about Hogan, a castrated deaf male Dalmatian, and his compulsive behavior. Hogan had a history of neglect and abuse before he was adopted by Connie and Jim, who attempted to improve his behavior by teaching him to respond to American Sign Language. The following are some excerpts from Hogan's file:Dodman, Nicholas. 1999. Dogs Behaving Badly: An A-to-Z Guide to Understanding & Curing Behavioral Problems in Dogs. Bantam Books: New York. pp. 33‚Äì36. > All was well for a year and a half when suddenly, one March morning, he woke > up and started pawing everything in sight, and just wouldn't stop.

Eating sugary foods causes the brain to release natural chemicals called opioids and dopamine in the limbic system. Tasty food can activate opioid receptors in the ventral tegmental area and thereby stimulate cells that release dopamine in the nucleus accumbens (NAc). The brain recognizes the intense pleasure derived from the dopamine and opioids release and learns to crave more sugar. Dependence is created through these natural rewards, the sugary treats, and the opioid and dopamine released into the synapses of the mesolimbic system. The hippocampus, the insula and the caudate activate when rats crave sugar, which are the same areas that become active when drug addicts crave the drug. Sugar is good because it provides energy, but if the nervous system goes through a change and the body becomes dependent on the sugar intake, somatic signs of withdrawal begin to appear like chattering teeth, forepaw tremors and head shakes when sugar is not ingested. Morphine tolerance, a measure of addiction, was observed in rats and their tolerance on Morphine was attributed to environmental cues and the systemic effects of the drug. Morphine tolerance does not depend merely on the frequency of pharmacological stimulation, but rather on both the number of pairings of a drug-predictive cue with the systemic effects of the drug. Rats became significantly more tolerant to morphine when they had been exposed to a paired administration than those rats that were not administered a drug-predictive cue along with the morphine. =Depression= Using dogs, Martin Seligman and his colleagues pioneered the study of depression in the animal model of learned helplessness at the University of Pennsylvania. Dogs were separated into three groups, the control group, group A had control over when they were being shocked and group B had no control over when they were being electrocuted. After the shocking condition, the dogs were tested in a shuttle box where they could escape shock by jumping over a partition. To eliminate an interference effect ‚Äì that the dogs did not learn responses while being shocked that would interfere with their normal escape behavior ‚Äì the dogs were immobilized using curare, a paralyzing drug while they were being shocked. Both the control group and group A tended to jump over the partition to escape shock while group B dogs did not jump and would passively take the shock. The dogs in group B perceived that the outcome was not related to their efforts. Hahner, K. Learned Helplessness: A Critique of Research and Theory. On the Americans Europeans Japanese for Medical Advancement Website. Consequently, a theory emerged that attributed the behavior of the animals to the effects of the shock as a stressor so extreme that it depleted a neurochemical needed by the animals for movement. After the dogs study the effects of helplessness have been tested in species from fish to cats. Most recently learned helplessness has been studied in rhesus macaques using inescapable shock, evoked through stress situations like forced swimming, behavioral despair tasks, tails suspension and pinch induced catalepsy; situations that render the monkey incapable of controlling the environment. Depression and low mood were found to be of a communicative nature. They signal yielding in a hierarchy conflict or a need for help. Low mood or extreme low mood (also known as depression) can regulate a pattern of engagement and foster disengagement from unattainable goals. \\"Low mood increases an organism's ability to cope with the adaptive challenges characteristic of unpropitious situations in which effort to pursue a major goal will likely result in danger, loss, bodily damage, or wasted effort.\\" Being apathetic can have a fitness advantage for the organism. Depression has also been studied as a behavioral strategy used by vertebrates to increase their personal or inclusive fitness in the threat of parasites and pathogens. The lack of neurogenesis has been linked to depression. Animals with stress (isolated, cortisol levels) show a decrease in neurogenesis and antidepressants have been discovered to promote neurogenesis. Rene Hen and his colleagues at Columbia University ran a study on rats in which they blocked neurogenesis by applying radiation to the hippocampal area to test the efficacy of antidepressants. Results suggested that antidepressants failed to work when neurogenesis was inhibited. =Stress= Robert Sapolsky has extensively studied baboons in their natural environment in the Serengeti in Africa. He noticed that baboons have very similar hierarchies in their society as do humans. They spend very few hours searching for food and fulfilling their primary needs, leaving them with time to develop their social network. In primates, mental stresses show up in the body. Primates experience psychological stresses that can elicit physiological responses that, over time, can make them sick. Sapolsky observed the baboons' ranks, personalities and social affiliations, then collected blood samples of the baboons to control the cortisol (stress hormone) levels of the baboons, then matched social position to cortisol levels. Most of the data have been collected from male baboons, because at any given time 80 percent of the females were pregnant.Levy, D. 2001. We can all relate to stressed-out baboons. Standford Report. Three factors influenced a baboon's cortisol levels: friendships, perspective, and rank. Baboons had lower levels of cortisol if they 1. played with infants and cultivated friendships, 2. could tell if a situation was a real threat and could tell if they were going to win or lose, and 3. were top ranking. Cortisol levels rise with age and hippocampal cells express fewer hormone receptors on their surface to protect themselves from excess, making it harder to control stress levels. Cortisol levels are elevated in half of people suffering from major depression, it is the hippocampal region that is affected by both. Stress can have negative effects on gastrointestinal function causing ulcers, and it can also decrease sex drive, affect sleeping patterns and elevate blood pressure but it can also stimulate and motivate. When animals experience stress, they are generally more alert than when they are not stressed. It may help them be better aware of unfamiliar environments and possible threats to their life in these environments. Yerkes and Dodson developed a law that explains the empirical relationship between arousal and performance illustrated by an inverted U-shape graph.Ripped Enterprises website. http://cbass.com/Breakout.htm According to the Yerkes-Dodson Law, performance increases, as does cognitive arousal, but only to a certain point. The downward part of the U-shape is caused by stress and as stress increases so does efficiency and performance, but only to a certain point. When stress becomes too great, performance and efficiency decline. Sapolsky has also studied stress in rats and his results indicate that early experiences in young rats have strong, lasting effects. Rats that were exposed to human handling (a stressful situation) had finely-tuned stress responses that may have lowered their lifetime exposure to stress hormones compared to those that were not handled. In short: stress can be adaptive. The more exposure to stressful situations, the better the rat can handle that situation. =Stereotypies= Stereotypies are repetitive, sometimes abnormal behaviors like pacing on the perch for birds. There are adaptive stereotypic behaviors such as grooming in cats and preening in birds. Captive parrots commonly perform a range of stereotypies. These behaviors are repeated identically and lack any function or goal. Captive parrots perform striking oral and locomotor stereotypies like pacing on the perch or repetitive play with a certain toy. Feather picking and loud vocalizations can be stereotypies but are not as rigid and may be reactions to confinement, stress, boredom and loneliness as studies have shown that parrots that are in cages closest to the door are the most prone to feather pick or scream. Feather picking is not a true stereotypy and is more like hair pulling in human and loud vocalizations or screaming can be a stereotypy but vocalization is part of a parrot's natural behavior. Captive parrots lack sufficient stimulation. Presumably they suffer from lack of companionship and opportunities to forage. Stereotypies can evolve from the social environment for example the presence or absence of certain social stimuli, social isolation, low feeder space and high stocking density (especially for tail biting in pigs). These behaviors can also be transmitted through social learning. Bank voles, pigeons and pigs when housed next to animals that show stereotypies, pick them up as well as through stimulus enhancement which is what happens in tail biting in pigs and feather pecking by hens. Stereotypies may be coping mechanisms as results suggest from study on tethered and stalled sows. Sows that are tethered and stalled exhibited more stereotypies like licking and rubbing than sows that are in groups outdoors. This abnormal behavior seems to be related to opioid (related to the reward system) receptor density. In sows, prolonged confinement, being tethered or being in gestation crates, results in abnormal behaviors and stereotypies. Mu and Kappa receptors are associated with aversion behaviors and Mu receptor density is greater in tethered sows than sows that are in groups outdoors. However, sows with stereotypy behaviors experienced a decrease both in Mu and Kappa receptor density in the brain suggesting that inactivity increases Mu receptor density and stereotypy development decrease both kappa and Mu receptor density. =Self-aggression= Rhesus macaques have been observed to display self-aggression (SA) including self-biting, self- clasping, self-slapping, self-rubbing and threatening of body parts. The rhesus macaques observed were individually caged and free of disease. Their self-aggression level rose in stressful and stimulating conditions such as moving from one cage to another.Pond, C. L., & Rush, H. G. 1983. Self- aggression in macaques: Five case studies. Pimates, 24(1), 127-134. Stump- tailed macaques were studied to examine the source of their SA. SA increased in an impoverished environment and results support that SA may increase sensory input in poor environments. Captive macaques do not socialize the way wild macaques do which may affect SA. When allowed to socialize by putting another macaque in the cage or not putting them in a cage, SA levels in macaques decrease. Results indicate that SA is a form of redirected social aggression. SA is related to frustration and social status, especially in macaques that have an intermediate dominance rank.

One of the few remaining tatara is the Nittoho tatara in Shimane Prefecture, Japan. Etymology Working the bellows of a Tatara. It is generally agreed that the word tatara is foreign to Japan, originating in India or Central Asia. There is a possibility that the word came from a place in ancient Korea, where the two dynasties would often meet. According to the Kojiki (one of the oldest Japanese historical texts), this meeting place was called Tatara-ba („Åü„Åü„ÇâÂ†¥) or Tatara-tsu („Åü„Åü„ÇâÊ¥•), and the word was possibly imported with iron-working technology. Japanese scholar Tokutaro Yasuda suggests that the word may be from the Sanskrit word tƒÅtala, meaning \\"heat,\\" noting that the Hindi word for steel is sakeraa, which is very similar to the word kera (Èâß) used in Japan for the steel bloom which the tatara produces. The two Chinese characters used when the word has the original meaning are Ë∏èÈû¥ and, besides as tatara, they can be also read as fumifuigo, or foot bellows. Process The structure of a tatara. On the two sides of the furnace are visible two bellows The smelting process used differs from that of the modern mass production of steel. A clay vessel about 1.1 meters (4 feet) tall, 3 meters (12 feet) long, and 1.1 meters (4 feet) wide is constructed. This is the tatara. After the clay tub has dried, it is fired until dry. A charcoal fire is started from soft pine charcoal, then the smelter will wait for the fire to reach the correct temperature. At that point, he will direct the addition of ironsand, known as satetsu. This will be layered in with more charcoal and more ironsand over the next 72 hours. Four or five people need to constantly work on this process. Tamahagane, which is used to forge the blade of traditionally made Japanese blade nihonto. It takes about a week to build the tatara and complete the iron conversion to steel. When the process is done, the clay tub is broken and the steel bloom, known as a kera, is removed. At the end of the process, the tatara will have consumed about 10 tons of satetsu and 12 tons of charcoal, leaving about 2.5 tons of tamahagane.  The Nittoho Tatara  In 1977, the Japanese Society for Preservation of Japanese Art Swords (Nittoho), together with the Japanese government's Agency for Cultural Affairs and Hitachi Works, built in Shimane Prefecture the so-called Nittoho Tatara to provide the steel necessary for the production of Japanese swords. The Nittoho Tatara is managed jointly with Yasugi Works, a subsidiary company of Hitachi Metals, and is operational only during the winter.

The government was dissolved in 1988 and he was appointed as a caretaker Education Minister. During the first Benazir Bhutto government, Kanju for the first time became a part of the opposition headed by Nawaz Sharif. In the general elections of 1990, Kanju was for the third time elected Member of National Assembly from Lodhran, and at the behest of his friend and mentor Hamid Raza Gilani, joined the Nawaz Sharif cabinet as Minister of State for Foreign Affairs (1990‚Äì1993). During this period in 1991 he got changed Lodhran's status to a district, which was a tehsil of Multan District. In the General Elections of 1993, Kanju who was perceived as a success of the Muslim League, lost his National Assembly seat from Lodhran district. Jang reported his failure was due to extensive travel made as Minister of State and absence from the constituency. During the period 1993-1996 Kanju spent most of his time in Lodhran. He was again elected Member of National Assembly on Muslim League ticket. Once again he became part of Muhammad Nawaz Sharif's Cabinet, as Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, and served in this capacity until the Muslim League Government was dissolved by the military coup of 1999. When Mian Nawaz Sharif left the country, Siddiq Kanju with his group of members joined the new faction of Muslim League headed by Chaudry Shujjat Hussain, former Interior Minister under Nawaz Sharif, and Mian Azhar who was a former Governor of Punjab. During the local government elections of 2001, once again Kanju actively started campaign in his constituency. On 28 July when he was visiting a Counsellor shop in Kahror Pakka city, he was shot dead by three or four assassinsJuly 2001 Retrieved November 5, 2007. along with MajorMuhammad Aslam Khan Joiya, ex MPA . One of his party workers were also shot. The place where Kanju died was the same where he gave his maiden speech as an incumbent in 1977 and started his career in politics. Siddiq Kanju died at the age of 49 years. His burial was attended by thousands of people. People from all walks of life condemned this act, and President Musharraf responded by saying it was a big loss. Interior Minister Moin-u-din Haider and Governor Sind, later Chairman Senate, acting Prime Minister and President Muhammad Mian Soomro took special notice and directed IG Punjab to take strict action. Two assassins were arrested by the police later in 2002.

F. Valle (born June 2, 1953) is a Spanish-Brazilian physicist. Born in Brazil, he earned a PhD in Theoretical Physics from Syracuse University (New York, 1982). In January 1983 he joined the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, Oxfordshire, UK, as a Research Associate, where he got married with a Spanish geneticist. In 1986 he moved to Spain, joining as a visiting Professor at the Autonomous University of Barcelona, and subsequently IFIC (Instituto de F√≠sica Corpuscular) at the University of Valencia in 1987. He is a Full Professor at the Spanish Council for Scientific Research CSIC. He is known for his numerous contributions to theoretical astroparticle and high energy physics, especially neutrino physics. Valle has contributed significantly to the modern theory of neutrino mass. In a groundbreaking work with Joseph Schechter he has provided the first exhaustive discussion of the various mechanisms of neutrino mass generation (including the variants of the seesaw mechanism). The same authors also formulated the Schechter-Valle theorem demonstrating that an observation of neutrinoless double beta decay will necessarily imply neutrinos to be Majorana fermions and vice versa. He also contributed to the correct interpretation of the oscillations of solar and atmospheric neutrinos which led to the physics Nobel Prize 2015 awarded to Arthur B. McDonald and Takaaki Kajita. The discovery of neutrino masses and oscillations can be considered as the only firm indication of the incompleteness of the Standard Model of particle physics with important consequences also for astrophysics and cosmology.

Occasionally, the hardware is used percussively as well, the most common example being a rim shot. John Morrison is noted for his drum solos played entirely on a hi-hat stand (and occasionally also on other parts of the kit hardware, adjacent furniture, and audience). __TOC__ Drum parts =Rim= A drum \\"hoop\\" or \\"rim\\" may be made of metal, wood, or other materials and is used to hold a drumhead against a drum shell, either with bolts through metal \\"claws\\" attached directly to a hoop, or bolts through holes in a flanged or die-cast rim. The bolts, called tension rods, are screwed into threaded \\"lugs\\" attached to the drum shell, in order to tighten and tune the drumhead.International House of Blues Foundation. \\"Making a Drum\\" 2003 A drum key is a type of wrench often used to screw the tension rods into the lugs. =Spurs/bass drum legs, casings/lugs, and tension rods/tuning screws= There are a number of components that make up a drum's anatomy. Some of these anatomical components vary dependent upon the type of drum, the manufacturer, and the year in which it was made. However, nearly all modern drums have the same essential components. Kick drums often have legs called spurs on either side of the drum shell. These spurs are used to prevent the kick drum from rolling side to side, to prevent the drum from sliding forward as it is being played and to provide overall added stability to the drum. Casings, also known as lugs, vary in shape and size. They all serve the same purpose as the receiving end of the drum tension rod (also known as a tuning screw) and provide the anchor point for the tension rods themselves. Casings are found on nearly all modern drums. The number of casings a drum has can vary from drum to drum and manufacturer to manufacturer. A drum can have as little as six casings and as many as twelve. Tension rods, also known as tuning screws, are threaded bolts that are placed around the rim of a drum and screw into the casings. They enable the musician to adjust the tension of the drum's head and affect its overall pitch, tone, and timbre. They come in many lengths and should also always have a tension rod washer that is often made of metal or hard plastic. =Snare tensioner= Snare drums will often have a \\"strainer\\" on one side and a \\"butt plate\\" on the other to hold the snare wires to the drumhead. Snare tension is controlled with a screw on the strainer. A strainer may also have a \\"throwoff\\" lever to move snares away from the drumhead, in order to prevent buzzing caused by other bass instruments while the snare is not in use, or to produce a tom-tom sound if desired.Okamoto, Gene. \\" HOW TO REPLACE AND ADJUST SNARES\\" 1995-2003 =Badge= While not required for operation, most drum manufacturers label their products by way of a drum \\"badge\\". The badge is a label attached to the drum shell with a grommet, which is embossed with the manufacturer's name or logo, and often a serial number as well. The grommet doubles as a \\"vent\\" hole for two-sided drums. =Mounts= Drum mounts are fittings, normally attached to the drum shell, that enable a drum to be attached to a supporting bracket, stand or rack. Traditionally, smaller tom-tom drums are supported by mounts and known as hanging toms, while snare drums rest on a stand not attached to the drum, and floor toms and bass drums rest on their own legs.\\"Pearl Drums Hardware\\" 2004 Hanging tom mounts are of two main patterns: * The Pearl 7/8\\" (22 mm) mount accepts a 22 mm steel tube perpendicular to the drum shell. The excess length of the tube intrudes through the drum shell, and a large hole is required for this. Developed by Pearl, this mount has been adopted by many other manufacturers, and the 22 mm tube has become a standard interface for many other mounts and stands, such as cymbal booms. * The parallel mount accepts a solid bar parallel to the drum shell. There are many bar sizes and profiles, mostly either round and knurled or hexagonal. There is a some compatibility, but it is not universal. Some manufacturers such as Tama Drums and Gibraltar Hardware even produce a single fitting that can be used either singly as a hanging tom mount, or in sets of three to attach the floor tom legs. Either of these patterns can also be used with a rim mount. Most fittings have provision for memory to reduce setup time. There are many other patterns, including: * Similar mounts to the 7/8\\" but with smaller tube. Mostly used on toy and entry level kits * Spade mounts on older kits and, traditionally, on timbales * Mounts that accept a solid bar similar to the parallel mount, but perpendicular to the drum shell or at an angle close to this. Common on older kits, and on some high-level handmade kits from smaller makers. Stands and holders Metal stands and holders are used to support percussion instruments or microphones. Floor stands are often tripods and telescoping. Tom-tom and cymbal stands may have a \\"boom arm\\" attached to extend holder reach, and a \\"tilter\\" to move instruments into a desired position. Smaller \\"clamp holders\\" may also be used to attach more instruments to existing stands. Drum \\"racks\\" are stands surrounding a drum kit onto which percussion instrument holders may be clamped. \\"Memory locks\\" are clamps used to make drum and telescoping positions permanent. =Snare drum stand= Snare drum stands have three arms as a \\"basket\\" to cradle the lower rim of the drum. There are several patterns. The older, traditional pattern has two arms that pivot, and one that slides to accommodate varying sizes of drum. This is satisfactory for a tilted drum; The drum is tilted away from the sliding arm and rests on the two pivoting arms. If it is horizontal, or tilted the wrong way by inexpert players, then the drum is insecure. The newer patterns use a symmetrical basket with a central screw adjustment, allowing the basket to be tightened onto the lower rim and the drum to be firmly held at any angle. They differ mainly in sturdiness and in the precise mechanism used for the screw adjustment. Snare drum stands have long been used by some drummers to support tom-tom drums. In this application they offer much the same advantages as the more recently available rim mounts. =Rack toms= Hanging toms are traditionally supported by tom-tom arms or brackets mounted on the bass drum, with one or two toms supported by each bass drum. Extra toms may be supported by stands or racks. =Floor tom= Floor toms are traditionally supported by three feet resting on the floor, as the name suggests. More recently, some drummers have used rim mounts. =Cymbal stands= Cymbal stands have a threaded bolt or \\"cymbal post\\" to hold a cymbal down with a nut. Accessory booms and piggyback adaptors allow additional cymbals to be added to an existing stand (not to be confused with stacking). =Hi-hat stand= A hi-hat stand is a standard part of the hardware of a drum kit. In an extended kit, additional pairs of hi-hat cymbals may be operated remotely by a cable hat, or held closed by an X-hat adaptor. =Drum throne= The drum \\"throne\\" is a three or four-legged padded seat or stool the drummer sits on while playing. Thrones may be shaped like round cushions or in a saddle design. Throne heights may be adjusted to accommodate the drummer. =Memory= Many drum stands and brackets have provision for memory. This consists of a mechanical device, such as a collar, that allows quick reassembly in a preset position after the kit has been disassembled. Cymbals, hanging toms, a floor tom and even the bass drums are supported by this drum rack =Drum rack= Some or all of the stands can be replaced by a drum rack. Racks are particularly used for larger kits, but can greatly reduce the weight and setup time of even moderately sized kits. Cymbals and hanging toms are most often mounted on the rack, but bass drums, floor toms and even snare drums can be rack mounted, particularly if rim mounts are used.

In 2007 he got a regular starting spot in the Melbourne side, playing 17 games and even scoring a goal against the Western Bulldogs in round 7. In round 20, against Collingwood, he was involved in an incident with Collingwood's Ben Johnson. With his head over the ball, Johnson crashed into the head of Bell, and Bell lay motionless on the ground before being stretchered off the field. Bell initially feared that he might have broken his back, and he couldn‚Äôt breathe because of the impact. There were no hard feelings over the incident; however Johnson was suspended for six weeks for head high contact. He did not play again after the incident in the 2007 season. Bell returned in 2008 to play 18 games and was mainly used as a half back flanker. After playing only three games in 2009 and being unable to make it into the senior team in 2010, Bell was delisted at the end of the season.

It can be a variant of ecotourism. Many villages can facilitate tourism because many villagers are hospitable and eager to welcome (and sometime even host) visitors. Agriculture is becoming highly mechanized and therefore, requires less manual labor. This trend is causing economic pressure on some villages, which in turn causes young people to move to urban areas. There is however, a segment of the urban population that is interested in visiting the rural areas and understanding the lifestyle. Principles * Minimize impact of rapid urban development. * Build environmental and cultural awareness and respect * Provide positive experiences for both visitors and hosts * Provide direct financial benefit for conservation * Provide financial benefits and empowerment for local people * Raise sensitivity to host countries' political, environmental, and social climate.  Benefits  Rural tourism allows the creation of a replacement source of income in the non-agricultural sector for rural dwellers. The added income from rural tourism can contribute to the revival of lost folk art and handicrafts.  Relevance in developing nations  Rural tourism is particularly relevant in developing nations where farmland has become fragmented due to population growth. The wealth that rural tourism can provide to poor households creates great prospects for development.  Relevance in developed nations  Rural tourism exists in developed nations in the form of providing accommodation in a scenic location, ideal for rest and relaxation. There are many scenic towns that have become quaint spots for vacationers (See Sanford, Fl; Folsom, CA; St. Augustine, FL; Creede, CO) =United States: niche tourism in rural areas= Many niche tourism programs are located in rural areas. From wine tours and eco-tourism, to agritourism and seasonal events, tourism can be a viable economic component in rural community development. According to the USDA, Cooperative State, Education and Extension Service, \\"Tourism is becoming increasingly important to the U.S. economy. A conservative estimate from the Federal Reserve Board in Kansas, based on 2000 data, shows that basic travel and tourism industries accounted for 3.6 percent of all U.S. employment. Even more telling, data from the Travel Industry Association of America indicate that 1 out of every 18 people in the U.S. has a job directly resulting from travel expenditures.\\" \\"Rural Tourism\\" (February 2008).

Local citizen participation is helpful and should be included in starting any kind of a tourism program. Being prepared when planning tourism can assist in a successful program that enhances the community. Community Ecotourism The International Ecotourism Society (TIES) defines ecotourism as \\"responsible travel to natural areas that conserves the environment and improves the well-being of local people.\\"The International Ecotourism Society. 2014. Online. http://www.ecotourism.org TIES is an example of a nonprofit organization dedicated to assisting companies in developing ecotourism practices and promoting sustainable community development. Ecotourism provides an alternative form of travel to mass tourism. Mass tourism is the idea of visiting a place with minimal responsibility to the local community and environment.Alomari, Thabit. Motivation and Socio-Cultural Sustainability of Voluntourism. M.A. University of Lethbridge (Canada), 2012 Canada. Tourism, the world's largest industry of more than 10% of total employment and 11% of global GDP, is also a quickly growing industry as \\"total tourist trips are predicted to increase to 1.6 billion by 2020\\".Rajan, Brilliant, Vincy Mary Varghese, and Anakkathil Purushothaman Pradeepkumar. \\"Beach Carrying Capacity Analysis for Sustainable Tourism Development in the South West Coast of India.\\" Environmental Research, Engineering, and Management, 2013. 1(63): 67-73. In order to accommodate these rising needs in the tourism industry, there must be a shift within this industry. One in particular is the need to protect the environment and respect the local culture. According to the World Tourism Organization, ecotourism is growing three times faster than the tourism industry.Cox, Rachel S. \\"Ecotourism.\\" CQ Researcher 16.37 (2006): 865-88. This implies the already changing phenomenon occurring in traveling. Similarly, the World Conservation Union goes one step further in defining ecotourism to include enjoying and appreciating nature, have low negative visitor impact, and providing socio- economic involvement to the local populations.Lindsay, Heather. \\"Ecotourism: the Promise and Perils of Environmentally-Oriented Travel.\\" ProQuest. February 2003. Online. As ecotourism is growing, it is also focusing on especially vulnerable locations to climate change. In a neoliberalism theory, ecotourism is a win-win for both the host and tourist. This is because there is an effort for conservation when jobs are available outside of activities such as logging that harm the environment and the intrinsic value of the environment is taken into consideration. Additionally, ecotourism enhances social capital for both the host and tourist when engaging in social interaction and learning about other cultures. However, because ecotourism is most popular in vulnerable environments, it may unintentionally exploit the community causing a serious social justice issue. The idea of community ecotourism is placing the tourism activities in the hands of the local community. It addresses the needs of the tourism businesses to minimize negative impacts and maximize positive impacts in all three parts of the community ‚Äì social, economic, and environmental.Li, Yiping. \\"Situated Learning, Responsible Tourism, and Global Peace.\\" Peace Research 30.4 (1998): 83-100. Community ecotourism resolves one issue with ecotourism in particular, the input of the community hosting the tourism. Governments and outside agencies have pushed communities into hosting tourists which can sometimes cause more harm if the community is not prepared without relevant knowledge, leadership, or capacity.Moscardo, G.

An example of such occurrence is in Montego Bay in which international organizations brought tourists to already westernized sites, which harmed this degraded environment.West, Paige, James G. Carrier, 2004. Ecotourism and Authenticity: Getting Away from It All? Current Anthropology. 45(4): 483 ‚Äì 498. Another example is the case of Papua New Guinea's Crater Mountain. Setting aside their ethnic tension, the clans planned a tourist lodge for two years that the government denied in five minutes. The lack of collusion among the local clans and the government created tension and failure for all parties. With community ecotourism, the community itself primarily sees the venture to success and receives the economic benefit, rather than government or third party organizations. As a whole, the rise in demand of tourism to exotic places as they become more accessible provides an opportunity for vulnerable and economically impoverished communities. In traditional tourism, these communities are often exploited and their resources depleted. It also includes the social inequities when considering the power in the host‚Äìguest relationship.Jones, Samantha. \\"COMMUNITY-BASED ECOTOURISM: The Significance of Social Capital.\\" Annals of Tourism Research 32.2 (2005): 303-24. Community ecotourism empowers the relationship of the host and guest so that both can learn from a different culture and how to maneuver such differences.Pantea, Maria-Carmen. \\"Young People in Cross-National Volunteering: Perceptions of Unfairness.\\" Journal of Social and Personal Relationships.30 (August 2013): 564-681. When addressed properly, equitable relationships blossom in the national and global sphere. Unlike traditional tourism, this alternative tourism experience enables people to engage positively in the community's way of life and learn how they interact with the environment. Community ecotourism can act as a solution to social justice issues that arise with the tourism industry in respect to the economy, environment, and culture. =Benefits of Community Ecotourism= Generally, success is the benefits outweighing the costs. A more concrete measure of success for ecotourism is ensuring that the tourism industry operates within the location's capacity to handle such activities in the three areas of ecotourism ‚Äì economy, environment, and culture. One such form of capacity is economic capacity so that the tourism industry does not displace sustainable local economic activity already in place. Additionally, there is an environmental carrying capacity, the limit at which the environment is not degraded from tourism. This is especially important as many ecotourism locations are in locations vulnerable to climate change, such as along the coast. There is also the idea of cultural capacity in which the tourism industry remains authentic and can maintain local practices. With addressing these three capacity measures, many problems mass tourism places on the host community are resolved. Economic In contrast with traditional tourism, community ecotourism is often a tool for economic development to promote both capital inflow and employment opportunities to the community. Thus, it is often targeting more impoverished areas where implemented. It encourages entrepreneurship for local members to organize the community in implementing and running successful community-based ecotourism enterprises. Both financial and social capital is placed in the indigenous community, driving further enhancements of the community ecotourism program.Coria, Jessica, Enrique Calfucura. \\"Ecotourism and the Development of Indigenous Communities: the Good, the Bad, and the Ugly.\\" University of Gothenburg School of Business, Economics, and Law, 2011. This capital inflow can then be used to help the development of infrastructure, education, and health practices. Community- based ecotourism places an emphasis on local businesses and reinforces supporting local endeavors. Not only does the capital increase, the intrinsic value of the environment increases. In Zanzibar, the idea of ecotourism has enabled entrepreneurs to give tours of their home villages and use the revenue to support themselves as well as give back to the community. It has also helped development in conservational ways including increasing investment in solar energy.Honey, Martha. Ecotourism and Sustainable Development : Who Owns Paradise? (2nd Edition). Washington DC, USA: Island Press, 2008. . ebrary. As a whole, community-based ecotourism can overall increase the economic value of a previously impoverished area through providing dignified jobs and capital into the local economy. Environmental Along with economic value, community ecotourism enhances the value of the environment for both the host and the traveler. As a result, community ecotourism becomes an incentive for conservation.Stronza, Amanda, and Javier Gordillo. \\"Community Views of Ecotourism.\\" Annals of Tourism Research 35.2 (2008): 448-68. For the community, their environment becomes a showcase to the tourist and brings a greater desire to maintain it. In mass tourism, the average tourist holds little responsibility in the impact they have on the environment and often depletes resources. Community ecotourism gives the tourist a greater stake in conservation efforts because of their involvement in the local culture.Chiu, Yen-Ting Helena, Wan-I Lee, and Tsung-Hsiung Chen. \\"Environmentally Responsible Behavior in Ecotourism: Antecedents and Implications.\\" Tourism Management 40.0 (2014): 321-9. Community ecotourism becomes a potential solution to bring social justice to those suffering from side effects of mass tourism in locations most vulnerable to climate change. The Galapagos Islands was one of the initial ecotourism destinations. As the programs have continued to evolve in combatting ecotourism issues, specifically with maintaining cultural capacity, one of the main findings from community ecotourism are the programs associated with environmental conservation. When visiting national parks, guides must be with the tourists to ensure they stay on the paths and do not harm the environment during nature walks. One in particular sets tourists on projects to help with environmental restoration, economic development projects, and biodiversity conservation. These \\"travel philanthropists\\" are more involved tourists who want to appreciate the natural beauty of the destination from a completely different viewpoint. The ecotourism model on a community-based level enables conservation efforts to come from both the tourist and the community to maximize results. Sociocultural The sociocultural aspect of ecotourism is that the local tourist becomes more engaged in the community and their culture. This can be from learning a religious tradition or supporting a local handicraft. Tourism can at times force more injustices on the host community. It inculcates a sense of inequality in the relationships if the tourist feels they have superior knowledge. Community-based ecotourism places more responsibility on the tourist to learn from the other culture. For example, in South Africa, community ecotourism has been especially beneficial after the apartheid because of a renewed attention towards local cultures that are selling traditional handicrafts and showing cultural tours. The community-based ecotourist is often more interested in engaging with the local community. This can also entail building relationships and decreasing the social gap. Specifically, engagement in nationalism, socioeconomic conditions, and similar age groups can help narrow the social gap and decrease stereotypes.Woosnam, Kyle M., and Yoon Jung Lee. \\"Applying Social Distance to Voluntourism Research.\\" Annals of Tourism Research 38.1 (2011): 309-13. This leads to a more positive cultural understanding on both sides. This effect can even go beyond the tourist's journey. After visiting such communities and learning about their livelihood, studies have found that people gain a newfound activism to contribute back to the community. This socio-cultural connection with the community can in return bring about greater resources to this community to help promote education, conservation, disease prevention, and other needs. It is through the sociocultural aspect that enhances the tourist's engagement with the economy and environment to maximize the overall community-based ecotourism experience. =Criticisms= While under the neoliberalism theory, ecotourism is an overall winning situation, there are many issues associated with ecotourism when poorly implemented. Community ecotourism is a solution to many of the flaws detailed. Inherently Flawed Compared to responsible tourism and voluntourism, there is an added importance on respect for the environment and being environmentally sustainable while traveling. By definition, travel inherently harms the environment by getting to the location, using more resources than the location is used to, and producing more waste than normal. It adds an overall stress to areas most vulnerable to global warming, such as coastlines. One tourism spot that has struggled to implement community ecotourism is Tanzania. Tanzania practices a kind of ecotourism that focuses exclusively on the environment, also called nature tourism. In Tanzania's Ngorongoro Conservation Area, tourists come to look exclusively at the nature bringing primarily economic benefit with arguably negative impact on sociocultural and environmental factors.Charnley, Susan. \\"From Nature to Ecotourism.\\" Human Organization. 2005. 64(1):75-88. As a result, the environmental capacity is exhausted and little attention is paid to the culture and environment. It has created a situation in which the environment is now degraded because of tourism and the economic returns are going to organizations outside of the local economy. Community-based ecotourism helps address this flaw through working more small- scale to not expend more resources than available. Greenwashing Greenwashing is the idea of using an environmentally friendly label on low impact conservation efforts. These certifications are often marketing tactics that can actually promote low impact projects in which the costs can be greater than the benefit. This idea is common with certain lodging as people look for green marketing to attempt to have an ecotourism experience with minimal responsibilities as a tourist.Zeppel, Heather. Indigenous Ecotourism : Sustainable Development and Management. Wallingford, Oxfordshire, GBR: CABI Publishing, 2006. ebrary. Cox offers that small-scale, privatized ecotourism enterprises, such as community ecotourism, can avoid such downfalls of green washing. With community ecotourism, the host community has a greater involvement in trying to protect their environment to eliminate any harmful behavior to the environment. However, these low impact campaigns can cause harm to already vulnerable communities, amplifying the institutionalized poverty found in many of these locations. Effective community ecotourism must allow the community to define their environmental needs. Economic Downfalls While seen as a driver in the industry, economic returns may not be as high as anticipated. Community ecotourism tends to be more small-scale and does not attract a higher income population. As a result, community ecotourism brings more backpackers and low-income travelers who wish to travel cheaply and thus do not support the local economy. It could in turn result in haggling throughout the journey to receive the lowest prices. When issues like this arise, it may cost more for the community to host tourists than the return it brings, especially when taking into account environmental and social costs. The important part for community ecotourism is to ensure that tourists are leaving an overall positive impact on the community and that capital is reinvested into the community. So, community ecotourism in practice can do more damage both to the environment and local economy while having no positive impact on the people when not properly practiced. Furthermore, the challenge of community ecotourism is that it is balancing market objectives with both social and environmental aims, whereas competitors that offer more luxuries have primarily financial objectives. In order to lead community ecotourism to success, there must be a clear sense of leadership and direction for the long- term impact of this organization in the local community. When looking at what makes a successful responsible tourism enterprise, research has found the focus on strong leadership, clear market orientation, and organizational culture to be essential.von, der Weppen, and Janet Cochrane. \\"Social Enterprises in Tourism: An Exploratory Study of Operational Models and Success Factors.\\" Journal of Sustainable Tourism 20.3 (2012): 497-511. In community ecotourism, this requires appointing a leader or board that can focus on meeting the triple bottom line. Community ecotourism can redefine the tourism industry as sustainable travel continues to have high consumer demand and thwart the harms associated with mass tourism. Authenticity Finally, in terms of the sociocultural aspect of community-based ecotourism, it is essential for the community to be respected for their own cultures. At times, the growing demand of tourists can cause tourist sites to adapt to the demands and expectations of the tourist. Instead of showcasing the culture, the community may have a show of what the tourist would expect the culture to be. Community-based ecotourism often eliminates this concern as well when they are responsible for showcasing their own lifestyle to the tourist. =Case Studies= Cambodia One example in particular is southwestern Cambodia, which successfully runs community-based ecotourism to address such issues. First, this program targets villages of low GDP for ecotourism to help provide jobs and education for these communities. The local people in the villages determine the tourism activities available with an emphasis on showing their local culture. In fact, Reimer and Walter have found that in Cambodia, populations have limited their logging and other harmful practices because ecotourism has given a more successful industry and greater awareness to the intrinsic value of the environment.Reimer, J. K. (Kila), and Pierre Walter. \\"How do You Know it when You See it? Community-Based Ecotourism in the Cardamom Mountains of Southwestern Cambodia.\\" Tourism Management 34.0 (2013): 122-32. By placing ecotourism in the hands of the local, the least amount of harm is assessed. However, it may limit financial trajectory because of mismanagement or lack of attraction. These concerns with ecotourism can be mitigated through education and careful implementation. Costa Rica Costa Rica is known for its biodiversity with having 5% of the world's biodiversity on its 0.035% of earth's surface. In 2007, the government announced that it would support four types of tourism, ecotourism, adventure tourism, beach tourism, and rural community based tourism. A specific part of Costa Rica that has benefited from community-based ecotourism is Tortuguero, a turtle-nesting area surrounded by a national park with an impoverished community. Nearly the entire population of Tortuguero is working in the tourism industry, as community-based ecotourism is breeding entrepreneurs.Honey, Martha. Ecotourism and Sustainable Development : Who Owns Paradise? (2nd Edition). Washington DC, USA: Island Press, 2008. ebrary. Economically, the largest issue of Tortuguero is to maintain the community- based aspect of the tourism as they continue to resist institutionalization from the outside. Environmentally, conservation has been seen as a priority in order to motivate the ecotourism industry. However, because Tortuguero is only accessible by boat, there has been an increase in noise and pollution. Additionally, beach paths had to be inputted to avoid disturbing nesting turtles. In terms of the sociocultural aspect, training and education of the local community has become a priority to ensure their ability to continue as a community-based endeavor. The community has learned to become more organized and work together to build conservation efforts to support their community. There are now nonprofit organizations in Costa Rica that will train local small businesses to successfully run community ecotourism enterprises. =Future Implications= Community ecotourism becomes an issue of social justice. The communities that are becoming popular tourist sites are impoverished and are using ecotourism as a tool for economic development. These communities, especially when looking at indigenous tourism, are often lacking voices in the greater political sphere and faced with limited resources. On top of that, they tend to be especially vulnerable to climate change. This brings greater attention to the need of conservation efforts. Through success of community ecotourism, the community can have a larger voice as they show successful development and become a greater participating member in the global sphere. As the tourism industry continues to grow, it is imperative to continue developing more sustainable avenues to participate in such endeavors. One way is making travelers aware of the potential harm their activities may have on the host culture. A continuing theme is the importance of dialogue and defining the ideals for each party. While stakeholders want the same idea of economic improvement, environmental sustainability, and cross-cultural relationships, the end goals are often defined differently. Opening a reflexive dialogue that is understandable to all is essential. Overall, the success of smaller enterprises that have thrived under strong leadership and community efforts will help tourism be a tool for economic development. Community ecotourism also opens the discussion for the purpose of land usage and the difference of preservation now over usage in the future. Community ecotourism highlights the importance of seeing the community's usage of the land. It can bring a common goal for science and local populations alike. Community ecotourism offers an opportunity for the tourism industry to succeed in conservation efforts while enhancing tourism efforts through a grassroots network effort.

He moved to Tokyo in 1965 and, while working in Tokyo's Shibuya district, witnessed the Zama and Shibuya shootings. Nagayama killed four people with a handgun between October 11 and November 5, 1968. He robbed the last two victims of 16,420 yen. He was arrested on April 7, 1969. When he was arrested, he was 19 years old and was regarded as a minor under Japanese law. The Tokyo District Court sentenced him to death in 1979, though this was overturned by the Tokyo High Court, which imposed a sentence of life imprisonment in 1981. The Supreme Court of Japan reversed the high court's decision in 1983. This ruling is today considered the landmark decision for application of the death penalty in Japan. The high court subsequently sentenced him to death in 1987, a decision which the Supreme Court upheld in 1990. In prison, Nagayama wrote many novels and became a public figure. His first published work was in 1971. In 1983, he was awarded a prize for the novel . The Japanese writing community was uneasy with his success, given his status as a convicted killer. He was rejected by the Japan Writers' Association, but he received a similar recognition in Saarland, Germany in 1996. His death sentence was contested until his sudden execution on August 1, 1997, just 34 days after the arrest of \\"Seito Sakakibara\\", the 14-year-old perpetrator of the Kobe child murders. A foundation to save poor people was established by his will. On August 1, 1997, he was hanged at the Tokyo Detention Center. He made no final statement. A 1969 documentary by Japanese New Wave director Masao Adachi tells Nagayama's story through biographical information in a voiceover narrated by the director himself. Instead of editing archival footage or staging scenes with actors, Adachi employs an observational approach, filming the places pertinent to Nagayama‚Äôs life (including where his spree took place) in order to express the influence that environments have on politics, social standing/class, and psychology.

It was recorded at Sunrise Studio in Kirchberg, Switzerland in February and August 1979, and released on LP in January 1980 on founding member Marc Hollander's Belgian independent record label, Crammed Discs. At the time the band had changed the spelling of their name to \\"Aqsak Maboul\\", and this is reflected on the album's record sleeve. When the album was re- issued on CD in 1995 (also on Crammed Discs) the spelling of their name reverted to \\"Aksak Maboul\\". In addition to the Aksak Maboul line-up at the time, the album also featured ex-Henry Cow musicians Fred Frith and Chris Cutler whose contribution and names helped bring the album to the attention of a wider audience. Aksak Maboul's co-founder, Vincent Kenis did not play on this album, although he did arrange two of the tracks. Background The formation of Rock in Opposition (RIO) in 1978 brought together a number of like-minded European bands.See Rock in Opposition. Aksak Maboul was amongst the second wave of bands to join RIO and benefited from the collaborations it spawned. This album features three musicians from two other RIO bands, Michel Berckmans from Univers Zero, who had joined Aksak Maboul when they began performing live in 1978, and Fred Frith and Chris Cutler from Henry Cow, who were invited by Marc Hollander to participate in the recording. Content Un Peu de l'Ame des Bandits is more intense and experimental than Aksak Maboul's first album, Onze Danses Pour Combattre la Migraine (1977). It comprises complex written sections as well as improvised ambient pieces. It uses sampling before samplers were invented and is a mixture of tangos, Turkish tunes, \\"chamber rock\\", noisy punk rock and pseudo-Var√®se music. Like the first album, it is largely instrumental with a little singing and other vocals. Side A of the LP record contains five dance pieces. \\"Modern Lesson\\" begins as a \\"twisted blues number\\" with gibberish vocals over guitar, cello and saxophone, then switches to horn and string chamber music. It includes sounds from a pinball machine flipper as well as samples from every other track on the album. \\"Tango\\" was composed with \\"hat, scissors and glue\\" Un Peu de l'√Çme des Bandits liner notes. and features several popular tangos cut up and reassembled at random; the resulting \\"opus\\" was learnt and performed live in one take. \\"I Viaggi Formano la Giovent√∫\\" is an arrangement of a Turkish folk song featuring dumbeg and cello playing traditional scales. \\"Inoculating Rabies\\" is \\"angry bassoon punk\\" that is a composed bassoon and bass clarinet piece over a background of noisy rock guitar music. Side B is the 23-minute \\"Cinema\\" suite which includes four solos: six-string bass-guitar, acoustic cello, electric cello, and synthesizer. It contains \\"dissonant woodwind passages, atonal psychedelic rock-outs, and snatches of Middle Eastern music\\". The last section, \\"Age Route Brra! (Radio Sofia)\\", is an improvised imitation of a Bulgarian radio talk show. \\"Cinema\\" was well received in progressive rock circles, as was the album as a whole. Reception AllMusic called it \\"a pinnacle of the RIO movement\\", while Gnosis said, \\"Overall a very good album and one that is considered de rigueur for RIO fans.\\" In their review of the album's 2018 reissue, Pitchfork criticized the album's \\"[dis]regard for flow\\" whilst saying that it does not come at \\"the expense of exhilarating technicality\\". The Quietus called it \\"still great ... riotous and breathtaking\\" in their review of the same.

The CD cover used the original LP artwork in colour, with the band's name spelt \\"Aksak Maboul\\", and not \\"Aqsak Maboul\\". In 2018, Un Peu de l'√Çme des Bandits was re-issued on vinyl by Crammed Discs. The album was remastered from the original tapes, and includes a large booklet with abundant liner notes, rare documents, and recollections by all the participants. Also included is a bonus album entitled Before and After Bandits, consisting of ten previously-unreleased live and demo recordings, and featuring seventeen of the band's subsequent members and guests. This series of tracks depicts the evolution of the constantly-morphing Aksak Maboul, from the band's 1977 debut album, to the Bandits album, followed by a lesser-known avant-No Wave phase in 1980, the eclectic electropop of Ex- Futur Album, and though to the band's current incarnation, with a live track from 2015.

In the , Hivesville had a population of 169 people.  Geography  The town is located on the Proston-Wondai road, north west of the state capital, Brisbane. History Hivesville was originally known as Jaumbill, believed to be an Aboriginal word in the Waka language meaning yam. On the request of James Braidwood Edwards, the Member of the Queensland Legislative Assembly for Nanango, the town was named Hivesville, after George Hives, a pioneer settler. On 2 March 1923, the Queensland Railways Department named the railway station Hivesville. The Hives family owned substantial property around the site of the town (centred on Sunday Creek Station) from the 1890s. Hivesville Post Office opened by December 1923 and closed in 1991. The town is now serviced by a Community Post Office located at the service station. The town was for many years the predominant business centre for the district west of Wondai and had developed into a vibrant community hub before the nearby town of Proston was founded. Indeed, until 1930, Hivesville eclipsed Proston in size and importance. In these early years Hivesville boasted a general store, bakery, butcher, garage with six bowsers, blacksmith, post office, school, hotel, two cafes, two bank branches, the Empire theatre cinema, railway station and various receiving depots. When the railway arrived some fourteen years after the first town buildings had been established, the name of the town was changed from Jaumbill to Hivesville (in 1923). Rail sidings were established at nearby Kawl Kawl and Kinleymore. In addition, a large public hall was constructed, along with QCWA rest rooms, Church of England and Lutheran church. Residents of the following nearby farming localities regarded Hivesville as their primary town of business from the time of first settlement into the 1960s, although the town originally serviced a much wider area - Abbeywood, Stalworth, Speedwell, Kinleymore, Stonelands, Keysland. When the nearby town of Proston overtook Hivesville as the major centre of the district in the 1930s, Hivesville entered a long period of slow decline until by the early 1970s it resembled what it is today. The Hivesville State School opened in 1924 and closed in 1968. The school's first teacher, Alexander Wilson served in that position until July 1937. Nearby schools were also established at Kinleymore (1913-1969), Speedwell (1912-1963), Stonelands (1932-1967), Keysland (1915‚Äì1974) and Abbeywood (1914-1969). There was no school at Stalworth, however that district became known for a local hall where dances and social functions were held and there was also a butter factory there for a short time as well. Some of the original settlers in the district included John and Percy Slinger, George Perkins, W.Perkins, C.Perkins, H.Perkins, R.Potter, E.Hird, A.Taylor, George Hatchett, W.T.B.Hatchett, Reuben (John) Bull, E.Dowell, H.Olsen, S.Porter, A.Chesterton, A.Harper, C.Harper, M.Comerford, J.Walton, M.McGovern, R.Glanville, E.Cridland, H.Nairne, W.Waters, E.Murgatroyd, S.Sunderland, A.Ley, J.Kinnear, D.Morey, W.Welch, E.York, C.Rees, R.Bracken, J.Donkersley, J.Wardill, J.Grace, H.Holdsworth, H,Crick. P.Henry, T.Marriott, S.Shaw, and Harry Flynn. These first settlers, took up uncleared selections of virgin bush, with most between 300 and 350 acres in size. The price was seventeen shillings and sixpence an acre, payable to the Queensland Lands Department over thirty-three years in annual installments, at an interest rate of three percent. Initially the bush and scrub was cleared and then corn and Rhodes grass planted. Income was generated through dairying, with the cream being sent by rail to Maryborough in the earliest years and later to Murgon. Excess milk was fed to pigs which generated further income and calves from the cows were also sold. Corn was the most regular crop. The system was viable, but only just, and there were many hard years. The northwestern part of the district, which became known as Abbeywood, Speedwell and Stalworth, was largely settled by English immigrants who had travelled to Australia on the ship \\"Oswestry Grange\\". This ship made several journeys to Queensland between 1905 and 1912. These immigrants formed a progress association in order to agitate authorities for improvements such as roads, railway and schools. As the area had no name, it was referred to for a time as the Oswestry Grange settlement and later simply, the Overseas settlement, due to the selections being reserved for English settlers. Throughout the Hivesville area, sub-district locality place names were gradually adopted, usually when a school, hall, rail siding or other building was initiated. Early businesses in Hivesville were operated by Arthur Johnson, Messrs. Thorne and Walker, Mrs. Jennings, S.Fuller, Messrs. Levitt and Smith, Miss Schultz and J.Webb. Mary Vaughan (nee Johnson), daughter of Arthur Johnson, operated a general store in the town for many years until well into old age. The Anglican Church of the Holy Spirit opened on 15 May 1932. It closure on 3 June 2005 was approved by Assistant Bishop Rob Nolan. At the 2006 census, Hivesville and the surrounding area had a population of 310.  Facilities  Facilities in the town include an old church, old pub, convenience store with petrol, diesel and lpg gas, plus a sports oval. The Hivesville branch of the Queensland Country Women's Association meets at 12 Main Street.

Eastern Arabian cuisine includes the similar cuisines that are shared by the population in the Eastern Arabia. Seafood is a very significant part of the diet of the inhabitants of the coastal region of Eastern Arabia. Fish is very popular, usually eaten with rice. The cuisine of eastern Arabia is different from the cuisine of the Arabs of Hejaz, Najd and other parts of Arabia. Harees is also a very popular dish in the region. History Sag'ai dates from Saudi Arabia. Sag'ai dates are grown in the Arabian peninsula and are naturally sweet, luscious and very soft. Fresh Arabian camel Camel milk. Camel milk may also be strained to form strained yogurt. Originally, the inhabitants of the Eastern Arabia relied heavily on a diet of dates, wheat, barley, rice and meat, with little variety, and with a heavy emphasis on yogurt products, such as \\"leben\\" (ŸÑÿ®ŸÜ) (yogurt without butterfat). Globalization and contact with ancient civilizations such as the Romans, Persians, and later on with the Ottomans brought the Arabs in close contact with dishes of several other cultures, as well as introducing several new ingredients in their diet. As with most Asian cultures, the culinary heritage can find its root in either Persian, Indian, or Chinese cuisines. In fact the food structure of Persian-Arabian civilization began with cooking techniques innovated in ancient Persia and carried forward by Persians during the Sassanid Dynasty. With subsequent development and growth of the Ottomans (Turkish empire), Arab culture came in contact with the Ottoman empire; Turkish contributions to the Arabian culture included \\"kebabs\\". This multicultural inclusion in part, became possible, after advent of Islam, and with the growth of Arabian influence after invasion of Persia, Balkans, and North Africa, making it possible for merchants of different nations to travel long distances coming into contact and being influenced by or influencing local cuisines they encountered. The exchange of customs and food was bidirectional, with Arabs also exporting their dietary preferences such as dates, figs, and lamb to the areas they traveled to or conquered including the Persian empire and the Turkish population of Balkan. This interchange of goods and ways of life, was significant in forming the current modern Arab diet. Arabs later on transferred these newly gained cuisines on their conquests to Africa, and as far as North Africa, West Africa, and South of Spain. In fact, certain Spanish desserts such as polvorones, tocino de cielo (custard and caramel) and yemas de San Leandro (marzipan based) are heavily influenced by the Moors. Though these influences were not carried out by the original Arabs of the Arabian sub-continent, their west ward expansion into Egypt, and Morocco led to dissemination of Chinese, Indian, Arabian, and Persian cuisines and eventually their vicarious adoption by the North Africans. Ingredients Eastern Arabian cuisine today is the result of combination of diverse cuisines, incorporating Persian, Indian, Lebanese and Chinese cooking styles, and many items not originally indigenous to the region, which were most probably imported on the dhows and the caravans. In addition, the cuisine is heavily dosed with spices, from hot sauces to every variety of pepper, to tea. This cuisine also favors vegetables such as cucumbers, eggplants, and onions, and fruits (primarily citrus). Notably, many of the same spices used in eastern Arabia cuisine are also those emphasized in the Indian cuisine. This is a result of heavy trading between the two regions, and of the current state of affairs in the wealthy oil states, in which many South Asian workers are living abroad in Eastern Arabia. National cuisines *Bahraini cuisine *Emirati cuisine *Kuwaiti cuisine *Omani cuisine *Qatari cuisine *Saudi Arabian cuisine Culture A Majlis in the United Arab Emirates. Majlis (literally a place of sitting) is where guests are welcomed and usually offered dates and Arabic coffee. Essential to any cooking in eastern Arabia is the concept of hospitality. Meals are sometimes family affairs, with much sharing and a great deal of warmth over the dinner table. Formal dinners and celebrations generally entail large quantities of food, and every occasion entails large quantities of coffee. There are many regional differences in Arab cuisine. For instance mujadara in Syria or Lebanon is different from mujadara in Jordan or Palestine. Some dishes such as mensaf (the national dish of Jordan) are native to certain countries and rarely if ever make an appearance in other countries. Unlike in most Western cuisines, cinnamon is used in meat dishes as well as in sweets such as Baklava. Other desserts include variations of rice pudding and fried dough. Ground nut mixtures are common fillings for such treats. Saffron is used in everything, from sweets, to rice, to beverages. Fruit juices are quite popular in this often arid region. Influences In addition to Arab cuisine, the following cuisines have influenced, or have been influenced by the Eastern Arabian cuisine, either due to trade (mostly maritime from the far east), or as a result of ancient contact: * African cuisine * Balochi cuisine * Fusion cuisine * Iranian cuisine  References  Further reading * Al-Hamad, Sarah, Cardamom and Lime: Tastes of the Arabian Gulf, 2015 , Fox Chapel Publishing, External links Category:Arab cuisine Category:Middle Eastern cuisine Category:Arab culture Category:Arabian Peninsula Category:Gulf Cooperation Council ","title":"Eastern Arabian cuisine"},{"id":"14084636","text":"Brush Creek (formerly, Mountain Cottage and Mountain House) is an unincorporated community near Oroville in Butte County, California, United States.

He was the last owner of the Arnolfini Portrait before it was bought by the National Gallery. Life He was born in Braco, Scotland the son of John Hay and joined the 16th Light Dragoons as a cornet on 10June 1795. He was subsequently promoted to Lieutenant on 4March 1795; to Captain on 28February 1799; to Major on 2January 1812 and to Lieutenant-colonel on 18February 1813. During the Peninsular War, Hay was present at the battles of Vittoria and the Nive for which he received the Army Gold Medal with one clasp. He had his arm broken at the Battle of Salamanca. In one engagement he led his regiment against the Lancers de Berg during which 70 enemy men and a squadron chief were captured. On 22 June 1815, on the recommendation of Wellington, he was appointed a Companion of the Most Honorable Order of the Bath (CB) for his services at Quatre Bras and Waterloo. He was so seriously injured at Waterloo that he could not be moved from the field for eight days. He later claimed (very implausibly) that the Arnolfini Portrait hung in the room in Brussels where he recovered further, and he bought it from the landlord. It is far more likely that he had acquired it in Spain after the Battle of Vitoria, when a coach loaded with treasures from the Spanish royal collection by Joseph Bonaparte was captured and looted by British soldiers. Wellington ordered the recovery of as much as he could, and offered the works back to the King of Spain, who later let the Wellington Collection keep them. The Arnolfini painting is well-documented as being in the Spanish royal collection before the war.Campbell, 175‚Äì178 Hay offered the painting to the Prince Regent, later George IV of England, via Sir Thomas Lawrence. The Prince had it on approval for two years at Carlton House before eventually returning it in 1818. Around 1828, Hay gave it to a friend to look after, not seeing it or the friend for the next thirteen years, until he arranged for it to be included in a public exhibition in 1841. It was bought the following year (1842) by the recently formed National Gallery, London for ¬£600, as inventory number 186, where it remains.Campbell, 175‚Äì178 Hay was given the colonelcy of the 79th Regiment of Foot (Cameron Highlanders) from 1849 to his death. He died at his seat near Kilburn, County Longford on 25February 1854. Family He married Mary Elizabeth Guthrie (1789‚Äì1850), daughter of Dr Matthew Guthrie.

High school career Egawa entered Sakushin Gakuin High School. In his high school career, he recorded two perfect games, nine no-hitters, 20 shutouts, and 30 complete games in 44 games pitched. He closed out his high school career with an earned run average of 0.41, which was significantly lower than Daisuke Matsuzaka (1.12) and Masahiro Tanaka (1.31). In the spring of 1973, he set a still- standing record of 60 strikeouts in National High School Baseball Invitational Tournament. He was nicknamed \\"The Monster\\", a nickname that Matsuzaka later received as well. However, he was different from Matsuzaka in not having strong teammates. His team had never won the championship at the Koshien Stadium. Professional career Egawa repeatedly attempted to join Yomiuri Giants, but failed every time. On November 21, 1978, he forcedly signed with Yomiuri Giants, but other baseball teams protested against the contract. Because there was no reverse-draft, his act was regarded as unfair by the other Japanese professional baseball teams. After many controversies, he officially entered Yomiuri Giants. Egawa had over 10 wins each year from 1980 to his retirement. He recorded 8 consecutive strikeouts in 1984 All-Star game, but did not reach Yutaka Enatsu's record of 9 straight strikeouts. In 1985, Randy Bass seemed to poised break Sadaharu Oh's single season record of 55 home runs. Yomiuri Giants pitchers were said to have been given instructions to intentionally walk Bass in every at bat. However, Egawa ignored the indication in the first game of the two last Giants' games against Hanshin Tigers (1 hit-1 out-1 walk). After Egawa left the mound, Bass was issued five walks in six at-bats. On June 26, 1986, he gave up a home run to Bass, which was Bass' seventh consecutive game with a home run. Sadaharu Oh's record is also 7 consecutive games. Egawa was admired for his fair play, even though it sometimes went against the wishes of his team. Retirement Since he retired in 1987, he has been working as a baseball analyst. In the Japanese anime film Whisper of the Heart, he played a role as a baseball analyst.

Brought to Rome with the Flaminio Obelisk in 10 BC by the Roman Emperor Augustus to be used as the gnomon of the Solarium Augusti, it is now in the Piazza Montecitorio. It is high, and including the base and the globe. History =First construction= Obelisk of Pharao Psamtik II, not called \\"Obelisk of Montecitorio\\", used as a Roman sundial, the famous Horologium Augusti, in Rome. In the background is the Italian Chamber of Deputies building Augustus erected it as the gnomon of the Solarium Augusti, his giant sundial (or horologium) in the Campus Martius. The meridian, worked out by the mathematician Facondius Novus, was placed in the center of a surface measuring , constructed from slabs of travertine, on which a quadrant was marked out with bronze letters, with indications of the hours, months, seasons and signs of the zodiac. Besides its function as a solar clock, the obelisk was oriented in such manner so as to cast its shadow on the nearby Ara Pacis on 23 September, Augustus's birthday, which coincided with the autumnal equinox. A detailed description that gives us the typology, appearance and formal operating procedure of this imposing solar meridian is supplied from Pliny the Elder (Naturalis Historia 36, 71‚Äì72).is autem obeliscus, quem divus Augustus in circo magno statuit, excisus est a rege Psemetnepserphreo, quo regnante Pythagoras in Aegypto fuit, LXXXV pedum et dodrantis praeter basim eiusdem lapidis; is vero, quem in campo Martio, novem pedibus minor, a Sesothide. inscripti ambo rerum naturae interpretationem Aegyptiorum philosophia continent. ‚Äî Ei, qui est in campo, divus Augustus addidit mirabilem usum ad deprendendas solis umbras dierumque ac noctium ita magnitudinis, strato lapide ad longitudinem obelisci, cui par fieret umbra brumae confectae die sexta hora paulatimque per regulas, quae sunt ex aere inclusae, singulis diebus decresceret ac rursus augeresceret, digna cognitu res, ingenio Facundi Novi mathematici. is apici auratam pilam addidit, cuius vertice umbra colligeretur in se ipsam, alias enormiter iaculante apice, ratione, ut ferunt, a capite hominis intellecta.

XIV AEGVPTO IN POTESTATEM POPVLI ROMANI REDACTA SOLI DONVM DEDIT Imperator Caesar, son of the deified (Julius Caesar), Augustus, Supreme Pontiff, proclaimed Imperator twelve times, Consul eleven times, holding Tribunician Power fourteen times, having reduced Egypt into the sovereignty of the Roman people, gave this gift to the sun. However, according to Pliny, the original horologic stopped working 30 years after its construction (that is, by the 40s AD).haec observatio XXX iam fere annis non congruit, sive solis ipsius dissono cursu et caeli aliqua ratione mutato sive universa tellure a centro suo aliquid emota (ut deprehendi et aliis in locis accipio) sive urbis tremoribus ibi tantum gnomone intorto sive inundationibus Tiberis sedimento molis facto, quamquam ad altitudinem inpositi oneris in terram quoque dicuntur acta fundamenta. (Naturalis Historia, XXXVI, 73). =Later history= The base of the column of Antoninus, with the personification of the Campus Martius, reclining, left Between the 9th and 11th centuries, probably because of fire, earthquake (perhaps the earthquake of 849) or war (e.g. during the siege of Rome of 1084 by Robert Guiscard), the obelisk collapsed and then, progressively, became buried. Pope Sixtus V (1520‚Äì1590) made some attempts to repair and raise the obelisk, reassembling some pieces that had been found in 1502 in a cellar off the \\"Largo dell'Impresa\\", the present Piazza del Parlamento. After this fruitless attempt, some traces of the meridian were recovered during the pontificate of Benedict XIV in 1748, who found parts of it under the main entrance of Piazza del Parlamento 3, sited just as in Pliny's description. The obelisk and the meridian were not originally located in the position in which they were re-erected by the popes, but in the space behind the Curia innocenziana (now called Palazzo Montecitorio). Under the cellar of a stable on a street in the Campus Martius, a piece of the meridian was excavated, with the markings for various months in Greek letters set into the travertine slabs. Another fragment was hypothesized to be contained in the mosaic still visible in the foundation of the Church of San Lorenzo in Lucina. From 1789 to 1792, Pope Pius VI carried out intensive works to repair the obelisk, which was later raised and restored as a solar clock. The direction of the restoration work was entrusted to the architect Giovanni Antinori, who restored the obelisk using granite from the Column of Antoninus Pius. This column's base, with its famous relief showing the Solar obelisk held as a symbol of the Campus Martius regio by a personification of the Campus, is still preserved in the Vatican Museums. In the new layout of Piazza Montecitorio (inaugurated on 7 June 1998), a new meridian was traced on the pavement in honor of Augustus's meridian, pointing towards the main entrance of the palazzo. Unfortunately, the shadow of the obelisk does not point precisely in that direction, and its gnomonic function is definitively lost.

It is published by Local World. It serves a wide surrounding area of coastal and inland communities in South Devon which attracts millions of tourists each year to swell its 100,000-plus resident population. History The Herald Express was born out of the rivalry between two evening papers, each of which produced local editions for Torbay‚Äîan area which includes Torquay, Paignton and Brixham‚Äîand first appeared in its own right as a title on Monday, 13 July 1925, when the two decided to amalgamate. Devon's premier publishing centres had always been at Plymouth, where Sir Leicester Harmsworth, brother of newspaper baron Lord Northcliffe, controlled the city's Evening Herald, and at Exeter, where Sir James Owen had the county's other evening title, the Express and Echo. First into Torquay had been the Exeter- sponsored Torbay Express and South Devon Echo in 1921, followed shortly afterwards by the Plymouth-controlled Torbay Herald. The latter was produced in Braddons Hill Road West, the former nearby in Union Street. The competition was intense and Torquay of the day did not have the commercial output to support two evening titles. Eventually the papers merged, Harmsworth having acquired his rival, to become the Torbay Herald and Express, and printed in Braddons Hill Road West. Later this was simplified to Herald Express. It has had the distinction of being based in Fleet Street, for the front entrance and office of the Braddons Hill works was nearby in Torquay's main shopping thoroughfare. It was not until July 1980 that the paper moved to custom-built headquarters on the northern edge of the town. Throughout the years since its founding, the Herald Express has been closely linked with its Exeter sister paper within the Western Times Company and the Northcliffe Group. However, in 1991 it became a new and independent operating company in its own right within Northcliffe as Herald Express Publications Ltd. During its lifetime, it has had nine editors, including the present incumbent, Jim Parker. In March 1996, Northcliffe Newspapers Group restructured its publishing interests in the South West of England. This involved the appointment of a new regional management team to direct the operations of Northcliffe's daily newspaper centres at Plymouth, Exeter and Torquay. Following many changes in the structure of the Torquay operation, the Herald Express printing press was closed in November 1996. The head office in Barton Hill Road retained its existing editorial, advertising and newspaper sales departments, but from then on the paper was to be printed at the Western Morning News building in Plymouth. In June 2011 it was announced that it would become a weekly publication from Thursday 21 July 2011 with the loss of around 16 members (half) of the editorial staff. In 2012, Local World acquired owner Northcliffe Media from Daily Mail and General Trust.\\"Daily Mail sells regional newspapers to Local World\\". BBC News. 21 November 2012.

The Thun-based Br√ºgger & Thomet (B&T;) company provided its client with both a weapon and a special round, with the added benefit of compatibility with a wide array of lethal and less-lethal ammunition produced in the low-velocity class. Design The GL06 is a stand-alone shoulder-firing weapon intended for military and police applications. A special \\"less-lethal\\" version of GL06 was produced as the LL06. Although the LL06 was marketed as a variation of the GL06, the only difference is the bright yellow color of the frame, compared to the standard black of the GL06. Both weapons are fully capable of firing a complete range of lethal and less-lethal 40√ó ammunition. The GL06 is lighter and more compact than other stand-alone weapons of the same class (such as the US M79 or German HK69A1), yet it is capable of greater accuracy, tactical flexibility and has good ergonomics.

It was one of the ancient mints for Indian dynasties as evidenced by the diverse coins excavated here. The site has 5th and 6th- century Gupta era temples and monuments, particularly the colossal stone boar with sages and scholars depicted on the body of the sculpture. The inscription stones found at Eran are important to reconstructing the chronology and Gupta Empire history. Eran or Erakina was the capital of Erakina (Airikina) Pradesha or Airkina Vishaya, an administrative division of the Gupta empire.Raychaudhuri, Hemchandra (1972) Political History of Ancient India, University of Calcutta, Calcutta, p.495 Etymology The ancient name of Eran (), Erakaina, Erakanya or Erakina (as mentioned in the inscriptions); Airikina (, as mentioned in the inscription of Samudragupta) or Erikina (as mentioned in the inscription of Toramana)Lahiri, Bela (1972). Indigenous States of Northern India (Circa 200 B.C. to 320 A.D.), Calcutta: University of Calcutta, p.81 is derived from Eraka. The word erakƒÅ probably refers to a tall grass commonly called the Elephant cattail, botanical name Typha elephantina,William Roxburgh. 1832. Flora indica; or, descriptions of Indian Plants 3: 566‚Äì567, Typha elephantina which grows at Eran in abundance. Location Eran archaeological site map, 1880 sketch Eran is located on the south bank of Bina River in Madhya Pradesh.A. Cunningham (1880), Report of Tours in Bundelkhand and Malwa, Archaeological Survey of India, Volume 10, Calcutta, pages 76-90, It is about north-northeast of the ancient Vidisha-Sanchi-Udayagiri site, about west-northwest of Sagar, and about northeast of Bhopal. At the site, the river makes an inverted \\"U\\" turn, surrounding it with water on three sides, which Cunningham stated made it \\"a very favorite position for Hindu towns\\". The terrain is forested and hilly, with high grounds shielding the south of the Eran town.  History  Eran is an ancient city, one that finds mention as Erakaina or Erakanya in Buddhist and Hindu texts, on ancient coins and inscriptions nearby and distant sites such as Sanchi. It is now a small town surrounded by many mounds, likely archaeological remains of its distant past. The archaeological site nearby Eran has revealed several Gupta Empire era inscriptions. The town of Eran has a museum with a collection of archaeological relics. The first evidence of sati (immolation of widow) is found in an inscription (AD 510) at Eran in Madhya Pradesh.  Archaeology  The following sequence of cultures have been obtained and carbon dated at the site of Eran Period I: Chalcolithic (1800 BC-700 BC) Period II: Early historic (700 BC-2nd century BC) Period IIB: 2nd century BC - 1st century AD Period III: 1st century - 600 AD Period IV: late medieval (16th century AD - 18th century AD) Description The Buddhagupta pillar at Eran (c.476‚Äì495 CE), raised in honour of Janardana, another name of Vishnu. On top if a double statue of Garuda, holding a serpent in his hands, with a chakra wheel behind the head. =Temples= A group of ancient Hindu temples are located to the west of the Eran town. These are not aligned to the east or any cardinal direction, but to 76 degrees, or about 14 degrees off towards north from east. This suggests that they likely date to the Gupta period. According to Cunningham, this deliberate shift for all the temples and some other Gupta era Hindu temple sites may be to match the one nakshatra measure (lunar movement in one day), or one twenty-seventh part of 360 degrees.A. Cunningham (1880), Report of Tours in Bundelkhand and Malwa, Archaeological Survey of India, Volume 10, Calcutta, pages 81-84, All the temples have a rectangular or square plan and they are in a row. Pillar Pillar: It is exactly in front of the line of temples. The high monolith pillar stands on a square platform of side. The bottom of the pillar are of square cross-section (2.85 feet side), the next is octagonal. Above it is a capital in the shape of a reeded bell of height and diameter. On top of the capital is an abacus of height, then a cube of and finally double statue of Garuda holding a snake in his hands, with a chakra wheel behind his head. Garuda, the vahana of Vishnu, is depicted as two fused people, sharing the back, each looking over their 180 degree space, one with the temples, the other towards the town. Near the platform, on the side facing the temples, is a Sanskrit inscription. It mentions the year 165 and the Hindu calendar month of Ashadha, and dedication to Vishnu-Janardhana. The Gupta year 165 implies that the pillar was dedicated in 484/485 CE. The pillar is sometimes referred to as the Buddhagupta pillar or Bhima pillar. Varaha temple The most unusual and remarkable temple is dedicated to the Varaha avatar of Vishnu. Typically, Varaha is presented in Hindu temples as a man-boar avatar. In Eran, it is a colossal theriomorphic representation of the Varaha legend, which Catherine Becker calls an \\"iconographic innovation\\".A. Cunningham (1880), Report of Tours in Bundelkhand and Malwa, Archaeological Survey of India, Volume 10, Calcutta, pages 82-84, Catherine Becker (2010), Not Your Average Boar: The Colossal Varaha at Eran, An Iconographic Innovation, Artibus Asiae, Vol. 70, No. 1, \\"To My Mind\\": Studies in South Asian Art History in Honor of Joanna Gottfried Williams. Part II (2010), pp. 123-149 The boar is made of stone, but the intricate carving of the surface of its body, a goddess hanging by its right tusk, inscriptions and other details make the statue a symbolic narrative. The Eran site is in ruins, but there is enough remnants that suggest that the site was far more complex and developed. Currently, the boar stands in open, but the foundation and stumps around it confirm that around it were walls and mandapa that formed a complete temple. Scholars debate what the shape of the temple would have been. Cunningham, the first archaeologist to write a systematic report, suggested a rectangular shrine. Later scholars such as Catherine Becker suggests that it was likely larger, more along the lines of one found in Khajuraho shrine for Varaha. ;Colossal Varaha The Eran Varaha boar statue with ruins in late 19th- century, showing the relief on the boar's body. The Colossal Varaha at Eran is the earliest known completely theriomorphic iconography for the Varaha avatar of Vishnu. The scene shown is the return of Varaha after he had successfully killed the oppressive demon Hiranyaksha, found and rescued goddess earth (Prithivi, Bhudevi), and the goddess is back safely. The Eran Varaha statue is significant for several reasons: *it shows the importance and popularity of Vaishnavism and its legend of Vishnu avatars *the statue includes goddess earth hanging by the boar's right tusk; she has a tidy hairdo bun, has a turban that is bejeweled, her face calm *the floor is carved to depict the ocean (samudra) with serpents and sealife, a reminder of the oppressive demon who attacks dharma legend *on the body of the Varaha are carved sages and saints of Hinduism identified by their simple robes, pointy beards and hair knotted up like sadhus, by they holding kamandalu water pot in one hand and with a yoga mudra in the other, symbolizing knowledge needing protection and god's benevolence when attacked by the oppressive demon Hiranyaksha *the Varaha's tongue is sticking out slightly, on it is standing a small goddess who has been interpreted as Saraswati (or Vedic goddess Vac) *in his ears are shown celestial musicians *he wears a roundels garland on his shoulders and neck, these add up to 28 matching the 5th-century astronomy that used 28 major stars to divide the night skies into constellations; each of the roundels has miniature carvings with male and female figures *the artists made the teeth of the boar humanlike, his eyes too are made to depict compassion *on its front chest is the Toramana inscription which confirms that the Hunas has invaded the northwest, displaced Gupta Empire authority, and their brief rule over the northwest and central India had begun in early 6th-century *below the inscription are more Hindu sages, further below is ruined fragment that probably was an anthropomorphic carving of Vishnu to explicitly link the Varaha's underlying identity, states Becker. The temple was built by king Dhyana Vishnu. Cunningham and others found it in ruins with pillars broken that suggest its destruction at some point rather than natural erosion. The boar stood on. It is long, high and wide. It was inside a sanctum. Cunningham states that there was also a mandapa in front because of the ruins of pillars he saw. He found two carved 10 feet high pillars which were \\"remarkably fine specimens of Hindu decorative art\\". About in front of what is now the Varaha platform, there is another stone 6 feet by 3.5 feet. It is aligned with the temple alignment and set into the ground. On it is a large shell script inscription that remains undeciphered. It is probably the stone that formed the original temple's entrance. About in front of this entrance stone is the ruined leftovers of a torana (Hindu arched gateway). The gateway pillars are broken, but one of them survives and it is ornamented (\\"G\\" in the plan drawings). Cunningham searched for broken parts of the pillars, but only found a few broken statues and most of the torana pillars gone. Next to the Varaha temple remnants are two terraces, one to the south that is sided square, another by . These were likely temples too, but they are lost. Vishnu temple The Vishnu Temple is to the north of the Varaha temple. It has a damaged colossal statue of Vishnu that is high.A. Cunningham (1880), Report of Tours in Bundelkhand and Malwa, Archaeological Survey of India, Volume 10, Calcutta, pages 85-87, This temple is also mostly ruined, but shows signs of having a sanctum, a mandapa and all the elements of a Hindu temple. Just like the Varaha temple, the Vishnu temple had intricately carved pillars, but with a different design. Parts of the door jamb before the sanctum have survived, and these show the traditional river goddesses Ganga and Yamuna as flanking the sanctum entrance, but they are positioned nearer to the floor like late Gupta era temples. Cunningham dated this temple as probably built in 5th or 6th century, about two or three centuries after the neighboring early Gupta era Varaha temple. The remnants of the entrance, wrote Cunningham, are \\"lavishly decorated\\", with the surviving reliefs showing daily life and rites- of-passage scenes. Near the temple are ruins of a gateway and other monuments, including one which was likely a Vamana temple. According to Cunningham, one of the smaller shrine monuments had a man-boar sculpture which he located in the town of Eran. Narasimha temple The Narasimha Temple is the northernmost substantial structure ruins in the group, though there were additional temples according to excavations by Cunningham. The Narasimha temple was a single room of 12.5 feet by 8.75 feet with a mandapa in front on four pillars. These pillars are now missing, but the remnants on the plinth confirm that they once did. The broken pillars found at the site among the ruins, and who dimensions match the leftover plinth profile, show that the pillars were intricately carved. The sanctum had a high Narasimha statue, the man-lion avatar of Vishnu.A.

File:5th century Hindu temples Eran Madhya Pradesh, plan sketched in 1880.jpgTemple plans File:Eran, Varaha und Garuda-S√§ule (1999).jpgThe body of the stone boar statue has carvings of sages and scholars. =Coins= Eran was likely one of the ancient mints for Indian kingdoms, along with Vidisha, Ujjain, and Tripuri. A large number of antique coins, of different styles, shapes and inscriptions spanning the last few centuries of the 1st millennium BCE through the 7th-century have been discovered here. Over 3,000 coins found here have been dated to between 300 BCE to 100 CE. Square coins were Eran's specialty and these predominate in excavated discoveries. According to Brown, the ancient Erakina or Eran mint innovated the \\"die-method\\" a far more perfect technique to make coins than \\"punch-marked coins\\", thereby distinguishing itself. Cunningham, a late 19th-century archaeologist, states that \\"copper coins of Eran are the finest specimen\\" that he found across India, as well \\"remarkable also for presenting the largest and smallest specimens of old Indian money\\". The largest coin has measured about and the smallest about in diameter. Cunningham grouped the found coins in four: #Punch-marked coins #Cast coins #Die struck coins #Inscribed coins The common motifs on the coin include goddess Lakshmi seated with two elephants flanking her as if spraying water, horses, elephants, bull, trees (probably Bodhi), flowers particularly lotus, swastikas, rivers, Buddhist symbols such as dharmachakra and tri-ratna, triangles. Almost all coins, states Cunningham, show an unusual symbol consisting of a cross with circle in four sections. One of the coins found in Eran with the name Dharmapala stamped on it is in Brahmi script. This copper coin is presently displayed in the British Museum, in London. This, stated Cunningham in 1891, is among the earliest inscribed coins in India.Cunningham, A.: Coins of Ancient India, London, 1891, p. 101, pl. xi On the paleographic grounds this coin has been assigned to the late 3rd century BCE. Another circular lead piece bearing the name of another ruler \\"Indragupta\\", assignable to the same period has been discovered at Eran. Several inscribed copper coins bearing the name 'Erakannya' or 'Erakana' in the Brahmi script have also been found at Eran.Cunningham, A: Archaeological Survey of India, New Delhi, Vol. xiv, plate, xxxi Cunningham proposed that the symbol of the river represent the river Bina on which the village stands. He also surmised that the semi- circle on the coins was representative of the old Eran town. Which was probably so shaped. Bronze coin of Eran of the 3rd Century B.C was found at Sulur, in the Coimbatore district of Tamil Nadu in one of the excavations.Ceramic Traditions in South India; S.Gurumurthy; University of Madras; 1981;page 21 File:EranVidishaCoin.jpgEran Vidisha coin.

Circa AD 476-495.jpgCoin of Buddhagupta in Malwa (476-495 CE) = Inscriptions = Inscription of Sridharavarman (circa 350 CE) The Saka (Indo-Scythian) king Sridharavarman, who ruled in Central India circa 339-368 CE, made an inscription of a small pillar at Eran, together with his Naga military commander.Buddhist Landscapes in Central India: Sanchi Hill and Archaeologies of Religious and Social Change, c. Third Century BC to Fifth Century AD, Julia Shaw, Routledge, 2016 p58-59 Bhanugupta later also wrote his inscription on the same pillar, circa 510 CE. It seems that the inscription of Sridharavarman is succeeded chronologically by a monument and an inscription by Gupta Empire Samudragupta (r.336-380 CE), established \\"for the sake of augmenting his fame\\", who may therefore have ousted Sridharavarman in his campaigns to the West.\\"During the course of this expedition he is believed to have attacked and defeated the Saka Chief Shridhar Varman, ruling over Eran- Vidisha region. He then annexed the area and erected a monument at Eran (modern Sagar District) \\"for the sake cf augmenting his fame\\".\\" in Inscription of Samudragupta Eran inscription of Samudragupta. The Eran Inscription of Samudragupta (336-380 CE) is presently stored in Kolkata Indian Museum. The inscription, in red sandstone, was found not far to the west of the ruined temple of the boar. Though damaged and much of the inscription is missing, this was a significant find, states Cunningham, because on it are numeral scripts, with at least \\"2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7\\" preserved. Inscription of Budhagupta (484‚Äì485 CE) Budhagupta pillar inscription at Eran. The Budhagupta inscription is dated to 484‚Äì485 CE. It is s Vaishnava inscription. It describes that the Gupta kingdom stretched from Kalindi River to Narmada River, that the inscription marks the raising of a column in honour of Janardana, another name of Vishnu. Inscription of Toramana The Eran boar inscription of Toramana is a stone inscription with 8 lines of Sanskrit, first three of which are in meter and rest in prose, written in a North Indian script. It is carved on the chest of a freestanding high red sandstone boar statue, a zoomorphic iconography of Vishnu avatar, and dated to the 6th century.

Coordinates: The fourth inscription is badly damaged, but important. The inscription mentions Bhanugupta and is inscribed on the reverse of the Sridharavarman pillar. It also mentions the death of chieftain or noble Goparaja in a battle the 191st year without mentioning calendar system. This is generally accepted as Gupta era 191, or 510 CE. It also mentions the cremation of Goparaja, and his wife also cremated herself on the funeral pyre. This, states Shelat, is one the earliest recorded instances of Sati. Cunningham did not comment on this Bhanugupta-Goparaja inscription, but did comment on three Sati stones he found and stated that earliest Sati stone monument he found is from Samvat 1361 (1304 CE). The Bhanugupta inscription does not use the word sati or equivalent and the inscription was interpolated by Fleet in the first edition, later revised in the second edition: Eran site has yielded additional sati stones. Alexander Cunningham mentioned three inscribed Sati stones in and around the Eran site including villages across the river in his archaeological survey report for 1874-1875. With inscriptions on them, he dated the first one to the reign of Sultan Mahmud Khilchi of Mandugar-durg and Chanderi, the second to 1664 CE during the reign of Patisahi Sahi Jahan who Cunningham speculated was likely a jagir and noble in court of Shah Jahan, and a third stone he dated to 1774 CE during the rule of Pandit Balwant Rau Govind and Balaji Tuka Deva.A.

Its usage is solely dedicated to Line 5 of the Paris M√©tro. It links Gare d'Austerlitz on the Rive Gauche to Quai de la Rap√©e on the other side of the river. History Location on the Seine Due to restrictions posed by navigational traffic, it was implausible to place a pier in the middle of the river. Therefore, in 1903, engineer Louis Biette, with the help of Fulgence Bienven√ºe, conceptualized a metallic bridge that crossed the river in a single span. It was designed by the architect Jean-Camille Formig√©, who also designed the Pont de Bir-Hakeim, the greenhouses of Auteuil, and the park below the Basilica of Sacr√©-Coeur, and restored the Roman amphitheater in Arles and the Roman theater in Orange. Formig√© decorated the steel arcs with marine-themed reliefs, including dolphins, seashells and seaweeds. Parts of the steel footings are etched with figures of the Parisian Coat of Arms, which symbolizes steadfastness. Tasked with the bridge construction, the Building Society of Levallois-Perret (La Societ√© de Construction de Levallois-Perret) proposed a bridge with a span reaching , which was a record out of all the Parisian bridges at the time. Nowadays, this is only surpassed by Pont Charles-de-Gaulle. The viaduct consists of two reversed steel parabolic arcs joined together at three locations‚Äîtwo near the river banks and one exactly on the top of the arcs‚Äîand a single suspended deck about 8.5 m in width and hovering 11 m above water. As the deck is too close to the water, the arcs ought to be elevated above the deck and affixed at each end to a giant stone abutment, 22 m x 18 m in dimension. The approach to the bridge from the left bank (Gare d'Austerlitz) posed no particular issue to the construction project but it wasn't practical to remove the existing structures on the right bank to clear way for the bridge exit. Therefore, to circumvent this problem, instead of a straight exit leading out from the main bridge (like the one on the left bank), a curved structure was erected with riveted girders parallel to the rails. The helicoid ramp, which has a radius of approximately 75 m and a 40‚Ä∞ gradient, bends in until the rails point downstream. The rails then disappear beneath la Place Mazas and re-emerge at the other end. The construction of the viaduct began in 1903 and was completed by the following year. In 1936, the bridge body was consolidated to allow it to carry more load.

Born in Florence, Bartoli studied physics and mathematics at the University of Pisa until 1874. He was professor of physics at the Technical Institute of Arezzo from 1876, at the University of Sassari from 1878, at the Technical Institute of Firenze from 1879, at the University of Catania from 1886 to 1893, and at the University of Pavia from 1893. In 1874 James Clerk Maxwell found out that the existence of tensions in the ether, in other words radiation pressure, follows from his electromagnetic theory. In 1876 Bartoli derived the existence of radiation pressure from thermodynamics. He argued that the radiant temperature of a body can be raised by reflecting its light from a moving mirror, and therefore it is possible to transport energy from a colder to a hotter body. To avoid this violation of the second law of thermodynamics, it is necessary that light impart a pressure to the mirror. Therefore, the radiation pressure was also called \\"Maxwell- Bartoli pressure\\". Later the radiation pressure played an important role in the work of Albert Einstein in connection with mass‚Äìenergy equivalence and the photoelectric effect. Einstein lived in Pavia at that time (1895), when Bartoli held the Physics chair at the local University. However, it is unknown whether Einstein was directly influenced by Bartoli.

The nursery tank system was developed in Florida. Boats and small rafts were also used to gather the oysters in the deep if they cannot reach by bare foot. The rafts and boats were made in Italy. Also while they remove the oysters they use a small knife or a stone to weaken the oyster from the rocks. The knives are from China. A filter is also a main one to keep the hatchery water clean and the same water level. Such filters are made in Japan. When the oysters need to be carried by hand the workers used Hessian bags made in the United Kingdom. Racks are used often to dry out the bacteria on the oysters. This are also from the United States of America. What the machines do These machines have their own part on working helping us get money from other different countries. Nursery tank systems - These tanks help the oyster larvae survive by eating algae that is stored in the tank. The tank was not in a shape of a water tank or a cylinder it was about one meter high and very wide that it was a size of a swimming pool. Small boats and rafts - The boats and rafts make the job easier. They are designed small to fit through narrow gaps when looking for oysters. Small knives - The knives used in the hatcheries are blunt only the top bit was sharp to help remove oysters of their place. Filter - The filters had different jobs one was to make algae to feed the oyster larvae, the other one was to pump enough water and clean enough for the oysters to survive. Hessian Bags - These bags are hardly made to hold much weight and are easier to carry while working. Racks - Racks were not machines but they help the hatchery to produce more money by killing the bacteria that make you sick. Exploring the hatchery Nowadays hatcheries have expanded with more machines than before. The hatchery is not a factory, it is a place for oysters to grow and be harvested and then transported to a factory. The oyster larva has a soft body. It begins to grow an outer skin and when that happens the larvae are old enough to find an obstacle to settle on. The hatchery has many interesting machines and equipment.

It is a form of \\"credit enhancement\\" that generally results in the rating of the insured security being the higher of (i) the claims-paying rating of the insurer or (ii) the rating the bond would have without insurance (also known as the \\"underlying\\" or \\"shadow\\" rating). The insurer is paid a premium by the issuer or owner of the security to be insured. The premium may be paid as a lump sum or in installments. The premium charged for insurance on a bond is a measure of the perceived risk of failure of the issuer. It can also be a function of the interest savings realized by an issuer from employing bond insurance or the increased value of the security realized by an owner who purchased bond insurance. Bond insurers are \\"monoline\\" by statute, which means that companies that write bond insurance do not participate in other lines of insurance such as life, health, or property and casualty. The term monoline does not mean that insurers operate only in one securities market, such as municipal bonds, as the term has sometimes been misconstrued. Although bond insurers are not the only monoline insurers, they are sometimes colloquially called \\"the monolines\\". Bonds insured by these companies are sometimes said to be \\"wrapped\\" by the insurer.The term 'wrap' is used in the various FAQs and documents referenced in this article. Also see Structured Finance & Collateralized Debt Obligations, by Janet Tavakoli, 2008, Wiley Bond insurers generally insure only securities that have underlying or \\"shadow\\" ratings in the investment grade category, with unenhanced ratings ranging from \\"triple-B\\" to \\"triple-A\\". Benefits = Value to issuers = The economic value of bond insurance to the governmental unit, agency, or other issuer of the insured bonds or other securities is the result of the savings on interest costs, which reflects the difference between yield payable on an insured bond and yield payable on the same bond if it was uninsured‚Äîwhich is generally higher. Borrowing costs are generally reduced for issuers of insured bonds because investors are prepared to accept a lower interest rate in exchange for the credit enhancement provided by the insurance. The interest savings are generally shared between the issuer (as its incentive to use the insurance) and the insurer (as its insurance premium). Since an issuer has the option of selling its securities with or without insurance, it will generally only use insurance when doing so results in overall cost savings. Municipal bond insurance premiums are generally paid up-front as a lump sum; while non- municipal bond insurance premiums are generally paid in periodic installments over time. In July 2008, the Association of Financial Guaranty Insurers (\\"AGFI\\"), the trade association of financial guaranty insurers and reinsurers, estimated that, since its inception in 1971, the bond insurance industry had saved municipal bond issuers and their taxpayers $40 billion. A majority of insured securities today are municipal bonds issued by states, local governments and other governmental bodies in the United States and in certain other countries. Bond insurance has also been applied to infrastructure project financing, such as those for public-private partnerships, bonds issued by non-U.S. regulated utilities, and U.S. and non-U.S. asset-backed securities (\\"ABS\\"). Financial guaranty insurers withdrew from the residential mortgage- backed securities (\\"RMBS\\") market after the 2008 financial crisis. = Value to investors = Investors purchasing or holding insured securities benefit from the additional payment source provided by the insurer if the issuer fails to pay principal or interest when due (which reduces the probability of a missed payment to the probability that not only the issuer but also the insurer defaults). The value proposition of bond insurance includes the insurers' credit selection, underwriting, and surveillance of the underlying transactions. Significantly, uninsured transactions are often not monitored by rating agencies following their initial rating issuance. In the event of default of such transactions, bond trustees often fail to take appropriate remedial actions absent direction and indemnity from the bondholders (which is typically not forthcoming). In contrast, bond insurers frequently have the ability to work directly with issuers either to avoid defaults in the first place or to restructure debts on a consensual basis, without the need to obtain agreement from hundreds of individual investors. Litigation to obtain recovery, should it be necessary, is the insurer's responsibility, not the investor's. The insurance may also improve market liquidity for the insured securities. The uninsured bonds of an individual issuer may trade infrequently, while bonds trading in the insurer's name are more likely to be actively traded on a daily basis. Investors in insured bonds are also protected from rating downgrades of issuers, so long as the insurer is more highly rated than the issuer. Following the global financial crisis of 2008, municipal market events have helped to refocus investors and issuers on the benefits that bond insurance provides. A number of well-publicized municipal defaults, bankruptcies and restructurings occurred, which proved that bond insurance remains valuable in the public finance market. For example, holders of insured bonds were kept whole by Assured Guaranty and National Public Finance Guarantee in situations involving Detroit, Michigan; Jefferson County, Alabama; Harrisburg, Pennsylvania; Stockton, California and Puerto Rico. In the secondary market, insured bonds have generally exhibited significant price stability relative to comparable uninsured bonds of distressed issuers. Additionally, investors were spared the burdens of negotiating or litigating to defend their rights. Although the financial crisis caused most bond insurers to cease issuing insurance policies, the insurance has continued to remain available from highly rated providers, including legacy insurers and new industry participants.  History: 1970s‚Äì2008  Prior to the 2008 financial crisis, bond insurers suffered few material losses. Notable exceptions in the municipal sector include: * a 1984 Ambac loss on its exposure to the Washington Public Power Supply System (WPPSS), which helped establish the value of bond insurance; and * a 1998 MBIA loss on its exposure to Allegheny Health, Education and Research Foundation (AHERF), which declared bankruptcy. As publicbonds.org points out, a 1994 BusinessWeek article called MBIA \\"an almost perfect money machine\\". The BusinessWeek story noted that, as of that time, MBIA had seen only one loss.Major Player: Bond Insurers, publicbonds.org, accessed 2010 4 15, Corporate Research Project / Good Jobs First.

(subsequently renamed AMBAC and later \\"Ambac\\"). Ambac was the first separately capitalized insurance company formed for the purpose of insuring bonds. In 1973 Municipal Bond Insurance Association (subsequently renamed \\"MBIA\\") formed, followed by Financial Guaranty Insurance Company (\\"FGIC\\") in 1983. Financial Security Assurance Inc. (\\"FSA\\", now known as Assured Guaranty Municipal) formed in 1985. FSA was the first bond insurer organized to insure non-municipal bonds, and it established the business of insuring asset-backed securities (ABS). These became known as the \\"big four\\" bond insurers. By 1980, about 2.5% of long-term municipal bonds were insured.Major Players, publicbonds.org, Corporate Research Project / Good Jobs First, accessed 2010 4 11 In 1983, the Washington Public Power Supply System (WPPSS) defaulted on $2.25 billion of revenue bonds relating to troubled nuclear power projects. Most of the 30,000 bondholders lost 60-90 cents on the dollar.Washington Public Power Supply System (WPPSS) History Link 5482, By David Wilma, July 10, 2003 Ambac had insured a small portion of the bonds, and holders of the insured debt received full and timely payment from Ambac, which demonstrated the value of bond insurance to the market. This proved to be a watershed moment for the bond insurance industry, igniting steady growth in demand for many years. During the 1980s, other participants emerged in the sector including Bond Investors Guaranty Insurance Company (\\"BIG\\") (1985) and Capital Markets Assurance Corp. (\\"CapMac\\") (1988), both of which were subsequently acquired by MBIA; Capital Guaranty Corp. (1986), which was subsequently acquired by FSA; and College Construction Loan Insurance Corporation (\\"Connie Lee\\") (1987), which was subsequently acquired by Ambac. The 1980s also saw the birth of monoline financial guaranty reinsurance companies, including Enhance Reinsurance Company (\\"Enhance Re\\") (1986) and Capital Reinsurance Company (1988). FSA insured the first collateralized debt obligation (\\"CDO\\") in 1988, and experienced only minor losses in the asset-backed securities (ABS) sector before the 2008 financial crisis. In 1989, New York State enacted a new Article 69 of the New York State Insurance Law, which established \\"financial guaranty insurance\\" as a separate line of insurance. Article 69 excluded financial guaranty insurers from coverage under the property/casualty insurers security fund, which covered payments owed by insolvent insurers. It also established financial guaranty insurance as a monoline business, limiting industry members to writing bond insurance and closely related lines of insurance that include surety, credit, and residual-value insurance. The monoline restriction also prevented other types of insurance companies from offering financial guaranty insurance. A cited rationale for the monoline approach was to simplify regulation and help ensure capital adequacy. The 1990s saw industry members insure both municipal bonds and asset-backed securities (ABS). At the same time, the industry expanded into overseas markets in Europe, Asia, Australia, and Latin America. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, a new group of bond insurers emerged. These included ACA Financial Guaranty Corp. (1997); XL Capital Assurance Inc. (\\"XLCA\\") (2000), a subsidiary of XL Capital Ltd. that was spun off in 2006 and subsequently renamed \\"Syncora Guarantee Inc.\\"; and CIFG (2001). This era also saw the emergence of new reinsurers, such as Ram Reinsurance Company Ltd. (\\"Ram Re\\") and AXA Re Finance.Fitch Assigns Negative Rating Outlook to Monoline Reinsurers, Business Wire, July 26, 2002 access 2010 4 11 In 1999, ACE Ltd. acquired Capital Re, and renamed the company \\"ACE Capital Re.\\" ACE Capital Re was spun off from ACE Ltd. in 2004 and renamed Assured Guaranty Corp.

(\\"Assured Guaranty\\"), engaged through its subsidiaries in both financial guaranty insurance ‚Äì through AGC‚Äîand reinsurance‚Äîthrough Assured Guaranty Re Ltd. (\\"AG Re\\"). In 1999, the New York State Insurance Department (NYID) issued guidance regarding insurance of obligations under credit default swaps, which facilitated the participation by financial guaranty insurers in the CDS market. The NYID guidance was subsequently codified by amendments to Article 69 of the New York Insurance Law. In 2001, Radian Group Inc. acquired Enhance Reinsurance Company and its affiliate, Asset Guaranty Insurance Company, renaming the companies Radian Reinsurance Inc. and Radian Asset Assurance Inc. (\\"Radian Asset\\"), respectively. Both companies engaged in financial guaranty insurance and reinsurance. In June 2004, Radian Reinsurance and Radian Asset Assurance merged, with the surviving corporation being Radian Asset.  Financial crisis  = Events = Bond insurers had guaranteed the performance of residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) since the 1980s, but their guaranties of that asset class expanded at an accelerated pace in the 2000s leading up to the 2008 financial crisis. Bond insurers were also exposed to residential mortgage debt through collateralized loan obligations (CLOs) and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) backed by subprime mortgage debt. The insurers had sold credit default swap (CDS) protection on specific tranches of CDOs. [30] [31] This business contributed to the monolines' growth in the early 2000s, with $3.3 trillion insured in 2006,\\"A Monoline Meltdown?\\" The Economist, July 26, 2007 with that contingent liability backed by approximately $47 billion of claims-paying resources. These exposures were all in compliance with Article 69 of the New York Insurance Law and other states' financial guaranty insurance statutes and with capital adequacy guidelines set by the rating agencies. As the housing bubble grew in the mid-2000s, bond insurers generally increased the collateral protection required for the RMBS they guaranteed. But when the housing market declined, defaults soared to record levels on subprime mortgage loans and new types of adjustable rate mortgage (ARM) loans‚Äîinterest-only, option-ARM, stated-income, and so-called \\"no income no asset\\" (NINA) loans‚Äîthat had been developed and issued in anticipation of continuing appreciation in housing prices. The subsequent real estate market decline was unprecedented in its severity and geographic distribution across the U.S., and was not anticipated by the bond insurers or the rating agencies that evaluated their creditworthiness. Unlike many other types of insurance, bond insurance generally provides an unconditional and irrevocable guaranty‚Äîalthough the insurers reserve the right to pursue contractual and other available remedies. As a result, the bond insurers faced billions of dollars of claims on insured RMBS, with uncertain prospects for recoveries from the sponsors (creators) of those RMBS. Monoline insurers posted higher reserves for losses as these insured securities appeared headed for default. Following the crisis, the bond insurers became aware that many RMBS they had insured included large percentages of loans that were ineligible for securitization, i.e., they should not have been in the RMBS and were subject to repurchase by the RMBS sponsors. As provided under the insurance contracts, the insurers \\"put back\\" to the sponsors such loans, which breached applicable representations and warranties (\\"R&W;\\") regarding what was in the securitizations, i.e., they demanded the sponsors buy the loans out of the pool, as required under the contracts. Such \\"putbacks\\" have remained subject to litigation into the second decade following the financial crisis. One indication of the extent of loan quality misrepresentation was a 2011 settlement between Assured Guaranty and Bank of America, which had purchased mortgage originator Countrywide. Under the terms of the settlement, Bank of America made a $1.1 billion payment to Assured Guaranty and agreed to cover 80% of up to $6.6 billion of Assured Guaranty's future paid losses from breaches of representations and warranties on 21 insured RMBS transactions. Subsequently, in 2013, in the first R&W; trial to reach a judgment, Flagstar Bank was required to compensate Assured Guaranty in full for past and future claims. The amounts that Assured Guaranty caused R&W; providers to pay or commit to pay through putbacks and settlements plus the amount of future projected losses that Assured Guaranty avoided through negotiated terminations totaled approximately $4.2 billion as of March 31, 2015. While the widespread misrepresentations caused bond insurers to experience considerable losses on insured securities backed by residential mortgage loans (including first lien loans, second lien loans, and home equity lines of credit), the most severe losses were experienced by those that insured CDOs backed by mezzanine RMBS. Although the bond insurers generally insured such CDOs at very high attachment points or collateral levels (with underlying ratings of triple-A), those bond insurers and the rating agencies failed to anticipate the correlation of performance of the underlying securities. Specifically, these bond insurers and rating agencies relied on historical data that did not prove predictive of residential mortgage loan performance following the 2008 crisis, which witnessed the first-ever nationwide decline in housing prices. Notably, AGM and AGC did not insure such CDOs, which has allowed Assured Guaranty to continue writing business throughout the financial crisis and ensuing recession and recovery. = Impacts on individual companies; regulatory response = The financial crisis precipitated many changes in the bond insurance industry, including rating agency downgrades, several companies ceasing to write new business, dramatic share value reductions, and consolidation among the insurers. The industry's primary regulators in New York also took action, as did their counterparts in Wisconsin. On November 7, 2007, ACA, the only single-A rated insurer, reported a $1 billion loss, wiping out equity and resulting in negative net worth.[36] On November 19, ACA noted in a 10-Q that if downgraded below single-A-minus, it would have to post collateral to comply with standard insurance agreements, and that‚Äîbased on current fair values‚Äîthe firm would be unable to do so. On December 13, 2007, ACA's stock was delisted from the New York Stock Exchange due to low market price and negative net worth, although ACA retained its single-A rating. On December 19, 2007, the company was downgraded to triple-C by Standard & Poor's.Market Muted in ACA Drop, The Bond Buyer, Dec. 19, 2007 Downgrades of major triple-A monolines began in December 2007, resulting in downgrades of thousands of municipal bonds and structured financings insured by the companies. In 2007 Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Assurance entered the market. Also during this time, credit default swap markets quoted rates for monoline default protection that would have been typical for below-investment- grade credits. Structured credit issuance ceased, and many municipal bond issuers went to market without bond insurance. By January 2008, many insured municipal and institutional bonds were trading at prices as if they were uninsured, effectively discounting the financial guaranty insurance completely. The slow reaction of the rating agencies in acknowledging this situation echoed their slow downgrading of subprime mortgage debt a year earlier.Corporate and Municipal Bond Trading Costs During the Financial Crisis, a White Paper by Peter Ciampi and Eric Zitzewitz In 2008, the New York State Insurance Department (NYID) issued \\"Circular Letter No. 19\\", which described \\"best practices\\" for financial guaranty insurers, particularly relating to categories of securities that had damaged the industry in the financial crisis. In 2009, Assured Guaranty acquired FSA and subsequently renamed it Assured Guaranty Municipal (\\"AGM\\"), combining under the same ownership the two most highly rated bond insurers at that time. Assured Guaranty became the only bond insurer to write insurance continuously from the pre-crisis period to the present. Also in 2009, MBIA separated its municipal bond insurance business from its other mostly asset-backed business, and formed National Public Finance Guarantee Corp. (\\"National\\") as an investment- grade insurer with the municipal bond insurance business that had previously resided in MBIA. Continuing the trend of reorganization in 2008, Ambac ceased writing business and in 2010 was split into (i) a \\"segregated account\\" (with liability for asset-backed and certain other troubled policies) subject to a rehabilitation overseen by the Wisconsin Office of the Commissioner of Insurance and (ii) a \\"general account\\" for municipal bond insurance and certain other non-troubled policies. On November 8, 2010, Ambac's holding company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. By order of the New York State Insurance Department, FGIC ceased paying claims in 2010 and is in run-off, now paying claims in part. Syncora Guarantee Inc. (\\"Syncora\\"), CIFG, Radian Asset and Ram Re remained solvent but have generally not written new business. Ram Re has been renamed American Overseas Reinsurance Company Ltd. and has redomesticated to Barbados. The company never filed for bankruptcy and is writing new lines of insurance while it runs off its financial guaranty book. In January 2012, Assured Guaranty acquired a bond insurance subsidiary that was owned by Radian Asset but never launched, renamed it Municipal Assurance Corp. (\\"MAC\\"), and launched the new company as a municipal-only bond insurer in July 2013. In July 2012, Build America Mutual (\\"BAM\\") began operations as a mutually owned municipal-only bond insurer. In December 2014, Assured Guaranty acquired Radian Asset, which was fully merged into Assured Guaranty Corp. (\\"AGC\\") in April 2015. In July 2016, Assured Guaranty acquired CIFG, which was merged into AGC. In January 2017, Assured acquired MBIA UK Insurance Limited (\\"MBIA UK\\") and renamed it Assured Guaranty (London) Ltd. In June 2017, Standard and Poor's lowered the financial strength ratings of National to A from AA- and lowered the long-term counterparty rating of MBIA Inc. to BBB from A-[51] Subsequent to the downgrade, MBIA announced that National would cease, for the time being, the pursuit of new bond insurance business. In January 2018, Syncora Guarantee announced a successful merger of its subsidiary Syncora Capital Assurance Inc. (\\"SCAI\\") into its wholly owned subsidiary, Syncora Guarantee Inc. (\\"SGI\\"), with SGI being the surviving entity. In the following month, Syncora and Assured Guaranty announced that Assured would reinsure approximately $13.5 billion of SGI-insured policies and provide certain administrative services to SGI with respect to the reinsured policies. In June 2018, Assured Guaranty announced that it had completed the reinsurance transaction. Both companies said that the transaction would strengthen their financial positions. In February 2018, Ambac Assurance Corporation completed rehabilitation of its Segregated Account. The conclusion of the rehabilitation followed the successful completion of Ambac's surplus note exchange offers and consent solicitation, which, together with the satisfaction of all remaining conditions, completed a holistic restructuring transaction that had been announced in 2017. Ambac Assurance Corporation currently pays all claims in full and in cash. As a result of its multiple acquisitions, by 2017 Assured Guaranty owned four different European subsidiaries, which it merged into a single entity in November 2018, named Assured Guaranty (Europe) Ltd.  Critiques of the business; rating agencies  Some have criticized the whole business model of financial guaranty insurance. In her book Confidence Game, Christine S. Richard examined the industry's basic assumptions. She argued that a monoline's business can be seen as the sale of a triple-A credit rating to a municipal bond issuer. She noted that the rating agencies had different rating scales for municipal issuers and non-municipal issuers (e.g., corporations). Some argued that if the rating agencies had rated municipalities on the same scale they used to rate corporations, the municipalities would have been higher rated, obviating the need for bond insurance. The question was debated before Congress in 2008, at the House Committee on Financial Services under Barney Frank. Richard Blumenthal, then-attorney general of Connecticut, Ajit Jain of Berkshire Hathaway, then-Superintendent Eric Dinallo of the New York State Insurance Department, and a Moody's representative were also in attendance. Standard & Poor's Ratings Services has denied that it employed or employs a separate rating scale for municipal and non-municipal issues. Moody's Investors Service acknowledged that it employed separate rating scales for municipal and non- municipal issues, but has since adopted a uniform rating scale for all issues. The argument that bond insurance provided no value in the municipal bond market was proven wrong not long after the 2008 congressional hearings. The following decade saw a number of significant municipal defaults, including the two largest ‚Äì by Detroit and Puerto Rico. In both those cases and others, bond insurers kept insured bondholders whole. Richard's book also described the role of hedge fund manager Bill Ackman (Gotham, Pershing Square), who grew increasingly suspicious of the viability of MBIA. Ackman believed the company had insufficient capital and he shorted it by purchasing credit default swaps on MBIA corporate debt. He also released reports to the public, regulators and other corporate executives. Commentators such as investor David Einhorn have criticized rating agencies for being slow to act and for giving the monolines undeserved ratings that allowed them to be paid to \\"bless\\" bonds with these ratings.

The typical structure of CSPs is made of six or seven Œ±-helical chains of about 110-120 amino acids (10-12 kDa), including four cysteines that build two small loops, two adjacent disulfide bridges, and a globular \\"prism-like\\" functional structure [5]. Three CSP structures have been solved in moths (Mamestra brassicae and Bombyx mori) and locusts (Schistocerca gregaria) [5-8]. Gene structure and evolution The CSP structure is highly flexible. CSPs are characterized by RNA editing and/or post-translational modifications as discovered in the silkworm moth, B. mori [9-14]. The addition of glycine near cysteine at specific location, amino acid inversion and motif insertion in protein sequence strongly argue for the existence of recoding at the level of protein synthesis in the CSP family [9-14]. In addition, they are capable of breathing or specific conformational changes upon ligand binding, which may represent another key feature of the ancestral primitive multifunctional soluble binding protein [15]. The number of CSP genes is usually very low in insects as found in Drosophila flies, Anopheles mosquitoes, Pediculus lice, honeybees and jewel wasps (4-8) [4, 24, 40-41]. A significantly higher number of CSP genes exist in butterfly, moth and beetle genomes (nb CSPs=19-20) [32, 42-43]. Culex mosquito species have between 27 and 83 CSP genes [44]. More than hundreds of protein variants can be produced from CSP genes through or mediated via post-translational modifications and/or RNA-peptide editing as in the case of Dscam and cochlear sensory genes [9-14]. CSP genes evolved via duplication, intron loss and gain, and retrotransposition events [4, 14, 32, 40-41, 45]. A single unified hypothesis of RNA editing and retrotransposition-driven evolution of CSPs, i.e. initial production of new CSP protein motifs via DNA and RNA -dependent RNA polymerization before retro- transposition of edited CSP-RNA variants, has been proposed in moths [11]. Expression In insects, CSPs are found throughout the whole insect development process from eggs and larvae to nymphal and adult stages [4, 16-19]. In locusts, they are mainly expressed in the antennae, tarsi and legs, and found to be associated with phase change [3-4, 20-22]. CSPs are not the apanage of insects. They are also expressed in many various organisms such as crustacean, shrimp and many other arthropod species [23]. However, they are not specific to the arthropod kingdom. They are also expressed at the level of the bacterial superkingdom, demonstrating their existence not only in eukaryotes, but also in prokaryote organisms [23-24]. Prokaryote CSPs are twins or identical twins to insect CSPs [24]. They have been reported from bacterial species such as coccobacillus Acinetobacter baumannii, Macrococcus/Staphylococcus caseolyticus, the filamentous actinomycete Kitasatospora griseola, an Actinobacteria genus in the family Streptomycetaceae, and Escherichia coli (E. coli) which are known as common bacteria from the digestive tract, main prokaryotic secondary metabolites, opportunistic multi-drug resistant pathogens, high positive cytochrome c oxidase reactions, and symbionts of multiple insect species [24]. Their existence has been mentioned in plants, but this still needs to be demonstrated experimentally [25-26]. CSPs can be extracted from wasp venom [27]. In moths, nearly all CSPs are expressed in the female pheromone gland [9-14]. However, CSP expressing secretions and tissues are not only the female moth pheromone gland, but also antennal branches, mandibles and salivae, cephalic capsula, eyes, proboscis, thorax and abdomen, head, epidermis, fat body, gut, wings and legs, i.e. a wide range of reproductive and non reproductive, sensory and non-sensory fluids and tissues of the insect body [28-31]. Nearly all CSPs are up regulated in most of all tissues from the insect body, particularly in the gut, epidermis and fat body, following insecticide exposure [32]. Functions and binding properties Such a broad pattern in gene expression over such a wide range of sensory and non-sensory fluids or tissues is in strong agreement with a very general basic function for this gene family, i.e. in relation with lipid transport and metabolism. A role of CSPs in general immunity, insecticide resistance and xenobiotic degradation has been recently brought up by Xuan et al. (2015), who showed a drastic and remarkable up-regulation of CSP genes in many various tissues over exposure to abamectin insecticide molecule [32]. Increased load of CSPs (pherokines) in fly hemolymph is observed after microbial or viral infection [33]. The particular role of CSP proteins in lipid transport in relation with insecticide resistance has been brought up by Liu et al. (2016) in whiteflies [34]. Liu et al. showed insecticide-mediated up regulation and interaction of the protein with C18-lipid (linoleic acid), suggesting a metabolic role of CSP in insect defense rather than olfaction or chemical communication [34]. The first member of this soluble protein family has been reported by Nomura et al. (1982) as up-regulated factor (p10) in the regenerating legs of the American cockroach Periplaneta americana [35]. The same protein was identified in the antennae and legs from P. americana at the adult sexually mature stage with some apparent differences between males and females, rather suggesting a ‚Äúchemodevol‚Äù function for this protein, contributing both to tissue development and recognition of sex-specific signals such as sex pheromones [2]. In immunocytochemistry experiments, one (polyclonal) antibody against CSP labeled the antennal sensillum, but the labeling was not restricted to sensory structures but rather diffused to the cuticle and supporting cells [3, 36]. A function of CSPs in lipid transport is consistent with a crucial role not only in insect general immunity, moth pheromone synthesis or locust behavioral phase change, but also in head development as described in honeybees [37]. CSPs have been proposed to mediate recognition of chemical signatures composed of cuticular lipids as for instance in ants [38]. However, it is not clear whether some CSPs are involved in chemical communications, others in development or other physiological roles. The functional CSP structure is bound with fatty acid molecules [5]. Other functional CSP structures have been shown to interact directly with exogenous compounds such as toxic chemical compounds (cinnamaldehyde) from plant oils [34]. So, CSPs expressed not only in arthropods, but also in bacteria, and apparently endowed with heterogeneous functions. CSPs can trigger innate immune pathways in plants [39]. Nomenclature The first member of this gene family was called p10, in reference to the size and molecular weight (in kDa) of a protein from insect regenerating legs. The same protein (called Pam) was found in the adult antennae and legs from the two sexes of the American cockroach P. americana [2, 35]. Similar clones identified in Drosophila and Locusta in a search for olfactory genes referred to Olfactory-Sensory type D protein (OS-D or Pheromone Binding Protein A10) [20, 46-47]. Related clones identified in the antennae of the sphingid Manduca sexta were named sensory appendage proteins (SAPs) to distinguish them from a family of longer six-cysteine soluble proteins, i.e. odorant-binding proteins or OBPs [48]. Individual SAPs/CSPs have been designated in various ways: p10/Periplaneta americana (Nomura et al., 1992) [35], A10/Drosophila melanogaster (Pikielny et al., 1994) [46], OS-D/D. melanogaster (McKenna et al., 1994) [47], Pam/P. americana (Picimbon & Leal, 1999) [2], CSP/Schistocerca gregaria (Angeli et al., 1999) [3], SAP/Manduca sexta (Robertson et al., 1999) [48], Pherokine/D. melanogaster (Sabatier et al., 2003) [33], B-CSP/Acinetobacter baumannii, Macrococcus caseolyticus, Kitasatospora griseola, Escherichia coli (Liu et al., 2019) [24]. The protein family was renamed to chemosensory protein (CSP) by Angeli et al. after one (polyclonal) antibody against p10 labeled some sensory structures in the adult antennae of the desert locust Schistocerca gregaria [3]. The term ‚ÄúB-CSP‚Äù was used to refer to similar clones from bacterial (B) species [24]. However, the functional importance of CSP proteins in olfaction/chemosensing remains to be proved. Since then, this protein gene family has been proved to act outside the chemosensory system [32]. They were called pherokines to designate proteins in abundance in the fly hemolymph in response to microbial or viral infection [33]. It was even proposed to rename these proteins to cuticular sensory proteins to keep the name but to emphasize on their expression level not only in sensory organs, but also in the immune barriers between the insect and the environment [49-50]. An email forum was organized to find most suitable new name considering the growing evidence that CSPs do not play a central and unique role in chemosensing, if any [32]. The term ‚ÄúCSP‚Äù has grown and is taken to mean belonging to a group of soluble proteins with a particular four-cysteine pattern and a high level of structural similarity [4, 14, 23-36, 32-37, 50]. The term ‚ÄúCSP‚Äù is rather unsuitable especially to designate the whole protein gene family because it means literally ‚ÄúChemosensory Proteins‚Äù [3]. This term should not be used to unite under a common name all genes and proteins that are related in an evolutionary context from bacteria to honeybees. The knowledge to name the CSPs properly comes now with this thorough analysis of sea crustaceans, arthropod, bacteria and insect genome and Expressed Sequence Tag (EST) databases in the continuity of molecular data that demonstrate that CSPs are not exclusively tuned to olfactory/taste chemosensory organs [4, 14, 23-36, 32-37, 50]. It is a situation similar to lipocalins (from Greek lipos=fat and Greek kalyx=cup), where the name designates a superfamily of widely distributed and heterogenous proteins, which transport small hydrophobic molecules including steroids and lipids. However, in contrast to lipocalins, the ‚ÄúCSP‚Äù family refers to homogenous evolutionary-well conserved proteins with characteristic sequence (4 cysteines), tissue profiling (ubiquitously expressed), and rather highly diverse binding properties (not only to long fatty acids (FAs) and straight lipid chains, but also to cyclic compounds such as cinnamaldehyde) [34]. Therefore, it is rather difficult to name groups and sub-groups within the CSP family, although numerous CSP proteins are mainly produced in the gut and the fat body that are considered as the insect body‚Äôs principle storage organs for energy in the forms of FAs and lipids, which are mobilized through lipolysis process to provide fuel to other organs to develop, regenerate or grow and/or to respond to an infectious agent [4, 14, 50]. In moths, specific lipid chains are mobilized for pheromone synthesis [9-14]. References 1\\\\. Vogt RG, Riddiford LM. Pheromone binding and inactivation by moth antennae.

Some of Mr. Brody's additional credits include The First Wives Club, Wigstock: The Movie, The Natural, Inspector Gadget, Thir13en Ghosts, Manny & Lo, Flirting with Disaster, Raise the Red Lantern, Great Expectations, as well as the TV-shows New York News, Sesame Street, Gullah Gullah Island, What Not to Wear, Helen of Troy, Vietnam War Story, and American Masters. Advertising and commercial production Prior to joining Cannon Films in Hollywood as Head of Post Production, Brody worked in advertising and commercial production. After leaving University in 1976, he joined the staff at the ad agency, Ted Bates AB in Stockholm as a studio still photographer, shooting everything from people to product photography. He returned to New York a year later where he worked at the In-House Production Company at Ogilvy & Mather on several accounts most notably, American Express, and then joined Ted Bates in Stockholm once again as a commercial producer working on the Marabou and Apotekarnes accounts. From 1979 thru 1984, he worked at several well-known production companies in New York, producing commercials for a wide range of clients including Volkswagen, Canon, Coppertone, Lincoln Mercury, The U.S. Postal Service, Chemical Bank, Barclay's Bank, Ship n' Shore, Fayva, Gillette, De Beers, Avon, Oil of Olay, WNBC News, L'eggs, 7-Up, Glaxo, Toni, Coleco, Wella Balsam, Lux, Duncan Hines, Post Fruit & Fiber, Weight Watchers, Windex, ABC Television, Fawcett Paperbacks, Keepsake Diamond Engagement Rings, Minute Rice, Goodyear, The American Cancer Society, and Puffs Tissues, as well as Music Videos for Pat Benatar, Kiss, Zebra, Rachel Sweet, Wire Train, and The Bongos \\"Number With Wings\\" which was nominated for Best Direction at the 1st MTV Music Awards!

In 2010, former model Ann Kirsten Kennis filed suit against Vampire Weekend and Mr. Brody claiming misuse of the image which she said she believed to be a Polaroid taken by her mother. Her attorney later recanted that claim, saying they didn‚Äôt know what the origin of the photo was. Vampire Weekend then filed suit against Mr. Brody who later filed a counter suit against the band. After the initial filings and interrogatories, negotiations continued and ultimately, the suits were settled out of court when Vampire Weekend paid an undisclosed figure to Ms. Kennis. Mr Brody ultimately was not party to the cash settlement. Mr. Brody was initially represented by the Los Angeles law firm Lavely & Singer and later by Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom. In Mr. Brody‚Äôs initial answer to the suit he provided detailed information about the taking of the photo, including information about Ms. Kennis, who simply went by the name ‚ÄúKirsten‚Äù as a model.

In January 2002, Springer, then a calf developmentally equivalent to a human toddler, was discovered alone and emaciated some 250 miles from the territory of her family (called a pod). Experts identified Springer by her vocal calls that are specific to her family, or \\"pod,\\" and by examining photographs of her eye patch. They were also able determine where Springer's pod was currently located. After months of heated public debate, a decision was made by the United States National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) to capture the young orca and attempt to reintegrate her into her pod. On June 12, 2002, Springer was captured and moved to a seapen in Manchester, Washington. On July 13, after medical treatment and rehabilitation, Springer was transported to Johnstone Strait, BC and held in a seapen at Dong Chong Bay, Hanson Island. The next morning, Springer was released near her close relatives. In October, she was seen traveling with her pod to the open ocean. The following July, she returned to Johnstone Strait with the same orca pod. Springer has been observed with her pod in Johnstone Strait every year since her rescue and translocation, becoming the only cetacean in history to be successfully reintegrated into a wild population after human intervention. In July 2013, 11 years after her rescue, Springer was seen off the central British Columbia coast with a new calf and is considered to be a contributing member of that population. In 2017 Springer was seen with another calf, who was confirmed to be her second offspring. Appearance in Puget Sound Springer's family was traced through analysis of her vocal dialect. Her mother was \\"Sutlej,\\" who probably died in 2001. Although there were possible sightings in early January 2002 of either a juvenile orca or false killer whale in northern Puget Sound near the town of La Conner, Washington, Springer was first confirmed by researchers and reported to news media on January 14 when she was spotted swimming alone near the Vashon Island ferry dock south of Seattle. At that time, she was 11 feet long and estimated to be between 18 and 36 months old. Springer's presence was immediately regarded as a mystery, as orcas are rarely observed alone, and mothers never leave young offspring unattended. As advocates and researchers worked to identify this strange visitor to Seattle, grave concern arose over her presence in the waters off a major metropolitan area. In one of the first media reports on January 19, 2002, the public was urged to resist the temptation to interact with this highly sociable orca, not to try to capture up-close photographs or video of her, or worse yet, do what was reportedly already happening, try to feed her. \\"The message we want to get out to boaters is, no matter how much you want to help this whale, do not approach it, don't feed it,\\" Michael Harris of Orca Conservancy warned on KING-TV (NBC Seattle). \\"A fed whale is a dead whale.\\"\\"Podless in Seattle,\\" KING 5 News (NBC Seattle), January 19, 2002 Despite the warnings, Springer became an instant celebrity, appearing regularly on the news in the United States and Canada. The beach community of West Seattle took on the look of a marine park. The orca's interactions with humans increased. The situation became untenable. =Identification= Killer whale experts tried to solve the mystery of this solitary, social orca, initially known to locals and ferry workers as \\"Baby Orphan Orca\\" (\\"Boo\\") or \\"Little Orcan Annie.\\" They pored over high-resolution photographs taken of the young orca's markings. They also hoped to find clues in the orca's calls, which are distinctive to her pod. The orcas of Washington state and British Columbia coasts have been extensively studied since the pioneering work of Michael Bigg in the early 1970s. Each of the approximately 500 orcas which frequent these waters is named, and experienced observers recognize individuals by their unique body markings and the shape of each orca's dorsal fin. Birth records of each orca have created detailed family trees. They are considered the best-known marine mammal population in the world. Orcas in the region's inner coastal waters take two forms, \\"resident\\" and \\"transient\\" (also known as Bigg's killer whales), two eco-types that are similar in appearance but have different diets and social structures and do not interbreed. The different orca pods have developed their own unique vocalizations, using distinctive sets of calls, known as \\"dialects.\\" Closely related groups have more similar dialects than more distant relatives. In February 2002, recordings and photographs of Springer in Puget Sound were sent to Dr. Paul Spong and Helena Symonds of OrcaLab and Department of Fisheries and Oceans (DFO) Canada biologist John Ford, who determined that the killer whale belonged to a group of around 215 killer whales known as the Northern Resident Community, ranging some 250 miles north, a group rarely seen in the Puget Sound area. Resident killer whales leave the coast each fall; their migration routes are still relatively unknown. It was known that A45, a female killer whale from this community, and her calf A73 had not returned to Johnstone Strait the previous summer and were both feared to be dead. Through assessment of the orca's dialect, she was confirmed to be A73, offspring of A45, also known as \\"Sutlej.\\" Orca fathers do not play a role in rearing their young, so Springer is considered an orphan. Her closest maternal relatives are other members of the matriline (subpod) known as A24, which is in the pod known as A4. A73 had been given the nickname \\"Springer\\" shortly after her birth. Like many of the region's killer whales, she is named after a geographical feature ‚Äì Springer Point in southern Johnstone Strait. Springer nuzzles up to a floating log in Puget Sound =Health and welfare concerns= Springer had developed a pattern of approaching and rubbing against boats, creating a high risk of being hit by a vessel in the busy area or capsizing a small boat. One Seattle-based group, Project SeaWolf, began regularly observing and tracking the calf on the water, documenting a number of orca- boat interactions, including potentially dangerous interactions with private boats and a Washington State ferry. The group captured surface and underwater video of the orca that they disseminated to the media, urging federal intervention. Springer's attraction to boats and floating logs was attributed to needing social interaction and touch. Dr. John Ford observed later that, \\"She didn't have whales to associate with down there, so boats sort of became a replacement for that for social reasons.\\" Although Springer had been weaned from her mother and was able to forage on her own, she was underweight and in poor health, being malnourished, having ketoacidosis, worms, and an itchy skin condition. Orcas are highly social and form extremely strong family bonds. Resident orcas remain with their mothers and maternal relatives their entire lives. Springer hanging out at the Fauntleroy Ferry, Seattle. Washington State Ferry workers were the first to see and report the young orca to researchers, and kept a watchful eye on her throughout her stay in the big city. =Public debate= The orphaned orca's fate soon became a hotly debated public issue. Some feared Springer might be removed to a captive-display facility, even though a Stipulation of Dismissal in the 1976 lawsuit of Washington v. Don Goldsberry, SeaWorld, et al legally prohibited marine parks from capturing wild orcas in Puget Sound. Some argued that federal authorities should not intervene and rescue the young orca, even if the animal was likely to die as scientists warned alone in one of the most congested, contaminated waterways in North America. \\"It's going to be heart-breaking if we see the worst thing happen, which is to see her die,\\" activist Donna Sandstrom of Orca Alliance (now head of the Washington state nonprofit The Whale Trail) explained on KING 5 News (NBC Seattle), \\"but we would rather bear that heartbreak than to know she's enduring it alone in a concrete tank.\\" Sandstrom became an outspoken critic of direct intervention by NMFS in the local media, often pitted against advocates calling for Springer's rescue and return to her family in British Columbia. While advocates, researchers and scientists pushed since mid-January for immediate federal action to save this wayward whale, the beginning of March brought a new discord of opinions on the matter. Activists like Howard Garrett of the Whidbey Island, Washington-based Orca Network also argued against rescuing Springer, and favored the federal government authorizing a \\"Social Approach,\\" the introduction of regular human companionship for the orca, to put divers in the water with her to address the orca's social needs until she left Puget Sound on her own. Garrett's proposal of introducing regular human contact to a solitary, social, displaced orca in a major metropolitan area was considered by many scientists and advocates as potentially disastrous. The Oregon Coast Aquarium (OCA) in Newport, Oregon where the orca Keiko was kept prior to his translocation to Iceland, offered its facilities to rehabilitate Springer for a one-year period, after which a scientific panel would determine whether or not she was fit to return to Johnstone Strait, BC. Media reports soon revealed that OCA was deep in debt and bound by an agreement with the Free Willy-Keiko Foundation (FWKF) that Keiko's former tank, built by FWKF, could never again house a wild orca. Furthermore, growing scientific opinion was that rehabilitating Springer in a concrete tank would further acclimate the orca to humans and likely result in permanent captivity. It was also widely reported that OCA was in financial hardship due to controversial loans taken out for renovations. It soon withdrew its offer. In July, OCA's Executive Director, Phyllis Bell, would \\"resign her post with little explanation.\\"\\"Bell's Departure Clouds Future for Oregon Coast Aquarium,\\" Diane Dietz, Eugene Register-Guard, July 4, 2002 In these first critical weeks of the Springer debate, Seattle-based non-profit Orca Conservancy, which would later emerge as the lead U.S. non-government organization in a similar, highly publicized effort to rescue and repatriate another displaced resident killer whale, L98, or Luna,Francis, Daniel; Gil Hewlett (2007). Operation Orca: Springer, Luna and the Struggle to Save West Coast Killer Whales. Harbour Publishing. . hit the local airwaves, repeatedly calling upon authorities to act immediately to rescue Springer and return her to her family in Johnstone Strait. As reported on KING 5 News (NBC Seattle), the group initially proposed a \\"Namu Shuttle,\\" a scientifically peer-reviewed proposal to lure the orca into a hydrodynamic floating seapen and tow it north ‚Äî a plan employed successfully in 1965 by Ted Griffin to translocate Namu the orca over 400 miles from British Columbia to Seattle. The distance from Seattle to Springer's repatriation site is approximately 250 miles. Another option the group presented to the National Marine Fisheries Service was to transport the orca aboard a high-speed hovercraft the Canadian Consulate believed it could source from its Coast Guard. The overriding component of all these rescue options was to minimize human contact and keep the orca in the water as much as possible, provide medical treatment and draw blood samples in situ (in the water), expedite medical tests and clearances with Department of Fisheries and Oceans Canada, and target a speedy translocation and reintroduction in Johnstone Strait in July, when Springer's pod historically returns to its summer habitat. As the weeks unfolded, NMFS officials chose not to intervene, stating it lacked both the funds and the confidence that a rescue, translocation and reunion was possible. No cetacean had ever been re- integrated into a wild pod after human intervention. Another orca, Keiko, had been released into the wild in 2002 after spending most of his life in captivity, and although the orca who played Free Willy found freedom, he never found his family. Aside from some interactions with other wild whales, Keiko lived alone until his death in Norway in 2003. Scientists considered the possibility that Springer had been rejected by her pod (although resident orcas had never been known to do this). They feared Springer's pod might respond to her reappearance by a physical attack. Also, the increasing habituation with humans and vessels could jeopardize a successful return to the wild and humans could be endangered by Springer's close contacts with small boats. Springer's uncertain health was also a concern. Canadian officials refused to accept an orca with any communicable diseases. Returning Springer to her home waters would require the political, scientific, logistical and financial cooperation of federal agencies and multiple organizations in two countries, as well as the consent of the First Nations. Capturing and moving an orca risked further stress and injury. Local media continued to cover the crisis intensively, with advocates still demanding immediate government action to save the whale, as Springer's health was deteriorating and her dangerous attraction to boats and people (and people to Springer) increasing. The prospect of federally protected young orca washing up dead on one of Seattle's most-visited beaches grew every day. In late February, NMFS convened a panel of experts to discuss what to do. Brian Gorman of NMFS called the decision \\"a thorny one,\\" but added that letting nature take its course \\"realistically is not an option. She's in a very public location. People will want to feed her.\\"\\"Feds Consider Helping Orphan Orca Calf,\\" Associated Press, March 1, 2002 Despite laws prohibiting the removal of any wild whale in Puget Sound to a marine aquarium, some activists like Sandstrom continued to argue in the local media against a rescue, concerned that human intervention would lead to a life in captivity for the orca. Others assured that protections were in place to prevent that from happening. \\"The last scenario that any of us want... is putting this whale in a tank,\\" said Michael Harris of Orca Conservancy. =Monitoring program= As the debate continued, NMFS urged the public to keep away from Springer, and officially authorized a volunteer, on-the-water monitoring project proposed by three Washington-based nonprofit organizations possessing the marine vessel resources to keep track of the calf ‚Äî Orca Conservancy, The Whale Museum in Friday Harbor, Washington, and Project SeaWolf. The highly experienced non-government monitoring team took shifts monitoring Springer and keeping the public away. But the growing number of onlookers were making the effort unsustainable. As time went on and the orca's prognosis worsened, the idea of directly intervening on behalf of Springer and returning her to her family in Canada was soon catching on. Public opinion was now strongly in favor of rescuing the orca, and to do everything possible to keep her out of a concrete tank. On March 13, KOMO-TV (ABC Seattle) reported a \\"ground-breaking coalition,\\" announcing that Orca Conservancy, the Keiko team and Vancouver Aquarium had tentatively agreed to combine their plans‚Äîthe only ones submitted to NMFS that called for rehabilitation in a seapen and an expedited translocation and repatriation to her natal pod. The organizations reportedly had agreed to \\"pool their resources\\" on behalf of Springer, including a pledge the Keiko team secured from a private, anonymous donor to fund the entire project. Upon hearing this rare pledge of cooperation between anti-captivity organizations and a captive- display facility, NMFS announced its decision ‚Äî it would intervene to save Springer, and would go with the combined seapen rehabilitation/translocation/reintroduction plan, with Vancouver Aquarium as the lead non-government organization on the Canadian side. Shortly after the NMFS announcement and without explanation, Vancouver Aquarium backed out of the coalition. But the NMFS-approved plan to rescue and repatriate Springer would still go forward, but because of the Aquarium's change-of-heart, the effort was again without funding. NMFS could not shoulder the costs of the project, and Vancouver Aquarium made it very clear that they had no interest in doing so, either. Unless a new funding source was located immediately, the intervention could not happen. Springer's prognosis in Puget Sound was getting worse every day. =Prescott Grant and Orphaned Orca Fund= Conservationists then presented an idea to NMFS ‚Äî the Springer project could be funded by the newly established John H. Prescott Marine Mammal Rescue Assistance Grant, taking advantage of language inserted by Washington's Congressional delegation that provided \\"priority consideration for gray whale and orca strandings in the Pacific Northwest.\\" Although not a stranded whale, if Springer were deemed by NMFS as a \\"pending stranding,\\" the agency might be able to expedite the Prescott money. NMFS agreed to the plan. Applications were made for two $100,000 USD grants, with a requirement that both be triggered by 1/3 matching contributions, or a total of $66,667 USD. NMFS invited five nonprofit organizations to form the \\"Orphaned Orca Fund\\" (OOF) to raise the matching funds for the Prescott grants ‚Äî Orca Alliance, Project SeaWolf, People for Puget Sound, The Whale Museum and Orca Conservancy. Free Willy-Keiko Foundation/Earth Island Institute and Friends of the San Juans would soon join OOF at the invitation of Orca Conservancy. The new coalition immediately passed a Motion that stated that \\"no funds raised by OOF can be used to remove A73 to a marine facility.\\"\\"Groups Trying to Help Feds Pay for Orca Relocation,\\" KOMO 4 News (ABC Seattle), June 3, 2002\\"Orca Coalition Sees Hope for Ecosystem,\\" KOMO 4 News (ABC Seattle), June 12, 2002 The next day, Project SeaWolf formally resigned from OOF, informing the coalition that it did not agree with the Motion passed against the removal of the orca to an aquarium. But the group continued assisting the Springer project in material ways, particularly when the time came to rescue and repatriate the orca. The public response to helping Springer was overwhelming. In a matter of weeks, OOF successfully raised the matching funds to trigger the Prescott grants. There was now approximately $266,666 USD in cash and in-kind services and equipment available to the project, by most accounts more than enough to get Springer home. Under contract from the Orphaned Orca Fund and a special out-of-season permit from DFO Canada, Namgis First Nation fishermen load 73 wild-caught Pacific salmon into Springer's seapen in Dong Chong Bay, Hanson Island, BC. =Namgis First Nation enlisted to catch wild salmon for Springer= During one OOF meeting in June, a Motion was made by Orca Conservancy's Michael Harris on behalf of Dr. Spong and OrcaLab to use OOF funds to contract commercial fishermen from the Namgis First Nation of Johnstone Strait to catch and provide wild salmon for Springer while she was in her seapen in Dongchong Bay, Hanson Island, the repatriation site and territory of the Namgis. If the money were approved, Dr. Spong would help arrange an out-of-season fishing permit from DFO, and Namgis Chief Bill Cranmer would put together a boat and crew. Donna Sandstrom of Orca Alliance, together with Lynne Barre from NMFS, urged instead the use of farmed Atlantic salmon provided by a local aquaculture company, even though the First Nations and a vast majority of orca advocates in the region, including renowned local scientist Alexandra Morton, were adamantly opposed to fish farms in their waters. It was argued that the logistics of feeding Springer wild fish was too much to take on for the team, particularly so close to the capture date. There was also a question of whether OOF had the authority to directly contract vendors with its donations, although it was agreed that the coalition's by-laws did not specifically preclude it from doing so. After much discussion, Barre agreed that NMFS would not oppose the Namgis contract, on the condition that OOF provide a metal detector at the seapen site to screen the wild salmon for fish hooks which could pose a danger to Springer. When that was argued to be impractical, NMFS finally assented on a personal assurance from OOF members that they would be at the site when the salmon came in, physically inspecting the mouth of each fish for hooks prior to their placement into the seapen. The Motion passed and the Namgis were contracted. The First Nations were now appropriately participating in the return of a wayward kukawin, or orca, to their ancestral waters. And a potential conflict unfolding before the eyes of the world media was averted. No farmed Atlantic salmon would be brought into Namgis territory. Capture and rehabilitation Springer is lowered into her seapen at Manchester, WA. The team to capture Springer was led by Jeff Foster, who had helped prepare Keiko for release. On June 13, with news helicopters circling overhead sending live video to millions of viewers, Foster's team lured the orca close to the capture boat, and then Foster got in the water, carefully placed a soft rope around her tail, gently moved her into a sling and hoisted her into the boat. By all accounts, the operation went smoothly and the Springer rescue was underway. \\"There were so many things that could've gone wrong, and nothing went wrong,\\" said Michael Harris, one of a multitude of orca advocates and scientists holding their breath that day. The first critical step in the operation was a success. Springer was then moved to a seapen at a government research station in Manchester. For four weeks, she was given live salmon and tested for medical conditions. To avoid creating a dependency on humans, staff kept their contact with her to a minimum and released food into her pen at random times of day. Her food, sometimes laced with medication, was delivered via a chute that was arranged so that Springer could not see the person putting the food into the chute. Her health improved and she began to eat more, approaching the 60‚Äì80 pounds of fish per day needed to increase her weight. After medical tests revealed no genetic disorders or communicable diseases, Springer was cleared for a return to Canada. Another hurdle was to secure a means of transport for the whale's 250-mile journey. A truck ride would have been long and bumpy, and an airplane prohibitively expensive. Project SeaWolf persuaded a boat building company from Whidbey Island, Nichols Brothers Boat Builders, to donate use of the Catalina Jet, a 144-foot-long catamaran capable of traveling more than 40 mph. It was a timely and critical contribution to the Springer project. Springer's move to her home waters needed to be well-timed to maximize her chances of re-integrating into a wild pod. To minimize her habituation to humans, she needed to be moved as soon as possible and had to be released during the time her pod was usually present in Johnstone Strait between May 6 and July 25, usually in mid-July. On July 9, OrcaLab detected orca calls closely related to Springer's, moving towards Johnstone Strait. On July 10, the A-11 matriline, her extended family, appeared in Johnstone Strait. Michael Harris, working with OrcaLab researchers at the repatriation site, described the arrival to KOMO 4 News (ABC Seattle) as \\"karmic... kinda magical for a lot of us,\\" going on to say that \\"after forming all these groups to help fund this, working with NMFS and DFO, which has not always been easy, people on both sides of the border, it's like delivering a baby. And we're ready to pass out cigars.\\"\\"Waiting on Springer,\\" KOMO 4 News (ABC Seattle), July 12, 2002 =Return to Johnstone Strait= Springer prepared for 13-hour journey On July 12, 2002, under the watch of news helicopters, Springer was lifted by crane from the holding pen and placed in a specially constructed shallow pool aboard the catamaran. The team was in place. The boat departed Manchester to cheers from the dock. The world was watching. Then, the boat broke down. Plastic debris was sucked into one of the catamaran's intakes shortly after it began its journey north, hamstringing the high-speed vessel. The team decided to head back to the dock, put Springer back in the seapen, and wait for the next day.\\"Springer's Ride Develops a Problem, Delays Departure,\\" Christopher Dunagan, Kitsap Sun, July 13, 2002 The operation got underway the next day without incident. Springer was brought north through Puget Sound and Haro Strait, across the border and then to Campbell River, BC, where locals donated hundreds of bags of ice to help keep the orca cool. To keep her skin from drying out or becoming sunburned during the 13-hour journey, Springer was draped with wet cloths and treated with ointment. The catamaran traveled through the Inside Passage to Johnstone Strait, then to Dongchong Bay, and Hanson Island, not far from OrcaLab. The previous day, high-tech hydrophones were installed in Dongchong Bay by David Howitt and Michael Harris, to monitor acoustic interactions between Springer and wild whales. A net pen was in place, filled with wild Pacific salmon caught by local First Nations fishermen under a specially granted fishing permit. As promised, all 73 of the wild salmon caught by the Namgis were physically inspected for metal hooks. When released into the net pen, Springer immediately began feeding on the salmon, spyhopping (raising her head out of the water), breaching, pushing at the net, and calling out loudly to her relative orcas swimming nearby. \\"She was vigorous and vocalizing and obviously interacting with the other whales. We were listening practically with our mouths hanging open (Saturday) night,\\" said Dr. Spong. Dr. Lance Barrett- Lennard, Senior Marine Mammal Scientist with the Vancouver Aquarium, said that it was clear Springer knew she was home, and that \\"her calls were so loud they practically blew our earphones off.\\" Life in community Namgis First Nations canoes welcome Springer home. At 3:30 p.m. on July 14, Springer's keepers opened the gate on her net pen as other orcas went by, and Springer went \\"charging off.\\" She swam straight towards the other orcas. First observations appeared to indicate that the operation was exceeding all expectations, that the experiment was a success.\\"Waters of Home Welcome Springer,\\" Christopher Dunagan, Kitsap Sun, July 14, 2002 However, the reaction of the wild whales to Springer's sudden appearance was initially to bunch together silently, seemingly in confusion. After a few minutes, they swam off, perhaps expecting Springer to follow. She appeared not to be able to keep up. Temporary transmitter devices had been attached to Springer's back with suction cups, designed to fall off after a few days. Scientists and volunteers observed Springer visually. In the first days, she trailed the pod, keeping a distance of about half to three quarters of a mile. Springer's tendency to interact with boats remained a problem. On July 16 she positioned herself near a small boat leaving it unable to move without hitting her. Springer though would soon connect with wild whales. She began traveling consistently with the A4 Pod (her mother's closest relatives), and distant cousins in the A5 pod. It was hoped that she would form a bond with a mature female who would act as a surrogate mother. The orca known as A51 or \\"Nodales,\\" a 16-year-old female from the A5 Pod who had no calf of her own, appeared to take that role. In August, A51 was observed following Springer and guiding her away from boats, which Dr. Barrett-Lennard described as a sign of \\"reciprocalness in the relationship. It convinced me this is not just a case of A73 finding a placid female she's following around.\\" The bond between Springer and Nodales turned out to not be as strong as a normal mother- offspring bond in killer whales, however. Springer has since often been seen with Nawitti, a 12-year-old female from the A4 pod, and with Springer's great- aunt Yakat.Francis, Daniel; Gil Hewlett (2007). Operation Orca: Springer, Luna and the Struggle to Save West Coast Killer Whales. Harbour Publishing. . On July 15, she was reportedly visiting Robson Bight, a favorite \\"rubbing beach\\" for local orcas. OrcaLab reported that she used the opportunity to rub off temporary suction cups researchers attached to her before her release. Monitors were pleased with the developments. \\"It's a good start,\\" said Dr. Barrett-Lennard.\\"Young Orca Spends Hours With Her Family,\\" The Associated Press, July 16, 2002 Dr. John Nightingale, Director of the Vancouver Aquarium, stated on ABC World News Tonight With Peter Jennings, \\"I've been a fascinated spectator, watching these whales get used to each other and her integration into her larger family group.\\" Springer has been sighted each year with her pod. \\"Springer is in excellent condition,\\" reported Dr. Spong in an OrcaLab press release. \\"There can now be no question about the success of the return project as it is clear that Springer has resumed living a normal social life among her kin and community.\\" \\"This is a great experiment that is a success. We are very happy,\\" said Orca Conservancy's Michael Harris on KOMO 4 News (ABC Seattle). \\"What a test for a small orca like that who's spent so much time in a ferry lane in urban Puget Sound, swimming about a mile a day, to keep up with her family traveling 75 miles a day in the big ocean. She's with her family now. She's fat, she's happy. We've been holding our breath for a long, long time and this is great news.\\" KING 5 News (NBC Seattle) reported, \\"It was a daring, dangerous and highly publicized effort, and now it appears it worked.\\" =Motherhood= On July 4, 2013 Springer was seen with her first calf. In July 2013, Springer was sighted with a calf, named A104, measuring about 2.5 metres long. \\"That leaves no doubt the young whale was accepted by and is thriving with her pod,\\" said environmental reporter Gary Chittim of KING 5 News (NBC Seattle). The history of Springer's story, and her successful reintroduction into a wild pod, has set the precedent for the rescue and repatriation of other possible captive orca worldwide. This calf was later nicknamed Spirit. Springer was first seen with her second calf on June 6, 2017. It was estimated to have been born about six months earlier. Said Dr. Lance Barrett-Lennard: \\"Her rescue, relocation, reunification with relatives and transition to motherhood is an incredible story. I see it as testimony to both the resiliency of killer whales as a species and to the wonderful things we humans can do when we work together on behalf of ‚Äî rather than against ‚Äî nature.\\" See also *Keiko (Orca) *Luna (Orca) *Namu (Orca) References Further reading * http://castlegarsource.com/news/ten-years-later- vancouver-aquarium-celebrates-release-springer-orphaned-killer-whale-19484 External links *Video of Springer's return to Johnstone Strait in 2002 *\\"Saving Springer: Orphan Orca\\", documentary from the NOAA *Photograph of Springer and A71 in 2006 *Closeup of Springer's dorsal fin and saddle patch in 2006 * Category:Individual killer whales Category:Wayward cetaceans Category:Wildlife rehabilitation ","title":"Springer (killer whale)"},{"id":"14085366","text":"A Place to Call Home or Yu nu qin qing is a 1970 Hong Kong Shaw Brothers drama film directed by Wu Jiaxiang.

Employed by the papacy, he oversaw the re-erecting of three of Rome's obelisks - the Quirinale (between the Horse Tamers), the Sallustian (outside Trinit√† dei Monti) and the Montecitorio.  Life  He studied mathematics in his birth town, Camerino, under his father Girolamo, a well-known and expert surveyor. He left Camerino for Rome to continue his mathematical studies (and started his architectural studies) at the \\"Sapienza\\" and at the Accademia di San Luca, participating in the 1754 Concorso Clementino in \\"classe II di Architettura\\". He was instructed in architecture by Marquis Gerolamo Theodoli, designer of the teatro Argentina. In 1755 Antinori went to Lisbon where he worked as architect in the Casa dos Bicos attending the reconstruction works after the earthquake of 1755, He also worked to the plans of a new palazzo reale of Campolide for Joseph I, but a short time later was imprisoned either due to envious accusations by his rivals or due to a conspiracy in which he had got involved. With the help of the Portuguese woman Josefa Luisa Lopez de Cunha, he escaped and fled to Italy, where he married her. Giovanni Antinori Returning to Rome and from there to Camerino, he built the splendid arcade and Hall of Mirrors in the castle-villa of Marquis Alessandro Bandini (Lanciano di Castelraimondo). From 1772 to 1778 he reconstructed and enlarged the interior of the church of the Monte Oliveto Maggiore abbey not far from Siena, creating grandiose Baroque shapes which anticipated the neoclassical forms to come. He worked for the Doria-Pamphilj family in Rome, collaborating with Francesco Nicoletti, their court architect, and replacing him from 1776 onwards. He built them the structures sustaining temporary wooden hall in the courtyard of their palazzo in Via del Corso in 1769 in occasion of the visit of emperor Joseph II of Austria. He also worked on designing the new waterfalls in the gardens of the Villa Doria Pamphili which were subsequently amended by architect Francesco Bettini, and worked at their other properties on the outskirts of Rome, designing alongside his brothers Luigi, Tommaso and Vincenzo and nephew Girolamo. From 1778-83 he constructed a casale within their castello at Piombinara, not far from Colleferro. On the accession of Pope Pius VI, Antinori was put in charge of an important excavation in the church of San Rocco, near the Mausoleum of Augustus, which revealed a large red obelisk of granite. He also worked on the Piazza del Quirinale, rotating the Horse Tamers statues (originally parallel to each other) and placing the obelisk from S. Rocco between them using powerful winches and clever mechanisms. In 1787‚Äì89 he raised the Sallustian and in 1790‚Äì1792 that at the Piazza Montecitorio (which is still, in his honour, inscribed 'IOAN. ANTINORIO CAMERTE ARCHIT.‚Äô. ANTINORIO CAMERTE ARCHIT). In 1790‚Äì91 Antinori drew a proposal for the Palazzo Braschi for Luigi Braschi Onesti, nephew of Pius VI - other projects was presented by Giuseppe Barberi, Melchiorre Passalacqua, Giuseppe Valadier and Cosimo Morelli, who obtained the commission. Giovanni Antinori died in Rome, whilst still directing the works at Piazza Montecitorio, which were completed by his assistant Pasquale Belli (1752‚Äì1833). He was buried in the Church of S. Venanzio dei Camerti. In 1929 that church was demolished to make way for gardens and public spaces around the Vittorio Emmanuele Monument and, despite requests from the local government of Camerino, it proved impossible to find and save Antinori's mortal remains before demolition. His wife was buried in the church of S. Antonio dei Portoghesi, always in Rome.  Sources  *A. Ricci, Memorie storiche delle Arti e degli Artisti della Marca di Ancona, II, Macerata 1834. *L.

The retired nurse was the founder of the non- profit charities‚ÄîHeart to Heart Service and the Home for the Aged Sick, one of the first homes for the aged sick in Singapore. She had been a social worker in China and Paraguay and a nurse in England, before coming to Singapore to start similar non-profit charities since 1961. Despite being a supercentenarian, Hsu was still involved in charity work and was one of very few supercentenarians who were recognised for reasons other than their longevity. She had spent almost all her savings on feeding and housing the poor and the elderly, all of whom are younger than she was, but she herself led a simple and humble lifestyle. In 2005, she received the Special Recognition Award from the Singapore government in recognition of her contribution to the country. Early years Hsu was reportedly born on 7 July 1898, in Shantou prefecture of China, during the reign of the Manchu Qing dynasty, although this has never been independently verified. When Hsu was young, her father walked out on the family for another woman. Her mother, who was illiterate, had to fend for the three girls and one brother singlehandedly. At 16, her family moved to Penang in Malaya, where they worked as cleaners in a convent. As she did not want to be a cleaner all her life, Hsu asked the nuns there to allow her to study with the children, and they agreed. Combining study with work, she passed her Senior Cambridge examinations four years later. Equipped with a basic education, she ventured to Hong Kong to work and, later, to Chongqing, China, where she became a secretary and bookkeeper at a German news agency in the 1930s. She quit her job to become a volunteer, helping the injured during the Sino-Japanese War. Recalling her inability to help the wounded people whom she saw during the Second World War, Hsu decided to become a nurse. As she was overaged at 47, she wrote a request to the chief matron of the Nursing Council in London. Touched by Hsu's sincerity and dedication, her application was accepted. She spent eight years in England doing nursing and another eight in Paraguay as a member of the German charity group Bruderhof, to start hospitals and homes for the aged there. In her mid-50s, she decided to return home to Penang to be with her mother. In Malaysia, she assisted her brother in starting the Assunta Foundation for the Poor in Ipoh. She also played a key role in the startup of three homes for the elderly and two homes for young girls and neglected children in Ipoh. Home for the Aged Sick The Society for the Aged Sick at Hougang Avenue 1, Singapore In 1961, she came to Singapore to live with her older sister, Ursula, late principal of the Convent of the Holy Infant Jesus in Bukit Timah. On seeing her dedication and commitment in helping the poor and sick, Ursula bought her a 0.6-hectare piece of land at Jalan Payoh Lai in 1965, so that Hsu could open the first home for the aged sick in Singapore. The two sisters ran the Home for the Aged Sick for five years. Ursula financed its operations with her pay, while Hsu managed it and made some extra cash by selling the harvest of 10 coconut trees and a dozen banana trees in the backyard. The sisters converted a servants' quarters and a bungalow into wards for their patients, but it became increasingly difficult to cope with the numbers. In 1970, with about 100 patients, they approached the Rotary Club for funds. The Rotary Club agreed to finance the home on condition that the club take over the running of it. The sisters handed the deeds over to the Society for the Aged Sick, an association formed by the Rotary Club members. The society built three blocks to house the increasing number of residents and Hsu remained the home's matron until 1980, when she was asked to retire at 83. Hsu moved into a three-room apartment on the rooftop of the Home, built by the society. After her sister died, she left Hsu a sum of money which she was able to buy flats with‚Äîfive in Singapore and two in Malaysia for those people who had no money and who were asked to move. When asked where all her compassion and deep caring came from, she replied: Heart to Heart The Heart to Heart Service Centre is located at the premises of the Society for the Aged Sick in Hougang, Singapore Shortly after she retired, Hsu set up the Heart to Heart Service with Sharana Yao, her co-social worker, a non-profit, non-government aided welfare service which provides food, clothes and monthly cash contributions to those in need. With the help of volunteers who drive her around, she brought necessities to the homes of elderly women and destitutes in their 80s and 90s on public assistance, such as rice, sugar, biscuits, beverages and monthly cash allowances of between S$20 and S$180. She got her rations and funds from various sources‚Äîmerchants, people in the neighbourhood, church friends, and their friends. The needy get on Heart-to-Heart's list based on good faith by word of mouth. In 2000, a Straits Times reader wrote to comment on her selfless contributions to the society and urged the young to follow her example: Lifestyle Hsu was still actively involved in charity work after turning 110. An advocate of healthy living, Hsu often gave public talks at schools, welfare homes, and hospitals in Singapore and overseas about health and service to the needy. When asked about the secret of her good health and longevity, Hsu attributed her good health to a spartan lifestyle, vegetarian diet, and to her positive attitude towards life. She would start her day at 4 am with calisthenics, meditation and an hour of yoga exercises. At night, she would do yoga again, then read until midnight. She picked up yoga at age 69, when she bought a book titled Forever Young, Forever Healthy. She also taught yoga to the young and old at temples, associations, hospitals and schools. She ate sparely; her breakfast was a glass of water or milk. Lunch was often milk and salad, unless \\"people bring me food\\", and it was milk or yogurt for dinner. At home, she had a 2,000-volume private library she called Prema, which in Sanskrit means \\"divine love\\". Her final days were kept busy with trips to help needy senior citizens, reading and yoga practice at her sparsely-furnished single-storey house attached to the Society for the Aged Sick. Death Hsu died on 7 December 2011, peacefully at home and was cremated on the same day without any rites, as per her instructions. She was the verified oldest living person in Singapore at the time of her death; later that year Fadilah Noor Abbe was reported to have been born in 1897.

But nowadays this concept goes even far away and a new and improved way of interaction with the user has been developed. The early private broadcasters, as Canal+, were the pioneers in adopting this new form and today are preceded by their digital formats. As a consequence of the Analogue Switchoff the Project known as Digital Terrestrial Television (DTT) was developed creating a public digital format television with more features, in competition with private broadcasters. Among this features one can found interactive menus that, as in the case of the private broadcasting, give information to the user and let them adapt the product to their own needs. This user-television interaction is today known as interactive television. All of these can happen thanks to the Set-top-Boxes (or STBs for short), the television decoders that households usually have at home, that see to receive and decode the digital signal to show it by the analogue television set. This device lets the users accede to the contents the digital television net offers. One of their many functions is running the interactive applications, being this the object of this article. For interactivity, it is required that the STBs could be dynamically programmed and updated. For that, there are some different solutions in the market, among them, the definition of an intermediary software layer on which the applications, broadcast together with the audiovisual signals, run. This intermediary software layer is called Middleware. Private standards or private property =Media highway= It was defined by Canal Plus Technologies, which represents the widest range of solutions in the market so that the software in the STBs interprets and executes interactive applications, broadcast software from the server for the broadcasting of applications and data via satellite, cable and terrestrial nets, moreover runs interactive applications and their execution environment. Also, includes different profiles to better respond to the broadcasters needs. These standard runs applications written in different programming languages as Java, MHEG-5 or HTML and supports the specifications DVB-MHP, OCAP, DAVIC or ATSC adding, at the same time, other own and new specifications. =Open TV core= The most important product from Open TV, a middleware for digital television (DTV) widely extended. The Open TV Core software technology contains a hardware abstraction layer (to let the hardware be independent), TV libraries, a selection of execution environments for the applications, and support for Personal Video Recorders (PVRs), to create a DTT environment for the decoders (STBs). The TV libraries include support for rich graphics (RG) and High Definition (HD), net communication from phone line up to broad band IP (via DSL, ethernet or fibre), management of the digital audio and video signals (DVB, as well as another standards and proprietary formats), and support to authentication and encryption by using CA/DRM systems. Open TV Core supports a number of Applications environments execution(AEE) including the 'C' Virtual Machine, a HTML browser, an Adobe Flash presentation environment and a Java Virtual Machine in compliance with the MHP standard. The 'C' Virtual Machine is an execution environment that allows the APIs of the Open TV software Developers Kit, that lets the content providers create, in O code, applications centred on TV by using the development tools from Open TV or another sellers. Open or public standards =MHEG= As early as 1995 the ISO (International Organisation for Standardisation), together with the Multimedia and Hypermedia Experts Group, published the MHEG standard. This gave a statement approach to the creation of multimedia applications that could work in every operative system in compliance with this standard. Conceptually, MHEG intended to do for multimedia applications the same as HTML did for documents at the proper time that is, to give a common exchange format that should be executed in every receiver. MHEG-1: this version included support for objects containing procedure codes, that could widens the basic model of MHEG-1 adding decision making functions, as it was not possible in other way. MHEG-3: this version defined a standard virtual machine and a byte representation code that allows its portability through hardware platforms. These versions were unsuccessful, since they were based on concepts very complicated and the industry was not ready for the characteristics they offer. MHEG-5, the simpler version of MHEG-1, was created in April 1997. Many of the functions that were shaping it were equal but simultaneously there were many differences between the two versions. MHEG-3 was overcome by the success of Java and in 1998 they decided to create the sixth version, MHEG-6, which was based on the fifth version adding a support for the use of Java to develop objects script, mixing the declarative force of MHEG with the procedure elements of Java. For doing this, they defined a Java application programming interface (API) for MHEG so that the code Java could manipulate MHEG objects in its mother application. Though the MHEG-6 was not extended, it was the base of the DAVIC's (Digital Audio Video Council) standard. =DAVIC= This standard was created little later than the MHEG-6 in 1998. It was created adding a new series of APIs Java to MHEG's sixth version. The APIs of the above-mentioned standard were allowing the objects Java the access to some services of information, control of services of audio content and video and the managing of the management of the resources in the receiver. Though the creation of an application was not possible pure Java for the receiver DAVIC, the APIs Java already was capable of controlling more elements of the receiver of what was possible with other standards. =DVB-MHP(The Multimedia Home Platform)= This is defined by the Digital Video Broadcasting (DVB) to offer interactive services in the DTV. It is a limited version of the virtual machine of Java, where a set of extra functionalities are added for the adjustment to the environment of the DTV. With the purpose of arranging the specification of this standard there are defined three profiles related to the capacities of the STBs: :1. Enhanced Broadcast Profile: interactive applications are downloaded via broadcasting. It does not incorporate backward channel in the STB. :2. Interactive Broadcast: incorporates bidirectional communications via backward IP channel towards the server, allowing the download of applications. :3. Internet Access: STB processes extreme internet contents. There exist two versions that cover the mentioned profiles: *MHP 1.0 that covers the first two profiles. This version is the one that the current receivers use and the majority implement the second profile. Many countries have adopted it to offer their DTV's interactive services, like Spain, Italy or Finland. *MHP 1.1 that covers the three profiles. Nowadays it could not be found in any commercial receivers compatible with that version though there are a few compatible protocols. =OCAP= The American company CableLabs collaborated with DVB for the creation of a new opened standard, which it led to the acceptance of the specification of the standard MHP as base for this standard, the OCAP (OpenCable Application Platform), in January, 2002. With MHP in its center OCAP provides a common especificai√≥n for the middleware layer for the systems of cable in the United States. Since in the United States DVB standards are not used, OCAP is based on those parts that are not DVB specific, replacing the rest of DVB specific ones such as DVB IF API. Originally, OCAP was based on the 1.0.0 version of the specification MHP. Later, DVB presented the specification Globally Executable MHP (GEM) to facilitate the use of MHP's elements in other specifications. OCAP's recent versions use GEM instead of MHP as base, but they refer to some MHP's elements that are not included in the especificai√≥n GEM. =ACAP (Advanced Common Application Platform)= This platform was created by the Advanced Television Systems Committee (ATSC), as common base for all the systems of interactive TV in USA, for cable, terrestrial or satellite. It is also based on GEM and adds some OCAP's elements that are adapted for the USA market.

The port is the sixth-largest in Australia by tonnage. Major commodities handled by the port include crude oil and petroleum products, export grain and woodchips, alumina imports, and fertiliser.The Age: Geelong port contributes $500mn a year to Victoria ‚Äì September 12, 2005 Major port industries include Alcoa's Point Henry smelter, AWB Limited's grain elevator, and the Viva Energy oil refinery at Corio. The Port of Geelong handled $5.6 billion worth of bulk cargo in 2004‚Äì05, made up of 12 million tonnes of cargo from 543 ship visits. History The steamboat Edina leaving Geelong on its final journey on 21 June 1938. Cunningham Pier has been refurbished for tourists. Before the initial settlement of Geelong, a sandbar across the bay from Point Lillias to Point Henry only allowed small ships to enter the inner harbour. Larger ships were required to drop anchor in the bay, and their cargo was brought into Geelong on lighters. At times it was possible to walk across the bay on the sandbar at low tide. The first channel through the sandbar was started in 1853, providing less than 4 metres draught for ships. This channel was straightened out and dredged at a depth of 6 metres in the 1860s. In 1881 dredging of a new channel was started which took 12 years to complete. It was named the Hopetoun Channel after the then Governor of Victoria, Lord Hopetoun, who opened it on 20 December 1893. By the early twentieth century shipping traffic had increased and the existing piers in the city area were proving inadequate. As a result, new port facilities were progressively provided in the North Geelong area. Management Management of the channels and port of Geelong was the responsibility of the Geelong Harbor Trust that was formed in December 1905.Public Record Office Victoria ‚Äì Agency VA 1425 In addition, the Authority was responsible for the associated ports at Queenscliff, Barwon Heads, Lorne and Apollo Bay. In 1981, the trust was reconstituted as the Port of Geelong Authority as an attempt to follow modern practice with the naming of organisations responsible for ports operation throughout the world. The authority was privatised by the State Government, being sold to Ports Pty Limited for $49.6 million on 1 July 1996. Ports Pty Limited was a joint venture between Primera, a wholly owned subsidiary of TNT Limited (30%) and Infrastructure Investment Corporation Ltd (70%). The port was later rebranded as Toll GeelongPort after the acquisition of TNT by Toll Holdings. The port is now branded as GeelongPort, and is a part of Linx Cargo Care Group, following the sale of the Asciano group of companies in August 2016 (Asciano formed from the demerger of Toll Holdings in 2007). In 2008 the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) revoked Asciano's exclusive equipment contract with the Port of Geelong. The ACCC found that the compulsory use of Asciano cranes for dry bulk and fertiliser unloading was anti-competitive, and that the negative effects of the arrangement outweighed any productivity improvements derived from use of a single equipment type. Facilities North Shore Point Henry Major piers in the Port of Geelong include: * Cunningham Pier: opened as the Railway Pier in the mid-1850s, the pier was rebuilt in the late 1920s and renamed Cunningham Pier in 1929. Disused by the 1980s, it was later occupied by a Smorgy's restaurant. Currently used as a restaurant and social venue called 'The Pier'. * Moorabool Street Wharf: located at the end of the street of the same name. Main terminal for bay steamers until the last one ceased running in 1942. Demolished in the 1950s. * Yarra Street Pier. Destroyed by fire in 1988 and mostly removed, but has been the subject of a number of rebuilding proposals since. By the early 1900s, shipping traffic has increased and the existing piers in the city area were inadequate. As a result, new port developments were started in the North Geelong area. * Corio Quay. Construction started in the 1900s, and the wharfs are still in use today for woodchip and bulk cargoes. * Grain Pier. Built to export grain from the adjacent grain elevators in 1937. Replaced by a newer pier to the north in the 1990s. * Lascelles Wharf. Caters for general cargo, as well as minerals and fertiliser for the adjacent phosphate works. * Refinery Pier. Opened by Shell in 1953 to cater for their nearby oil refinery. There are also a number of special purpose piers on Corio Bay: * Point Henry Pier. Established by Alcoa at Point Henry for alumina ore imports for their former Point Henry smelter * Point Wilson Pier.

It correlates with mortality, morbidity and hospitalization time after trauma. It is used to define the term major trauma. A major trauma (or polytrauma) is defined as the Injury Severity Score being greater than 15. The AIS Committee of the Association for the Advancement of Automotive Medicine (AAAM) designed and improves upon the scale. Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) The Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) is an anatomically based consensus-derived global severity scoring system that classifies each injury in every body region according to its relative severity on a six-point ordinal scale: # Minor; # Moderate # Serious # Severe # Critical # Maximal (currently untreatable). There are nine AIS chapters corresponding to nine body regions: #Head #Face #Neck #Thorax #Abdomen #Spine #Upper Extremity #Lower Extremity #External and other. Definition The ISS is based (see below) upon the Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS). To calculate an ISS for an injured person, the body is divided into six ISS body regions. These body regions are: *Head or neck ‚Äì including cervical spine *Face ‚Äì including the facial skeleton, nose, mouth, eyes and ears *Chest ‚Äì thoracic spine and diaphragm *Abdomen or pelvic contents ‚Äì abdominal organs and lumbar spine *Extremities or pelvic girdle ‚Äì pelvic skeleton *External To calculate an ISS, take the highest AIS severity code in each of the three most severely injured ISS body regions, square each AIS code and add the three squared numbers for an ISS ( where A, B, C are the AIS scores of the three most injured ISS body regions). The ISS scores ranges from 3 to 75 (i.e. AIS scores of 5 for each category). If any of the three scores is a 6, the score is automatically set at 75. Since a score of 6 (\\"unsurvivable\\") indicates the futility of further medical care in preserving life, this may mean a cessation of further care in triage for a patient with a score of 6 in any category.Trauma.org website. http://www.trauma.org/index.php/main/article/383/ Accessed Nov. 18, 2009 References External links Online Calculator of the Injury Severity Score Category:Emergency medicine Category:Diagnostic intensive care medicine Category:Medical scales ","title":"Injury Severity Score"},{"id":"14085626","text":"Gennady Igorevich Gladkov (; born February 18, 1935, Moscow) is a prominent Soviet and Russian composer, known mainly as a composer for films, TV series and animated films.

An Australian sniper uses a periscope rifle, assisted by a spotter with a periscope Quinn's Post Cemetery is a Commonwealth War Graves Commission cemetery from World War I in the former Anzac sector of the Gallipoli Peninsula, Turkey. The battles at Gallipoli, some of whose participating soldiers are buried at this cemetery, were an eight-month campaign fought by Commonwealth and French forces against Turkish forces in an attempt to force Turkey out of the war, to relieve the deadlock of the Western Front (France/Belgium) and to open a supply route to Russia through the Dardanelles and the Black Sea. Quinn's post was established on the day of the landing, 25 April 1915, as a New Zealand machine gun position and was taken over by Australian troops the following day. It was held by a variety of units until the evacuation of the Anzac sector and was the site of continual attacks and hand-to-hand fighting as Turkish troops defending the peninsula strove to recapture it. Fighting was intense, with heavy casualties on both sides, as it was a key position at the end of the Anzac line. It was overlooked by Turkish positions on three sides, and subjected to incessant sniper activity, and to grenade bombardment from Turkish positions only 15 metres away. The Turkish name for the position was Bomba Sirt (bomb ridge). Periscopes were used to survey the surrounding area, although they were prone to being damaged by rifle fire, and periscope rifles eventually allowed accurate fire to be directed towards the Turkish trenches. Wire nets were erected in front of the trenches to stop grenades. In his official history, the Australian historian, Charles Bean described the holding of the post as amongst the finest achievements of the Australian force. It was named after Major Hugh Quinn, the 27-year-old commander of C Company, 15th Battalion, Australian Imperial Force. His detachment of 226 men took over the position from troops of the 14th Battalion on 29 April. Quinn was killed there on 29 May whilst reconnoitring for an attack to recapture trenches seized by the Turks earlier in the day and is buried in Shrapnel Valley Cemetery. The cemetery was established after the war by moving 225 isolated graves into it, along with the 73 burials in Pope's Hill Cemetery and another six graves found together nearby. 105 Australian and 10 New Zealand graves belong to identified soldiers, and memorials record the names of 64 other soldiers thought to be buried in the cemetery.

The concert was headlined by former Beatle Sir Paul McCartney, playing in his home city for the first time in five years. Venue Anfield, home to Liverpool Football Club, played host to its first concert since the Hillsborough Justice Concert held 11 years earlier in 1997. Anfield, home to Liverpool Football Club Despite modernisation over the years, the nature of the 124-year-old stadium created a number of problems. The stadium's normal capacity of 45,362 was not realistic for a rock concert. Whilst 15,000 tickets were allocated for pitch-standing, seating in the stands had to be significantly reduced to meet health and safety standards. The stadium, built exclusively for football, was not equipped for such an event despite it dealing with sell-out crowds throughout the football season. This resulted in a total capacity for the event of 36,000. The stage was constructed at the Anfield Road end of the stadium. The size of the entrances to the stadium (designed to accommodate the movement of people rather than stage equipment) meant that the stage had to be lifted in by crane before being constructed. The stage eclipsed the two-tier Anfield Road stand. The name of the city in giant letters, set against outlines of famous local landmarks, adorned the top of the structure. Liverpool City Council gave ¬£1.7 million to MPL Communications to cover costs such as stage and lighting hire, licence fees and insurance. Neither McCartney nor Liverpool F.C. charged a fee - seeing the event as their contribution to the city's European Capital of Culture year. Notable attendees included Yoko Ono and Olivia Harrison - widows of McCartney's former bandmates John Lennon and George Harrison - who were sat together in the audience. McCartney's daughter, fashion designer Stella McCartney, who had hosted a presentation earlier in the day at the Liverpool Institute of Performing Arts, was also seen watching her father in the wings of the stage. Liverpool F.C. manager Rafael Ben√≠tez, normally resident in the ground's technical area was in attendance as was a member of his playing staff, Jamie Carragher. Former Liverpool F.C. player and manager Kenny Dalglish and local born footballer Wayne Rooney of Manchester United F.C. with his fianc√©e Coleen McLoughlin were also in the crowd.

Kay described him as \\"a local lad who's done very well for himself in the music game\\" and has \\"played with some amazing people over the years: Stevie Wonder, Rupert the Bear and The Beatles.\\" He jokingly thanked the crowd for coming out and \\"missing the last episode of Ultimate Force with Ross Kemp\\" and claimed he was dismayed that the previous day's soundcheck had revealed McCartney would neither be breakdancing nor including a Right Said Fred medley in his set. Paul McCartney The Liverpool Sound's headliner, Sir Paul McCartney McCartney's appearance marked the fifth anniversary of his last appearance in his home city and one month after his fourth classical album, Ecce Cor Meum, had been performed at Liverpool Cathedral. He played for approximately two hours, playing songs from his Beatles, Wings and solo career. He opened his set with the Chan Romero song Hippy Hippy Shake - a song covered by The Swinging Blue Jeans in 1963 but played live by numerous Merseybeat acts prior (The Beatles included). A tribute to George Harrison was made in the rendition of Something - performed on a ukulele given to McCartney as a gift by Harrison - midway through his performance. The encore included the first live performance by a Beatle of A Day in the Life which led into a rousing rendition of The Plastic Ono Band's Give Peace a Chance in front of a giant CND symbol. Yoko Ono was seen smiling with approval as the crowd sang her late husband's peace anthem. The morning after the concert, Liverpool newspapers claimed the show to be McCartney's best ever gig.

The field employs methods and theories from a wide range of disciplines, including cognitive psychology, evolutionary psychology, cognitive anthropology, artificial intelligence, developmental psychology, and archaeology. Scholars in this field seek to explain how human minds acquire, generate, and transmit religious thoughts, practices, and schemas by means of ordinary cognitive capacities. History Although religion has been the subject of serious scientific study since at least the late nineteenth century, the study of religion as a cognitive phenomenon is relatively recent. While it often relies upon earlier research within anthropology of religionGeertz C. (1966) \\"Religion as cultural system\\" In: Banton, M. (ed) Anthropological approaches to the study of religion London: Tavistock p 1-46 and sociology of religion, cognitive science of religion considers the results of that work within the context of evolutionary and cognitive theories. As such, cognitive science of religion was only made possible by the cognitive revolution of the 1950s and the development, starting in the 1970s, of sociobiology and other approaches explaining human behaviour in evolutionary terms, especially evolutionary psychology. While Dan Sperber foreshadowed cognitive science of religion in his 1975 book Rethinking Symbolism, the earliest research to fall within the scope of the discipline was published during the 1980s. Among this work, Stewart E. Guthrie's \\"A cognitive theory of religion\\"Current Anthropology 21 (2) 1980, pp. 181-203. was significant for examining the significance of anthropomorphism within religion, work that ultimately led to the development of the concept of the hyperactive agency detection device ‚Äì a key concept within cognitive science of religion. The real beginning of cognitive science of religion can be dated to the 1990s. During that decade a large number of highly influential books and articles were published which helped to lay the foundations of cognitive science of religion. These included Rethinking Religion: Connecting Cognition and Culture and Bringing Ritual to Mind: Psychological Foundations of Cultural Forms by E. Thomas Lawson and Robert McCauley, Naturalness of Religious Ideas by Pascal Boyer, Inside the Cult and Arguments and Icons by Harvey Whitehouse, and Guthrie's book-length development of his earlier theories in Faces in the Clouds. In the 1990s, these and other researchers, who had been working independently in a variety of different disciplines, discovered each other's work and found valuable parallels between their approaches, with the result that something of a self-aware research tradition began to coalesce. By 2000, the field was well-enough defined for Justin L. Barrett to coin the term 'cognitive science of religion' in his article \\"Exploring the natural foundations of religion\\". Since 2000, cognitive science of religion has grown, similarly to other approaches that apply evolutionary thinking to sociological phenomena. Each year more researchers become involved in the field, with theoretical and empirical developments proceeding at a very rapid pace. The field remains somewhat loosely defined, bringing together as it does researchers who come from a variety of different traditions. Much of the cohesion in the field comes not from shared detailed theoretical commitments but from a general willingness to view religion in cognitive and evolutionary terms as well as from the willingness to engage with the work of the others developing this field. A vital role in bringing together researchers is played by the International Association for the Cognitive Science of Religion, formed in 2006. Theoretical basis Despite a lack of agreement concerning the theoretical basis for work in cognitive science of religion, it is possible to outline some tendencies. Most significant of these is reliance upon the theories developed within evolutionary psychology. That particular approach to evolutionary explanations of human behaviour is particularly suitable to the cognitive byproduct explanation of religion that is most popular among cognitive scientists of religion. This is because of the focus on byproduct and ancestral trait explanations within evolutionary psychology. A particularly significant concept associated with this approach is modularity of mind, used as it is to underpin accounts of the mental mechanisms seen to be responsible for religious beliefs. Important examples of work that falls under this rubric are provided by research carried out by Pascal Boyer and Justin L. Barrett. These theoretical commitments are not shared by all cognitive scientists of religion, however. Ongoing debates regarding the comparative advantages of different evolutionary explanations for human behaviourSee Laland K. and Brown D. (2002) Sense and Nonsense: Evolutionary Perspectives on Human Behavior Oxford: Oxford University Press for overview. find a reflection within cognitive science of religion with dual inheritance theory recently gaining adherents among researchers in the field, including Armin Geertz and Ara Norenzayan. The perceived advantage of this theoretical framework is its ability to deal with more complex interactions between cognitive and cultural phenomena, but it comes at the cost of experimental design having to take into consideration a richer range of possibilities. Main concepts =Cognitive byproduct= The view that religious beliefs and practices should be understood as nonfunctional but as produced by human cognitive mechanisms that are functional outside of the context of religion. Examples of this are the hyperactive agent detection device and the minimally counterintuitive concepts or the process of initiationKress, Oliver (1993). \\"A new approach to cognitive development: ontogenesis and the process of initiation\\". Evolution and Cognition 2(4): 319-332. explaining buddhism and taoism. The cognitive byproduct explanation of religion is an application of the concept of spandrel (biology) and of the concept of exaptation explored by Stephen Jay Gould among others. =Minimally counterintuitive concepts= Concepts that mostly fit human preconceptions but break with them in one or two striking ways. These concepts are both easy to remember (thanks to the counterintuitive elements) and easy to use (thanks to largely agreeing with what people expect). Examples include talking trees and noncorporeal agents. Pascal Boyer argues that many religious entities fit into this category.Boyer, Pascal. The Naturalness of Religious Ideas University of California Press, 1994. UpalUpal, M. A. (2010). \\"An Alternative View of the Minimal Counterintuitiveness Effect\\", Journal of Cognitive Systems Research, 11(2), 194-203. labelled the fact that minimally counterintuitive ideas are better remembered than intuitive and maximally counterintuitive ideas as the minimal counterintuitiveness effect or the MCI-effect. =Hyperactive agency detection device= Cognitive scientist Justin L. Barrett postulates that this mental mechanism, whose function is to identify the activity of agents, may contribute to belief in the presence of the supernatural. Given the relative costs of failing to spot an agent, the mechanism is said to be hyperactive, producing a large number of false positive errors. Stewart E. Guthrie and others have claimed these errors can explain the appearance of supernatural concepts. =Pro-social adaptation= According to the prosocial adaptation account of religion, religious beliefs and practices should be understood as having the function of eliciting adaptive prosocial behaviour and avoiding the free rider problem. Within the cognitive science of religion this approach is primarily pursued by Richard Sosis. David Sloan Wilson is another major proponent of this approach and interprets religion as a group-level adaptation, but his work is generally seen as falling outside the cognitive science of religion. =Costly signaling= Practices that, due to their inherent cost, can be relied upon to provide an honest signal regarding the intentions of the agent. Richard Sosis has suggested that religious practices can be explained as costly signals of the willingness to cooperate. A similar line of argument has been pursued by Lyle Steadman and Craig Palmer. Alternatively, D. Jason Slone has argued that religiosity may be a costly signal used as a mating strategy in so far as religiosity serves as a proxy for \\"family values.\\" =Dual inheritance= In the context of cognitive science of religion, dual inheritance theory can be understood as attempting to combine the cognitive byproduct and prosocial adaptation accounts using the theoretical approach developed by Robert Boyd and Peter Richerson, among others. The basic view is that while belief in supernatural entities is a cognitive byproduct, cultural traditions have recruited such beliefs to motivate prosocial behaviour. A sophisticated statement of this approach can be found in Scott Atran and Joseph Henrich (2010).

Life =Origin= Sophia was the daughter of Richeza of Poland, Dowager Queen of Sweden, from her second marriage to a man called \\"Valador\\" King in Poloni Land. The identity of her father is uncertain, it's either Volodar of Minsk or , Prince of Novgorod and son of Vsevolod of Pskov. Both of them are the Rurikids. The latter version means Valdemar was married to his second cousin, as Sophia's possible father Vsevolod was her Ingeborg of Kiev's nephew =Childhood= Sophia spent a part of her childhood in Denmark, where her mother had been married to a Danish prince in her first marriage, and returned with her daughter when her second marriage was terminated. Sophia was the half sister of Canute V of Denmark, the son of her mother by her first marriage: after her half brother became king of Denmark in 1146, her mother returned to Denmark with her daughter Sophia, who thus spent part of her childhood in Denmark at the court of her half brother the king. In circa 1149, her mother married Sverker I of Sweden, in her third marriage. She took her daughter with her to Sweden, where Sophia subsequently spent the rest of her childhood at the Swedish royal court. =Queen= In 1154, at the age of circa fourteen, Sophia was betrothed to Valdemar as a symbol of alliance between Sweden and Denmark: she was at this time described as a pretty girl with promise of becoming a beauty. In the marriage contract, she was secured an eighth of her half brother King Canute V's estates in Denmark. 1157 bracteate commemorating the wedding of Valdemar and Sophia of Minsk Sophia departed Sweden for Denmark after the conclusion of the engagement in 1154, but as she was not yet regarded old enough to marry by Nordic standards, she was sent to reside with a foster mother named Bodil until she was old enough to live with Valdemar. The wedding between Sophia and Valdemar was conducted in Viborg in 1157, three years later. Queen Sophia was described as beautiful, dominant and cruel. According to traditional myth, she murdered Valdemar's mistress Tove and injured his sister Kirsten, but this is not confirmed.Smith-Dampier, Eleanor. Danish Ballads, pp. 15-24 (Cambridge U. Press 1920). She was widowed in 1182. =Later life= As queen dowager, Sophia received a proposal from, and married, Louis III, Landgrave of Thuringia in about 1184, and was escorted to the border by her son and a grand entourage. She was repudiated in 1190, and returned to Denmark. Issue Sophia had the following children with Valdemar I of Denmark: * Sophia (1159‚Äì1208), married Siegfried III, Count of Weimar-Orlam√ºnde * King Canute VI of Denmark (1163‚Äì1202) * Maria (born c. 1165), nun at Roskilde (1188) * Margaret (born c. 1167), nun at Roskilde (1188) * King Valdemar II of Denmark (1170‚Äì1241) * Ingeborg (1175‚Äì1236), married King Philip II of France * Helena (c.1177‚Äì1233), married William of L√ºneburg * Richeza of Denmark (c. 1180‚Äì1220), married King Eric X of Sweden  References  * Dansk biografisk Lexikon / XVI.

Pedroso was involved in what became known as the Casa Pia child sexual abuse scandal, but the charges against him were dropped. Paulo Pedroso requested a compensation of 600,000 euros from the Portuguese Republic on the grounds that his arrest was illegal and destroyed his political career. In September 2008, a Portuguese court ordered the state to pay 100,000 euros ($140,000) to the ex-minister on the grounds that he was wrongly detained on paedophilia charges.

Works usually include oils, watercolours, sculpture ceramics, photographs and jewellery. Artists donate 35% of sales and all proceeds from the raffle, auction, \\"mystery pictures\\" and silent auction are 100% donations to the charity. New artists are chosen by a selection panel which seeks fresh, innovative and affordable work. Art for Youth London enables new and upcoming artists to exhibit at the Royal College of Art alongside more established talent. The Diana Brooks Prize is awarded annually to an artist aged 35 or under. Many former prize winners, some of whom have gone on to very successful artistic careers, offer a piece of their work for sale as a 100% donation to UK Youth.

Life and family  Luigi's mother Giulia Braschi was Pius's sister, and his father was count Girolamo Onesti. His younger brother was Romoaldo Braschi-Onesti, Cardinal and Camerlengo. On Luigi's marriage to the richest lady of the Falconieri family, he was granted permission by Pius to build Palazzo Braschi off Piazza Navona, and from 1787 and 1795 he built another neoclassical Palazzo Braschi at Terracina, as a private residence for his uncle. Construction on his Rome palazzo was suspended from February 1798 ‚Äì 1802 during the Napoleonic occupation of the city, when the French occupied the house and confiscated the recently acquired antiquities Onesti had housed there. Braschi Onesti moved into the palazzo in 1809, when Napoleon declared Rome an imperial city, and was declared mayor of Rome, though the palazzo was still unfinished at his death seven years later.

Biography Sheetrit was born in Tiberias in 1895 during the time of the Ottoman Empire to a Moroccan Jewish family that had immigrated to Ottoman Palestine in the 19th century. He was educated at a heder, Alliance school and a yeshiva. After school he attended the Hebrew University of Jerusalem where he was certified as a lawyer. He became involved in Zionist activities as a youth, and was a founder of the Tehiya Zionist association in his home town. He also joined Hapoel Hatzair after being influenced by kibbutz Degania. During World War I he held the position of Mukhtar of Kinneret and organised local police until the British Army entered the area. Following the war he held several positions in the police, including Commander of the Lower Galilee area (where he helped organised the Jewish Mounted Police) and deputy commander of the police academy in Jerusalem. Sheetrit was the prosecutor in the Haim Arlosoroff assassination case. After being made a District Judge in 1935, he served as head district judge in Lod between 1945 and 1948.

Prior to the 1951 elections, Sheetrit defected to Ben- Gurion's Mapai, and was reappointed to his ministerial post after winning a seat for his new party in the elections. Re-elected in 1955, 1959, 1961 and 1965 (by which time Mapai had merged into the Labour Alignment), Sheetrit retained his cabinet post under new prime ministers Moshe Sharett and Levi Eshkol.

Personal life F√°tima Felgueiras was born in Rio de Janeiro, then capital city of Brazil, from Portuguese parents. When she was 4 years old, the family returned to Portugal and settled in Felgueiras, northern Portugal. She studied in a secondary school of Guimar√£es and earned a degree in Germanic Philology from the University of Coimbra. Involved in local politics, F√°tima Felgueiras took over as mayor of Felgueiras in 1995. F√°tima Felgueiras has a daughter, Sandra Felgueiras, who is a well-known television reporter and journalist of RTP public service television network. Corruption allegations She was placed under investigation after a series of anonymous letters addressed to Cunha Rodrigues at the public prosecutor's office. The police inquiry produced more than 120 volumes. The mayor of Felgueiras, F√°tima Felgueiras, hurried through the streets of the small northwestern Portuguese city in the early afternoon of May 5, 2003. She was late for a funeral. But before she arrived at the cemetery, she took a phone call, returned home‚Äîand disappeared. The then 49-year-old fugitive has been charged with 30 counts of corruption, embezzlement, prevarication and abuse of power and was suspected of managing a US$1 million \\"saco azul\\" (blue bag) to pay for her own electoral propaganda, Socialist Party office rent and phone bills, her new Audi, among others. Felgueiras faced a possible 25-year sentence, according to the Guimar√£es Appeals Court (Tribunal da Rela√ß√£o de Guimar√£es). Seventeen other Town Hall employees and private entrepreneurs were involved in the scandal.

Unlike four-wheel drive drivetrains, the configuration is largely confined to heavy-duty off-road and military vehicles, such as all- terrain vehicles, armored vehicles, and prime movers. Other types of smaller 8x8 vehicles include such things as the Argocat. When such a vehicle only has eight wheels by definition all are driven. When it has twelve ‚Äì with two pairs of ganged \\"dual\\" wheels on each rear axle ‚Äì all are also driven but the 8√ó8 designation remains. Very occasionally, on the Sterling T26 for example, the two front axles can be fitted with ganged \\"dual\\" wheels. For most military applications where traction/mobility are considered more important than payload capability, single wheels on each axle (often referred to as super singles) are the norm. On some vehicles, usually recovery trucks or heavy tractor units, the rear two axles will have wider single tires than the front two axles. Heavy hauler and ballast tractor 8√ó8s have had a long history as prime movers both in the military (as tank transports and artillery tractors), and commercially in logging and heavy equipment hauling both on- and off-road. Most eight-wheel drive trucks have two forward axles and two at the rear, with only the front pair steering. Occasionally a single front axle and three rear (tridem) are seen, an example being the Oshkosh M1070 tank transporter. In such configurations, the front and rear axle usually steer. Other set ups include that of the ZIL-135. Many wheeled armored vehicles have an 8x8 driveline, and on these the axles (which usually have independent suspension) are more evenly spaced. Latest generation 8x8 wheeled armored vehicles have steering on the rearmost (fourth) axle to improve mobility in urban and confined situations. In the case of both truck and armored vehicle applications, drive may be limited to the rear two axles for on-road use, this reducing driveline stress and tire wear, and increasing fuel efficiency.

Description Gully grevillea grows up to 8 metres in height and flowers between October and December (mid spring to early summer) in its native range. These have whitish pink to fawn perianths and pale pink to pale crimson styles. Leaves are between 5 and 27 cm long and 2.5 to 12 cm wide. These may be unlobed or have up to 7 or more lobes. Taxonomy The species was first formally described by botanist Ferdinand von Mueller, his description published in Flora Australiensis in 1870. Mueller had previously published the name in 1861, but without a formal description, in the Annual Report of the Government Botanist and Director of the Botanic and Zoologic Garden for 1860. The specific epithet honours Sir Henry Barkly who was Governor of Victoria between 1856 and 1863. In 1986 the New South Wales populations previously included in this species were placed in a new subspecies G. barklyana subsp. macleayana by botanist Donald McGillivray. This subspecies was raised to species status by Peter Olde and Neil Marriott in 1994 and named Grevillea macleayana. Distribution and habitat Grevillea barklyana occurs in the upper catchments of the Bunyip and Tarago Rivers within the Bunyip State Park and adjoining State Forest. It is found in gullies and on slopes, favouring a southerly aspect and clay-loam soils that are moist but well drained. Associated tree species include Acacia dealbata, Eucalyptus obliqua, E. sieberi and E. regnans. As plants do not store seed in their canopies and are not able to resprout, it is necessary for a soil seed reserve to be established to enable them to regenerate following bushfires. Conservation The Labertouche Wildflower Reserve was created in 1963 to protect a significant population of gully grevillea as well as forest boronia (Boronia muelleri) and grasstree (Xanthorrhoea australis). The reserve was included within the Bunyip State Park which was gazetted in 1992. Approximately half of the known populations of the species occur within the boundaries of the park. The species is currently listed as \\"threatened\\" in Victoria under the Flora and Fauna Guarantee Act 1988 and \\"Vulnerable in Victoria\\" on the Department of Sustainability and Environment's Advisory List of Rare Or Threatened Plants In Victoria. Cultivation Although Grevillea barklyana is regarded as a desirable plant for cultivation, it is not widely available in nurseries. It is grown for its bird-attracting pink flowers, ornamental foliage and contrasting reddish new growth. The species can cope with heavy shade and has some frost tolerance. As it has a weak root system, plants are best situated where they are afforded wind protection by other planting. Propagation is by cuttings or seed.

An experienced staff officer and veteran of several actions of the First World War aboard the battlecruiser , Blagrove had only just received his appointment as commander of the 2nd Battleship Squadron of the Home Fleet when he was killed in the destruction of his flagship by .  Biography  = Early life = Henry Blagrove was born to Colonel Henry John Blagrove, CB of the 13th Hussars and Alice Evelyn Blagrove n√©e Boothby at Harbledown, Kent in April 1887. His family owned the Blagrove Estate in the Browns Town & Orange Valley of St Ann‚Äôs Jamaica. It had formerly been a slave plantation. In 1901 aged 14 he entered naval service and trained at , joining as a midshipman in 1903 aged 17. Three years later Blagrove departed the ship as a sub-lieutenant and over the next three years earned promotion to full lieutenant aboard several ships, including , and , the latter being the first of many appointments aboard capital ships. = First World War = Following promotion to lieutenant in 1909, Blagrove saw brief service aboard , and the battleship , before taking a course ashore at Dartmouth College, where the outbreak of the First World War found him. At the conclusion of his studies in October 1914, Blagrove received appointment aboard , a newly completed ship in the 1st Battlecruiser Squadron under Admiral David Beatty. Tiger was commissioned only days before Blagrove joined her and due to recruitment shortages she had a poor crew made up by deserters from other ships. Three months after joining Tiger Blagrove saw his first action, as Tiger joined her sister ships in the Battle of Dogger Bank. Tiger fired several hundred shells during the action, but her overall performance was poor, scoring few hits and suffering the loss of ten men to German counter fire. Nevertheless, Tiger was involved in the battle's final moments as the stricken German battlecruiser heeled over and sank with nearly 800 lives. In late May 1916, a much improved Tiger became involved in the war's largest naval action, the Battle of Jutland. Tiger was engaged in the action from start to finish and despite the loss of three of her compatriots to German fire, Tiger escaped mortal damage, taking at least 15 hits and losing \\"Q\\" turret but only suffering 24 fatalities. The battle as a whole was a confusing affair without a clear victor but within 24 hours Tiger had recovered sufficiently from her damage to be able to return to active service, something few German ships could boast. In November 1917, Blagrove was transferred to , a fast battleship which had spent much of the war in the Mediterranean. Unlike the battlecruisers in Rosyth, Queen Elizabeth was stationed in Scapa Flow in the Orkney Islands and it was there that Blagrove met his future wife Edith Lowe, who was serving as a Wren. The couple would be married in 1921 and later have two daughters. Aboard Queen Elizabeth, Blagrove served out the war, being present at the surrender of the German High Seas Fleet and their subsequent scuttling in Scapa Flow. During the war he was promoted first to lieutenant-commander and later to full commander in 1919. Blagrove was also awarded the Italian Silver Medal for Valour in 1917. He departed Queen Elizabeth in 1920 and joined during which he saw staff appointments at Cambridge University and in the office of the Second Sea Lord. = Inter-war service = In 1922, Blagrove joined for a training course and then joined for his first posting aboard her, later being removed to as her temporary captain for a month and then returned to Cardiff as her executive officer until January 1925. Further staff and training appointments followed, Blagrove being stationed at , HMS President and HMS Pembroke before being given command of in 1927 and promoted to captain. In 1932, after several staff appointments, Blagrove was briefly placed in command of and was then returned to shore duties at the Admiralty in 1934. In 1937, Blagrove spent a year commanding and in 1938 was given the promotion to rear-admiral and placed on the staff of the Admiral Superintendent at Chatham Dockyard after a period as Naval Aide-de-Camp to King George VI. In January 1939 with war impending, Blagrove was given command of the 2nd Battle Squadron, consisting of the battleships and stationed at Scapa Flow. Training and preparing his force in the run up to and opening weeks of the Second World War, Blagrove proved himself a capable and efficient officer, despite some doubts regarding his quiet personality and consequent suitability for service in a seagoing command. = Death aboard Royal Oak = HMS Royal Oak was sunk late on the night of 13 October 1939 after the entered Scapa Flow by bypassing its blockship defences. Initially Kapit√§nleutnant G√ºnther Prien, the commander of U-47, had been disappointed to find that the Royal Naval anchorage was largely empty; this was the result of a recent order from Admiral Charles Forbes to clear Scapa Flow in case of air attack. However Royal Oak was retained because she carried a large battery of anti-aircraft guns. On sighting the battleship, Prien began his first attack run at 00:58hrs by firing three torpedoes. Only one caused a glancing blow on the bow of Royal Oak. An alarm was raised aboard ship, however, it was mistakenly given for \\"danger of a potential internal explosion\\" not for a submarine attack. When no explosion seemed likely, most crew members returned to their bunks. At 01:13hrs Prien began his second run. This time all three torpedoes struck Royal Oak amidships causing a huge explosion followed by a severe list to starboard. Prien used the ensuing confusion to escape from Scapa Flow. As the crew scrambled to leave the stricken battleship, rescue boats set out from the shore as nearby ships responded. However the darkness, oil slick and low water temperature meant that many of those who did escape the ship drowned before they could be rescued. Royal Oak rolled over and sank 15 minutes after being hit. A total of 835 crew were killed in the disaster, a further 386 were rescued. Rear-Admiral Blagrove was not among the survivors. His body was not recovered and the manner of his death is unknown. Blagrove's family became aware of the sinking from newspaper billboards in Edinburgh the following day but were not overly concerned for his safety. They were notified of his death 24 hours later.  Legacy  Blagrove's name is included on the Portsmouth Naval Memorial as his remains were never recovered.Rear-Admiral Henry Evelyn Charles Blagrove, Commonwealth War Graves Commission, Retrieved 11 November 2007 His actual gravesite, the wreck of Royal Oak, is a protected war grave and a memorial to all the men who died aboard her stands in St. Magnus Cathedral on the Orkney Islands. The islanders themselves also maintain the memory of those lost on the battleship and an annual ceremony remembers them at the site of the wreck.

The Company‚Äôs focus is on the six major markets (China, India, Japan, USA, UK and Germany) which account for a large percentage of the luxury travel market. Location Headquartered in Hong Kong with production operations in Hanover, Shanghai, Mumbai, Taipei and New York, Voyages is currently available to over 40 million cable and satellite television homes on a 24-hour-a-day basis, as well as via the Internet. The Company plans to launch a Video On Demand product in 2007 and broadband television product (IPTV) in early 2008.  History  Television Voyages Ltd. was established in late 2001 by a group of Hong Kong- based investors. The initial production operations were centered in Taipei, in line with the Company‚Äôs strategy of targeting the Chinese speaking markets of Hong Kong, China and Taiwan. The original service was launched in TaiChung on the 4th of April 2002 to 520,000 cable television homes. Voyages' point of difference is that each of its programs contains a holiday offer that can be booked by the viewer on Voyages web site or via a call center. Thus, the business earns revenues from the sale of travel holiday packages to its audience, in addition to advertising and sponsorship revenue. In early 2003, based on the success of the initial Channel, Voyages increased distribution in Taiwan to include Taipei city and Taipei county, as well as to expand the Channel to other countries. The Company‚Äôs plans for expansion were interrupted by the outbreak of SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) in Asia in 2003. After the resolution of the SARS epidemic and the travel industry returning to a normal state, Voyages established operations in Hong Kong (2004), India (2005) and Germany (2006). In 2007, the Company plans to launch the Voyages Channel in North America, followed by the United Kingdom in 2008. In line with the development of the Voyages Channel, the Company has launched local language travel web sites, and is preparing for the pending launch of a broadband-based product. Voyages offers a balance of travel and lifestyle programs. Program strategy is to provide viewers with programs that include a travel purchase option and that provide a vehicle for advertising sales.

He was a prominent liberal educationist and was a councillor in Birmingham. Life Kenrick was born in 1850. He was the son of Timothy Kenrick from Edgbaston and the grandson of Archibald Kenrick, founder of the cutlery firm Archibald Kenrick & Sons in West Bromwich. After completing his education in Brighton and at University College, London, he worked for two years as an engineer at Nettlefolds in Smethwick, where his brother was a director. He then joined his father's company, where he was chairman for many years. Kenrick engaged with the local primary and higher education policy and at the age of 30 he became a member of the school board in Birmingham after the resignation of Dr Dale. He promoted physical training in schools and promoted sports setting up a Kenrick Shield in 1883. In 1908, he served for a year as Lord Mayor of Birmingham. His collection of world butterflies and moths is in Birmingham Museum & Art Gallery, except the types which are in the Natural History Museum, London. At the beginning of the 20th century Kenrick began writing about tropical butterflies. He sent the naturalist Antwerp Edgar Pratt and his two sons, Carl Brenders Pratt and Felix Biet Pratt 1902-1903 to the British part of New Guinea(1909) Descriptions of some new species of the genus Delias from North New Guinea, recently collected by Mr. C.

Career  In June 1800, Poursuivante took part in the battle of Dunkirk under commander Oreille. In 1802, she departed Flushing to ferry troops to Saint-Domingue, under capitaine de vaisseau Jean-Baptiste Philibert Willaumez. She arrived as the Haitian Revolution raged. The ships Duguay-Trouin, Annibal and Swiftsure, as well as frigate Pr√©cieuse, Infatigable were also in Haiti.

En route for Saint-Domingue with the 16-gun corvette Mignonne, she encountered a British convoy, was chased by HMS Hercule, and took part in the fights of the Blockade of Saint-Domingue. Largely outgunned, Poursuivante managed to manoeuvre behind Hercule and in the Action of 28 June 1803, managed to rake her, disturbing her operations enough to be able to reach harbour. Mignonne was captured by HMS Goliath. In October, Poursuivante reffited in Baltimore, from where she departed in March 1804. On 14 August 1804, Poursuivante captured in a notable single-ship action off the American coast and later burnt her. During her journey back to France, Poursuivante met and evaded another British ship. Willaumez was promoted to vice-admiral on his return.

With one of the biggest film budgets in the history of Russian cinema (including work done in post production by international studios), the film was a notable success in its homeland. Although the film did not see widespread theatrical release in the English speaking world, international distributors such as Central Partnership and Momentum Pictures have produced English language home video versions which have met with some critical acclaim. Plot The setting of the film is a high fantasy Dark Ages Europe, in which desperate and bloodthirsty warlords fight brutal battles in their eternal quest for overlordship. Yet their swords, shields, lances, spears and arrows are all brittle, prone to wear and tear, and dull, protracting their campaigns against each other without end. Word spreads of a man in one of the Northern tribes: an adept blacksmith capable of crafting far hardier, stronger, sharper, and more durable weapons than any other known to exist, with aid of a mystical element. The warlords search for the enigmatic master of weapons to no avail. A former druid chieftain named Zhadoba, jaded by years of warfare and believing the Radiant Gods have abandoned him, learns of the identity and whereabouts of the blacksmith and his coveted weapons, more valuable than any gold in such a time. With this knowledge, Zhadoba's heart is hardened to mercy and replaced with greed and bloodlust. Bringing even the feared warlord, the Man-Eater, under his spell, Zhadoba massacres an entire people, the Clan of the Grey Hounds, including their blacksmith, and takes his legendary weapons. The only survivor of the tribe, the blacksmith's fair- haired son, witnesses the slaughter and bites at Zhadoba's tattooed hand. Instead of killing the boy, Zhadoba orders the boy to be sent into the savage mines of the Crystal Mountains and to live a life of hard labor there, in conditions which will no doubt kill the boy anyway. Against all odds, the boy cheats death through sheer determination and will, his strength becomes powerful through many years of hard labor, scarred by violence, and his prowess honed by a hunger for revenge. For many years his only companions were disheartened, tortured slaves and a strangely intelligent bat, Ragged Wing, who is destined to become his constant companion. After killing his overseers with weapons created using his father's secret techniques and escaping the mines, he becomes a wanderer known as Wolfhound: a great and fearless warrior, as well as a true master of weapons like his father before him. After making the long journey to the Man-Eater's castle, Wolfhound finally conquers his archenemy. He also frees two prisoners, the sage and healer Tilorn and slave- girl Niilit. Wolfhound accompanies them to their home city of Galirad, which has been thrown into turmoil. The power-crazed forces under Zhadoba are poised to attack the city with their superior weapons at any moment. With enough bloodshed, and the right ritual involving royal blood, Zhadoba believes he can resurrect the ancient Dark Goddess Morana from the Celestial Gates and draw power from her. The King of Galirad, to save the city from destruction, is giving his daughter away in marriage to Vinitar, a young warrior-prince who promises to protect Galirad - and who also happens to be the son of the late warlord, the Man-Eater. Princess Elen must travel to the land of her husband- to-be, and asks Wolfhound to be her guard in this dangerous journey. Wolfhound agrees to serve the princess and is caught up in a whirlwind of mysterious events, as the true purpose of the journey is gradually revealed, a secret which could plunge the world into an eternal living nightmare... Cast * Aleksandr Bukharov as Wolfhound of The Grey Hound Clan / Volkodav * Gennady Makoev as Zhadoba, also known as \\"The Greedy\\", formerly the druidic shaman of Cai'Aron; now High Priest of Morana the Dark One, and Lord of the cursed and haunted Polran Swamps. Zhadoba seeks the mystical sword of the Clan of The Grey Hounds, the Celestial Key, and the blood of Princess Elen, all to unleash his master upon the world. * Oksana Akinshina as Princess Elen of Galirad / Princess Knesinka Yelen, who agrees to be married off to a warlord's son for the protection of her people; she chooses Wolfhound as her protector, eventually falling in love with Wolfhound and asking him to give her a child. Elen's blood is the key to Zhadoba and the Man-Eater's plans in resurrecting Morana the Dark One. * Igor Petrenko as Duke Luchezar of Galirad, Princess Elen's traitorous cousin (Luchezar is Elen's brother in the English version) * Aleksandr Domogarov as Vinitarly, commonly known as The Man-Eater (also The Cannibal and The Ogre) is, like Zhadoba, another former druidic chieftain turned savage warlord. The Man-Eater is Overlord of the land of Velemor, and at different times both ally and nemesis of his counterpart and rival, Zhadoba. * Anatoli Belyj as Prince Vinitar of Velemor, son of The Man-Eater, and Guardian of The Northern Gates * Juozas Budraitis as Doongorm / Dungorm, kinsman to Duke Vinitar and Velemor's ambassador to Galirad * Lilian Navrozashvili as Ertan, Doongorm's shield-maiden who falls in love with Wolfhound * Natalya Varley as Mother Kendarat, a Moon Goddess, patron of the Clan of The Grey Hounds, guardian of Wolfhound and enemy of Morana * Andrey Rudensky as Tilorn / Tillorn, a blind wizard and healer * Evgenia Sviridova as Niilit / Neelith, a slave girl rescued from the Man-Eater's castle by Wolfhound along with Tilorn * Artyom Semakin as Evrikh / Eurikh, a young yet gifted scribe who is resurrected from death by Tilorn so that he can translate the Celestial Key, stolen from Galirad by the Man-Eater * Rezo Esadze as Illad * Nina Usatova as Vozhditsa Kharyukov * Tatyana Lyutaeva as Lekarka * Eugenia Tudorascu as Haigal * Pyotr Zaychenko as Fitela * Iliya Sokolovski as the guardsman Production notes Wolfhound is a film adaptation of the first novel of a four-book series about a mighty warrior by Russian author Maria Semyonova, a bestseller in the author's homeland. Semyonova openly takes inspiration from sources such as Slavic mythology, Celtic mythology, and Norse mythology, and with a few more familiar nods to the likes of Conan the Barbarian and Lord of the Rings; yet the author has woven an intellectual property in its own right. Star Aleksandr Bukharov, a TV heart-throb in his native Russia, was chosen because Semyonava believed Bukharov to \\"embody\\" the character of Wolfhound. Wolfhound was filmed in 2004 at the Mosfilm Studios in Moscow, Russia, and on-location in Slovakia. The film was in pre-production for two and a half years before general release, and included some American and British firms in digital compositing. Special effects by Dr. Picture Studios, post-production by Nordisk Film Post Production (facilities), Reel Sound (sound), Sound recorded in DTS, Dolby Digital. With a final combined estimated budget of $20,000,000, Wolfhound became the second highest movie budget for any post-Soviet Russian film. Release dates and availability Premiering in Moscow, Russia, on 28 December 2006, the film did not see wide theatrical release across Europe until 5 January 2007, and over the next year dozens of versions of the film with dubbed audio tracks were produced for international markets in dozens of languages. Other international distributors included Diema Films (Bulgaria), Atlantic Film (Sweden), Cathay-Keris Films (Singapore). The English language version by Momentum Pictures premiered at the Sci-Fi-London Convention in the United Kingdom on 2 May 2008, although it is still considered a direct-to-DVD film there due to the fact the film did not see widespread theatrical release across the English-speaking world. Wolfhound most recently received a 3D Blu-ray release in Germany. Box office and reception =Domestic= Originally, Wolfhound was both massively popular and a box office success in its native Russia, as well as in Scandinavia and the Baltics. The success was enough to green-light a twelve episode television series named Young Wolfhound based upon the film. =English-speaking world= The film itself when translated into English did not attain a great level of recognition in the English-speaking world, largely due to lack of any sustained advertising campaign in the West, a lack of any wide cinema release nor even widespread home video distribution. Critical reception was nearly nonexistent in the West due to this limited availability, and what there was tended to be mixed, but mostly positive; as demonstrated by the public reviews on Rotten Tomatoes. A typical review comes from The Hollywood Reporter which praises the production effort yet notes the film's clear similarities to Western films such as Conan and LOTR, and calls Wolfhound 'epic' yet 'old-fashioned'. =Awards= Wolfhound did however receive some notable international acclaim. One example of this is the fact the film won 3rd place in the Audience Award for Best Feature Film at the 2007 Toronto After Dark Film Festival. The film won the award for \\"Best Fight in Foreign Film\\" between Aleksandr Bukharov (Wolfhound) and Igor Petrenko (Luchezar) in the 2007 MTV Movie Awards. This award for \\"Best Fight\\" was shared with Gerard Butler (Leonidas) vs. The Uber Immortal (Kurrgan) in 300. Television series The success of the film in Russia led in 2007 to a 12-part television series under the name of Young Wolfhound, also starring Aleksandr Bukharov yet with a notably darker and grittier tone than the film. The television series acted as a prequel to the film, and chronicled the events between the prologue of the film (Wolfhound as a boy witnesses the massacre of his tribe and is enslaved in the mines) and the subsequent first scene of the film (some twenty years later, whereby Wolfhound is already a powerful warrior having escaped the mines some time prior).

Peer To Patent is the first social-software project directly linked to decision-making by the federal government.\\"Peer To Patent: government using social networking\\" An initial pilot project in collaboration with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) was completed June 15, 2009.Press release, \\"June 15 is Last Day to Submit Applications for Peer Review Pilot\\" That pilot examined more than 220 patent applications in the fields of software and business methods. The Peer To Patent project has issued two anniversary reports from the initial pilot (\\"First Anniversary Report\\" and\\"Second Anniversary Report\\"), and a final report from the initial pilot is pending. Following the conclusion of the initial pilot the USPTO undertook an evaluation of Peer To Patent assisted by students from Worcester Polytechnic Institute. That evaluation concluded that the program had merit and should be continued.\\"Evaluation of the Peer To Patent Pilot Program\\" On October 19, 2010, the USPTO and New York Law School jointly announced a new pilot program commencing October 25, 2010, and continuing through September 30, 2011 (with the review period extending through December 31, 2011).\\"USPTO Launches Second Peer To Patent Pilot in Collaboration with New York Law School\\" This new pilot will not only include patent applications covering subject matter included in the initial pilot, it will now include telecommunications, speech recognition, translation, biotechnology, bioinformatics and biopharmaceuticals.\\"Listing of classes and subclasses qualified for the FY2011 Pilot\\" Other patent offices involved in pilot programs include IP Australia,\\"Peer To Patent Australia\\" the Japan Patent Office,\\"Peer To Patent Japan\\" and the Korean Intellectual Property Office.\\"Community patent review trialed\\" The UK Intellectual Property Office announced on November 4, 2010, that it would commence a pilot in 2011\\"Independent review launched to ensure IP system promotes growth\\" and the pilot commenced on 1 June 2011.\\"Intellectual Property Office - Peer-to-patent homepage\\"  Justification and purpose  Patents go to the heart of invention, a key driver of technological progress and economic vitality. When the patent system functions correctly, it rewards only meritorious inventions‚Äîthose that are useful, novel, and not obvious. This in turn encourages more people to exercise their ingenuity and effort to create new inventions. However, for a proper balance to be struck, the system must avoid awarding patents to discourage inventions that lack merit. When the system becomes inconsistent in recognizing true invention, inappropriately issued patents become obstacles for innovation in that technology area. This raises, directly or indirectly, the costs of doing business in that particular area. The number of patents in the most active jurisdictions (including the ones piloting Peer-to-Patent) has grown over the past few decades. The rise in patent applications has also placed stress on the patent offices themselves. For example, the USPTO October 31, 2010 had a backlog of about 700,000 patent applications, which is one and a half times the highest number of applications the USPTO has processed in any given year.\\"USPTO Data Visualization Center\\" Peer To Patent is focused on helping patent offices perform high-quality examinations of pending patent applications by enlisting the public to help find and explain prior art. Prior art are references that predate the date of conception of at least some of the features of a given claimed invention. Prior art can include earlier patents, academic papers, magazine articles, web pages, and even physical examples. Patent examiners compare a claimed invention with the prior art to determine if a given invention is both new (i.e. novel) and not obvious to a person of ordinary skill and creativity of the invention. Prior to the initiation of Peer To Patent, U.S. patent examiners had the sole responsibility for searching for prior art. Patent examiners have a time budget of a few hours in which to conduct such searches. Peer To Patent attempts to improve the patent process by markedly expanding the prior art search. The reasoning behind the project is that if prior art exists for an invention, particularly non-patent prior art, someone in the world knows about it. This knowledgeable person may be a competitor in the same field, a student or professor, or the owner of an earlier embodiment of the invention. Peer To Patent encourages such people to submit examples of prior art and creates communities of people worldwide who are interested in discovering prior art. Peer To Patent uses social software features to facilitate discussion amongst groups of volunteer experts. Users can upload prior art references, participate in discussion forums, rate other user submissions, add research references, invite others, and more. This helps the examiners focus their attention on the submission(s) of prior art that have the highest relevance to an application.  Theoretical underpinnings  An understanding of Peer To Patent's philosophical basis is valuable in order to comprehend its operation. The project also has a technological basis, lying in the potential for Internet technologies to structure public input into government processes much more effectively than agencies and legislators have done in the past. Thus, Peer to Patent is more than an intervention into the patent system; it serves as a demonstration of the potential to bring the public more fully into its own governance. Attempts to involve the public in government decision-making (other than voting and referenda, which are frequently powerful, but are also intermittent and very restrictive of the public's capacity for subtle, expressive input) previously fell into two categories, both usually of minimal impact: * Free-form online forums. These are useful for the exchange of information, but lack the structures that would permit the formation of coordinated groups and sustained, constructive planning between the public and government officials. * Web sites with suggestion forms. These tend to draw ill-considered comments from marginally committed participants, lack mechanisms for follow-through, and provide no support for knowledgeable individuals to coordinate their efforts. The paradigm underlying Peer To Patent is relatively novel, and involves clear goals, direction, and structure. The model is related, however, to many notions of civil society, particularly the theories deliberative democracy, communicative action (J√ºrgen Habermas), and strong democracy (Benjamin Barber). The more immediate underpinnings are best described in a series of papers by the creator of Peer to Patent, Beth Simone Noveck of New York Law School. Relevant papers include: * \\"Democracy of Groups\\" explains that \\"self- constituting groups\\" of volunteers can create value beyond what the individuals in them could accomplish alone. If formed online, such groups require tools to visualize their relationships and formalize contrasting approaches, so the groups can interact productively. New legal categories should also be created to recognize self-constituting groups‚Äîjust as special categories for corporations now exist‚Äîand give them a voice. * \\"Electronic Revolution in Rule-Making\\" criticizes the doctrine of the \\"insulated bureaucrat\\" who has been assumed by governments to be the most effective and impartial judge of policy. The paper calls on more democratic input from \\"on- going communities of interest and expertise,\\" but explains that government attempts to solicit such input generally fail because there is no process to let communities collaborate on input or to fashion input into a form that policy-makers can use. The article points to effective techniques such as allowing individuals to comment on each other's suggestions, providing tools for collaborative editing to bring up the quality of the suggestions, and allowing discussions with group moderation. Social norms and technological innovations must go hand in hand. The promise of Peer To Patent also draws on the success of various other movements that have created effective, productive communities on the Internet from far-flung individuals: free software and open-source software development, peer-to-peer systems for the collaborative sharing of data and computer processing, and Wikipedia.  Operation of the project  The process described in this section is that used for the USPTO pilot. = Patent applicants = The USPTO pilot, officially announced in the USPTO's Official Gazette of 26 June 2007,USPTO announcement of Peer to Patent Pilot, 26 June 2007 was initially restricted to patent applications from Technology Center 2100 (Computer Architecture, Software and Information Security) that are voluntarily submitted to the project by the owner/assignee. The extended pilot has expanded to include so-called Business Methods patents (class 705) that fall under Technology Center 3600. To be eligible for Peer To Patent review, a patent application must be filed during the period covered by the pilot. Furthermore, the USPTO tries to provide a representative sample of current patents by limiting the number of applications from any given applicant. Incentives for submitting an application to the project include: * Expedited review. Public review begins one month after publication of the application. Review continues for four months, after which the patent examiner conducts an expedited examination of the patent application. * Potentially stronger patents. If Peer to Patent review works as expected, patents that survive the process have already undergone considerable scrutiny and will be less at risk of a successful challenge later. * Public service. Applicants can feel they are contributing to a valuable experiment in new models and technologies for public decision-making. Applicants follow a procedure described on the project's web site to submit patent applications for review.To Patent sign up procedure = Community review = After a patent is published on the Peer To Patent web site, the public can post not only instances of possible prior art, but other useful comments such as common industry terms that might describe the patent. These terms, or Folksonomy tags, are useful to help other experts find prior art. The review process emphasizes and supports group collaboration in the following ways.Peer To Patent first anniversary report, June 2008 * Communication: To notify people who sign up on the web site about new applications, summaries are distributed regularly by email. People visiting the web site can easily see the titles of recent applications and other useful information. * Productivity: To keep discussion constructive and on topic, each application's site has a facilitator, whose job includes inviting new participants, reminding participants of their goals, and flagging inappropriate postings. * Self- regulation: A key contribution by participants is to rate prior art submitted by their fellow participants for a particular application. The ten pieces that receive the highest rating are submitted at the end of the review period to the patent examiner assigned to the patent. This limit prevents the examiner from being overwhelmed by a flood of prior art. * Granularity: Peer-to-Patent breaks down the process of volunteering into single questions and tasks, allowing volunteers to more easily choose which roles to occupy and what to contribute. Participants can opt to post comments, submit prior art, evaluate postings, or be active in group discussion. * Community-building: a critical aspect of Peer-to-Patent is creating a sense of community among volunteers, which leads to the likelihood of continued participation and can entice volunteers with side benefits. Volunteers describe their interests and qualifications in their profiles, invite colleagues to join the discussions, respond to each other's comments, and enhance the reputations of productive volunteers by giving \\"thumbs-ups\\" to their prior art submissions. Examples of potential side benefits are job signaling (demonstrating skills that can lead to job opportunities for students or consultants) and finding colleagues for research projects. = The office action = The role of the patent examiner in Peer To Patent remains the same as with traditional applications, except that Peer to Patent applications move to the head of the queue, to reward patent applicants who participate, and the patent examiner is forwarded the ten highest rated submissions of prior art from the Peer To Patent community to aid in their examination.  Governance  The Peer To Patent project is an independent project set up by New York Law School and operated through the school's Center for Patent Innovations.\\"Center for Patent Innovations\\" An agreement between the USPTO and Peer To Patent allows the project to submit prior art to USPTO examiners. The steering committee includes patent attorneys from major patent-holding companies. The computer industry provides most of the steering committee members, since the initial pilot focused on Technology Center 2100. Peer To Patent is funded by project sponsors and by the USPTO. The sponsors include:\\"Peer To Patent Sponsors\\" *Article One Partners *General Electric *Hewlett Packard *IBM *Microsoft *Open Invention Network *Red Hat Technology Except where noted, content on the site is available for noncommercial use through a Creative Commons license. A description of the technology used on the site is stated in their first anniversary report, :\\"The Peer To Patent Web site is built using open source technologies. It is an Internet application implemented using Ruby on Rails with a MySQL database on the Linux operating system. The system infrastructure includes hosted Web servers and database servers, as well as load balancers for traffic management. Interactive features include threaded discussions, e-mail alerts, RSS feeds, social bookmarks, video clips, tagging, ratings, and more.\\"  Future evolution  The success of the initial pilot will likely lead to a gradual expansion of Peer To Patent to cover more and more categories of patents; for example the second U.S. pilot has been expanded to include speech recognition, telecommunications, biotechnology, and bioinformatics. Channels, standards, and protocols will be created to let inventors and other participants in the process integrate their own data and work flows. One feature of the Peer To Patent site allows participants to rate each other's comments, just as they now rate each other's prior art submissions. A future stage of the project may allow patent examiners to consult the public during the office action, so that the public not only submits prior art but helps examiners better understand the relevant subject matter. More broadly, Peer To Patent shows how the public can become more self-governing by interacting in an organized manner with government officials. Elements of this interaction include: * Clear goals * Transparency, created by publicizing and archiving all interactions * A guarantee that government officials with the power to make decisions will actually take the public input into serious consideration * Building trust among the community and the ability to listen to each other * Filtering and rating tools to improve the quality of results * Visualization tools that allow participants to quickly investigate each other's qualifications and viewpoints, group themselves into caucuses, and see how many people support each position  Evaluation  As of November 24, 2010, there had been 557,560 page views from 114,395 unique viewers in 173 countries or territories. More than 2, 800 people signed up to be reviewers. Up-to-date statistics about the number of patent applications submitted to Peer To Patent, the number of community participants searching for prior art, and the amount of discussion around each patent can be obtained from the Peer To Patent web site.\\"Site Statistics\\" Some highlights from the First Anniversary report: * Peer To Patent attracted more than 2,000 peer reviewers. * The first 27 office actions issued during the pilot phase showed use of Peer To Patent submitted prior art in nine rejections * On average, citizen-reviewers contributed 6 hours reviewing each patent application in the pilot * Although USPTO rules permit third-party prior art submissions on pending applications (but only before the applications have been published, or before a notice of allowance is issued, whichever comes first), the average number of prior art submissions on Peer To Patent applications was 2,000 times that of standard rule-based submissions. * 92% of patent examiners surveyed said they would welcome examining another application with public participation, while 73% of participating examiners want to see Peer-to-Patent implemented as a regular office practice. * 21% of participating examiners stated that prior art submitted by the Peer To Patent community was \\"inaccessible\\" directly to USPTO examiners. * Prior art submissions by Peer-to-Patent reviewers were four times as likely to include non-patent literature (any document that is not a patent, including Web sites, journals, textbooks, and databases) as compared to prior art submissions by applicants.  Criticisms  Criticism of the Peer to Patent project range from its goals to its likelihood of success. For instance, criticisms can be found in comments posted to two articles favorable to Peer To Patent on the well-known Patently Obvious (Patently-O) blog: articles about the announced launch and the actual launch of the pilot. Here is a sampling of objections aired in various forums: * The patent system is too fundamentally out of kilter to be fixed by examining and rejecting individual patents. * By reviewing patents that belong to categories some people think do not deserve patents (notably software), Peer To Patent implicitly endorses the existence of such patents. * The problem with many bad patents does not involve the existence of prior art, but a definition by the patent office of \\"obviousness\\" that is too forgiving, and therefore allows obvious patents to be approved because they are not precisely the same as prior art. * The participation process that works for free software and Wikipedia will not work for the patent system because it presents steep challenges of its own. Few people in the general public understand the unique use of language in patent applications or the stages through which an application passes. The current pilot has drawn masses of participants because of its novelty and because computer-related patents are a particularly contested policy area, but this is no guarantee that similar participation will be seen in other areas and over a long term. * Potential infringers will be afraid to review patent applications because, if the patent is granted, the inventor could successfully argue in court that the infringer knew of the scope of the patent and therefore engaged in wilful infringement, potentially subjecting the infringer to triple damages. This assumes that assurances from the USPTO and Peer To Patent that reviewing an application does not constitute knowledge of the final patent are invalid and will be rejected in court. * Third parties will be afraid to help overturn a patent application for fear that the applicant (particularly if it's a large company) will retaliate later. * There are too many patent applications for the public to review every one adequately. Those who have the time and expertise to look for prior art will take their chances, waiting for the patent office to approve patents and then challenging the patents at the patent offices or in court. * Third parties who submit prior art during the patent application cannot argue in favor of that prior art during the prosecution of the patent (the discussion between the examiner and the applicant). During this ex parte discussion, the applicant has a definite advantage in arguing his or her case. Third parties will therefore wait and reserve their prior art for court cases where they have an equal chance to argue their point. This argument rests on the premise that third parties are willing to assume the hundreds of thousands (or often millions) of dollars in costs that a court challenge requires. * Large companies will devote resources to denying the applications of their competitors, and small companies will not be able to marshal the corresponding resources to knock out the patents of large companies. This argument assumes that the general public will not step up to the responsibility of reviewing patents.

Unusually for the time, the story adhered to the laws of physics as they were known, showing a starship that was limited by the speed of light, and which took several years to travel between the stars. In his comments on the story in Before the Golden Age, Isaac Asimov thought that \\"Proxima Centauri\\" must have influenced Robert A. Heinlein's later story \\"Universe\\" and stated that it influenced his own Pebble in the Sky. Plot summary Earth's first starship, the Adastra, is approaching Proxima Centauri after a seven-year voyage. The voyage was marred by a mutiny among the crew, and the ship is still divided between a small group of officers who control the Adastra and the remainder of the crew, whom the officers refer to disparagingly as Muts, short for mutineers. A young Mut named Jack Gary has been picking up and studying transmissions from a race native to the Proxima Centauri system. This has earned him the confidence of Captain Bradley, the love of Bradley's daughter Helen, and the hatred of the Adastra's first officer, Commander Alstair, who also has romantic designs upon Helen. Much to Alstair's disgust, Captain Bradley raises Gary to officer status in recognition of his work with the Centaurian transmissions. Shortly after the elderly Bradley's death, Gary discovers that a Centaurian spaceship is approaching the Adastra, and he suspects that their intention is hostile. The Centaurians confirm his suspicions when they fire a radiation beam at the ship. Although the Adastra has not been harmed, Alstair has the ship play dead to fool the Centaurians into thinking they have succeeded in wiping out the crew. The Centaurian ship docks with the Adastra, and a boarding party attacks the crew. The boarding party is defeated, and the Centaurian ship departs. Studying the captured leader of the Centaurian boarding party makes it clear that the Centaurians are mobile, carnivorous plants that feed on animals, and that they look on the crew of the Adastra as a highly valuable food source. Now that the Adastra has entered their system, the Centaurians will be able to trace their course back to Earth. As a fleet of Centaurian ships approaches the Adastra, Gary learns that Earth has launched a second starship for Proxima Centauri. The defenseless Adastra is surrounded by the Centaurian fleet, and boarded. The entire crew is consumed by Centaurians except for Alstair, Jack Gary, Helen Bradley, and half a dozen officers. The Centaurian leader orders all the Adastra's records, equipment, and animals sent on board an automated ship, along with Gary and Bradley. While Alstair and the remaining officers pilot the Adastra to Proxima Centauri I, the Centaurian homeworld, the automated ship will be flown to Proxima Centauri II, an Earthlike world that has long since been stripped of its native animal life and abandoned by the Centaurians. After Gary and Bradley land on Proxima Centauri II and release the animals there, Alstair reaches the Centaurian homeworld. Alstair rigs the Adastra's engines to explode, setting off a chain reaction that will destroy the Centaurian homeworld and exterminate the Centaurians, leaving Gary and Bradley to await the arrival of the next ship from Earth. Reception L. Sprague de Camp dismissed the story as \\"bottom of the trunk\\", with no virtues beyond \\"fast action\\".\\"Book Reviews\\", Astounding Science Fiction, February 1951, p.151 Everett F. Bleiler reported that the story contains \\"some good material, some cliche, and some nonsense,\\" concluding that it \\"seems much less successful\\" than when it was originally published.Everett F. Bleiler, Science- Fiction: The Gernsback Years, Kent State University Press, 1998, p.248 Story notes As Asimov notes in Before the Golden Age, earlier writers such as E. E. Smith had ignored the lightspeed barrier in writing about interstellar travel. Leinster not only worked within the constraints of the theory of relativity, he even calculated that a trip to Proxima Centauri would take seven years if the ship traveled under a constant acceleration and deceleration of one gravity. Leinster also notes that such an acceleration would bring the ship to a significant fraction of the speed of light, though he fails to take account of the resulting time dilation, which would reduce the subjective length of the trip by at least two years. Asimov also writes, \\"The thing I remember most clearly over the years about 'Proxima Centauri' is the peculiar horror I felt at the thought of a race of intelligent plants that lusted after animal food. It is almost an unfailing recipe for a startling science fiction story to begin by inverting some thoroughly accepted situation, something so ordinary as to be almost disregarded. Of course, animals eat plants, and of course, animals are quick and more or less intelligent, while plants are motionless and utterly passive (except for a few insect-eating plants, which can be disregarded). But what if intelligent and carnivorous plants fed on animals, eh?\\" Publication history *Sidewise in Time, edited by Murray Leinster, Shasta, 1950 *Conquest of the Stars, Malian Press, 1952 *Monsters and Such, edited by Murray Leinster, Avon, 1959 *Before the Golden Age, edited by Isaac Asimov, Doubleday, 1974 *The Best of Murray Leinster, edited by Brian Davis, Corgi, 1976 *The Road to Science Fiction 2: From Wells to Heinlein, edited by James Gunn, Mentor, 1979 *First Contacts, edited by Joe Rico, NESFA Press, 1998 References External links \\"Proxima Centauri\\" on the Internet Archive Category:Proxima Centauri in fiction Category:Science fiction short stories Category:1935 short stories Category:Works originally published in Analog Science Fiction and Fact Category:Works by Murray Leinster ","title":"Proxima Centauri (short story)"},{"id":"14086866","text":"Dark Energy Digital was a privately owned video game developer and publisher based in the United Kingdom.

It is in the process of selling IP and assets, most notably the Hydrophobia series and the Hydroengine.3 HydroEngine HydroEngine logo The HydroEngine is a video game engine created by Blade Interactive for their video game Hydrophobia for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. Developed over three years, it has a unique capability which allows modelling of flowing water and other liquids for the first time. It is entirely dynamic, which means the effect is not repeated and thus allowing different effects each time. The engine can also interface with solid body physics engines such as Havok, which allows objects and debris to be carried with the flow. Another new development platform, called the InfiniteWorldsGCS, interfaces directly with the HydroEngine. According to the developers it is \\"an underlying architecture, which can interface with bespoke editors tailored to individual game projects\\".

Biography =Early life and career= Morahan was born in London in 1929, the son of film production designer Tom Morahan and Nancy (n√©e Barker), his wife. His mother was an artist. He was educated at Highgate School followed by his national service. Originally thinking about a career as an architect, he realised it would be some years before he could earn a living and thus settled on working in the film industry. The director Thorold Dickinson advised him to learn about acting and the theatrical repertoire instead. He trained for the stage at the Old Vic Theatre School from 1947 with actor/director Michel Saint- Denis, designer Margaret Harris, and director George Devine. Initially an actor, he briefly worked as a stage manager on Orson Welles' touring production of Othello, but refused to work on Welles' next production and found the theatre of the time unenthusing. In a career change of sorts, he joined ATV as a floor manager and, subsequently became a television director from 1957, on Emergency Ward 10, a new ITV series. =At the BBC and in the theatre= Later, he developed a rapport with writer John Hopkins while working together on Z-Cars. This led to Morahan directing Hopkins' Fable (1965), a Wednesday Play parable locating a reversed South African apartheid in Britain, and the BBC's version of Talking to a Stranger (1966). Morahan gained \\"brilliant performances from all his cast\\" wrote Michael Billington of Talking to a Stranger, Michael Bryant, Maurice Denham and Margery Mason being three of the four leads, \\"but it was Judi Dench as the daughter, forced to reveal her pregnancy to her tight-lipped parents, who astonished everyone. Morahan's first stage production was Jules Feiffer's Little murders for the Royal Shakespeare Company at the Aldwych Theatre in July 1967, starring Brenda Bruce, Barbara Jefford, Derek Godfrey and Roland Curram. From 1972 to 1976, he was the Head of Plays for BBC Television, a department responsible for such series as Play for Today and Play of the Month. In this role he commissioned Days of Hope (1975), a four-part serial written by Jim Allen and directed by Ken Loach which covers proletarian life from 1916 to 1926. He managed to appoint Roy Battersby as the director of Colin Welland's Leeds United (1974) despite negative vetting from MI5 which rejected Battersby because of his membership of the Trotskyist Workers Revolutionary Party. While working for the BBC, Peter Nichols was another dramatist with whom Morahan had a successful partnership, but another project with John Hopkins, the six-part play cycle Fathers and Families (1977), was a major disappointment. =Later career= Morahan joined the National Theatre in 1977 as Deputy Director and was appointed Co-Director of the Olivier Theatre. He was involved in creating the 14-part television drama The Jewel in the Crown (1984), of which he was co-director and producer. The series won a Primetime Emmy Award and a BAFTA TV Award in 1985. The film Clockwise (1986), with John Cleese in the lead, was a minor hit. =Personal life and honours= Morahan's first wife was Joan Lucie Murray (d. 1973), with whom he had two sons, including director Andy Morahan; a daughter from the marriage predeceased him. After his first wife died, Morahan married actress Anna Carteret; the couple have two daughters: theatre director Rebecca, also involved in human rights activism, and actress Hattie Morahan.Ann McFerran Interview with Anna Carteret and Hattie Morahan, The Sunday Times Magazine, 30 November 2008 Morahan was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2011 Birthday Honours for services to drama. Morahan died on 7 April 2017, the same day as Tim Pigott-Smith, one of the leads in The Jewel in the Crown.

She is Switzerland's most successful luger. She first slid on a luge at the age of nine at St. Moritz, after taking an interest in the sport when her father Heinz, a former bobsledder-turned-coach of bobsleigh and luge, took her along to a training course he was leading. Competing in four Winter Olympics, she earned her best finish of seventh in the women's singles event at Vancouver in 2010. She also took ninth places on her Olympic debut at the 2006 Games at Cesana Pariol and at the 2014 Olympics at Sanki, and was 11th at her final Games, the 2018 Games at the Alpensia Sliding Centre. From 2014 until her retirement, Kocher broke away from the Swiss Sledding Association's set-up, organising her own coaching and support team, being coached by her father and former luger Stefan H√∂hener. For many years she trained alongside the German luge team. At the 2016 FIL World Luge Championships at K√∂nigssee, Kocher took the gold medal in the sprint and the silver in the full length singles event. At the following year's World Championships at Innsbruck, she finished second in the sprint. The latter result was considered a surprise as the short track at Innsbruck was not considered to suit Kocher, who was by far the lightest luger in top-level competition during her career. Her best finish at the FIL European Luge Championships was eighth in the women's singles event at Sigulda in 2010. Despite her World Championship success, she never achieved a Luge World Cup podium: her best World Cup result was a fourth place in K√∂nigssee in January 2018. In August 2018 Kocher announced her retirement from competition, becoming a teacher for teenagers with behavioural problems.

He is best known for playing the lead in Stephen Poliakoff's BBC films Joe's Palace and Capturing Mary, alongside Sir Michael Gambon and Dame Maggie Smith. He is also recognised for his stage work. Primarily through an actors perspective, Lee Wynter has written many articles on the topic of diversity, addressing issues of race, class, disability and gender within TV, theatre, art, history, sexuality and mass media. His writing has appeared in numerous publications including The Stage Newspaper, The Huffington Post, The Guardian and The Evening Standard and between 2017 and 2018 he was a columnist for Attitude (magazine). He is founder of the campaigning group the Act For Change Project, a charitable organisation operating from the National Theatre. He is also acknowledged for beginning the Yes or No campaign, a movement in the U.K. arts encouraging leading casting directors and producers to respond to performers post audition. Biography Lee Wynter was born in Barking, East London and grew up in a single parent family in Essex. His mother, a train attendant, is of Romany Gypsy and Italian ancestry, and his father, a local businessman, is of Jamaican descent. He has been open about his sexuality since the beginning of his career identifying as gay. http://attitude.co.uk/interview-actor-danny- lee-wynter-talks-deathwatch-revival-and-lack-of-media-diversity/ In 2000, Lee Wynter studied performing arts at Middlesex University, where he trained in clown under John Wright, founder of Trestle Theatre Company and As Told By An Idiot. In 2003, he gained a place at the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art to train in classical acting. During this period he ushered at The Royal Court theatre, a job which he left to make his professional debut in Stephen Poliakoff's 2007 BBC/HBO films Joe's Palace and Capturing Mary. After receiving acclaim for his performance in the Poliakoff films Lee Wynter was cast by Dominic Dromgoole as the Fool to David Calder's King Lear for Shakespeare's Globe. His other work for the company includes Henry IV Part I and II opposite Roger Allam and new plays The Frontline by Che Walker and Bedlam by Nell Leyshon. He also appeared as the titular character in Milton's Comus in the Wanamaker Playhouse. Early theatre work includes David Storey‚Äôs The Changing Room for The Royal Court, Moliere‚Äôs The Miser for The Royal Exchange Manchester and Ibsen‚Äôs St. John‚Äôs Night for Jermyn Street Theatre. In 2013, he was directed by Sir Mark Rylance, as Don John the bastard in Much Ado About Nothing for The Old Vic Theatre Company, opposite Vanessa Redgrave. In January 2014, after responding to a trailer for a new season of TV drama which failed to include a single BAME artist, Lee Wynter brought together a group of friends and colleagues, actresses Ruth Wilson and Stephanie Street, actor and director Daniel Evans, casting director Andy Pryor and actors Malcolm Sinclair and Kobna Holdbrook-Smith to send out the message that the UK arts must reflect everyone regardless of race, gender, class, sexual orientation or disability. What started as a handful of voices soon became the Act for Change project. The organisations first public event was a sold out debate chaired by Baroness Shami Chakrabarti, then of the human rights group, Liberty. Held at London's Young Vic Theatre, the pilot debate was attended by various leading industry figures, including the Head of ITV Drama. Unprecedented public support followed and Act For Change was formed as a way of \\"drawing attention to the lack of equality that exists within the UK live and recorded arts.\\" In 2015 The Act For Change Project became a registered charity. Lee Wynter's more recent stage work includes the lead role of Tom Wingfield in Tennessee Williams' The Glass Menagerie for the Nuffield Theatre, Southampton, opposite Belinda Lang.

The script coordinator is responsible for producing each draft of the script and annotating it for ease of use for the production team. On a television series the script coordinator is responsible for liaising between the writing and production departments. The writers deliver the first draft of a script to the script coordinator who prepares it for the production team and handles any clearance issues. Clearance refers to the need to check the script for potential legal problems and ensure that all names are cleared by the legal department. wisegeek.com, What Does a Script Coordinator Do? The script coordinator must check the draft for proper formatting, spelling, punctuation and continuity before releasing the draft. Once a script has been released, other members of the production team offer notes to the writers necessitating revisions to the script. The process of how widely each draft is released (e.g. just to the writers, then to the writers and producers and then to the network) varies from show to show. aspiringtvwriter.blogspot.com, 5 Questions with a Writer's Assistant and Script Coordinator, Tuesday, July 17, 2012 With each round of revisions the script coordinator must ensure that the changes are clearly marked, re-issue the script and again check the script for errors. Many script coordinators are also responsible for foreign language translations and compiling a show bible that tracks plot points and character introductions as a reference tool. A script coordinator is a distinct role from script supervisor. A script supervisor is responsible for on-set annotation of the script for editing purposes rather than pre-production coordination of the script to facilitate production. A script coordinator is considered a junior role in the writing staff and becoming a full-time screenwriter is typically a common promotion from being a script coordinator.

Abbreviated or PBu, it is a tertiary phosphine. It is an oily liquid at room temperature, with a nauseating odor. It reacts slowly with atmospheric oxygen, and rapidly with other oxidizing agents, to give the corresponding phosphine oxide. It is usually handled using air-free techniques.  Preparation  Tributylphosphine is prepared industrially by the hydrophosphination of phosphine with butene: the addition proceeds by a free radical mechanism, and so the Markovnikov rule is not followed. :PH + 3CH=CHCHCH ‚Üí P(CHCHCHCH) Tributylphosphine can be prepared in the laboratory by reaction of the appropriate Grignard reagent with phosphorus trichloride although, as it is commercially available at reasonable prices, it is rare to have to perform the small-scale preparation. :3 BuMgCl + PCl ‚Üí PBu + 3 MgCl Reactions Tributylphosphine reacts with oxygen to give the phosphine oxide: :2 PBu3 \\\\+ O2 ‚Üí 2 OPBu3 Because this reaction is so fast, the compound is usually handled under an inert atmosphere. The phosphine is also easily alkylated. For example, benzyl chloride gives the phosphonium salt:J√ºrgen Svara, Norbert Weferling and Thomas Hofmann \\"Phosphorus Compounds, Organic\\" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, 2006, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. : PBu3 \\\\+ PhCH2Cl ‚Üí [PhCH2PBu3]Cl Tributylphosphine is a common ligand for the preparation of complexes of transition metals in low oxidation states. It is cheaper and less air-sensitive than trimethylphosphine and other trialkylphosphines. Although its complexes are generally highly soluble, they are often more difficult to crystallize compared to complexes of more rigid phosphines. Furthermore, the 1H NMR properties are less easily interpreted and can mask signals for other ligands. Compared to other tertiary phosphines, it is compact (cone angle: 136¬∞) and basic (œá-parameter: 5.25 cm‚àí1)  Use  Tributylphosphine finds some industrial use as a catalyst modifier in the cobalt-catalyzed hydroformylation of alkenes, where it greatly increases the ratio of straight-chain aldehydes to branched-chain aldehydes in the product mixture. However, tricyclohexylphosphine is even more effective for this purpose (although more expensive) and, in any case, rhodium catalysts are usually preferred to cobalt catalysts for the hydroformylation of alkenes. It is the precursor to the pesticide 2,4-dichlorobenzyltributylphosphoniumchloride (\\"Phosfleur\\"). Although tributylphosphine is generally regarded as toxic, its biological effects can be manipulated by drug delivery strategies. For example, a photoactivatable version of tributylphosphine has been used to induce disulfide bond cleavage and reductive stress in living cells. Odor The main laboratory inconvenience of tributylphosphine is its unpleasant smell.  Hazards  Tributylphosphine is moderately toxic, with an LD50 of 750 mg/kg (oral, rats).

His name also appears as Schurmann and in Hochdeutsch as Scheuermann. Life Sch√ºrmann studied music, including voice, in his native Lower Saxony. By 1693, he was singing at the Oper am G√§nsemarkt as a young alto. In 1694 he composed a cantata for the inauguration of the Castle Salzdahlum in Wolfenb√ºttel. In 1697, he went to L√ºneburg (about 50 km southeast of Hamburg) for a guest performance. His singing there so impressed Duke Anton Ulrich of Brunswick- Wolfenb√ºttel that the Duke hired him on the spot. From 1702 to 1707 he was principal conductor and composer for the Meiningen Court Orchestra. In 1707 Sch√ºrmann officially succeeded Reinhard Keiser as Cammer-Componist (court composer). He served the court of Brunswick, with but a few brief interruptions, for 54 years until he died at the age of 79. Work Sch√ºrmann wrote over thirty operas, many of which have not survived. His music was characterized by harmonic richness, careful contrapuntal elaboration, flexible handling of form and theatrically effective delineation of characters.

She was used by the Union Navy as a gunboat assigned to patrol Confederate waterways. Post-war she was converted into a dispatch vessel and served that function until finally decommissioned. Built in Cincinnati in 1863 Reindeer, a wooden, stern-wheel gunboat (No. 35) built at Cincinnati, Ohio, in the spring of 1863 as Rachel Miller, was purchased by the Navy there on 13 June 1863 and placed in service early in July 1863. Civil War service = Assigned to the Mississippi Squadron = Reindeer joined the Mississippi Squadron just as Union Army and Navy efforts to open the entire Mississippi River system to Federal shipping finally reached fruition with the capture of the South's river strongholds at Vicksburg, Mississippi, and Port Hudson, Louisiana. =Opening of the Confederate waterways to Union Navy control= This achievement of Northern arms opened a new phase of the Civil War in the West. Control of the vast inland waterways, which meandered through the Confederacy, gave Union commanders strategic lines of supply and communication for campaigns which would pierce into the South's heartland to deprive the Confederacy of its centers of strength. To counter this strategy, Southern generals attempted to deprive the North of the use of these vital rivers. Lacking a powerful naval arm to challenge Federal forces afloat, the South resorted to guerrilla raids and cavalry forays against Union bases along the riverbanks and on supply ships which plied the rivers bringing Mr. Lincoln's soldiers food, clothing, ammunition, and the other necessities of war. =Supporting the effort to suppress Morgan‚Äôs Raiders= It was Reindeer's job to protect Northern shipping from Southern raiders. After Confederate Brig. Gen. John H. Morgan crossed the Ohio River and invaded the North with some 2,500 troops early in July, Reindeer joined a group of Union gunboats which patrolled the river for 10 days to prevent his crossing back to the southern bank and escaping. Aided by Union troops under Major General Ambrose Burnside, they chased Morgan for almost 500 miles before they caught up with him at Buffington Island on the 19th and captured about half of the invading force. =Reindeer finally officially commissioned= The crisis passed, Reindeer returned to Cincinnati for a belated commissioning ceremony on 25 July 1863. She operated along the Ohio from Louisville, Kentucky, to Madison, Indiana, watchful against guerrilla batteries as she patrolled the river and escorted transports and supply ships. =Reassigned to Cumberland River operations= On 15 November, the gunboat was transferred to the Cumberland River for similar duty. In the months that followed, she frequently engaged Confederate batteries which fired upon her from temporary positions along the riverbanks as she reconnoitered the upper Cumberland and supported Army operations in Tennessee which would ultimately culminate in General William Tecumseh Sherman's death thrust through Georgia to the sea. She also participated in the Battle of Nashville December, 2nd, 4th and 15th, 1864. On 11 April 1864, Reindeer became a dispatch vessel for the Navy base at Mound City, Illinois, and served in that capacity until she decommissioned on 7 August 1865. Post-war disposal and subsequent civilian career She was sold at public auction on 17 August 1865 to J. A. Williamson, et al., and was redocumented as Mariner on 5 October 1865. The ship operated as a merchantman until she was stranded and destroyed at Decatur, Alabama, on 9 May 1867.

Through alternative splicing, it encodes both of the human proteins Bcl-xL and Bcl-xS.  Function  The protein encoded by this gene belongs to the BCL-2 protein family. BCL-2 family members form hetero- or homodimers and act as anti- or pro-apoptotic regulators that are involved in a wide variety of cellular activities. The proteins encoded by this gene are located at the outer mitochondrial membrane, and have been shown to regulate outer mitochondrial membrane channel (VDAC) opening. VDAC regulates mitochondrial membrane potential, and thus controls the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and release of cytochrome C by mitochondria, both of which are the potent inducers of cell apoptosis. Two alternatively spliced transcript variants, which encode distinct isoforms, have been reported.

It aired on MBC from September 17, 2007 to June 16, 2008 on Mondays and Tuesdays at 21:55. The series was directed by Lee Byung-hoon, who also produced the award-winning television series Dae Jang Geum. Lee Seo-jin and Han Ji-min received recognition for their performances at the MBC Drama Awards. Synopsis Yi San dramatizes the life of Korea's King Jeongjo, the 22nd ruler of the Joseon Dynasty. Jeongjo is remembered in Korean history for his sympathy with the plight of the common man, in spite of his own pampered upbringing as royalty. The drama begins with the King's early years, during which he befriends two children working in the Palace who are later expelled. King Yeongjo (Jeongjo's grandfather) seals Jeongjo's father, Crown Prince Sado, in a rice storage chest with no food or water because he fears that the crown prince is planning a coup. Jeongjo wants to save his father, and with the help of his friends Seong Song Yeon and Park Dae Su, begs King Yeongjo to forgive the Crown Prince. The drama then skips forward to Jeongjo's adult years when he and his friends re-establish contact with each other. Throughout, Jeongjo's position as Crown Prince is threatened by palace intrigues. The Crown Prince, Jeongjo, begins to fall in love with one of his childhood friends, Seong Song Yeon, whose father, a palace artist, died when she was young. The story then follows Yi San's rise to power, his assumption of the kingship, and the labyrinthine palace intrigues that he must constantly guard against from the No-ron Faction. While the show does deviate from the historical record in a number of ways, its representation of court life during the Joseon Dynasty appears to be based on contemporary sources. Cast and characters *Yi San/King Jeongjo (played by Lee Seo-jin) ‚Äî the main protagonist in the series. He is the only son of Crown Prince Sado and Lady Hyegyeong. Extremely kind and generous, he makes frequent trips under disguise to see how the common people are doing. The series spans from San's childhood at the age of eleven, when Crown Prince Sado is being executed, to about 40 years later, when San himself reigned as king. It was during the beginning of the series when San met Seong Song Yeon and Park Dae Su. In episode 1, he disguises himself as a junior eunuch and sneaks into the courtyard where his father was imprisoned in a rice chest. With the help of Dae Su and Song Yeon, he manages to see him and obey his father's last wish. The friendship that developed as a result would last the entire series. The plot fast-forwards ten years, when San is an adult and Crown Prince of Korea. San is a filial child who loved his father unconditionally despite the opposition, and never denied his father's innocence, which caused him to get into trouble several times. He also never bore a grudge against King Yeongjo, his grandfather, despite Yeongjo's sometimes unfair and harsh treatment towards him. San loved his grandfather deeply. Loyal to his subjects and people, he hates it when someone risks their own life for his, and always tries to protect them instead. While he is still Crown Prince, he falls in love with Song Yeon who became his source of comfort and warmth. Later, when he becomes king, Song Yeon, is finally made his concubine. Although San tries to hide it, he never liked the other concubines his mother brought in and hardly ever spend time with them like he did with Song Yeon, and only doing so once in a while out of a sense of duty as a King, a fact which he is bitter about. San likes practicing martial arts with the Royal Guards and traveling incognito in order to feel the experience of the people. When doing so, he adopts the pseudonym Yi Mu-Duk. He suffered severe pain and heartbreak when Song Yeon passes away. While he gravely misses and thinks of her every day, he continued to keep his promise to her that he will withstand everything and be a good king. He is implied to be together with Song Yeon again in their afterlife, where he is finally at peace and happy to spend the rest of eternity with the woman he loves. :Titles: Yi San (San of the Royal House of Yi), Ïù¥ ÏÇ∞, Wangsesun Cheoha (His Highness the Crown Prince Grandson), ÏôïÏÑ∏ÏÜê Ï†ÄÌïò, Chusang Cheona (His Majesty the King), Ï£ºÏÉÅ Ï†ÑÌïò :Pseudonym: Yang(Ga) Mu-Duk (Mu-Duk of the Yang Clan), Ïñë(Í∞Ä) Î¨¥Îçï *Seong Song-yeon/Ui-bin Seong (played by Han Ji-min) ‚Äî King Jeongjo's love interest. She is the daughter of a skilled palace artist and thus has a fondness for art. Orphaned at a young age with a baby brother to take care of, she was taken in by a relative who helped her become a palace maid so that she, too, could gain a standing in the palace. When she was 11, she entered the palace and her relative sent her baby brother, Seong Song Wook, to the family of a local physician who was kind enough to adopt him. On her first night in the palace Song Yeon met San, who was trying to get to the rice chest that held his father. Dae Su, who was trying to escape the palace, while she was obtaining food for the older palace maids. Sadly, she and Dae Su were caught and kicked out of the palace. Angry at her, the relative that helped her enter the palace refused to take her in, so Dae Su's uncle, senior eunuch Park Dal Ho, took her in and raised her with Dae Su. However, enemies of the prince forced them all to flee the capital. They fled promising that they would return to the palace to keep their friendship. This they do, and Song Yeon enters the Bureau of Painting, which keeps records of events by painting them, as a Damo (female painting assistant). The promise of returning to the palace is not fulfilled until Song Yeon paints a Kirin for an ambassador from Qing China. Curious to learn more about her, San inquires about her at the Bureau and realized it was Song Yeon. He quickly visits her home where he finds Dae Su and his uncle. From then on, the three stay together. Song Yeon fell in love with San because of his kind heart and loyal personality, and shows great concern and love for him. Although Song yeon loves San unconditionally, she thinks it is unwise to be with San as she assumes she would be an obstacle for him due to her lowly status, no matter how much she wants to be by his side. San eventually persuaded her to be with him, telling her that he loves her not as King, but a man. Song Yeon is portrayed in the series as a beautiful, kind, and intelligent young woman. She manages to rise from a lowly Damo to a real Bureau artist. Her good character and beauty make San fall in love with her; she becomes his concubine after he becomes king. Sadly, few people accept her due to her low status (Damo were considered lower than slaves) and the fact that she was orphaned. It was not until she gave birth to a boy that she is accepted and formally recognized as the King's concubine. Unfortunately, her first son died of illness and caused her to suffer severe grief. Consequentially, when she urged to take medicine for her liver cancer, she refused as it would kill her second child. Song Yeon dies of liver cancer while pregnant with her second child near the end of the series, but returns to San in a dream one last time just before his death. :Titles: Seong(Ga) Song Yeon (Song Yeon of the Seong Clan), ÏÑ±(Í∞Ä) ÏÜ°Ïó∞, Seong Sang-gung (Lady Seong), ÏÑ± ÏÉÅÍ∂Å, So-yong Seong-ssi (Concubine So-yong of the Seong Clan), ÏÜåÏö© ÏÑ±Ïî®, Ui-bin Seong-ssi (Royal Noble Consort Ui-bin of the Seong Clan), ÏùòÎπà ÏÑ±Ïî® *Park Dae-su (played by Lee Jong-soo) ‚Äî King Jeongjo's favorite military officer. Dae Su was originally a junior eunuch in the palace. Because he wasn't castrated, he wanted to leave. He tried to flee, when he met Song Yeon and San. Like Song Yeon, he too got kicked out for helping San. Song Yeon and Dae Su know each other very well, as they practically grew up together. Both are orphans, but Dae Su's uncle raised them. When Song Yeon entered the Bureau, Dae Su took the military exam and became a palace guard, and became a guard of the Crown Prince (San). From there, Dae Su was promoted over and over until he became Grand Commander of the Dragon Guard, the finest army division in Korea and the king's personal guard. Dae Su started out very dumb and dependent, but when he took the military exam, his tutors helped him become a decent man; intelligent, independent, and calm. Without this change, he might have become a simple street thug. Dae Su was extremely supportive and defensive of San and would beat up anyone who dares to insult him. He is one of the three military guards who always loyally follow the king. The other two military guards are Kang Suk Ki, a perceptive archer, and Suh Jang Bo, a stubborn fighter. Song Yeon is Dae Su's love interest, but he gave up trying to court her after she became a concubine. He was alive during the reign of Yi San's son, King Sunjo and was implied to have joined them in the afterlife soon afterwards where they played together again as children. It is possible that he is based on Baek Dong-soo, a body guard who was famous for saving King Jeongjo on multiple occasions. *Lady Hyegyeong (played by Kyeon Mi-ri) ‚Äî Jeongjo's mother. She is the daughter of high-ranking court official Hong Bong-han of the Pyeongsan Hong clan. Ever worrisome over the royal family and the people, she is a model mother of the Korean upper class. She never approved of Song Yeon and San due to Song Yeon's status as a Damo and tried numerous ways to separate them. Lady Hyegyeong looks down on lower-class people and was the main obstacle that caused Song Yeon suffering when she became a concubine as well. Eventually, through Song Yeon's efforts, Lady Hyegyeong saw her good personality and started to finally accept her. When she learns that Song Yeon was pregnant, she acknowledged her as a royal concubine. Lady Hyegyeong is also responsible for the multiple concubines brought in to bear an heir. *Queen Hyoui (played by Park Eun-hye) ‚Äî King Jeongjo's primary wife, born into the Kim clan. She was betrothed to San at the age of 10 and married him in her late teens (around 19). Hyoui is very kind, filial, refined, and honest, a model wife of the Korean upper class. She has the respect of almost everyone in the palace and she does not abuse this power. Unfortunately, the Queen is unable to bear children and thus results in Jeongjo's mother bringing in multiple concubines. Queen Hyoui favors Song-yeon, and it is with her help that Song Yeon became a concubine and gave birth to a son. Queen Hyoui dies soon after King Jeongjo dies. *King Yeongjo (played by Lee Soon-jae) ‚Äî Jeongjo's grandfather. He was the 21st king of Korea before San took over. Yeongjo has one son, his second son Crown Prince Sado, and a daughter, Princess Hwawan.Both Sado and Hwawan were offspring of one of Yeongjo's concubines. King Yeongjo is a loving and experienced old man, but he is very firm on San so he can make him the next king. King Yeongjo always suspected his second son of high treason, and throughout the series, that was shown. It was not till just before his death did King Yeongjo discover it had been a plot to frame his son. Yeongjo publicly made it known that it had been a false accusation and had his son's grave repaired. Like San, Yeongjo loved the people and when he knew he would die, he sneaked out of the palace and went to his private residence so that he could die among the people. Before dying, he commissioned Seong Song Yeon to create a portrait of Crown Prince Sado to replace the ones that had been destroyed. Before dying, he looks at the painting while apologizing to his son for being a terrible father and promising him to be a better father to him in the afterlife. Yeongjo died in 1777 in his 80s of dementia. *Queen Jeongsun (played by Kim Yeo-jin) ‚Äî King Yeongjo's 2nd wife. She is the daughter of the extremely wealthy and powerful Gyeongju Kim clan. Yeongjo fell in love with her when he was 66 and she was 15. Of all the characters in the series, Queen Jeongsun has the best split character. She is very caring and smart, but deep inside she has a greed for power, is very manipulative and holds a silent grudge against San even though she is his step-grandmother.In actuality, she is his step-grandmother, as San's real grandmother is one of Yeongjo's concubines Queen Jeongsun is the leader of the conservative No-ron Faction and the mastermind behind a decades long plot to destroy San. Later, she is forced to give up her titles and power but is permitted to live in the palace. *Crown Prince Sado (played by Lee Chang-hoon) ‚Äî Jeongjo's father. He was skilled at archery, calligraphy, and painting. He was courted by the So-ron Faction (who fell from power) and was later framed by the No-ron Faction. After being accused of treason against the throne by his own father, King Yeongjo, Sado was sentenced to death in a rice chest. San, in secret, came to see him a few nights before he died. Sado told San to retrieve a painting he had painted of a scene King Yeongjo cherished. Sadly, Sado died before Yeongjo saw the painting. Later on, it was an adult Song Yeon who discovered the meaning of the painting and brought it to Yeongjo, 14 years after Sado's death. With the secret revealed to the king, Yeongjo understood and Sado's name was cleared. *Princess Hwawan (played by Sung Hyun-ah) ‚Äî Yeongjo's daughter by a concubine. Yeongjo is very fond of her. Hwawan is a very beautiful and filial, but impatient young woman. Because she is widowed and has no children, she adopted the orphan Jeong Hu-gyeom, who became a court official. Like Queen Jeongsun, Princess Hwawan affiliated with the No-ron Faction and is also a mastermind in the plot to destroy King Jeongjo. This cost her her favor with her father. In the end, Princess Hwawan was stripped of her royalty and titles and exiled to a place far from the capital, where she lived in seclusion under house arrest with only her lady-in-waiting to accompany her. *Jeong Hu-gyeom (played by Cho Yeon-woo) ‚Äî Princess Hwawan's adoptive son. He is incredibly intelligent, and the youngest person ever to be part of the royal court; Jeong is the Royal Secretary. He is very smart and filial to the princess. When he was a child, he was San's study partner at the Confucian Academy. In his teens he studied in Qing China and as an adult he was very successful. Like his adoptive mother, he was a key member of the No-ron Faction and also part of the plot to destroy San. When the participants were punished, Hu-gyeom was exiled and put to death by poison, but not before warning Hong Guk-yeong from personal experience that he too would fall from grace if he couldn't keep his lust for power in check. *Hong Guk-yeong (played by Han Sang-jin) ‚Äî King Jeongjo's right-hand man, as well as distant cousin to his mother, Lady Hyegyeong (both are members of the Pyeongsan hong clan). He is a very loyal adviser to Jeongjo, but very ambitious and can be somewhat shady. Hong is at times hungry for power and when he has it, he sometimes abuses it. He was also the main tutor who helped Dae Su when he was training for the military exam. Throughout the series, he was promoted to Chief Inspector, Chief of the Royal Guard, and Chief Secretary due to his skill at politics and investigation. His younger sister also became one of Jeongjo's concubines and Hong Guk-yeong hoped to have enhance his influence by being related to the King's future heir. However, his sister would die out of grief after a failed cover-up of a phantom pregnancy (due to potential scandal). Enraged over the fact that she died unforgiven by Queen Hyoui and her remark that he would have no influence over the next heir, he made a bargain with Queen Jeongsun to allow him to be the adoptive parent of a member of the royal family. In the end, he was exiled for trying to poison Queen Hyoui out of anger over his sister's death and to prevent his bargain from being exposed, for Queen Hyoui discovered it and threatened to tell King Jeongjo. He aborted the attempt after discovering that the King was taking her place at the food ceremony and tearfully confessed. He later died at peace due to health issues after being forgiven by the king. *Jeong Yak-yong (played by Song Chang-eui) ‚Äî A scholar from the Confucian Academy and a member of the Nam-in Faction, he was initially unable to enter the court for three years. Later, after entering, he replaced Hong Guk-yeong as Yi San's closest adviser. While not as politically skilled as his predecessor, he is extremely innovative and is a skilled inventor. As a skilled-albeit clumsy investigator, he is also aware of the flaws in the government and called for reforms. *Yang Cho-bi (played by Lee Ip-sae) ‚Äî A Damo at the Bureau of Painting. At first she was very rude to Song-yeon. But when she fell in love with Dae Su and discovered that Song Yeon was practically his sister, she became nicer to her. At first it was for Dae Su, but eventually she developed a real bond and friendship with Song-yeon. When Song Yeon became concubine to Jeongjo, Cho-bi was selected to be her lady-in- waiting, an attendant court lady of the 6th rank (in Korea, all royalty, palace servants, government employees, and government officials are ranked on a system of 1-9, with 1 being the highest rank and 9 being the lowest rank). After Song Yeon's death, Cho-bi becomes Queen Hyoui's second lady-in-waiting. *Kim Gwi-joo (played by Park Young-ji) ‚Äî Queen Jeongsun's older brother and a member of the No-ron Faction. He is a high-ranking minister of the royal court and holds the title Lord Kim. Very aggressive, he can easily beat up anyone who makes him or his sister look bad. He has a very lively and straight forward personality and is highly loved by her sister. He also is very intelligent and loves travelling to the city of Pyongyang. He plotted to kill San alongside Princess Hwawan (who he saw as a rival to his sister in the No- Ron faction). After his participation in the plots is discovered, Lord Kim is stripped of his titles and exiled. *Nam Si-cho (played by Maeng Sang-hoon) ‚Äî San's chief eunuch. He follows San everywhere he goes and is very supportive of him. *Chae Je-gong (played by Han In-soo) ‚Äî San's administrative assistant. Chae is also Minister of the Tribunal (in charge of national prisons). When San was a child, Sir Chae was also his tutor. Chae is always of help to San and very supportive of his commands. He is also a trusted adult source of advice to Dae Su, Song-yeon, Hong Guk-yeong, and San. *Yi Cheon/Lee Chun (played by Ji Sang Ryul) ‚Äî a Royal Artist at the Bureau of Painting. He is by far the most supportive person of Song Yeon at the Bureau. He is great at painting erotica and drawing sketches but is otherwise a not-so-extraordinary artist. Yi Cheon is very funny and bubbly and is always trying to keep his wife happy so she doesn't kill him. *Seong Song-wook (Yoo Jung Suk) ‚Äî The younger brother of Seong Song-yeon, he was initially given up for adoption to the family of a physician soon after the death of their parents. Song Wook was later sold off as a slave, although the adoptive family lied and told Song- yeon that he had died young of disease. He was rescued and raised by a group of Catholic converts, who were initially persecuted by the authorities. *Artist Tak Ji Soo (played by Yoo Min Hyuk) ‚Äî Another Royal Artist at the Bureau of Painting. He is by far much more skilled than Yi Chun and becomes good friends with Song Yeon (whom he secretly has a crush on). In the last episode, Tak is promoted to a Senior Artist of the 5th rank. *Yi Hyang (Yi Sun, Ton)/Crown Prince Munhyo (played by Cha Jae-dol) ‚Äî the infant son of King Jeongjo and Seong Song-yeon/Ui-bin Seong who died at the age of four.

This transporter is a major regulator of cellular cholesterol and phospholipid homeostasis.  Tangier disease  It was discovered that a mutation in the ABCA1 protein is responsible for causing Tangier disease by several groups in 1998. Gerd Schmitz's group in Germany and Michael Hayden's group in British Columbia were using standard genetics techniques and DNA from family pedigrees to locate the mutation. Richard Lawn's group at CV Therapeutics in Palo Alto, CA used cDNA microarrays, which were relatively new at the time, to assess gene expression profiles from cell lines created from normal and affected individuals. They showed cell lines from patients with Tangier's disease showed differential regulation of the ABCA1 gene. Subsequent sequencing of the gene identified the mutations. This group received an award from the American Heart Association for their discovery. Tangier disease has been identified in nearly 100 patients worldwide, and patients have a broad range of biochemical and clinical phenotypes as over 100 different mutations have been identified in ABCA1 resulting in the disease.  Function  The membrane-associated protein encoded by this gene is a member of the superfamily of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters. ABC proteins transport various molecules across extra- and intracellular membranes. ABC genes are divided into seven distinct subfamilies (ABCA, MDR/TAP, MRP, ALD, OABP, GCN20, White). This protein is a member of the ABCA subfamily. Members of the ABCA subfamily comprise the only major ABC subfamily found exclusively in multicellular eukaryotes. With cholesterol as its substrate, this protein functions as a cholesterol efflux pump in the cellular lipid removal pathway. While the complete 3D-structure of ABCA1 remains relatively unknown, there has been some determination of the c-terminus. The ABCA1 c-terminus contains a PDZ domain, responsible for mediating protein-protein interactions, as well as a VFVNFA motif essential for lipid efflux activity.  Physiological role  ABCA1 mediates the efflux of cholesterol and phospholipids to lipid-poor apolipoproteins (apoA1 and apoE) (reverse cholesterol transport), which then form nascent high-density lipoproteins (HDL). It also mediates the transport of lipids between Golgi and cell membrane. Since this protein is needed throughout the body it is expressed ubiquitously as a 220 kDa protein. It is present in higher quantities in tissues that shuttle or are involved in the turnover of lipids such as the liver, the small intestine and adipose tissue. Factors that act upon the ABCA1 transporter's expression or its posttranslational modification are also molecules that are involved in its subsequent function like fatty acids, cholesterol and also cytokines and cAMP. Adiponectin induces reverse cholesterol transport by an ABCA1-dependent pathway. Other endogenous metabolites more loosely related to the ABCA1 functions are also reported to influence the expression of this transporter, including glucose and bilirubin. Interactions between members of the apoliprotein family and ABCA1 activate multiple signalling pathways, including the JAK-STAT, PKA, and PKC pathways Overexpression of ABCA1 has been reported to induce resistance to the anti- inflammatory diarylheptanoid antioxidant curcumin. Downregulation of ABCA1 in senescent macrophages disrupts the cell's ability to remove cholesterol from its cytoplasm, leading the cells to promote pathologic atherogenesis (blood vessel thickening/hardening) which \\"plays a central role in common age- associated diseases such as atherosclerosis, cancer, and macular degeneration\\" Knockout mouse models of AMD treated with agonists that increase ABCA1 in loss of function and gain of function experiments demonstrated the protective role of elevating ABCA1 in regulating angiogenesis in eye disease. Human data from patients and controls were used to demonstrate the translation of mouse findings in human disease.http://www.faqs.org/patents/app/20130317090  Clinical significance  Mutations in this gene have been associated with Tangier disease and familial high-density lipoprotein deficiency. ABCA1 has been shown to be reduced in Tangier disease which features physiological deficiencies of HDL. Leukocytes ABCA1 gene expression is upregulated in postmenopausal women receiving hormone replacement therapy (HRP).

Function  The gene, HSP90AA1, encodes the human stress- inducible 90-kDa heat shock protein alpha (Hsp90A). Complemented by the constitutively expressed paralog Hsp90B which shares over 85% amino acid sequence identity, Hsp90A expression is initiated when a cell experiences proteotoxic stress. Once expressed Hsp90A dimers operate as molecular chaperones that bind and fold other proteins into their functional 3-dimensional structures. This molecular chaperoning ability of Hsp90A is driven by a cycle of structural rearrangements fueled by ATP hydrolysis. Current research on Hsp90A focuses in its role as a drug target due to its interaction with a large number of tumor promoting proteins and its role in cellular stress adaptation.  Gene structure  Human HSP90AA1 is encoded on the complement strand of Chromosome 14q32.33 and spans over 59 kbp. Several pseudogenes of HSP90AA1 exist throughout the human genome located on Chromosomes 3, 4, 11 and 14. The HSP90AA1 gene encodes for two distinct mRNA transcripts initiated from separate transcription start sites (TSS). No mRNA splice variants of HSP90AA1 have presently been verified. Transcript variant 1 (TV1, NM_001017963.2) encodes the infrequently observed 854 amino acid isoform 1 of Hsp90A (NP_001017963) from a 3,887 bp mRNA transcript containing 12 exons spanning 59, 012 bp. Transcript variant 1 is located directly next to the WDR20 gene, which is encoded on the opposite coding strand. Transcript variant 2 (TV2, NM_005348.3) encodes the well-studied 732 amino acid isoform 2 (NP_005339) from a 3,366 bp mRNA transcript containing 11 exons spanning 6,438 bp. DYNC1H1 encodes the gene product on the other side of HSP90AA1, which coincidentally has been found to interact with Hsp90A. Hsp90A TV1 and TV2 are identical except for an additional 112 amino acids on the N-terminus of isoform 1 encoded by its first 2 exons. The function of the extended N-terminal domain on isoform 1 is currently not understood. This information was gathered from both NCBI Gene and the UCSC Genome Browser.  Expression  Despite sharing similar amino acid sequence, Hsp90A expression is regulated in a different manner than Hsp90B. Hsp90A is the stress inducible isoform while Hsp90B is expressed constitutively. Several heat shock elements (HSE) are located upstream of Hsp90A allowing for its inducible expression. RNA levels measured in cell lines collected from cancer patients as well as normal tissue can be found at The Human Protein Atlas.  Promoter  Transcription of the HSP90AA1 gene is currently understood to be induced by stress through binding of the master transcription factor (TF) HSF1 to the HSP90AA1 promoter. However, several focused studies of the HSP90AA1 promoter along with extensive global analysis of the human genome indicate that various other transcription complexes regulate HSP90AA1 gene expression. Mammalian HSP90AA1 along with HSP90AB1 gene expression was first characterized in transformed mouse cells where it was shown that HSP90AB1 is constitutively expressed 2.5-fold higher than HSP90AA1 under normal conditions. However upon heat shock, HSP90AA1 expression increased 7.0-fold while HSP90AB1 increases only 4.5-fold. Detailed analysis of the HSP90AA1 promoter shows that there are 2 heat shock elements (HSE) within 1200 bp of the transcription start site. The distal HSE is required for heat shock induction and the proximal HSE functions as a permissive enhancer. This model is supported by ChIP-SEQ analysis of cells under normal conditions where HSF1 is found bound to the proximal HSE and not detected at the distal HSE. The proto-oncogene MYC is also found to induce HSP90AA1 gene expression and binds proximally to the TSS as verified by ChIP- SEQ. Depletion of Hsp90A expression indicates that HSP90AA1 is required for MYC-driven transformation. In breast cancer cells the growth hormone prolactin induces HSP90AA1 expression through STAT5. NF-Œ∫B or RELA also induces HSP90AA1 expression possibly explaining the pro-survival ability of NF-Œ∫B-driven transcription. Conversely, STAT1, the proto-tumor suppressor, is found to inhibit stress induced expression of HSP90AA1. In addition to these findings, ChIP-SEQ analysis of the human genome indicates that at least 85 unique TFs bind to the RNA polymerase II (POLR2A) footprints associated with the promoter regions that drive the expression of both HSP90AA1 transcript variants. This indicates that HSP90AA1 gene expression may be highly regulated and complex.  Interactome  Combined, Hsp90A and Hsp90B are predicted to interact with 10% of the eukaryotic proteome. In humans this represents a network of roughly 2,000 interacting proteins. Presently over 725 interactions have been experimentally documented for both HSP90A and Hsp90B. This connectivity allows Hsp90 to function as a network hub linking diverse protein interaction networks. Within these networks Hsp90 primarily specializes in maintaining and regulating proteins involved in signal transduction or information processing. These include transcription factors that initiate gene expression, kinases that transmit information by post-translationally modifying other proteins and E3-ligases that target proteins for degradation via the proteosome. Indeed, a recent study utilizing the LUMIER method has shown that human Hsp90B interacts with 7% of all transcription factors, 60% of all kinases and 30% of all E3-ligases. Other studies have shown that Hsp90 interacts with various structural proteins, ribosomal components and metabolic enzymes. Hsp90 has also been found to interact with a large number of viral proteins including those from HIV and EBOLA. This is not to mention the numerous co-chaperones that modulate and direct HSP90 activity. Few studies have focused on discerning the unique protein interactions between Hsp90A and HSP90B. Work done in Xenopus eggs and yeast has shown that Hsp90A and Hsp90B differ in co- chaperone and client interactions. However, little is understood concerning the unique functions delegated to each human paralog. The Picard lab has aggregated all available Hsp90 interaction data into the Hsp90Int.DB website. Gene ontology analysis of both Hsp90A and Hsp90B interactomes indicate that each paralogs is associated with unique biological processes, molecular functions and cellular components. Heat shock protein 90kDa alpha (cytosolic), member A1 has been shown to interact with: * AHSA1, * AKT1, * AR, * C-Raf, * CDC37, * DAP3, * EPRS, * ERN1, * ESR1 * FKBP5, * GNA12, * GUCY1B3, * HER2/neu, * HSF1, * Hop, * NOS3, * NR3C1, * P53, * PIM1, * PPARA, * SMYD3, * STK11, * TGFBR1, * TGFBR2, and * TERT. Post-translational modifications Post- translational modifications have a large impact on Hsp90 regulation. Phosphorylation, acetylation, S-nitrosylation, oxidation and ubiquitination are ways in which Hsp90 is modified in order to modulate its many functions. A summary of these sites can be found at PhosphoSitePlus. Many of these sites are conserved between Hsp90A and Hsp90B. However, there are a few distinctions between the two that allow for specific functions to be performed by Hsp90A. Phosphorylation of Hsp90 has been shown to have affect its binding to clients, co-chaperones and nucleotide. Specific phosphorylation of Hsp90A residues have been shown to occur. These unique phosphorylation sites signal Hsp90A for functions such as secretion, allow it to locate to regions of DNA damage and interact with specific co-chaperones. Hyperacetylation also occurs with Hsp90A which leading to its secretion and increased cancer invasiveness.  Clinical significance  Expression of Hsp90A also correlates with disease prognosis. Increased levels of Hsp90A are found in leukemia, breast and pancreatic cancers as well as in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). In human T-cells, HSP90AA1 expression is increased by the cytokines IL-2, IL-4 and IL-13. HSP90, alongside other conserved chaperones and co- chaperones that interact to safeguard proteostasis, is repressed in aging human brains. This repression was found to be further exacerbated in the brains of patients with age-onset neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's or Huntington's disease. = Cancer = Over the last two decades HSP90 has emerged as an intriguing target in the war on cancer. HSP90 interacts and supports numerous proteins that promote oncogenesis, thus distinguishing Hsp90 as a cancer enabler as it is regarded as essential for malignant transformation and progression. Moreover, through their extensive interactomes, both paralogs are associated with each hallmark of cancer. The HSP90AA1 gene however is not altered in a majority of tumors according to The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Currently bladder cancer is found to have the largest number of alterations followed by pancreatic cancer. This may not come as a surprise since overall Hsp90 expression levels are held at such a high level compared to most all other proteins within the cell., therefore further increasing Hsp90 levels may not provide any benefit to cancer growth. Additionally, whole genome sequencing across all tumor types and cancer cell lines reveals that there are presently 115 different mutations within the HSP90AA1 open reading frame. The effects of these mutations on HSP90A function, however, remain unknown. Remarkably, in a number of tumors the HSP90AA1 gene is homozygously deleted, suggesting that these tumors may have a reduced level of malignancy. This is supported by a comparative genome-wide analysis of 206 gastric cancer patients that reported loss of HSP90AA1 is indeed associated with favorable outcomes after surgery alone. This supports the possibility that the absence of Hsp90A in tumor biopsies may serve as a biomarker for positive clinical outcomes. Biologically, Hsp90A differs from Hsp90B in that Hsp90A is presently understood to function as a secreted extracellular agent in wound healing and inflammation in addition to its intracellular roles. These two processes are often hijacked by cancer allowing for malignant cell motility, metastasis and extravasion. Current research in prostate cancer indicates that extracellular Hsp90A transduces signals that promote the chronic inflammation of cancer-associated fibroblasts. This reprogramming of the extracellular milieu surrounding malignant adenocarcinoma cells is understood to stimulate prostate cancer progression. Extracellular HSP90A induces inflammation through the activation of the NF-Œ∫B (RELA) and STAT3 transcription programs that include the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-8. Coincidentally NF-Œ∫B also induces expression Hsp90A., thus providing a model where newly expressed Hsp90A would also be secreted from the stimulated fibroblast thereby creating positive autocrine and paracrine feedback loops resulting in an inflammatory storm at the site of malignancy. This concept requires further attention as it may explain the correlation of increased levels of Hsp90A in the plasma of patients with advanced stages of malignancy. = Hsp90 Inhibitors = Hsp90 is exploited by cancer cells to support activated oncoproteins, including many kinases and transcription factors. These clients are often mutated, amplified or translocated in malignancy, and Hsp90 works to buffer these cellular stresses induced by malignant transformation. Inhibition of Hsp90 leads to the degradation or instability of many of its client proteins. Thus, Hsp90 has become an attractive target for cancer therapy. As with all ATPases, ATP binding and hydrolysis is essential for the chaperoning function of Hsp90 in vivo. Hsp90 inhibitors interfere with this cycle at its early stages by replacing ATP, leading to the regulated ubiquitination and proteasome-mediated degradation of most client proteins. As such, the nucleotide binding pocket remains that most amenable to inhibitor generation. To date, there are 23 active Hsp90 inhibitor oncology trials, and 13 HSP90 inhibitors are currently undergoing clinical evaluation in cancer patients, 10 of which have entered the clinic in the past few years. While the N-terminal nucleotide-binding pocket of Hsp90 is most widely studied and thus targeted, recent studies have suggested that a second ATP-binding site is located in the Hsp90 C-terminus. Targeting of this region has resulted in specific reduced Hsp90-hormone interactions and has been shown to influence Hsp90 nucleotide binding. Although none of the C-terminal Hsp90 inhibitors have yet to enter the clinic, the use of both N- and C-terminal Hsp90 inhibitors in combination represents an exciting new strategy for chemotherapy. Although many of the afore-mentioned inhibitors share the same Hsp90 binding site (either N- or C-terminal), it has been shown that some of these drugs preferentially access distinct Hsp90 populations, which are differentiated by the extent of their post-translational modification. Though no published inhibitor has yet to distinguish between Hsp90A and Hsp90B, a recent study has shown that phosphorylation of a particular residue in the Hsp90 N-terminus can provide isoform specificity to inhibitor binding., thus providing an additional level of regulation for optimal Hsp90 targeting.

This zone acts as a natural input of marine resources into a terrestrial system, providing food and habitat for a variety of coastal organisms.  Physical characteristics  The wrack zone is most commonly associated with a sandy beach habitat but can also be present in rocky shores, mangroves, salt marshes, and other coastal systems. Debris is carried up the intertidal zone as the tide comes in, and is deposited on the sand when the tide goes out. The zone can be recognized as a linear patch of debris toward the upper part of a beach running parallel to the water's edge. The location of the wrack zone varies geographically and temporally. It is found at a higher elevation during spring tides compared to neap tides. The size of a beach and its intertidal zone will influence the location of wrack deposition. Additionally, storms will often increase the volume of debris that is deposited. The wrack zone may be composed of a variety of materials, both organic and inorganic. A common organic component is seaweed, such as kelp, which easily floats to coastal waters after being dislodged by its holdfast or otherwise torn by wave action and animal activity. Other organic components may include seagrasses, terrestrial plants, driftwood, and stranded animal remains. Common inorganic components include plastics, fishing line, and other manmade materials.  Ecology  Sanderling (Calidris alba) feeding in the wrack zone Role in coastal food webs Organic debris that accumulates in the wrack zone is considered a cross-boundary subsidy, linking the marine system to the terrestrial system by providing resources that form the base of coastal food webs. Terrestrial invertebrates such as isopods, amphipods, polychaetes, and shore flies feed on seaweed and other dead material. These invertebrates provide food for shore birds and other predators on the beach. In addition, when organic debris decomposes, it delivers nutrients to the soil, promoting the growth of coastal vegetation. Role in habitat formation The wrack zone adds structure to the beach landscape, providing habitat for animals that live there. For example, rove beetles burrow in the wet sand below the wrack zone, benefiting from moist conditions and the availability of herbivorous invertebrate prey species. Kelp flies like Coelopa pilipes rely on washed up kelp in wrack zones for food, shelter, and oviposition. Additionally, the wrack zone plays a role in the formation of dunes by promoting the accumulation of wind-blown sand.  Human impacts  Albatross carcass with marine debris at Eastern Island, Midway AtollInorganic debris Manmade objects are often washed ashore in the wrack zone, posing a threat to coastal animals. Plastics in particular are the most common form of litter found on beaches, and it is estimated that 46% of shorebirds ingest plastic in their lifetime while 26% experience entanglement. A variety of effects have been observed in animals that ingest plastic, including reduced reproductive success, changes in immune function, and increased mortality. There is also growing evidence suggesting that plastic bioaccumulates through the food web, so predators may be affected by the accumulation of plastic in their prey's diet. =Beach raking= Sandy beaches are often groomed for aesthetic and recreational value. The removal of organic debris limits habitat and food availability for wrack-associated animals and inhibits the formation of dunes. =Shoreline hardening= Sea walls and other coastal armoring structures can affect the location of a wrack zone and reduce the accumulation of organic material. This can negatively impact the structure and diversity of coastal habitats.

A new, Palladio-influenced fa√ßade by Giuseppe Valadier was built in 1832. Initially male only, a maternity wing for women from the Tiber barges was later added to the hospital and, over time, the hospital as a whole came to be used principally by unmarried mothers. Patients who did not wish to give their name had a wing set aside for them, and they were even allowed to wear veils to ensure their anonymity. The hospital was closed at the start of the 20th century and in the 1930s it was demolished for excavations on the Mausoleum, though the church remains and holds various paintings, including one of the Nativity and one of St Martin of Tours dividing his cloak, a Baroque altarpiece by Il Baciccia (to be seen in the sacristy), and a carved organ case.

The match between the two national teams was billed as ‚ÄòUnited States of America versus the British Empire's Canadian Province‚Äô. The match took place between 24 and 26 September 1844 at the St George's Cricket Club's ground at what is now 30th Street and Broadway (then Bloomingdales) in Manhattan. Canada won by 23 runs. On the first day, there were from 5,000 to 20,000 spectators and an estimated $100,000 to $120,000 worth of bets were placed on the match. Background The origins of the match began four years earlier when a team from the St George's Club turned up in Toronto, almost destitute after a long journey by stage coach through New York State, and across Lake Ontario by steamer. A Mr. Phillpotts had invited St George's to play the Toronto Cricket Club at home, but when the 18 men arrived on 28 August 1840, the Canadians were not expecting them. It was discovered that the \\"Mr. Philpotts\\" who had arranged the match was not the Toronto club's Secretary, George A. Phillpotts, but rather an imposter. Despite the hoax invitation, a cricket match was hastily arranged, which was attended by a good number of spectators, a brass band and Sir George Arthur, the Governor of Upper Canada. The New Yorker Club won by 10 wickets, and left on such good terms that they invited the Canadians down for what was to be the first cricket match between national teams rather than local club teams. Match The US team was drawn from clubs in Philadelphia, Washington, DC and Boston, as well as a number in New York. Likewise, the Canadians tried to present a representative national team, rather than simply the Toronto CC team. Whether or not the Canadians managed to actually make it a cross-Canada national team is unclear but letters written between the clubs indicate the Canadian team may have included players from the Guelph Cricket Club and Upper Canada College Club as well as the Toronto club. Advertisements and posters for the game found in libraries have the game between the USA and Canada, rather than two city teams. The game was scheduled for two days and the score after the first day saw Canada post 82, with the USA being 61 for 9 in reply. On the second day, bad weather prevented play, so the game was extended to a third day when the USA were all out for 64 and Canada scored 63 in their second innings, setting the USA 82 runs to win. Canada bowled the USA for 58, winning by 23 runs. The US player Wheatcroft arrived too late on the third day and was replaced in the field by Alfred Marsh, who did not bat. Match details Legacy In 1845, a return match was arranged at McGill University, Montreal, and the fixture, known as the Auty Cup, has been played sporadically ever since.

The interior of the dome at its highest reaches a height of 40 meters. It provides an area of 5,646 square metres, offering by a variable grandstand system space for up to 8,500 people (together with the two tiers) seated, and 13,500 people unseated.  History  =Opening in 1909= At the end of the 19th century, the Frankfurt fair was held in various facilities. Frequently it was housed in the Hippodrome in Sachsenhausen (the quarters located south of the river Main), while at other times it was held in single-use pavilions. After a time many felt the city needed a dedicated exhibition hall. A competition was advertised, and the plans of the Marburg architect Friedrich von Thiersch made the short list of finalists. After several amendments, von Thiersch's concept was widely accepted. Construction began on 11 June 1907. On 19 May 1909, it was officially opened by Kaiser Wilhelm II. At the time of its completion, the Festhalle was the largest dome in Europe. The German Gymnastics Festival and the International Air Show, were the first events in the new building. In 1914, at the outbreak of the First World War, the banquet hall was turned into a camp for soldiers. After the war the hall reverted to its original purpose. =9 November 1938 and Second World War= On the night of 8 to 9 November 1938, during the November pogroms hundreds of Frankfurt's Jewish citizens were driven across the city centre to the Festhalle and some were seriously mistreated. The noted Frankfurt Opera singer Hans Erl was forced to sing \\"In Diesen Heil'gen Hallen\\" (\\"In These Holy Halls\\"). From here, the first mass transports went into the Nazi concentration camps. The Festhalle is thus of considerable relevance for the Holocaust. The Frankfurt physician and Holocaust survivor Dr. Max Kirschner describes the deportation in his memoirs. Since 1991, a plaque displayed in the rotunda bears remembrance of this dark spot in history. During the Second World War, the hall was used for the storage of uniforms of the armed forces. On 18 December 1940, textiles started a fire and put severe fire damage to the hall; whether to have been an act of arson, is unclear. Bombing by the Allied Forces damaged the Frankfurt Festhalle further. =The Postwar Period= After the Second World War thoughts appeared to demolish the hall, but the citizens of Frankfurt and their Mayor Walter Kolb prevented this. So makeshift repairs were enacted. Led Zeppelin were the first rock band to headline the hall in July 1970. During the 1980s, extensive modernizations, such as the installation of air conditioning were implemented. Pink Floyd performed there on 20 and 21 June 1989 as part of their A Momentary Lapse of Reason Tour. The Grateful Dead played the Festhalle on 22 October as part of their European Fall 1990 tour. =The Festhalle today= Festhalle Frankfurt in 2007 Today, the hall is serving again as an exhibition hall and is a popular venue for concerts by numerous prominent artists. During the International Motor Show Daimler AG traditionally occupies the Festhalle for the presentation of their Mercedes-Benz motor cars. In the first half of the 1990s the ATP World Championship was carried out in the banquet hall. The MTV Europe Music Awards were held in the Festhalle in 2001 and 2012. In 2004 and 2007 the World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) hosted some major live shows there. Footage of Depeche Mode's show at this venue on 21 July 1993, is included on their video release Devotional. On 13 April 2002, Irish vocal pop band Westlife held a concert for their World of Our Own Tour supporting their album World of Our Own. On 24 September 2004 Canadian rock trio Rush recorded their R30: 30th Anniversary World Tour DVD at this venue. On 28 June 2009 the centennial anniversary of the Festhalle was celebrated by a doors open day. The Festhalle recently was being extensively renovated. In the bars on the window sills, windows and ventilation shafts were re-fitted with the originally existing gold leaf. Cupolas on the towers that had not been reconstructed after the war have been rebuilt. The paint was changed from white to the pristine bright ocher.  Architecture  The Festhalle is one of the most important buildings of the late historicism. The architect's aim was to create the splendor of the neo-baroque style, the hall is a worthy representative of a fair city building of its day. The rectangular layout is superimposed by a cupola-crowned rotunda, which makes a contrast to the majestic architecture of the lower part. The Festival Hall was an archetype for many subsequent halls, particularly the dome was often imitated. The most famous example is the Centennial Hall in Wroc≈Çaw by Max Berg.

The creation of the parish 72 years ago on a 3, 964 sq. m donated lot on the former 11th Avenue, now known as St. Eugene de Mazenod Avenue marked the beginning of the evangelization of the Missionary Congregation in the heart of Caloocan City. Our Lady of Grace Parish commenced when the Archbishop of Manila, Most Rev. Michael J. O‚Äô Doherty, granted the request of the OMI Superior in the Philippines, Rev. Fr. Gerard Mongeau, to establish a house in Grace Park. The Philippine Realty Corporation, administrators of the Grace Park Subdivision, donated the use of eight lots in Block 171 for the church. With the help of the U.S. Signal Corps, a temporary chapel was built. The first Eucharistic Celebration was done on May 16, 1946, by Rev. Fr. Joseph F. Boyd, OMI, attended by thirty‚Äìfive people. But as early as mid‚Äì1949, just three years after the inauguration of the church, the need for a bigger space was seen. In response to this necessity, the people of Grace Park launched a fund‚Äìraising campaign. After two years, a new church was ready to be blessed by the Archbishop of Manila, Rev. Msgr. Gabriel Reyes. The church co-patron is St. Eugene de Mazenod and the feast of Our Lady of Grace is observed every first Sunday of May. =Switzerland= *Bellinzona, Canton Ticino : A late fifteenth-century church which was attached to a Franciscan convent.Bellinzona Turismo, Church of S.

Another statue sculpted from wood by Mariano Gerada could be found in ≈ªabbar a Maltese town dedicated to Our Lady of Graces, Il-Madonna tal-Grazzja, as known by the locals. Festivals Festivals to her are again celebrated in many places. In Italy one of the most famous is at Catenanuova. In Stamford, Connecticut she is celebrated by emigrants from Minturno. In the Maltese Islands at ≈ªabbar and Victoria the feast is celebrated on the first Sunday after 8 September every year and is the last feast of the Summer season.

While with Oswestry Town he won international honours for Wales, on 23 February 1889 in a 4‚Äì1 defeat to England. A report of the match said that Hallam \\"showed great speed but was evidently nervous and hesitated too much\\". In 1890, he moved to Small Heath, then playing in the Football Alliance, and made more than 150 appearances for the club in all competitions. The strength of Hallam's game lay in his speed, and he formed fine partnerships on the right side with both Charlie Short and Billy Walton. In Small Heath's first Football League season, they won the inaugural Second Division championship; Hallam contributed 17 goals, and was only outscored by future England international Fred Wheldon.Matthews, Complete Record, p. 141.

A Voronoi tessellation is called centroidal when the generating point of each Voronoi cell is also its centroid, i.e. the arithmetic mean or center of mass. It can be viewed as an optimal partition corresponding to an optimal distribution of generators. A number of algorithms can be used to generate centroidal Voronoi tessellations, including Lloyd's algorithm for K-means clustering or Quasi-Newton methods like BFGS. Proofs Gersho's conjecture, proven for one and two dimensions, says that \\"asymptotically speaking, all cells of the optimal CVT, while forming a tessellation, are congruent to a basic cell which depends on the dimension.\\" In two dimensions, the basic cell for the optimal CVT is a regular hexagon as it is proven to be the most dense packing of circles in 2D Euclidean space. Its three dimensional equivalent is the rhombic dodecahedral honeycomb, derived from the most dense packing of spheres in 3D Euclidean space. Applications Centroidal Voronoi tessellations are useful in data compression, optimal quadrature, optimal quantization, clustering, and optimal mesh generation.. A weighted centroidal Voronoi diagrams is a CVT in which each centroid is weighted according to a certain function. For example, a grayscale image can be used as a density function to weight the points of a CVT, as a way to create digital stippling.Secord, Adrian. \\"Weighted voronoi stippling.\\" Proceedings of the 2nd international symposium on Non- photorealistic animation and rendering.

Morgan (October 9, 1870 ‚Äì 1969) was a Maine folk artist. Early life George Eugene Morgan was born to George William and Vesta Rowena Farnham Morgan of Chelsea (three and a half miles west of Gardiner, Maine). As a young man and as most in the area, Morgan found work along the Kennebec, first in Augusta with a furniture maker, then for many years as a harness maker, and then for even more years he worked in the shoe factories of Gardiner (Commonwealth Shoe Company and then R. P. Hazzard Company). He was ranked a sergeant in the Maine Militia and when World War I broke out, Morgan already forty-seven was deemed too old for service. He married twice and had five children. Artistic career In the spring of 1962, Morgan was ninety- one years old and living in a rest home in Gardiner. Morgan was not one to sit idle and though sketching on paper and cardboard occupied him for some time, he ached for something more. Word got out and apparently through some connection at the home, Morgan was introduced to a local folk art and antiques dealer, Anne Wardwell of Farmingdale. When Wardwell met Morgan she must have seen something that inspired her. In the words of Howard Rose, from Unexpected Eloquence, \\"Mrs. Wardwell seems to have had one of the great prophetic eyes in dealerdom.\\" Wardwell became his benefactor or more so his enabler, providing him with brushes, paints, turpentine and canvas boards. Over the next eighteen months Morgan created twenty plus remarkable memory paintings. A number of factors come to play as to why Morgan chose the subjects that he did and how he painted them‚Äîthe bicentennial of Hallowell (which fueled a desire to see the Kennebec River towns for what they once were), his age (an old mind best remembers events and details of one's youth than of the more recent), a lack of mobility (living in a rest home and having an indifference to car travel limited his ability to paint these towns en plein air), and though it is usually said of writing, it could be inferred that he thought of the adage, \\"write [paint] what you know.\\" As a resident of Kennebec County for nearly one hundred years, Morgan knew the environs of Hallowell, Gardiner and Randolph better than anyone alive. It is true that for most the immediate attraction to Morgan's work is the folky sense of perspective and his color sense. However, one is taken in well beyond this initial blush. His works combine an innate formal grasp of composition with complex definitions of area and space, color, and balance‚Äîas well as a terrific sense of engagement and detachment. Old Covered Bridge between Randolph and Gardiner, George E. Morgan, Old Covered Bridge between Randolph and Gardiner, July 1962, Oil on paper, 10\\" √ó 14\\" his earliest dated work, reveals a sophisticated hold on translating a large scale real-world geographical area into a small two-dimensional space. The broadly defined spaces of color and short perspective remind us of another artist working in Maine, Milton Avery. Or even a Diebenkorn. The same applies for Moulton Mill, and Ice Houses on the Kennebec River. The topography is delineated in broad shapes and laid out in colors that work in a formal sense, not necessarily in a real-world sense. Accuracy did not trump color or compositional balance. Representational artists even have to lie a little. The body of Morgan's work is best and most often described as \\"map-like\\". His townscapes and depictions of local landmarks are often seen from overhead and/or from a high-vantage point. They provide for us, almost literally, a road-map of these towns as they were at the turn of the twentieth century. The three works, Hallowell: View of Lower Water Street, Freshet 1923 , Bridge Dividing Kennebec River, done in a flourish in just two months (June and July 1963) are arguably his most complex, finest and accessible works. In each, Morgan precisely tries to work out the perspective (a ruler was always at hand), however it is never (academically) correct. In the essay, \\"Mapping as a Cultural Universal\\", the authors assert that \\"to communicate...mapmakers distort...distortions from accepted veridicality may be the result of attempts to increase the map's informational value.\\" Though Morgan's unconventional perspective is incorrect, it is more informative‚Äîshowing us spaces and details of buildings that we would not otherwise see.

There are two types of channels, vertical (between full backs and their closest centre back), and horizontal (between defence, midfield, and attack). Vertical channels The channels are subjectively described (there is no specific marking of the pitch) as the areas in which wide-playing strikers look to receive the ball, being a vertical strip extending from the halfway line to the goal line, and close to, but not too near the edge of the pitch, just inside the touchline, an area more commonly occupied by a winger. By receiving the ball in the channel, a striker hopes to confuse the opposing defence, as he is between the full-back and centre-back, and makes them unsure as to who should mark or close down the striker, this thinking time allows the striker more time on the ball, and also distracts the defence from other players who are making runs. Horizontal channels These channels are the areas created between the defence and midfield (usually occupied by that team's defensive midfielder/anchor man, or the opposition's advanced playmaker/deep lying forward), and midfield and attack (usually occupied by that team's advanced playmaker/deep playing forward, or the opposition's defensive midfielder/anchor man). Formations that usually create these channels are the 4‚Äì4‚Äì2, 5‚Äì4‚Äì1, 5‚Äì3‚Äì2. In modern times, formations have been developed to cancel out these channels, examples of these formations include the 4‚Äì2‚Äì3‚Äì1, 4‚Äì3‚Äì2‚Äì1, 4‚Äì4‚Äì2 diamond. An example of the use of this is the FC Barcelona team, who use a fluid (meaning the players are free to move around and exchange positions) 4‚Äì3‚Äì3 formation to use the channels created by the oppositions formation to gain an advantage, e.g. Xavi with the ball in midfield, passing to one of the front three players who start either in the oppositions defensive zone, and drops back towards his midfield, or starting in the oppositions midfield zone, and moves forward. Barcelona's formation, as well as taking advantage of opposition's channels, also looks to cancel out the chance of their own team creating them, with the use of Sergio Busquets as a defensive midfielder, who looks to occupy the space between his back four and midfield three.

She was used by the Union Navy as a gunboat assigned to patrol Confederate waterways. Hastings, a small wooden gunboat, was built as Emma Duncan in 1860 at Monongahela, Pennsylvania, and operated as a river transport out of Cincinnati, Ohio. She was purchased at Cairo, Illinois, in March 1863 from J. Bachelor. Fitted out and ready for service in April; her first commanding officer was Acting Master W. N. Griswold. Rear Admiral David Dixon Porter recommended that her name be changed to Hastings 7 April 1863.  Hastings receives battle damage in Confederate waterways  One of the group of lightly built steamers which bore the brunt of the war on the Mississippi River tributaries, Hastings was initially assigned to the Tennessee River. While steaming upriver to report for duty, she received her baptism of fire when attacked by Confederate guerrillas near Green Bottom Bar 24 April. Captain Griswold rounded to and engaged the Confederates for a time, after which they withdrew. The light gunboat was hulled seven times and suffered three casualties in the action.  Assisting General Sherman‚Äôs march  Hastings then assumed duty as a convoy ship for Union Army transports on the Tennessee River. In May she was sent briefly for duty at the mouth of the Yazoo River, but was soon back on the Tennessee. She arrived in Eastport, Mississippi, 26 October 1863 to assist General William Tecumseh Sherman's troops in crossing the river during operations culminating in the Third Battle of Chattanooga, and steamed to Paducah, Kentucky, when that city was threatened by Confederate cavalry 8 November. In need of repairs, Hastings returned to the Naval Station at Cairo, Illinois, 16 December.  Louisiana operations in support of General Kilby Smith  Hastings resumed active patrolling in April 1864, and was detailed to convoy General Thomas Kilby Smith's transports from Springfield Landing to Grand Ecore, Louisiana. Union troops had suffered defeat at the Battle of Pleasant Hill, and the land portion of the Red River Campaign was deemed a failure. Covering the withdrawal of Smith's troops, Hastings took part 12 April in an engagement with Confederate cavalry and artillery near Blair's Landing. After a fierce engagement, in which Hastings fought at the rear of the transport group, the convoy passed downriver.  Action at Fort Pillow, Tennessee  As the pace of Confederate attacks in Tennessee heightened, Hastings was sent to Fort Pillow, Tennessee, to protect it from capture, but was unable to get there in time to help the surrounded city and give assistance to , the only gunboat present. Arriving 14 April, however, Hastings shelled the woods in the area of the city. During this period, the veteran gunboat was acting as flagship for the resourceful commander of the 7th District, Mississippi Squadron, Lt. Comdr. S. L. Phelps. Subsequently, she operated in the White River, and in June 1864 cooperated with Major General Frederick Steele in his efforts to corner and defeat Confederate cavalry in the Tennessee and White River areas. Hastings patrolled the river, gained intelligence, and convoyed troops in cooperation with the Army. The gunboat continued her service on the tributaries of the Mississippi River until returning to Cairo, Illinois, early in 1865.  Post- war decommissioning, sale, and civilian career  She decommissioned 7 July 1865 and was sold at Mound City, Illinois, 17 August 1865 to Henry H. Semmes. Hastings was subsequently redocumented Dora in October 1865 and served as a river freighter until 1872.

The aim of such efforts is to eradicate cancer as a major cause of death. The signing of the National Cancer Act of 1971 by United States president Richard Nixon is generally viewed as the beginning of this effort, though it was not described as a \\"war\\" in the legislation itself. Despite significant progress in the treatment of certain forms of cancer (such as childhood leukemia), cancer in general remains a major cause of death 40+ years after this war on cancer began, leading to a perceived lack of progressThe War on Cancer A Progress Report for Skeptics Skeptical Inquirer, Volume 34.1, January / February 2010 and to new legislation aimed at augmenting the original National Cancer Act of 1971. New research directions, in part based on the results of the Human Genome Project, hold promise for a better understanding of the genetic factors underlying cancer, and the development of new diagnostics, therapies, preventive measures, and early detection ability. However, targeting cancer proteins can be difficult, as a protein can be undruggable.  History  = National Cancer Act of 1971 = The war on cancer began with the National Cancer Act of 1971, a United States federal law. The act was intended \\"to amend the Public Health Service Act so as to strengthen the National Cancer Institute in order to more effectively carry out the national effort against cancer\\". It was signed into law by President Nixon on December 23, 1971. Health activist and philanthropist Mary Lasker was instrumental in persuading the United States Congress to pass the National Cancer Act. She and her husband Albert Lasker were strong supporters of medical research. They established the Lasker Foundation which awarded people for their research. In the year of 1943, Mary Lasker began changing the American Cancer Society to get more funding for research. Five years later she contributed to getting federal funding for the National Cancer Institute and the National Heart Institute. In 1946 the funding was around $2.8 million and had grown to over $1.4 billion by 1972. In addition to all of these accomplishments, Mary became the president of the Lasker Foundation due to the death of her husband in 1952. Lasker's devotion to medical research and experience in the field eventually contributed to the passing of the National Cancer Act. The improved funding for cancer research has been quite beneficial over the last 40 years. In 1971, the number of survivors in the U.S. was 3 million and as of 2007 has increased to more than 12 million. = NCI Director's Challenge = In 2003, Andrew von Eschenbach, the director of the National Cancer Institute (who served as FDA Commissioner from 2006-2009 and is now a Director at biotechnology company BioTime) issued a challenge \\"to eliminate the suffering and death from cancer, and to do so by 2015\\". This was supported by the American Association for Cancer Research in 2005 though some scientists felt this goal was impossible to reach and undermined von Eschenbach's credibility. John E. Niederhuber, who succeeded Andrew von Eschenbach as NCI director, noted that cancer is a global health crisis, with 12.9 million new cases diagnosed in 2009 worldwide and that by 2030, this number could rise to 27 million including 17 million deaths \\"unless we take more pressing action.\\" Harold Varmus, former director of the NIH and director of the NCI from 2010 to 2015, held a town hall meeting in 2010 in which he outlined his priorities for improving the cancer research program, including the following: # reforming the clinical trials system, # improving utilization of the NIH clinical center (Mark O. Hatfield Clinical Research Center), # readjusting the drug approval and regulation processes, # improving cancer treatment and prevention, and # formulating new, more specific and science-based questions. = Renewed focus on cancer = Recent years have seen an increased perception of a lack of progress in the war on cancer, and renewed motivation to confront the disease. On July 15, 2008, the United States Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions convened a panel discussion titled, Cancer: Challenges and Opportunities in the 21st Century. It included interviews with noted cancer survivors such as Arlen Specter, Elizabeth Edwards and Lance Armstrong, who came out of retirement in 2008, returning to competitive cycling \\"to raise awareness of the global cancer burden.\\" =Livestrong Foundation= The Livestrong Foundation created the Livestrong Global Cancer Campaign to address the burden of cancer worldwide and encourage nations to make commitments to battle the disease and provide better access to care. In April 2009, the foundation announced that the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan pledged $300 million to fund three important cancer control initiatives ‚Äì building a cutting-edge cancer treatment and research facility, developing a national cancer control plan and creating an Office of Advocacy and Survivorship. The Livestrong Foundation encourages similar commitments from other nations to combat the disease. Livestrong Day is an annual event established by the LAF to serve as \\"a global day of action to raise awareness about the fight against cancer.\\" Individuals from around the world are encouraged to host cancer-oriented events in their local communities and then register their events with the Livestrong website. =21st Century Cancer Access to Life-Saving Early detection, Research and Treatment (ALERT) Act= The US Senate on 26 March 2009 issued a new bill (S. 717), the 21st Century Cancer Access to Life-Saving Early detection, Research and Treatment (ALERT) Act intended to \\"overhaul the 1971 National Cancer Act.\\" The bill aims to improve patient access to prevention and early detection by: # providing funding for research in early detection, # supplying grants for screening and referrals for treatment, and # increasing access to clinical trials and information. =Obama-Biden Plan to Combat Cancer= During their 2008 U.S. presidential campaign then Senators Barack Obama and Joe Biden published a plan to combat cancer that entailed doubling \\"federal funding for cancer research within 5 years, focusing on NIH and NCI\\" as well as working \\"with Congress to increase funding for the Food and Drug Administration.\\" Their plan would provide additional funding for: * research on rare cancers and those without effective treatment options, * the study of health disparities and evaluation of possible interventions, * and efforts to better understand genetic factors that can impact cancer onset and outcomes. President Obama's 2009 economic stimulus package includes $10 billion for the NIH, which funds much of the cancer research in the U.S., and he has pledged to increase federal funding for cancer research by a third for the next two years as part of a drive to find \\"a cure for cancer in our time.\\" In a message published in the July 2009 issue of Harper's Bazaar, President Obama described his mother's battle with ovarian cancer and, noting the additional funding his administration has slated for cancer research, stated: \\"Now is the time to commit ourselves to waging a war against cancer as aggressive as the war cancer wages against us.\\" On 30 September 2009, Obama announced that $1 billion of a $5 billion medical research spending plan would be earmarked for research into the genetic causes of cancer and targeted cancer treatments. Cancer-related federal spending of money from the 2009 Recovery Act can be tracked online. =World Cancer Campaign= The International Union Against Cancer (UICC) has organized a World Cancer campaign in 2009 with the theme, \\"I love my healthy active childhood,\\" to promote healthy habits in children and thereby reduce their lifestyle-based cancer risk as adults. The World Health Organization is also promoting this campaign and joins with the UICC in annually promoting World Cancer Day on 4 February.  Progress  Though there has been significant progress in the understanding of cancer biology, risk factors, treatments, and prognosis of some types of cancer (such as childhood leukemia) since the inception of the National Cancer Act of 1971, progress in reducing the overall cancer mortality rate has been disappointing. Many types of cancer remain largely incurable (such as pancreatic cancer) and the overall death rate from cancer has not decreased appreciably since the 1970s. The death rate for cancer in the U.S., adjusted for population size and age, dropped only 5 percent from 1950 to 2005. As of 2012, WHO reported 8.2 million annual deaths from cancer Heart disease (including both Ischaemic and hypertensive) accounted for 8.5 million annual deaths. Stroke accounted for 6.7 million annual deaths. There is evidence for progress in reducing cancer mortality. Age-specific analysis of cancer mortality rates has had progress in reducing cancer mortality in the United States since 1955. An August 2009 study found that age-specific cancer mortality rates have been steadily declining since the early 1950s for individuals born since 1925, with the youngest age groups experiencing the steepest decline in mortality rate at 25.9 percent per decade, and the oldest age groups experiencing a 6.8 percent per decade decline. Dr. Eric Kort, the lead author of this study, claims that public reports often focus on cancer incidence rates and underappreciate the progress that has been achieved in reduced cancer mortality rates. The effectiveness and expansion of available therapies has seen significant improvements since the 1970s. For example, lumpectomy replaced more invasive mastectomy surgery for the treatment of breast cancer. Treatment of childhood leukemia and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) have undergone major advances since the war on cancer began. The drug Gleevec now cures most CML patients, compared to previous therapy with interferon, which extended life for approximately 1 year in only 20-30 percent of patients. Dr. Steven Rosenberg, chief of surgery at the NCI has said that as of the year 2000, 50% of all diagnosed cases of cancer are curable through a combination of surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy. Cancer surveillance experts have reported a 15.8 percent decrease in the age-standardized death rate from all cancers combined between 1991 and 2006 along with an approximately 1 percent annual decrease in the rate of new diagnoses between 1999 and 2006. A large portion of this decreased mortality for men was attributable to smoking cessation efforts in the United States. A 2010 report from the American Cancer Society found that death rates for all cancers combined decreased 1.3% per year from 2001 to 2006 in males and 0.5% per year from 1998 to 2006 in females, largely due to decreases in the 3 major cancer sites in men (lung, prostate, and colorectum) and 2 major cancer sites in women (breast and colorectum). Cancer death rates between 1990 and 2006 for all races combined decreased by 21.0% among men and by 12.3% among women. This reduction in the overall cancer death rates translates to the avoidance of approximately 767,000 deaths from cancer over the 16-year period. Despite these reductions, the report noted, cancer still accounts for more deaths than heart disease in persons younger than 85 years. An improvement in the number of cancer survivors living in the U.S. was indicated in a 2011 report by the CDC and the NCI, which noted that the number of cancer survivors in 2007 (11.7 million) increased by 19% from 2001 (9.8 million survivors). The number of cancer survivors in 1971 was 3 million. Breast, prostate, and colorectal cancers were the most common types of cancer among survivors, accounting for 51% of diagnoses. As of January 1, 2007, an estimated 64.8% of cancer survivors had lived ‚â•5 years after their diagnosis of cancer, and 59.5% of survivors were aged ‚â•65 years. A continued decline in cancer rates in the U.S. among both women and men, across most major racial groups, and in the most common cancer sites (lung, colon and rectum), was indicated in a 2013 report by the National Cancer Institute. However, the same report indicated an increase from 2000 to 2009 in cancers of the liver, pancreas and uterus. =Challenges= A multitude of factors have been cited as impeding progress in finding a cure for cancer and key areas have been identified and suggested as important to accelerate progress in cancer research. Since there are many different forms of cancer with distinct causes, each form requires different treatment approaches. However, this research could still lead to therapies and cures for many forms of cancer. Some of the factors that have posed challenges for the development of preventive measures and anti-cancer drugs and therapies include the following: * Inherent biological complexity of the disease: ** number of changes within a cell leading to the cancerous state ** disease heterogeneity due to different tissues of origin ** contribution of numerous genetic and environmental risk factors ** complexity of cellular interactions and cell signaling within the tumor microenvironment ** suitability of model organisms for understanding human disease. * Roadblocks to translational medicine * Challenges of early detection and diagnosis * The drug approval process * Availability of and access to patients with suitable tumor tissue for research * Challenges in implementing preventive measures, such as the development and use of preventive drugs and therapies * Choropleth mapping of the changes over time, of the national incidence rate, by cancer type, relative to the population at risk, is a technical challenge. Modern cancer research =Genome-based cancer research projects= The rise of a new class of molecular technologies developed during the Human Genome Project opens up new ways to study cancer and holds the promise for the discovery of new aspects of cancer biology that could eventually lead to novel, more effective diagnostics and therapies for cancer patients. These new technologies are capable of screening many biomolecules and genetic variations such as SNPs and copy number variations in a single experiment and are employed within functional genomics and personalized medicine studies. Speaking on the occasion of the announcement of $1 billion in new funding for genome-based cancer research, Dr. Francis Collins, director of the NIH claimed, \\"We are about to see a quantum leap in our understanding of cancer.\\" Harold Varmus, after his appointment to be the director of the NCI, said we are in a \\"golden era for cancer research,\\" poised to profit from advances in our understanding of the cancer genome. High-throughput DNA sequencing has been used to study the whole genome sequence of two different cancer tissues: a small-cell lung cancer metastasis and a malignant melanoma cell line. The sequence information provides a comprehensive catalog of approximately 90% of the somatic mutations in the cancerous tissue, providing a more detailed molecular and genetic understanding of cancer biology than was previously possible, and offering hope for the development of new therapeutic strategies gleaned from these insights. The Cancer Genome Atlas The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), a collaborative effort between the National Cancer Institute and the National Human Genome Research Institute, is an example of a basic research project that is employing some of these new molecular approaches. One TCGA publication notes the following: > Here we report the interim integrative analysis of DNA copy number, gene > expression and DNA methylation aberrations in 206 glioblastomas...Together, > these findings establish the feasibility and power of TCGA, demonstrating > that it can rapidly expand knowledge of the molecular basis of cancer. In a cancer research funding announcement made by president Obama in September 2009, TCGA project is slated to receive $175 million in funding to collect comprehensive gene sequence data on 20,000 tissue samples from people with more than 20 different types of cancer, in order to help researchers understand the genetic changes underlying cancer. New, targeted therapeutic approaches are expected to arise from the insights resulting from such studies. Cancer Genome Project The Cancer Genome Project at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute aims to identify sequence variants/mutations critical in the development of human cancers. The Cancer Genome Project combines knowledge of the human genome sequence with high throughput mutation detection techniques. =Cancer research supportive infrastructure= Advances in information technology supporting cancer research, such as the NCI's caBIG project, promise to improve data sharing among cancer researchers and accelerate \\"the discovery of new approaches for the detection, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of cancer, ultimately improving patient outcomes.\\" Modern cancer treatment =Cancer clinical trials= Researchers are considering ways to improve the efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and overall success rate of cancer clinical trials. Increased participation in rigorously designed clinical trials would increase the pace of research. Currently, about 3% of people with cancer participate in clinical trials; more than half of them are patients for whom no other options are left, patients who are participating in \\"exploratory\\" trials designed to burnish the researchers' r√©sum√©s or promote a drug rather than to produce meaningful information, or in trials that will not enroll enough patients to produce a statistically significant result. =Targeted tumor treatment= A major challenge in cancer treatment is to find better ways to specifically target tumors with drugs and chemotherapeutic agents in order to provide a more effective, localized dose and to minimize exposure of healthy tissue in other parts of the body to the potentially adverse effects of the treatments. The accessibility of different tissues and organs to anti-tumor drugs contributes to this challenge. For example, the blood‚Äìbrain barrier blocks many drugs that may otherwise be effective against brain tumors. In November 2009, a new, experimental therapeutic approach for treating glioblastoma was published in which the anti-tumor drug Avastin was delivered to the tumor site within the brain through the use of microcatheters, along with mannitol to temporarily open the blood‚Äìbrain barrier permitting delivery of the chemotherapy into the brain. Public education and support An important aspect to the war on cancer is improving public access to educational and supportive resources, to provide individuals with the latest information about cancer prevention and treatment, as well as access to support communities. Resources have been created by governmental and other organizations to provide support for cancer patients, their families and caregivers, to help them share information and find advice to guide decision making.

The movie was entirely filmed in Tainan. Plot In the eyes of her classmates, Yvette Chang (Enno) is a rock and roll girl, she has a cat by the name of \\"Summer\\", because of a congenital heart condition, she has left school and spends much of her time every day with Summer messing around, playing the guitar, and getting out and about. During the time when she is not in school, every day is filled with discovery, and since the specially gifted and talented class's student Jimmy Chan (Ray Chang), fell in love with a teacher, and met the fate of being expelled from the school, now the streets have one more high school student on the roam. Yvette willingly opens her arms to embrace all of Jimmy's emotions, and comfort him. But Jimmy doesn't quite understand why Yvette, who suffers from cardiac disease, is so full of ambition and warmth for living. Two high school drop-outs are out riding bicycles, when between the rice paddies and the irrigation canals, they find a place free from the control of adults, an undeveloped piece of land near the tracks of the Taiwan High Speed Rail. Under the blue skies, they gather with their classmates from the same school, another gifted and talented student named Wendy(Hannah Lin) and the Japanese exchange student Akira (Dean Fujioka) who loves soccer but is always the last in academic, and together at this secret base they relax, have fun, and fool around. The destiny which has brought the four of them together serves as a powerful force of empathy and encouragement, as they enjoy fun times together, and try to save an embittered suicidal father. Against the backdrop of clear skies, reflecting the visions and secrets lodged in the hearts of four almost grown up children, whether life is normal or exciting, with success or failure, they are always able to enjoy the experience. This demonstrates the ability to make oneself feel joy in living, which is a great gift from above, just like a tail, which you can wag just for fun, when you have time to spare from trying to do something. Actually, we all have a tail, which is also trying to keep us happy. What is the purpose of that tail?

On 4 February 1934, he took over as leader of the by then renamed National Front at a time when the movement was in trouble over the extent of its support for the Third Reich. Henne, a strong pro-German, struggled to retain control and in 1938 he was replaced by the more moderate Robert Tobler, his close links to the National Socialists and his advocacy of the Protocols of the Elders of Zion making him too extreme for many National Front members. Unable to serve under Tobler, Henne left to form the fiercely pro-National Socialist Bund Treuer Eidgenossen Nationalsozialistischer Weltanschauung with Hans Oehler and Jakob Schaffner.

MUC1 is a glycoprotein with extensive O-linked glycosylation of its extracellular domain. Mucins line the apical surface of epithelial cells in the lungs, stomach, intestines, eyes and several other organs. Mucins protect the body from infection by pathogen binding to oligosaccharides in the extracellular domain, preventing the pathogen from reaching the cell surface. Overexpression of MUC1 is often associated with colon, breast, ovarian, lung and pancreatic cancers. Joyce Taylor- Papadimitriou identified and characterised the antigen during her work with breast and ovarian tumors.  Structure  MUC1 is a member of the mucin family and encodes a membrane bound, glycosylated phosphoprotein. MUC1 has a core protein mass of 120-225 kDa which increases to 250-500 kDa with glycosylation. It extends 200-500 nm beyond the surface of the cell. The protein is anchored to the apical surface of many epithelia by a transmembrane domain. Beyond the transmembrane domain is a SEA domain that contains a cleavage site for release of the large extracellular domain. The release of mucins is performed by sheddases. The extracellular domain includes a 20 amino acid variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) domain, with the number of repeats varying from 20 to 120 in different individuals. These repeats are rich in serine, threonine and proline residues which permits heavy o-glycosylation. Multiple alternatively spliced transcript variants that encode different isoforms of this gene have been reported, but the full-length nature of only some has been determined. MUC1 is cleaved in the endoplasmic reticulum into two pieces, the cytoplasmic tail including the transmembrane domain and the extracellular domain. These domains tightly associate in a non-covalent fashion. This tight, non-covalent association is not broken by treatment with urea, low pH, high salt or boiling. Treatment with sodium dodecyl sulfate triggers dissociation of the subunits. The cytoplasmic tail of MUC1 is 72 amino acids long and contains several phosphorylation sites.  Function  The protein serves a protective function by binding to pathogens and also functions in a cell signaling capacity. Overexpression, aberrant intracellular localization, and changes in glycosylation of this protein have been associated with carcinomas. e.g. The CanAg tumour antigen is a novel glycoform of MUC1. In the cell nucleus, the protein MUC1 regulates the activity of transcription factor complexes that have a documented role in tumor-induced changes of host immunity.  Interactions  MUC1 has been shown to interact with: * CTNND1, * ERBB2, * GRB2, * JUP, and * SOS1. Role in cancer The ability of chemotherapeutic drugs to access the cancer cells is inhibited by the heavy glycosylation in the extracellular domain of MUC1. The glycosylation creates a highly hydrophilic region which prevents hydrophobic chemotherapeutic drugs from passing through. This prevents the drugs from reaching their targets which usually reside within the cell. Similarly, the glycosylation has been shown to bind to growth factors. This allows cancer cells which produce a large amount of MUC1 to concentrate growth factors near their receptors, increasing receptor activity and the growth of cancer cells. MUC1 also prevents the interaction of immune cells with receptors on the cancer cell surface through steric hindrance. This inhibits an anti-tumor immune response. =Preventing cell death= MUC1 cytoplasmic tail has been shown to bind to p53. This interaction is increased by genotoxic stress. MUC1 and p53 were found to be associated with the p53 response element of the p21 gene promoter. This results in activation of p21 which results in cell cycle arrest. Association of MUC1 with p53 in cancer results in inhibition of p53-mediated apoptosis and promotion of p53-mediated cell cycle arrest. Overexpression of MUC1 in fibroblasts increased the phosphorylation of Akt. Phosphorylation of Akt results in phosphorylation of Bcl-2-associated death promoter. This results in dissociation of Bcl-2-associated death promoter with Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL. Activation was shown to be dependent on the upstream activation of PI3K. Additionally, MUC1 was shown to increase expression of Bcl-xL. Overexpression of MUC1 in cancer. The presence of free Bcl-2 and Bcl- xL prevents the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria, thereby preventing apoptosis. MUC1 cytoplasmic tail is shuttled to the mitochondria through interaction with hsp90. This interaction is induced through phosphorylation of the MUC1 cytoplasmic tail by Src (gene). Src is activated by the EGF receptor family ligand Neuregulin. The cytoplasmic tail is then inserted into the mitochondrial outer membrane. Localization of MUC1 to the mitochondria prevents the activation of apoptotic mechanisms. =Promoting tumor invasion= MUC1 cytoplasmic tail was shown to interact with Beta-catenin. A SXXXXXSSL motif was identified in MUC1 that is conserved with other beta- catenin binding partners. This interaction was shown to be dependent on cell adhesion. Studies have demonstrated that MUC1 is phosphorylated on a YEKV motif. Phosphorylation of this site has been demonstrated by LYN through mediation of interleukin 7, Src through mediation of EGFR, and PRKCD. This interaction is antagonized by degradation of beta-catenin by GSK3B. MUC1 blocks the phosphorylation-dependent degradation of beta-catenin by GSK3B. The end result is that increased expression of MUC1 in cancer increases stabilized beta-catenin. This promotes the expression of vimentin and CDH2. These proteins are associated with a mesenchymal phenotype, characterized by increased motility and invasiveness. In cancer cells, increased expression of MUC1 promotes cancer cell invasion through beta-catenin, resulting in the initiation of epithelial-mesenchymal transition which promotes the formation of metastases. Diagnostic uses = Blood tests: Cancer Antigens (CA) 27.29 and 15-3 = CA 27.29 (aka BR 27.29) and CA 15-3 measure different epitopes of the same protein antigen product of the MUC1 gene seen in breast cancer. CA 27.29 has enhanced sensitivity and specificity compared to CA 15-3 and is elevated in 30% of patients with low-stage disease and 60 to 70% of patients with advanced-stage breast cancer. CA 27.29 levels over 100 U/mL and CA 15-3 levels over 25 U/mL are rare in benign conditions and suggest malignancy. = Immunohistochemistry= Using immunohistochemistry, MUC1 can be identified in a wide range of secretory epithelia and their neoplastic equivalents: Topic Completed: 1 May 2012. Revised: 18 September 2019 *It is a marker of various types of cancer (see below). *In micropapillary carcinoma of the breast and bladder, MUC1 stains the stroma-facing surface of cell clusters of micropapillary units. *It can distinguish systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma (MUC1 positive) from cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma (usually MUC1 negative). *Although other antibodies, such as cytokeratins, are more commonly used for the identification of metastatic carcinoma deposits, EMA can be used to distinguish mesothelioma, in which it is restricted to the cell membranes and associated micovilli, from adenocarcinoma, in which it is diffusely spread through the cytoplasm. ;Diseases with positive MUC1 staining: *Adenocarcinomas :*Breast cancer :*Colorectal cancer :*Pancreatic cancer *Carcinoid tumor, chordoma *Choriocarcinoma *Desmoplastic small-round-cell tumor *Epithelioid sarcoma *Follicular dendritic cell sarcoma, interdigitating dendritic cell sarcoma, reticulum cell sarcoma *Lung: Type II cell lesions (hyperplasia, dysplasia) *Lymphomas :*Anaplastic large-cell lymphoma :*Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (variable expression) :*Plasmablastic lymphoma :*Primary effusion lymphoma *Meningioma *Mesotheliomas (epithelioid) *Myeloma *Paget's disease of the breast *Perineurioma *Plasmacytomas *Renal cell carcinoma *Synovial sarcoma (epithelial areas) *Thymic carcinoma (often) ;Negative staining: *Myoepithelial cells *Adrenocortical carcinoma :Hepatocellular carcinoma :Germ cell tumors (except choriocarcinoma) *Acquired cystic kidney disease-associated renal cell carcinoma *Leiomyosarcoma (usually) *Liposarcoma *Melanoma *Neuroblastoma *Paraganglioma *Solitary fibrous tumor ;Normal tissues with positive staining: *Apical surface of almost all glandular and ductal epithelial cells: :*Breast, including Toker cells :*Distal convoluted tubule of kidney :*Type II cells of pulmonary alveoli :*Pancreas :*Salivary glands :*eccrine and apocrine glands of the skin *Several white blood cells: :*Activated T cells :*Some B cells :*Monocytes *Follicular dendritic cells *Perineurial cells As a therapeutic drug target Using MUC1, vaccines are being tested against a type of blood cancer called multiple myeloma. The technology could in theory be applied to 90 percent of all known cancers, including prostate and breast cancer, solid and non-solid tumors. This method would activate the immune system by training T-cells to search out and destroy cells that display a specific molecule (or marker) of MUC1. MUC1 is found on nearly all epithelial cells, but it is over expressed in cancer cells, and its associated glycans are shorter than those of non-tumor-associated MUC1. Because MUC1 is overexpressed (and differently glycosylated) in many cancers it has been investigated as a drug target, e.g. for the MUC1 vaccine ONT-10, which has had a phase 1 clinical study.

Significant Research Results He is part of a Nanotechnology group at UCB, the Center of Integrated Nanomechanical Systemshttp://nano.berkeley.edu/coins He holds patents on the nanoradio, the nano mass sensorAlex Zettl et al, Nature Nanotechnology, published online 20 July 2008 and other developments from this center's research.The World's Smallest Radio, Scientific American, 300, 3 (March 2009), p. 45 The research of Zettl, Kenneth Jensen, Jeff Weldon and Henry Garcia culminated in a single nanotube mounted on the tip of a metal electrode. When an electric current is passed between that nanotube and another, shorter, nanotube mounted nearby, an FM radio-frequency signal can be sensed by the nanotube, and the signal is converted into an audible signal without any other circuitry required. This remarkable phenomenon was first described in the November 2007 issue of Nano Letters,Alex Zettl et al, Nano Letters Vol. 7 No. 11 (Nov. 2007), pp. 3508-3511 a monthly publication of the American Chemical Society. In that same issue, independent University of California, Irvine, researchers Peter Burke and Chris Rutherglen announced a similar result - sensing and demodulating an AM radio-frequency signal, although their apparatus included conventional circuitry for antenna and amplification. Alex Zettl is a well-known condensed- matter physicist with many significant contributions to the field. When he was at UCLA, he (and his PhD advisor) discovered the charge density wave (CDW) and sliding CDW in several group of important materials (metal trichalcogenide, blue bronze). At the boom of high temperature superconductivity, Zettl also had some contribution in the study of superconductivity in carbon-based materials (C60 and doped C60). After that, Zettl and his group focuses their efforts on nanotubes, namely carbon nanotubes and boron nitride nanotubes. Alex Zettl is the first one to demonstrate the synthesis of boron nitride nanotubes. Since then he has continued contributing to develop the fields (synthesis, device fabrication and electron microscopy of nanotubes). Recently Alex Zettl focuses more on two-dimensional materials, namely graphene, hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) and metal dichalcogenide (TMDs). His work includes atomic resolution of structure of graphene and h-BN, their defects (grain boundaries, vacancies) and applications of 2-D materials (graphene loudspeaker). In 2015, Zettl was awarded R&D; Award for the invention of Extended-Pressure Inductively Coupled (EPIC) Plasma system to large scale synthesis of high quality boron nitride nanotubes.
