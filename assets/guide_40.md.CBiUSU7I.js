Description H. rigidifolia is a small tree reaching about in height. Annual growth is in the form of vigorous spur shoots with short internodes, scale-like leaves on the lower portions and normal foliage on the upper portions. The leaves, which are bent back when they first emerge, are trifoliate and markedly different to those of other members of the genus, being smooth and glossy, thick, stiff and leathery in texture, with inrolled margins on the underside. The tree is evergreen, because the shoots and leaves grow before the old foliage is shed. The inflorescence is borne in the axil of a scale leaf. Separate male and female flowers are present, the flowers being large, with markedly twisted calyx lobes. The fruits are green with reddish tips and contain three large hexagonal seeds, measuring . This tree is not used commercially for the production of latex having a poor reputation due to the high proportion of resins present.

It is native to the rainforests of northern Brazil and Guyana. It is named in honour of the English botanist Richard Spruce who spent the years 1849 to 1864 exploring the Amazon basin and sending botanical specimens back to Europe. Description H. spruceana is a medium-sized, evergreen tree that sometimes develops a markedly swollen trunk, seemingly a response to periodical flooding. The leaves have three elliptical leaflets. The inflorescence is a panicle with separate male and female flowers; in contrast to other members of the genus, the flowers of H. spruceana are purplish in colour. The usually three seeds are contained in a capsule with woody valves, but this does not break open explosively to expel the seeds as happens with other members of the genus. Distribution and habitat H. spruceana is found in the Amazon basin, in a strip bordering the Amazon River and some of its tributaries. Its range extends for the length of the Amazon from its confluence with the Putumayo River as far as the Amazon delta, almost extending to the sea. This tree also grows beside the lower reaches of the Madeira River, the Rio Negro and other main Amazon tributaries. Its typical habitat is muddy islands and riverbanks in localities subject to frequent heavy flooding. Ecology When the forest is flooded, the fruits of H. spruceana ripen and fall into the water. They act as a magnet to tambaquis, large seed-eating fish in the piranha family, which cluster around the trees, consuming every fruit that drops. The seeds are crushed by their powerful jaws but inevitably, some seeds pass through the fish undamaged and are dispersed elsewhere. Two other members of the piranha family that also feed on the fruits are Serrasalmus serrulatus and Pristobrycon striolatus. These fish are more selective, peeling the seeds and discarding the skins before breaking up and swallowing the kernels. Other fish that invade the flooded forest and are found near H. spruceana are the flesh-eating piranhas, which feed on other fish, insects, birds and animals that have fallen into the water, sometimes supplementing this diet with the fruits and seeds of the rubber tree.

A medium-sized deciduous tree growing to a height of about , it is native to the rainforests of northern Brazil, Colombia and Venezuela. Description H. benthamiana is a medium-sized deciduous tree growing to around , often with a narrow crown and a swollen, bottle-like trunk; these features seem to be a response to periodic flooding because they do not occur in cultivated trees. This tree is deciduous, shedding its old foliage before stubby \\"winter shoots\\" develop. This may be a response to the fungal leaf diseases that readily occur in the constantly humid environment. The leaves have three elliptical leaflets which have a golden-brown pubescence on the underside. The inflorescences have separate male and female flowers, the male flowers having seven to nine stamens in two irregular whorls. The seeds are rounded. Habitat The species is native to northern Brazil, Colombia and Venezuela. Its range is entirely to the north of the Amazon River and covers large parts of the Rio Negro and Vaup√©s River system, the Rio Negro being the largest left-bank tributary of the Amazon. It grows in areas of rainforest that are frequently inundated, often in association with the fan palm Mauritia carana in bogs that are flooded all year round. Because of its different habitat needs, it does not extend as far west as H. guianensis, H. nitida or H. pauciflora. Uses H. benthamiana produces a good quality latex which is slightly lower in quality than that of the Par√° rubber tree, H. brasiliensis. The tree is tapped for the production of rubber but is not widely grown as a plantation crop, although occasionally cultivated in Venezuela, Sri Lanka, Malaysia, and Indonesia. It has been used in breeding programmes for increasing the disease resistance and improving the growth qualities of H. brasiliensis. The seeds contain toxic substances and are poisonous to humans when raw, but they are eaten by local people when thoroughly cooked.

It was the defence force of the Republic of Bophuthatswana, a nominally independent bantustan during the Apartheid era of South Africa. Organisation and structure A National Guard of about 125 soldiers initially formed the Bophuthatswana National Guard in time for the independence of Bophuthatswana. Initially this group merely performed ceremonial duties and was housed within the office of the President. A SADF Officer Brigadier Riekert served as a military adviser to President Lucas Mangope. Over time an embryonic Department of Defence was developed resulting in the establishment of the Bophuthatswana Defence Force (BDF) on the 30 November 1979 with Brigadier Riekerk as the Minister of Defence and Lt Col Jack Turner as the Chief of the BDF. Development of the BDF =Bases and areas of command= The BDF developed military areas and bases at: *1 Military Area covered the region of Mafikeng, Mmabatho and Lehurutse and housed: **The Molopo base, with One Infantry Battalion, the Military School and the Technical Services Unit **The Lehuru Tshe base, with the Parachute Battalion *2 Military Area covered the region of Mankwe and Moretele and housed: **The Mankwe base, with Two Infantry Battalion, a COIN unit **The Bafokeng base, a company group base **The Odi base, a company group base *3 Military Area covered the region of Thaba‚ÄôNchu and Taung and housed: **The Thaba‚ÄôNchu base, a company group base and **The Taung base, a company group base. =The Units=  One BDF Infantry Battalion  The first true armed unit formed was One Infantry Battalion based at Molopo, while its training wing eventually formed the Military School. Technical Services Unit A Technical Services Unit at Molopo was also formed from a Light Workshop Troop. Two BDF Infantry Battalion A second Infantry Battalion was formed and based at Mankwe specialising in COIN operations. Parachute and Special Forces A Parachute Battalion and Special forces Unit was also formed. Together these units formed the Task Force. Other Units * BDF Signals Unit with a Supply Depot was housed at the old Mafikeng Air Base after the establishment of Air Force Base Mmabatho. * BDF Supply Depot * BDF Maintenance Unit Air Wing Based at Air Force Base Mmabatho and consisted of: ‚Ä¢ A Transport Wing: Operated CASA 212, CASA 235 and Pilatus PC6 ‚Ä¢ A Helicopter Wing: Allouette 3 and BK 117s ‚Ä¢ A Training Wing: Pilatus PC 7 Brigadier M.P. Janse van Rensburg as Chief fell under the Chief of the BDF.https://saartillery.wordpress.com/bophuthatswana-defence-force/ =Attempted Coup= The establishment of the Bophuthatswana National Security Unit as an addendum to the BDF in 1986 may have contributed to the aborted coup attempt of 2 February 1988. This unit was primarily responsible for the provision of infrastructure. One contentious issue was the low entry requirements for the BNSU compared to that of the BDF, resulting in dissatisfaction. After the coup was thwarted through the intervention of the SADF, Brigadier Riekert resigned as Minister of Defence and President Mangope personally took over the defence portfolio. The BNSU was disbanded and a small number of former BNSU members were allowed to join the BDF. For practical reasons, a Defence Committee under the chairmanship of Minister Rowan Cronje was established to assist the Chief of the BDF in dealing with welfare and social issues, since these were considered to be the most important sources of the dissatisfaction which had contributed to the coup attempt. Minister Cronje subsequently took over the defence portfolio in 1991. =Invasion of Bophuthatswana= On 11 March 1994, following a request from President Mangope for assistance from the Afrikaner Volksfront, hundreds of Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging (AWB) members unlawfully entered Bophuthatswana from South Africa, to \\"help\\" restore control in the face of a strike by civil servants, resulting in 42 residents of Mafikeng killed and three AWB members shot dead by a Bophuthatswana Police sergeant. The unrest ended when SADF was officially requested to assist in restoring safety and security, by General Turner (Chief of BDF). The request was done as per security agreement between the BDF and SADF. Bophuthatswana was then soon thereafter placed under the control of the South African government. Shortly afterwards, Mangope was removed from power and a temporary administrator was put in place by the South African Transitional Executive Council http://www.sahistory.org.za/dated-event/three- awb-members-shot-and-killed-during-invasion-bophuthatswana =General Elections of South Africa and Disbandment= During the historical General Elections of 1994, 2 SSB took part in Operation Baccarat (stability in Mmabatho and Passado (border protection) as a peace force to ensure stability in the North West Province). On 19 December 1994, the Bophuthatswana Defence Force Parachute Battalion at Gopane was placed under operational command of 2 SSB, as part of the founding of the SANDF. 2 SSB withdrew simultaneously from Nietverdiend and Nooitgedacht. From August 1994 to 15 June 1995 successful bridging training was provided for 550 formerly non-statutory force members. With the end of Apartheid in 1994 in South Africa, the former defence forces of the Bantustan s were incorporated into the newly formed South African National Defence Force. The SANDF's new 10 South African Infantry Battalion heraldry clearly originates from the Bophuthatswana Defence Force, its forbear. =Insignia= Bophuthatswana Defence Force Structure Ranks { style=\\"border:1px solid #8888aa; background-color:#f7f8ff; padding:5px; font- size:95%; margin: 0px 12px 12px 0px;\\" } { style=\\"border:1px solid #8888aa; background-color:#f7f8ff; padding:5px; font-size:95%; margin: 0px 12px 12px 0px; width: 50%\\" } Equipment The BDF was equipped for counter-insurgency (COIN) operations.

In the spring of 1627 the Jin khan Hong Taiji invaded Ming territory in Liaoning under the pretext of illegal construction on Jin lands. Background The Jin khan Nurhaci was wounded in the Battle of Ningyuan the previous year and died. His successor Hong Taiji ordered Amin to attack the kingdom of Joseon (Korea). He himself led a force of 40,000 to attack the Ming city of Jinzhou. Course of battle The Later Jin invaded Ming territory in Liaoning under the pretext of illegal construction on Jin lands. The Ming court immediately dispatched a relief army of 30,000. Hong Taiji led a force of 40,000 to Jinzhou, where he began negotiations with Ming. When Ming refused to respond, he assaulted the city. The battle was close and at one point it appeared that the western guard tower was about to fall, but the commander Zhao Shuaijiao rallied the defenders in that area and repelled the Jin soldiers. After half a day of fighting, Hong Taiji sounded the retreat and pulled back out of the range of Ming cannons. After several days of successful resistance by Jinzhou, Hong Taiji decided to try his luck at Ningyuan. As Hong Taiji approached Ningyuan, he was intercepted by a Ming army led by Man Gui, You Shilu, and Zu Dashou. The two armies engaged in combat, but it soon became apparent that the Jin were at a severe disadvantage as Yuan Chonghuan had expanded the defensive network from Ningyuan, and Ming reinforcements rushed out from defensive fortifications to attack. Meanwhile, Yuan directed cannoneers on top of Ningyuan's walls who assisted the ground forces by bombarding the enemies. The Jin army disengaged after losing several thousand men and retreated to Jinzhou, where Hong Taiji tried once again to take the city. As Ming cannons opened fire on the Jin army, a contingent of Ming cavalry engaged the enemies from the rear, forcing them to retreat with yet more casualties. After rallying his army, Hong Taiji attempted another assault on Jinzhou, this time attacking from the south while feigning diversionary assaults from the other three sides. This futile endeavor ended badly and the Jin suffered some two to three thousand casualties before retreating. Aftermath Northeast Asian 1620‚Äì1630. Hong Taiji learned the value of artillery and endeavored to obtain more firearm units for his army. In the immediate aftermath however he was occupied with famine and banditry in the Jin realm, which forced him to distribute relief supplies. Despite the Ming success in battle, Yuan Chonghuan was impeached for lack of agency, engaging with the Jin in peace talks, and allowing them to invade the kingdom of Joseon, for which he was dismissed from office. He was eventually reinstated again after the reigning Tianqi Emperor died and the Chongzhen Emperor succeeded him on 2 October 1627. In the summer of 1628 Yuan announced that he could recover all of Liaodong in just five years if the court followed his plans. Unfortunately for him, by this time Ming treasuries had been nearly tapped out and the Taicang vault was left with only seven million taels. The Ming realm was also suffering from natural disasters in Shaanxi, Shanxi and Henan. In 1627 widespread drought in Shaanxi resulted in mass starvation as harvests failed and people turned to cannibalism. Natural disasters in Shaanxi were not unusual, and in the last 60 years of the Ming, there was not a single year in which Shaanxi did not experience a natural disaster. The entire region was a natural disaster zone. Shanxi too suffered from windstorms, earthquakes, and famines. In the south, Henan also experienced starvation and it was said that \\"grains of rice became as precious as pearls.\\" Chongzhen's petty and mercurial ways exacerbated the situation by constantly switching grand secretaries, which prevented a coherent government response from coalescing. Chongzhen's reign alone saw around 50 grand secretaries appointed to the post, representing two thirds of all holders of that post throughout the entire Ming dynasty. To prevent further depletion of the imperial treasury, Chongzhen cut funding for the Ming postal service, which saw the mass unemployment of large numbers of men from the central and northern provinces around the Yellow River region. This in turn contributed to the overall deterioration of government control and the formation of bandit groups, which became endemic in the last decades of the Ming. In the spring of 1628, Wang Jiayin started a revolt in Shaanxi with some 6,000 followers, one of whom was Zhang Xianzhong, who would go on to depopulate Sichuan in the future. The rebellion posed no threat to the Ming army, but due to the rugged mountain terrain of Shaanxi, the Ming pacification army of 17,000 was unable to effectively root out the rebels. Another bandit leader Gao Yingxiang rose up in revolt and joined Wang Jiayin soon after. In early 1629 the veteran anti-rebel leader Yang He was called into service and made Supreme Commander of the Three Border Regions. What he found was that situations were even more dire than they appeared. Salaries for soldiers of Shaanxi were three years in arrears, and their own soldiers were deserting to join the rebels. Yang was unable to suppress Wang Jiayin's rebels, who took several isolated fortresses as late as 1630. Yang's policy of amnesty for surrendered peasants was generally ineffective. Once surrendered, the peasants would go back to their homes and join other rebel bands. Despite Ming victories in battle, peasant rebellions would remain a major problem for the remainder of the Ming dynasty. Yang He was eventually impeached and arrested for ineffectiveness. He was replaced with Hong Chengchou who would later defect to the Qing dynasty. As a result, Yuan Chonghuan was only allotted 40 percent of the funds he had requested.

It was the defence force of the Republic of Transkei, a nominally independent bantustan during the Apartheid era of South Africa. History =Origin= In 1981, the newly formed Transkei Defence Force (TDF) received a gift of equipment from the South African Defence Force. =The Rhodesian connection= In 1982, the Minister of Defence and then Prime Minister, G.M. Matazima announced the employment of a group of expatriate advisers from the former Rhodesia. A group of about 30 former Rhodesians had actually commenced employment in March 1981, under the auspices of the Security Services Transkei Company. Former Rhodesian Selous Scouts founder Ronald Reid-Daly was hired to serve as commander of the TDF and to supervise training. =Head of the Defence Force= President K.D. Matanzima retired as State President in February 1986, and was succeeded by his brother, G.M. Matanzima. =Attack on the Ciskei= In 1985, Apartheid practitioners conceived a plan to merge the Transkei and Ciskei and create a 'united nation of Xhosa speakers' who they thought would support the South African government and help it to stamp out unrest in the Eastern Cape. Matanzima had long held ambitions to rule such a territory, and had opposed the 'independence' of Ciskei in 1981 in the hope that this merger would be realised. On 19 February 1987, a truckload of Transkei special forces unsuccessfully attacked the home in Bisho of the Ciskei President, Chief Lennox Sebe. The raid was apparently under the control of the former members of the Rhodesian Security Forces, although Matanzima refused to admit Transkeian involvement. The raid appeared to be aimed at the overthrow of Lennox Sebe, but the plan, failed after it was leaked to Brigadier Bantu Holomisa. Consequences of the attack This together with resistance to the raid from elements within the Transkei, played an important role in the ascendance to power of Ms. Stella Sigcau and Brigadier Bantu Holomisa. By April 1987, the contracts of 27 white military officers, including the former Rhodesians, were terminated and a group of 20 of these men including their commander, Major General Ronald Reid-Daly were expelled from the Transkei. Rumours of a coup attempt by the former State President K.D. Matanzima followed the expulsions. The botched raid also earned Transkei the enmity of South Africa which had considered the Rhodesians to be a stabilising factor. President G.M Matanzima announced Brigadier Holomisa who had been released due to public pressure after nine weeks detention would be promoted to Major General and would succeed General Zondwa Mtirara as commander of the TDF. Holomisa had been detained by the Government as he had apparently agitated against the role of the white officers in the TDF as well as stirring disaffection on the basis of the Matanzima government. =Coup= By 23 September 1987, TDF soldiers served resignation letters on the Transkei cabinet. President G.M. Matanzima resigned in the wake of mounting evidence of corruption. Ms Stella Sigcau was elected as the new Prime Minister, but the TDF took over the administration of the Transkei in a bloodless coup on 30 December 1987, after only 86 days. Major General Holomisa declared martial law and suspended the Transkei constitution, alleging Ms. Sigcau had been involved in the corruption as well. A military council was formed and remained in power. =Coup Attempt= In November 1990, a group of six white and black soldiers attempted to mount a coup, but they failed when troops loyal to Holomisa overcame the plotters. Eighteen people were killed, including the leader of the coup, Colonel Craig Duli. =Equipment= The TDF was equipped for counter-insurgency (COIN) operations. The TDF used: * R4/R5 assault rifles, * light machine guns, * multiple grenade launchers, * and mortars and * Browning machine guns.

A sequel, titled Agatha Christie's Murder in the Making: More Stories and Secrets from Her Notebooks, was published by HarperCollins in 2012. This book included an unpublished version of The Case of the Caretaker, called The Case of the Caretaker's Wife. The book includes two unpublished Hercule Poirot stories - a previous version of The Capture of Cerberus, and The Incident of the Dog's Ball. The Capture of Cerberus was originally intended to be included in The Labours of Hercules as the final story, but was rejected due to the political content - set just before World War II, it involves Poirot solving the shooting of the German dictator, 'August Hertzlein'. The Incident of the Dog's Ball was expanded into Dumb Witness. The stories was found in her notebooks by Curran, a Christie enthusiast.  Unpublished stories  = The Capture of Cerberus = Hercule Poirot, by the Lake of Geneva, meets Countess Vera Rossakoff. She introduces him to Herr Keiserbach, and mentions that he can 'bring the dead back to life'. Keiserbach later visits Poirot and asks him to clear his son's name. He reveals that he changed his name from Lutzmann. His son, Hans Lutzmann, shot August Hertzlein during a speech, and was immediately torn apart by the crowd. Keiserbach tells Poirot that his son was an avid supporter of Hertzlein, ‚Äúa Nazi through and through‚Äù. Returning to Britain, Poirot hires Mr Higgs, a dog thief, and, with a cat burglar, they travel to a place in Alsace. Mr Higgs uses his skills to get the massive guard dog out of the way, while the cat burglar breaks into a certain room in the house, files the bars away, and with the aid of a silk ladder, lowers Hertzlein - a \\"short man with a bullet head and a little dark moustache\\" - to the ground. In a Paris-bound train, Poirot reveals how he guessed that the man that was shot was not Hertzlein - it was someone impersonating him. Hertzlein had been converted by a priest, and was about to start preaching peace. \\"Executive authorities in the Central Empires\\" kidnapped him and substituted a look-alike, who was then assassinated by two storm troopers who then accused Hans Lutzmann, forcing the gun into his hands. The real Hertzlein was put into an asylum, where no-one would believe him if he said who he was. Poirot sent out several young medical men to various asylums, one of who found Hertzlein. Hertzlein, freed, preaches peace to the nation. In Geneva, Poirot reads the news of Hertzlein. Rossakoff tells Poirot that this time, those who kidnapped him will really kill him. Poirot tells her that his legacy will live on, and presents her with the dog that Mr Higgs stole, calling it 'Cerberus'. =The Incident of the Dog's Ball= A Miss Matilda Wheeler writes to Poirot, expressing herself worried over little incidents. The letter is dated three months ago. Poirot, accompanied by Arthur Hastings, goes to investigate. At an inn, Poirot discovers that the writer of the letter died a month or two ago. The house was left to the lady‚Äôs companion, a Miss Lawson. Poirot visits Dr Lawrence, who attended her, and finds out that she died of yellow atrophy of the liver. Miss Lawson inherited everything, possibly due to influence through Spiritualism. Poirot and Hastings tour the house, meeting Bob, a fox terrier. Poirot learns that she made her will leaving everything to Miss Lawson after falling down the stairs, having supposedly slipped on Bob's ball. Poirot interviews Miss Wheeler's two surviving relatives, James Graham and Mollie Davidson. Graham reveals that Miss Wheeler had told him of the new will, but had not told Mollie. Poirot requests that they should get an order of exhumation, which they refuse. After they leave, Poirot makes a visit to Miss Lawson. She tells him that on the day of Miss Wheeler being taken ill, they held a seance. Miss Lawson saw a luminous halo around Miss Wheeler's head. Poirot sees a piece of needlework depicting a bulldog on the steps of a house, with the caption 'Out all night and no key!'. He deduces that Bob was out that night. He further deduces, after questioning Miss Lawson more, that Miss Wheeler was poisoned with phosphorus. As Miss Wheeler suffered from jaundice, the symptoms would not be noticed. The luminous haze that Miss Lawson saw was Miss Wheeler's luminous breath, caused by the phosphorus. The phosphorus was administered in the form of a pill, hidden among her digestive pills. Poirot further deduces that Mollie Davidson was the murderer, seeking to get her share of the inheritance, not knowing that the will had been changed. Poirot writes to Mollie, telling what he has deduced. Mollie commits suicide two days later.

Launched in 2016, it is the first such system in Malaysia. Currently, there are 250 LinkBike bicycles and 25 stations throughout the city, including its UNESCO World Heritage Site, as well as suburban places like Queensbay Mall. LinkBike, which is jointly funded by the Penang Island City Council and Fast Rent Bike (PG) Sdn. Bhd, a local private limited firm, is part of the wider efforts undertaken by the Penang state government to alleviate traffic congestion within George Town, as well as to promote environmentally-friendly alternative transportation modes.  History  In August 2016, the Chief Minister of Penang, Lim Guan Eng, announced the planned public bicycle sharing service within George Town. The proposed system, an internet of things (IoT)-based initiative of the Penang Island City Council, is to be operated on a public-owned and privately managed model. Of the RM1.85 million allocated to run the service, 90% was to be borne by the Penang Island City Council, while Fast Rent Bike (PG), which contributed the remaining 10% of the cost, would operate the system. LinkBike was launched on 17 December 2016, with nine stations within George Town and an initial fleet of 60 bicycles. Not only is LinkBike the first public bicycle sharing system in Malaysia, it also made George Town the first city in Malaysia to operate such a system. LinkBike's fleet was enlarged to 250 bicycles by April 2017. Since its launch, LinkBike recorded a ridership figure of 3,422 . This figure rose sharply to 8,583 by 28 May. Simultaneously, LinkBike has been expanded to 25 stations scattered throughout George Town, covering various destinations between Gurney Drive to the north and Queensbay Mall, near Bayan Lepas, to the south.Kelawei Road LinkBike station, installed in April 2017.  Technology  LinkBike utilises two electronic rental payment methods - the smart card and the smartphone application. The smartphone app is designed as a QR code scanner and comes with a location-based GPS feature that indicates the nearest LinkBike stations, as well as the number of available bicycles at any particular station updated in real time. Meanwhile, LinkBike's smart card can be topped up using either cash or credit card at LinkBike's office at the Esplanade. Each LinkBike bicycle has been fitted with an LED-powered dynamo hub that lights up the bicycle's front and rear once motion is detected; this is intended to improve the visibility and safety of riders at night.  Pricing  The first 30 minutes of each ride is free-of-charge, after which a fee of RM1 is imposed for every subsequent hour. Users can also purchase daily, weekly, monthly or annual passes, ranging from RM2 for 24 hours to RM30 for a one-year pass.  Stations  , 25 LinkBike stations have been installed within and around George Town, including 12 throughout the city's UNESCO World Heritage Site. Each station has either 10 or 12 bicycle parking docks.

History =Background= White immigrants flooded into northern California in 1848 due to the California Gold Rush, increasing the non-Indian population of California from 13,000 to well over 300,000 in little more than a decade. The sudden influx of miners and settlers on top of the nearly 300,000 Native Americans living in the area strained space and resources. On April 22, 1850, the fledgling California state legislature passed the Act for the Government and Protection of Indians, legalizing the kidnapping and forced servitude of Indians by White settlers. In 1851, the civilian governor of California declared, \\"That a war of extermination will continue to be waged ‚Ä¶ until the Indian race becomes extinct, must be expected.\\" This expectation soon found its way into law. An 1851 legislative measure not only gave settlers the right to organize lynch mobs to kill Indians, but allowed them to submit their expenses to the government. By 1852 the state had authorized over a million dollars in such claims. In 1856, a San Francisco Bulletin editorial stated, \\"Extermination is the quickest and cheapest remedy, and effectually prevents all other difficulties when an outbreak [of Indian violence] occurs.\\" In 1854, when the first six White settlers arrived in Round Valley, somewhere between 6,000 and 20,000 Yuki Indians inhabited the valley and its surrounding area. Those first six settlers immediately attacked the Yuki without provocation, killing 40 of them (see Asbill Massacre). By 1855‚Äì56 Yuki women were being kidnapped in large numbers and sold to outside men as there was a shortage of women among the miners and settlers. Pierce Asbill, the instigator of the Asbill Massacre, stayed in the area and personally kidnapped at least 35 Yuki women over the next year. Indian Agent Simon Storms reported upon arriving in 1856 that the Yuki people feared White men due to the kidnapping of women and children and in 1857 Indian Agent Vincent Geiger stated that in Round Valley: \\"the Indians ... have very few children‚Äîmost of them doubtless having been stolen and sold.\\" By 1860, settler William Frazier reported that there were no longer any children among the Indians they encountered and blamed kidnapping by outsiders as the cause. Historians Sherburne Cooke and Benjamin Madley suggest that these abductions were one of several instigators of violent conflict in the valley. William Brewer, a member of the California Geological Survey in the early 1860s, directly blamed child-stealing of Indian children for the rise in Indian/settler conflict and the atrocities that followed. A second instigator of conflict was competition for resources. The new settlers killed deer in large numbers and cut off Yuki access to fields where they had gathered plants and hunted small game. This threatened the Yuki with starvation, and at times Yuki men killed and ate grazing cattle to survive. Many cattle and horses also wandered off and died of natural causes, but these deaths were also blamed on the Indians and used to build animosity towards them. In fact, US Army Lieutenant Edward Dillon implicated California Superintendent of Indian Affairs Thomas Henley, current ranch owner and former California Supreme Court Judge Serranus C. Hastings, and Hastings's ranch manager H.L. Hall in a plot to build hatred towards the Indians by holding town-hall style public gatherings where settlers aired their grievances against them, real or imagined. In this manner they would be able to create community buy-in to their campaign of atrocities which could then drive the Indians off the land and allow them to have the valley entirely to themselves. =Incidents= A band of 20‚Äì30 men, a significant portion of the several dozen White settlers occupying the valley at that time, committed a series of attacks against the Yuki Indians between 1856 and the summer of 1859. These massacres were so frequent as to be uncountable. One Round Valley settler, Dryden Lacock, testified to the California State Legislature that he regularly took part in expeditions that would kill 50-60 Indians in a trip, as often as two to three a week at times, from 1856 to 1860. Settler William Scott testified before the legislature that H.L. Hall was a leader of vigilantes, killing all the Indians he could find whenever he encountered them and even poisoning their food and supplies. Hall‚Äôs culpability was verified by Army Lieutenant Edward Dillon, who referred to Hall as a \\"monster\\" who killed men, women, and children, regardless of any crimes committed and lamented that he had basically depopulated the county of Indians. Hall, despite remaining silent as to the number of Indians he had killed, did admit under oath to executing Indian women, children, and even infants. Special Treasury Agent J. Ross Browne's account of the attacks is vivid: \\"At [Round Valley], during the winter of 1858‚Äì‚Äò59, more than a hundred and fifty peaceable Indians, including women and children, were cruelly slaughtered by the whites who had settled there under official authority. ... Armed parties went into the rancherias in open day, when no evil was apprehended, and shot the Indians down‚Äîweak, harmless, and defenseless as they were‚Äîwithout distinction of age or sex; shot down women with sucking babes at their breasts; killed or crippled the naked children that were running about.\\" As early as September 1857, Superintendent Henley had stated that the campaign against the Yuki would continue until they were either exterminated or driven from the area entirely. Special Treasury agent J. Ross Browne in September 1858 called it a \\"war of extermination\\" against the Yuki with 20‚Äì30 armed White men engaging in months of constant attacks. By August 1859, after three years of a sustained campaign of atrocities, the Sacramento Union wrote that the local Indians appeared doomed to extirpation. A few specific attacks of which there is witness testimony are: * A local paper reported 55 Indians killed in Clinton Valley on October 8, 1856. * A White farmer, John Lawson, admitted an attack killing 8 Indians, 3 by shooting and 5 by hanging, after some of his hogs were stolen. He stated that these killings were a common practice. * A White farmer, Isaac Shanon, testified to killing 14 Indians in a revenge attack after a White man was killed in early 1858. * White persons from the Sacramento Valley came into Round Valley and killed 4 Yuki Indians with the help of locals in June 1858, despite having been warned against it by Indian Agents. * White settlers attacked and killed 9 Indians in the mountains edging the valley on November 1858. * Former Superintendent of Indian Affairs, Thomas Henley (fired two months earlier for embezzling funds), led a massacre of 11 Yuki Indians in August 1859. Due to the overwhelming number of killings, an exact death toll is unknowable. The following estimates were made by government agents and newspapers at the time: 1856: 300 total killed over the course of the year. Winter 1856‚Äì57: About 75 Yuki Indians killed over the course of the winter. March‚ÄìApril 1858: 300‚Äì400 male Yukis killed in three weeks.Petaluma Journal 1857, quoted in November 1858 ‚Äì January 1859: 150+ or 170 Yuki Indians killed between November and January March‚ÄìMay 1859: 240 Yuki killed in assaults led by H.L. Hall in revenge for the slaughter of Judge Hasting's horse and a total of 600 men, women, and children killed within the previous year.Major Edward Johnson, quoted in These estimates suggest well over 1,000 Yuki deaths at the hands of White settlers. (See Cook, Sherburne; \\"The California Indian and White Civilization\\" Part III, pg 7, for an argument in favor of the approximate reliability of figures of Indians killed at this time.) The White settler John Burgess testified that 10‚Äì15 Indians were killed for every beef that had been killed. Lieutenant Edward Dillon stated that many crimes were unknown as settlers \\"will not testify against each other, and in most cases of this nature, Indians are the only witnesses.\\"Edward Dillon, quoted in Yuki Indian depositions were taken during the investigation of the murders by the California legislature in 1860, but all of these depositions have either been lost or destroyed. Little retaliation or defense was possible from the Yuki. On 24 September 1857, over three years after the first massacre of Indians in Round Valley, Indian Agent Geiger reported that a White man had been killed by a Yuki for the first time. Another White man was killed in early 1858, and by the end of 1858 a total of four White men had been killed. Reports from the US Army suggest that at least two of the men killed were well known for grievous crimes against the Indians and that the Indians had been provoked in both instances. Repercussions =Military response= In October 1857, Superintendent Henley requested a federal detachment of troops, but Secretary of War Jefferson Davis refused to provide them and said it was not the military's responsibility. Henley, who himself ranched in the valley and was culpable in some of the massacres, may have made the request merely as a cover‚Äîin fact, in making the request in order to \\"preserve peace\\", he still wrote that the extermination of the Indians was the expected end result. In January 1859, seventeen soldiers were finally deployed to Round Valley by the Sixth Infantry, where they witnessed serious abuses and killings. However, they received no support from the authorities, and were ordered by Army command to avoid confronting or incarcerating the White settlers. Major Edward Johnson reported to command that he had tried to stop the killings but with little effect.Major Edward Johnson, quoted in By January 1860 they had been reassigned elsewhere. On 1 May 1859, Major Johnson explicitly stated in a report to the governor of California that \\"The Yukas have not been, for the last two years, nor are they now, at open war with the whites; But the whites have waged a relentless war of extermination against the Yukas,\\" and declared to the governor that the Indians, not the White settlers, needed protection.Major Edward Johnson, quoted in Governor Weller asked Pacific Department commander General W. S. Clark to deploy additional soldiers, but the general refused. In his place, a state militia captain F. F. Flint was deputized to investigate, but Flint advocated for killing the Yuki rather than protecting them. Major Johnson stated with resignation in August 1859: \\"I believe it to be the settled determination of many of the inhabitants to exterminate the Indians.\\" =Jarboe's War= In July 1859, a White settler named Walter S. Jarboe, already known for his brutal killings, formed an organized army of forty mercenaries to destroy the Round Valley Indians. He sought approval and payment from the state of California, and received an official appointment to kill Indians from the governor himself. With state government support Jarboe launched a new, organized campaign of atrocities on the valley, known as \\"Jarboe's War\\" or the \\"Mendocino War\\" by the settlers. In the middle of his campaign, Jarboe declared to the governor, \\"However cruel it may be ... nothing short of extermination will suffice to rid the Country of them [the Yuki].\\" Within six months Jarboe's mercenaries had killed 283 \\"warriors\\" in 23 attacks, along with hundreds of women and children as well, and captured nearly 300 Yuki Indians to be relocated to reservations. (See Mendocino War) =California Legislature Joint Special Committee= In 1860, a Joint Special Committee of the California Legislature was formed to investigate the \\"Mendocino Indian War\\" and complaints of Indian harassment from politically influential ranchers. The majority report of this committee (authored by four of the committee's five members) states: \\"Accounts are daily coming in from the counties on the Coast Range, of sickening atrocities and wholesale slaughters of great numbers of defenseless Indians in that region of country. Within the last four months, more Indians have been killed by our people than during the century of Spanish and Mexican domination. For an evil of this magnitude, some one is responsible. Either our government, or our citizens, or both, are to blame. \\"No provocation has been shown, if any could be, to justify such acts. We must admit that the wrong has been the portion of the Indian‚Äîthe blame with his white brother. In relation to the recent difficulty between the whites and Indians in Mendocino County, your committee desire to say that no war, or a necessity for a war, has existed, or at the present time does exist. We are unwilling to attempt to dignify, by the term 'war' as slaughter of beings, who at least possess human form, and who make no resistance, and make no attacks, either on the person or residence of the citizen.\\" The majority report recommended that in order to save the Indians, it would be necessary to expand the size of the reservation by a factor of four to include nearly all of Round Valley, to buy out the White settlers with property in the valley, and to invest more money in ensuring that the Indians had protection and an adequate food supply. The minority report, authored by dissenting California House member Joseph B. Lamar (Mendocino, Sonoma), suggested instead that the settlers had acted appropriately and that the only solution was to round up the Indians as slaves and have the government provide land for their upkeep to their White masters. Despite the support of 4 out of 5 committee members, the California Legislature chose to ignore the majority report and it was never read to the full legislature. Instead, the Legislature generally took the route of Rep. Lamar in blaming the Indians for the conflict. Rep. Lamar helped to push through legislation broadening the Indians eligible to be forcibly enslaved by White settlers. An editorial in The San Francisco Herald tragically mocked the government‚Äôs disturbing position. \\"We ... propose to the Legislature to create the office of Indian Butcher, with a princely salary, and confer it upon the man who has killed most Indians in a given time, provided it be satisfactorily shown that the Indians were unarmed at the time, and the greater portion of them were squaws and papooses.\\" =State sponsorship of slaughter= Despite such criticism, California legislators indeed continued state support for the ongoing slaughter. On 12 April 1860, legislators appropriated $9,347.39 for \\"payment of the indebtedness incurred by the expedition against the Indians in the county of Mendocino.\\" They also passed a law expanding the age and condition of Indians available for forced slavery. A Sacramento Daily Union article of the time accused high-pressure lobbyists interested in profiting off enslaved Indians of pushing the law through, gave examples of how wealthy individuals had abused the law to acquire Indian slaves from the reservations, and stated, \\"The Act authorizes as complete a system of slavery, without any of the checks and wholesome restraints of slavery, as ever was devised.\\" =Close of \\"war\\"= In 1861 the editor of the Mendocino Herald visited Round Valley and declared that there were no more than five or six hundred Yuki Indians left, out of an original population that had been more than ten times larger only five years earlier. A company-sized deployment of federal soldiers finally stopped the violence against the Indians in 1862. The law allowing the kidnapping and enslavement of Indians was revoked in 1863. By 1864, only 300 Yuki Indians remained.

There are roughly 30 known sites, with population numbers in the tens of thousands. The species occurs in a range of habitats typically in areas near water bodies, mostly on dolerite geology. The species is highly fire sensitive and an increase in fire events associated with climate change may lead to local extinction in some areas and fragmentation of habitat Description Pherosphaera hookeriana is a densely-branched erect shrub or small tree growing to heights of 5 meters, branches are often small and rigid with leaves arranged spirally and fully appressed to the stem. Individual leaves can measure up to 1.5 millimetres (mm) long, and 1 mm wide, leaves are thick, blunt and concave with a rounded keel. Male flowers in compressed, terminal globular cones, ranging from 1‚Äì5 mm in diameter, with 8 to 15 fertile scales, each scale has two pollen sacs on the abaxial surface. Female flowers occur in cones on short branches that usually droop (hence the old common name) flowers are globular ranging from 2‚Äì4 mm long and have 3-8 fertile scales, with a single ovule on the upper surface of each scale. When the seed is ripe it has a hard, glossy brown coat and is approximately 1mm in diameter [Description from Curtis & Morris (1975), Hill (1998)] Identification and ecology Pherosphaera hookeriana is a dwarf conifer that has been recorded to grow up to 5 meters, but in exposed and harsh environments it may only attain a height of 0.5 meters (Minchin 1983). The foliage of Pherosphaera hookeriana is well adapted to the high altitudinal ranges it occupies, with small imbricate scale leaves, the stomata are restricted to the adaxial surface and protected by a marginal leaf frill (Hill and Brodribb 1999). The species is generally dioecious, with the reproductive organs occurring on specialised leaves arranged in cone like structures. Pollen is wind dispersed and seed ripening occurs by late April (Wood & Rudman 2015). It is unclear if the plant produces seed annually or produces mass seed every few years (mast seeding). Recruitment of seed appears to happen only rarely and is restricted to moist, shady areas. Seed is noted as having a physiological dormancy which could potentially result in a soil stored seed bank with germination being staggered over several years. It is unknown how long the seed is viable in the soil for, but preliminary studies show that the seed requires warm stratification and then cold stratification to elicit germination; so the earliest recruitment would take place is in the second spring/summer following dispersal (Wood & Rudman 2015). Seedlings superficially resemble small lycopods, with narrow spreading leaves. The seeds are not winged so it is expected to drop within a few meters of the parent plant. It has been suggested that dispersal over long distances via water is possible for plants occurring near lakes and rivers. Pherosphaera hookeriana may form extensive clonal colonies via vegetative growth (Fitzgerald 2011). Like most endemic alpine conifers to Tasmania, the growth rate of Pherosphaera hookeriana is extremely slow. Plants that have a stem diameter of 3‚Äì6 cm having an estimated age of 250‚Äì300 years on Mawson Plateau (Minchin 1983) with the actual maximum ages likely exceeding 500 years. The time frame for plants to reach reproductive maturity is unknown, though there were observations of fruiting plants on the Tarn Shelf in 2016 in areas that suffered fire damage in 1966. Pherosphaera hookeriana is one of only two species in the genus, and is one of the five taxa in the family Podocarpaceae with four being endemic to Tasmania (de Salas & Baker 2016). This species can be confused with the more widespread and often co-occurring Tasmanian endemic shrubby conifer, Diselma archeri. Distribution and habitat Pherosphaera hookeriana is endemic to Tasmania's west, southwest and central plateau, the current distribution of the species is most likely to be a reflection of post-glacial expansion from refugia and subsequent fire events (Kirkpatrick & Dickinson 1984) Pherosphaera hookeriana exists in altitudinal ranges from 600 to 1300 meters above sea level in a wide range of habitats from alpine to Sphagnum bogs, the common element through the environments the species inhabits is the high soil moisture content and annual rainfall. There are confirmed records indicating that the species ranges from the Walls of Jerusalem in the north to Mount La Perouse in the south (Tasmanian threatened species guide 2016). Most populations of the species occurs on Jurassic dolerite, an exception is a stand in Artichoke Valley near Frenchmans Cap on sedimentary deposits. Distribution of Mount Mawson Pine in Tasmania, Australia Population Mount Field has long been recognized as the stronghold for the species with areas of coniferous heath being dominated or co-dominated by the species. There are approximately 30 known stands of the species with an estimated population of 20,000. There is a high likelihood that there are stands of the species that have yet to been found particularly in the Walls of Jerusalem National Park. Conservation Pherosphaera hookeriana was listed as rare under the Tasmanian Threatened species protection act of 1995 under the old name Microstrobos niphophilus, in 2001 it was changed to vulnerable. The chance of the whole species being destroyed in a single large scale disturbance is negligible given the species geographic range. However the chance of local extinction in individual stands or subpopulations appears to be increasing (the Lake Mackenzie fire in early 2016 is evidence of the fire threat to montane conifers). Populations occurring at lower altitudinal ranges close to flammable vegetation communities are considered to be at extreme risk of fire damage over the coming decades. Another prominent issue is that anecdotal reports suggest that the rate of seedling recruitment and establishment is extremely low. The possibility that many of the stands of this species are clonal in combination with the breeding strategy, could potentially set a limit of viable seed set in some areas. Climate change and the trends towards a warmer climate with a greater chance of extreme events such as drought and fires are likely to have a direct and adverse effect on the population. Severe declines or local extinction in the more susceptible regions are predicted to occur by the end of the century. Reference list # Curtis, W.M. & Morris, D.I. (1975).

Operational history = Division z.b.V. 444 = The Division z.b.V. 444 was established on 25 October 1939 in Darmstadt, which was in the XII Military District. It was renamed to 444th Security Division in mid-March 1941. = 444th Security Division = The division was formed on 15 March 1941 near Ohlau in Silesia, in the VIII Military District, from the staff of Division z.b.V. 444 and elements of the 221st Infantry Division. During the whole war, the 444th Security Division operated in the occupied Ukraine and Southern Russia regions behind Army Group South's front lines. Its duties included security of communications and supply lines, economic exploitation and combatting partisans in Wehrmacht's rear areas in conjunction with nearby German units. Along with other security and police forces in the occupied territories, the division participated in war crimes against prisoners of war and the civilian population. The division was subordinated to Karl von Roques, commander of Army Group South Rear Area. Similar to 454th Security Division, it undertook \\"cleansing actions\\" in the areas that the locals claimed harboured \\"partisans\\" (the term \\"partisan\\" was used interchangeably with \\"commissar\\", \\"Bolshevik\\", \\"Jew\\" and \\"guerrilla\\"). From November 1941, the division was ordered to recruit a Turkic unit among the prisoners of war in the prison camps. Hence, a Turkestan regiment (of four companies) was created in November 1942. In early January 1943, now in Army Group A, six Kalmykian cavalry squadrons were placed under the command of the division as the Kalmyk detachment. In February 1943, it was subordinated to the 4th Panzer Army, then to the Armee-Abteilung Hollidt and its successor, the 6th Army.

Life  Maria Harm was born in Degerloch, by that time a quarter in the city of Stuttgart, the capital of the semi-autonomous Kingdom of W√ºrttemberg. She attended school locally between 1901 and 1909, and then undertook factory and office work. She was employed until 1926 by the shoe manufacturer Schuhfabrik Haueisen & Cie AG at their Degerloch and nearby Bad Cannstatt locations. She married Ludwig Walter in 1916 and joined the newly launched Communist Party (KPD) in 1920. She became a member of the regional leadership of the para-military Red Women's and Girls' League (\\"RFMB- Gauleitung\\") and was also, for a time, chair of the RFMB in W√ºrttemberg. Within the mainstream party, between 1928 and 1933 she was head of the women's department of the regional leadership team (\\"Bezirksleitung\\"). Maria Walter was elected a member of the Regional Parliament (\\"Landtag von W√ºrttemberg\\"), representing the Communist Party, in 1932. She had also, by this time, participated in 1930 in a course for party officers at the Communist Party's national academy (\\"Reichsparteischule\\") in Berlin-Fichtenau. R√©gime change in January 1933 marked he start of a rapid transition to one-party dictatorship. The Reichstag fire in February 1933 was blamed in \\"communists\\" with an implausible level of immediacy, and was followed by the arrest of people who had been identified as politically active Communist Party members during the Weimar years. Maria Walter emigrated to Switzerland. However, at the beginning of September 1934 she returned to Stuttgart - according to one source on health grounds. In November 1939 and again in June 1944 she was arrested and detained for a number of weeks. Subsequently, she was no longer politically involved. Maria Walter died on 1 May 1988 in Stuttgart.

She was the first wife of artist Francis Picabia.  Biography  Gabrielle Buffet was the daughter of Alph√©e Buffet and his wife Laure Hugueteau de Chaill√©. She studied music at the Schola Cantorum in Paris with Vincent d'Indy, later in Berlin with Ferruccio Busoni. She grew up with a brother artist who painted in the classical manner (See: classicism), far removed from the visionary works of her future husband, the painter Francis Picabia, whom she married in January 1909. Her influence inspired Picabia to compose his paintings as musical pieces. In Zurich Gabrielle and Francis met Hans Arp and Tristan Tzara. In October 1912, while she was with her mother in the family home of √âtival, Picabia rejoined her along with Guillaume Apollinaire and Marcel Duchamp.Gabri√®le Buffet-Picabia, Aires abstraites, Pierre Cailler √âditeur, Geneva, 1957 Apollinaire there completed his poem Zone, which begins the cycle entitled Alcools. This journey served as an inspiration to Duchamp who wrote four \\" notes marginales \\" \\" Route Jura-Paris \\" from La Bo√Æte de 1914.Duchamp du signe, Flammarion, collection \\" Champs\\", 1994, (pp. 41‚Äì42). Duchamp created a prelude to his work La Mari√©e mise √† nu par ses c√©libataires, m√™me. On the basis of the meeting, a book was published with essays on Cubism, Les peintres cubistes, by Apollinaire, financed by Picabia.Quoted from the Weblink jura- paris-centenary.com In the magazine View, Charles Henry Ford describes her as one of the first to write a serious account of 'Duchamphenomena'. The marriage with Francis Picabia, which gave four children, Laure, Pancho, Jeanine and Vincente, ended in divorce in 1930. From 1941, during the Second World War, she was a member of the French Resistance in Paris, alongside Samuel Beckett, Mary Reynolds, Suzanne Picabia and others.Mary Reynolds , artic.edu, accessdate 27 March 2017 She died in 1985, well past the age of 104.

It specializes in high-end image quality where it is claimed to produce significantly smaller files than prior encoders at equivalent quality, albeit at very low speed. It is named after the Swiss German expression for Biscuits, in line with the names of other compression technology from Google.  Properties  Guetzli is known to be very resource intensive, requiring several orders of magnitude more processing time than other JPEG encoders, and a lot of memory. Guetzli supports only the top of JPEG's quality range (quantizer settings 84‚Äì100) and supports only sequential (non-\\"progressive\\") encoding. The performance of the Butteraugli quality metric it optimizes for breaks down below that range and starves some areas too much. Guetzli is more effective with bigger files. It is often placed in line with other bits of Google technology that are used to cut down web page load times, while Google itself describes it also as a demonstration of the potential of psychovisual optimizations to motivate further research to benefit future JPEG encoders, and acknowledges the often impractically low speed of their code. Two tests found that Guetzli is very slow (it's about 4 magnitudes slower than normal JPEG encoder) and not necessarily better than mozjpeg.  Availability  It is implemented as a command-line tool in C++ and the source code published on GitHub as free software under the terms of version 2 of the Apache license. Several important Linux distributions have packages available in their official repositories. For Arch Linux there are user repositories available. There is a macOS version packaged in the Homebrew repository. There are graphical user interfaces and prebuilt Windows binaries available elsewhere on the Internet. For web development with node.js, there is a Guetzli package available in the Node Package Manager (npm). The first public version was released on October 21, 2016, without any speed optimizations, and only announced on a specialist forum. Version 1.0 followed five months later on March 15, 2017, accompanied by an announcement to a broader public and two scientific papers.  Technology  Guetzli uses methods to optimize compression efficiency that target mainly the quantization step. It constructs custom quantization tables for each file, decides on color subsampling, and quantizes some adjacent DCT coefficients to zero, balancing benefits in the run-length encoding of coefficients and preservation of perceived image fidelity. Zeroing the right coefficients is the most effective tool in Guetzli, which is used as a makeshift means of spatially adaptive quantization. The optimizations are guided by Butteraugli.  Butteraugli  Butteraugli is a newly introduced objective image quality assessment metric. It assigns a differential mean opinion score (DMOS) value to the difference between an original image and a degraded version. It is significantly more complex than traditional metrics like PSNR and SSIM, but claimed to perform better with high-end quality, where degradations are not or barely noticeable. It models color perception and visual masking in the human visual system, taking into account that the eye is imaging different colors with different precision. It uses a heat map of changes. How the hundreds of parameters that model the properties of the human visual system were derived remains unexplained. An in-house performance evaluation with 614 ratings from 23 people on their own test set of 31 images yielded 75% of ratings favouring of JPEGs encoded for Butteraugli scores over libjpeg-turbo encodes, which usually score higher on SSIM and PSNRHVS-M. Translating to \\"butter eye\\", the Swiss- German name originally signifies a dimple on top of some sweet pastry that has been filled with butter and sugar before baking.

Ligules up to 2mm long, firm with tiny hairs on their margins and backs. Flowering spikelets are broadly ovate to lanceolate, 2‚Äì6 flowered, green or purplish, often viviparous. P. constantina and P. fawcettiae can be identified from P. gunnii due to the features of the lemma and the prickliness of the leaves.  Etymology  P. gunnii (GUNN-ee-i) after prominent Tasmanian plant collector Ronald Campbell Gunn (1808‚Äì1881) who collected the type specimemn from \\"summit of Mt. Wellington(/Kunanyi)\\" in 1841.

Challenging the Lutheran orthodoxy as an early proponent of freedom of religion in Sweden, he founded the society of Pietists based in the Diocese of Gothenburg, a society part of which was later integrated into the Church of Sweden.https://archive.org/stream/kyrkohistoriskr01swegoog/kyrkohistoriskr01swegoog_djvu.txt Biography Peter Spaak was born 1696 in Uddevalla, Bohusl√§n, Sweden. His father Elias Jon√¶ Spaak served as the local Postmaster and Deputy Customs Chief Inspector, and his maternal grandfather was the Chief Judge Johan Larsson Crantzberg. Peter Spaak's brother Magnus Spaak (1699‚Äì1768) emigrated to Brussels, Belgium, becoming the primogenitor of the family cadet branch there, including his nephew :fr:Jacques Joseph Spaak (1742-1825). Peter Spaak was married twice. The first time was to Clara Charlotta Esberg, daughter of Zacharias Esberg the older, bishop electus of the Diocese of V√§xj√∂ and sister of Zacharias Esberg the Younger, vicar of Uddevalla. His second marriage was to Ingrid Maria Bagge, daughter of Eva Christina Radhe Palmencrona, and great granddaughter of Nils Fredriksson Bagge, Mayor of Marstrand. Professionally, Spaak served as Chief Inspector of the Customs service, and Postmaster in Uddevalla. Influenced by the pietism of the German theologian Johann Conrad Dippel, along with Thomas Leopold and Johan Stendahl, Peter Spaak became one of the most prominent early proponents of the movement in Sweden. Originally, the new ideas were met with much opposition, culminating in the Conventicle Act in 1726. Like Leopold and Stendahl, at one time Spaak was threatened with prison sentence for heresy. However, contrary to the fate of the former two he was eventually relieved of the allegations, attributed to his contacts with the authorities, including notably family connections to clerics such as Zacharias Esberg the older and Zacharias Esberg the Younger, as well as Jacob Benzelius and Erik Benzelius the younger, the latter both subsequent archbishops of Uppsala.https://redviking.se/wp3/?page_id=990 The movement gained significant influence throughout the Diocese of Gothenburg. Spaak established a society based in Uddevalla. For a period from 1734 onwards, Spaak resided in Stockholm, where he came in contact with the Skevikare radicals on V√§rmd√∂. Around this time, Riksdag meetings evaluated the influences of Pietism in the realm, having gained supporters also among mainline Protestant clergy, with Spaak, Sven Ros√©n, and others making early appeals to freedom of religion in opposition to the staunch Lutheran orthodoxy. Peter Spaak died 1769 in Gothenburg. Soon after, the initial criticism by the state authorities against the perceived cultural radicalism of the dissident Petists was relaxed, and the movement gained more popularity, right up to the Royal court. King Gustav III visited the Skevikare incognito in 1779. King Gustav IV Adolf made an official visit in 1797 with \\"tokens of appreciation\\". With time, Pietism was eventually reevaluated as a legitimate expression of Lutheranism. By consequence, following the increased acceptance by the mainstream Protestant society, in the mid-19th century, a part of the Pietist movement was fully integrated into the official Evangelical-Lutheran Church of Sweden, although another part would persist in Radical Pietist deference into a Uddevalla local predecessor of the Protestant Uniting Church in Sweden, independent of the state church. Subsequent to the great fire of Uddevalla in 1806, a stone house was erected for the Pietist adherents which gave the street block its name, Herrnhut. The building, later purchased by the municipality, remained until another fire in the 1980s.Uddevalla Missionsf√∂rsamlings 100-√•rsskrift (1978) See also * Spaak * :sv:Evangeliska Br√∂draf√∂rsamlingen i Norden * Mission Covenant Church of Sweden References 1696 births 1769 deaths 17th- century Swedish people 18th-century Swedish people Age of Liberty people People from Uddevalla Municipality Postmasters Swedish Protestants Radical Pietism ","title":"Peter Spaak"},{"id":"53609449","text":"Tanzania pusillus is a jumping spider that lives in Tanzania.

It is a ground orchid with a single, sparsely hairy leaf and one or two white, pink or purplish flowers. Only about one thousand plants in two populations have been recorded and the species has been declared as \\"vulnerable\\". Description Caladenia versicolor is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and a single sparsely hairy leaf, 50‚Äì100 mm long and 6‚Äì8 mm wide with reddish blotches. One or two white, pink or purplish flowers 50‚Äì60 mm wide are borne on a spike 150‚Äì250 mm tall. The sepals and petals have blackish or brownish thread-like tips. The dorsal sepal is erect, 40‚Äì60 mm long and 2‚Äì3 mm wide. The lateral sepals are 40‚Äì60 mm long, 3‚Äì5 mm wide and spread stiffly apart from each other. The petals are 30‚Äì37 mm long, about 3 mm wide, and arranged like the lateral sepals. The labellum is white, pink or purplish, 12‚Äì16 mm long and 7‚Äì9 mm wide. The sides of the labellum have narrow teeth up to 3mm long, decreasing in length towards the tip which is curled under, and there are four or six rows of pink or purplish calli up to 1 mm long, along its centre. Flowering occurs from September to November. Taxonomy and naming Caladenia versicolor was first formally described in 1991 by Geoffrey Carr and the description was published in Indigenous Flora and Fauna Association Miscellaneous Paper 1. The specific epithet (versicolor) is a Latin word meaning \\"of different colours\\". Distribution and habitat The candy spider orchid is only known from two populations in Victoria, south- west of Stawell where there are about 800 plants and east of Balmoral where 175 individuals were recorded in 2012. It grows in woodland. Conservation Caladenia versicolor is classified as \\"endangered\\" under the Victorian Flora and Fauna Guarantee Act 1988 and as \\"vulnerable\\" under the Australian Government Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999. The main threats to the species are trampling, grazing by feral rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) and inappropriate fire regimes.

In the past it was common to spay the chickens early in life to ensure desirable meat quality, similar to the castration of a capon. Similar terms are often confused: in English, pullet refers to a young hen, generally under one year old. Sometimes it is more specific, indicating a hen which is fully grown but has not reached ‚Äòpoint-of-lay‚Äô, i.e. has not yet started laying eggs, which often happens between 16 and 24 weeks of age, depending on breed. Poulard (no 'e') can be used to mean \\"roaster\\", i.e. a young chicken weighing up to 6-7 pounds and living 10-12 weeks, as opposed to smaller \\"broiler\\" chickens weighing less than 3 pounds. In French, poussin is a newly hatched chick (either sex), poulet is a young chick (either sex), poulette is a female young chicken (one form of a poulet, and corresponding to the male coquelet), poularde is a poulette deliberately fattened for eating (often spayed, and the equivalent of the castrated male chapon = capon), and a poule is an egg-laying hen (corresponding to the coq = cockerel). Poularde is used in English in the context of cooking (as opposed to poultry farming); Larousse Gastronomique lists around 98 recipes for \\"Poulardes et poulets\\" with a further 100 or more for \\"Farm-raised chickens\\". In France many varieties of poularde exist, including the Poularde de Bresse, the Poularde du Mans and the Poularde de Lou√©, which are generally protected by the AOC or Label Rouge certifications.. The high price of these chickens meant that they were traditionally reserved for holiday meals, such as Christmas feasts.

According to experts, Turkish media ownership structure prevents citizens from receiving reliable information. In Turkey, 40% of all media are owned by eight media groups. Half of these top media owners have investments in at least three out of four media types (radio, TV, newspapers and online web portals). The top media owners, Doƒüan and Kalyon Groups, have investments in all four media types and share 10% and 7% of all media audience respectively. These groups are followed by Demir√∂ren Group (6%), Ciner Group (5%), Doƒüu≈ü Group (4%) and state-owned Turkish Radio and Television (TRT) (3%). Among the shareholders of companies that own the top 40 media outlets, most are commercial corporations. The conglomerates they own (Doƒüan, Doƒüu≈ü, Demir√∂ren, Ciner, Albayrak, Turkuvaz/Zirve/Kalyon, ƒ∞hlas and Ethem Sancak companies) operate in sectors such as construction, energy, mining and tourism. Some of them have won major public tenders in the past few years, ranging from the third airport in Istanbul to metro construction and urban redevelopment projects.  Media landscape  Experts state that it is almost impossible to get access to basic financial data on the Turkish media market. Therefore, most of the information on concentration of media ownership rely on news analyses, secondary sources and the analysis of the concentration of media audience. As to the radio in Turkey, there are 36 national, 102 regional, 952 local radio stations totalling 1090. The public broadcast Turkish Radio and Television (TRT) held the radio monopoly until 1992. Currently, it holds two radio stations in the top 10 list of radios dominating the sector. Instead, among media groups, Doƒüan Group (Radyo D, Slow T√ºrk, CNN T√ºrk) and Doƒüu≈ü Group (Kral FM, NTV Radio, Kral Pop Radio, Kral World Radio) are the two media companies dominating the sector, with 2 radio stations each in the top 10 list. With regard to the television landscape, in Turkey there are 108 television channels and 83 radio-TVs in total; 14 of which are national, 11 regional, 83 local. Public broadcast Turkish Radio and Television Corporation (TRT), owns 13 channels in total. TRT held the monopoly in television broadcasting until the 1990s. Star 1, the first private TV station, was founded in 1990. The first law for private broadcasting was enacted in 1993. At the moment, out of the top 10 TV channels that hold the most audience six belong to Doƒüu≈ü, Doƒüan and Kalyon Groups. As to print media, according to the Turkish Statistical Institute (T√úƒ∞K) 172 national, 112 regional and 2.447 local newspapers were published in 2015, totalling 2.731. According to data achieved from the Press Advertising Authority (Basƒ±n ƒ∞lan Kurumu- Bƒ∞K), Doƒüan and Kalyon Groups both own two among the most popular Turkish dailies. ƒ∞hlas Group, Estetik Yayƒ±ncƒ±lƒ±k, Ciner Group, Demir√∂ren Group, Albayrak Group and Ethem Sancak own one newspaper each. Except for Doƒüan's H√ºrriyet and Posta, and Burak Akbay's S√∂zc√º, all newspapers in the top 10 list belong to groups that are close to the ruling AKP. All owners except for one (Burak Akbay) have major investments outside of media that depend on state contracts. BirG√ºn and Cumhuriyet- two critical newspapers with an independent editorial policy- are owned, respectively: by various unions, NGOs and sponsors and by the Cumhuriyet Foundation. With regard to online media, most of the alternative online news platforms survive with the assistance of European Union's funds and by raising donations. For instance, the Independent Communication Network Bianet, is mainly funded by the EU Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights. As to news agencies, the largest news agency in Turkey- Anadolu Agency (AA)- is a joint stock company which was founded by the state of Turkey. Its shares are owned by the Undersecretariat of Treasury.  Legal framework  The issue of concentration of media ownership is regulated in Turkey both by sector- specific regulations and by competition law. The international standards the Turkish system should refer to in the field of media pluralism and diversity, are those developed by the Council of Europe, which defines pluralism and diversity in terms of structural (ownership) diversity in the media market and in terms of pluralism of ideas and cultural diversity. = Broadcasting sector = Media concentration is regulated under Law No. 6112 on Establishment of Radio and Television Enterprises and their Media Services (2011), for audio- visual media. The Turkish Competition Authority (Rekabet Kurumu) is entitled to take action against distortion of competition according to another law, i.e. the Law on the Protection of Competition. Therefore, as for the broadcasting sector there are sector-specific regulatory safeguards against a high horizontal concentration. For instance, the Law requires companies that are about to take over or merge with others to seek permission from the Radio and Television Supreme Council (Radyo ve Televizyon √úst Kurulu- RT√úK) and to inform it about transactions not later than 30 days after their completion. The regulatory framework also foresees a monitoring (administrative or judicial authority) and a sanctioning system. The sanctioning/enforcement system foresees the imposition of proportionate remedies against breaches of regulation. Possible remedial measures include: * Refusal of additional licences; * Blocking of a merger or acquisition; * Obligation to allocate windows for third party programming; * Obligation to give up licences/activities in other media sectors; * Divestiture. However, these remedies are not always effectively used. Law No. 6112 increased the limit of foreign shareholding rate in the broadcasting sector: the cap was raised from 25 to 50%. It fastly led to national and international mergers: for instance, Discovery Communications entered into a partnership with Doƒüus Media Group. The latter will be responsible for broadcasting Discovery Channel, Animal Planet and Discovery Planet. Also, Digiturk was acquired by BeIN Media Group, which led among other things to the entrance of the Al Jazeera Media Network in the Turkish media landscape. = Print = In the realm of print media, regulatory safeguards on media ownership concentration and a monitoring authority do exist under Law No. 5187 (2004), but there is no respective sanctioning system. Consequently, sanctioning and enforcement powers are not used. = Online media = There is no specific regulation for the concentration of media ownership in the online sector. Such sector falls under the scope of the Competition Authority. However, the Radio and Television Supreme Council (RT√úK) decisions on concentration of media service providers are not public. Therefore, monitoring whether media service providers notified the RT√úK for a share transfer or not is impossible to determine. = Regulatory authorities = Radio and Television Supreme Council (RT√úK) is the authority for the regulation and supervision of radio, television and on demand media services. For online and print media, the supervising and sanctioning authority is the Turkish Competition Authority. According to a 2011 TESEV (Turkish Economic and Social Studies Foundation) Report, due to the high number of complaints that are submitted to this authority, only 10% of them have been taken into consideration. According to an expert, appointment processes for RT√úK should be re-structured as to minimize political influence over appointments.  Cross-ownership  Cross-ownership refers to the concentration of ownership in different media sectors (i.e. across TV‚Äì Print‚Äì Radio‚Äì Online). In 2002, Law No. 4756 removed many cross-ownership restrictions, allowing, for example, a media company to own 244 local and regional and 30 national stations all at once. In the 2016 survey by MOM (Media Ownership Monitor), cross-ownership concentration in Turkey is measured by adding and weighting the market shares of the Top 8 owners across all sectors. The top eight owners of media in Turkey share approximately 40% of the cross-media audience in the country which results in a low risk for media ownership concentration, as to the MOM's parameters. Half of the top media owners have investments in at least three media sectors. The same company can only provide one radio, one television and one on demand broadcast service, and a real person or a legal entity can directly or indirectly hold shares in a maximum of four media service providers. However, in the event a real person or legal entity holds shares in more than one media service provider, the annual total commercial communication income of media service providers in which a real person or a legal entity is a direct or indirect shareholder cannot exceed thirty per cent of the total commercial communication income of the media sector.  Concentration of media audience  The horizontal concentration of audience and readership across media platforms as to July 2016 has been measured by the Media Ownership Monitor Turkey project. Concentration was measured by using the Top 4 largest audience share for each media type. As to audience concentration in television, the survey found a medium level of concentration (44%). Out of the four top media owners in the market, three are considered generally to be pro-government. The channels of the public broadcaster TRT hold 11% of the shares. With regard to audience concentration in television, the survey again found a medium level of concentration (44%). 11% of the shared are owned by state-run channels while 21% by the pro-government Doƒüu≈ü Media Group. With regard to the print sector, the Media Ownership Monitor survey shows that the level of audience concentration is high (59%). Similarly, there is a high audience concentration in the online sector (55%): online media outlets largely coincide with major print outlets in Turkey. 10 out of 15 online news portals with a high audience, are web sites of print or TV outlets.  Political and economic influence on media owners  Links between media owners and other actors operating in the economic and/or in the political sphere may lead to undue pressures and influences on the editorial policies of media organizations. With regard to political influences, since 2011- under Law No. 6112 on Broadcasters- broadcasting licenses can no longer be allocated to political parties, labor or employer unions, professional associations, cooperatives, foundations, local government bodies, companies established or partially owned by these institutions or financial institutions, and real and corporate entities that partially own these intermediary institutions. However, despite legal provisions, according to an expert, political clientelism in the media field has been at its peak for the last decade. After the 1980s, the media ownership structure changed dramatically due to the liberal economic politics under the Prime Minister Turgut √ñzal: businessmen from a non-journalism background acquired key media outlets or launched new ones. The ban on media conglomerates' bidding in public tenders was removed in 2001. As to the 2016 survey by MOM (Media Ownership Monitor), the share of TV media owned by politically affiliated entities results in 52%, that of radio channels in 40%, for newspapers is 52% and for online media 52%. In some cases -such as that of Doƒüu≈ü Media and Doƒüan Media - political affiliations of media owners/executives have come to light through wiretaps or leaked correspondence allegedly between media owners/executives and government officials. With regard to the economic influence, most of the shareholders of companies that own the top 40 media outlets are commercial corporations. According to an expert, one of the reasons why big conglomerates are almost the only owners in the media market is a consequence of the government's intolerance toward criticism. Such intolerance to criticism, which heavily influenced the work of media actors‚Äô working attitudes and made it impossible for them media outlets to be seen as reliable sources of news by the public. Therefore, it rendered it very difficult for them and therefore to reach have an economical sustainability for their media businesses.from the media businesses. Thus, only big media conglomerates, in such a context, can sustain such a non- profitable activity, thanks to the profits they can gain from other business activities they are involved in. These conglomerates (Doƒüan, Doƒüu≈ü, Demir√∂ren, Ciner, Albayrak, Turkuvaz/Zirve/Kalyon, ƒ∞hlas and Ethem Sancak companies) operate in sectors such as banking, construction, energy, mining and tourism. Some of them, such as the Albayrak group, Turkuvaz/Zirve/Kalyon group, ƒ∞hlas group and Doƒüu≈ü have won major public tenders in the past few years, ranging from the third airport in Istanbul to metro construction and urban redevelopment projects on a neighbourhood scale. Throughout 2015 and 2016, government's trustees were appointed to allegedly Gulenist-affiliated media outlets and companies. For instance, a takeover took place in October 26, 2015 for the Koza-Ipek Media Group, which owned, among others, Bugun and Millet dailies and Cihan News Agency. Similarly, trustees were appointed on March 5, 2016, for Feza Holding, the media holding publishing, among others, the most read newspaper in Turkey, Zaman, and the English-language daily Today's Zaman. The assets of these companies are currently under the jurisdiction of the government's Savings Deposit Insurance Fund (TMSF), and it is not clear if the companies will be either dissolved or sold off. After the July 2016 coup attempt, a state of emergency was declared. Under emergency decree No. 687 of February 9, 2017, Turkey's Saving Deposit Insurance Fund (TMSF) will be authorized to sell companies seized by the state through the appointment of trustees. Also, through the use of emergency decrees- such as Nos. 668 (July 27, 2016), 675 (October 29, 2016) and 677 (November 22, 2016), 178 media organizations were closed down being charged of having terrorist affiliations. As to November 2016, Twenty-four of these shut-down media organizations were radio stations, twenty- eight televisions, eighty newspapers.  Influence of Advertising Financing  As advertising is an important income for media providers and the allocation of advertisements may influence editorial policies or weaken certain media rather than others, media service providers (broadcasters) shall report their monthly commercial advertisement income to the RT√úK, by the 20th day of the following month. The distribution of public funds on advertising is existentially an important source of income for smaller papers but the relative data remain hidden. For instance, the request of information on this topic by the Media Ownership Monitor was refused by the Turkish Right to Information Assessment Council, citing ‚Äútrade secrets‚Äù as a reason. Following the coup attempt, on October 5, 2016, regulations regarding the Press Advertising Institution (Basƒ±n ƒ∞lan Kurumu- Bƒ∞K)- the authority managing public announcements and advertising- were changed. According to this contested regulation,Regulation No. 29848, October 5, 2010, Art. No. 110. any news outlet that employs a journalist who is being tried on terrorism related charges will not be given state advertising, unless the employee is fired from the media organization in five days.  The case of Doƒüan Media Group  Arbitrary tax penalties are often imposed to force critical newspapers into bankruptcy, after which they reappear usually under the ownership of government-related groups or individuals. Mainly due to commercial self- interests, Doƒüan Media Group's outlets have been taking a critical stance towards the ruling AKP. The government had a series of run-ins with it over the tax debts of Mr Doƒüan. The process continued with negotiations with the Ministry of Finance which resulted in the confiscation of Doƒüan TV holding stocks in 2009. The last development of this episode took place in April 2011,when the media group stated that it had agreed to sell its two major newspapers, Milliyet and Vatan, to the Demir√∂ren‚ÄìKaracan joint venture for US$74 million. The Karacan family decided to set up a partnership with Demir√∂ren Group (DG), whose main interests are the distribution and retail sale of Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG), petroleum, as well as real-estate development, construction, mining, and metal products. According to the circulation figures, as to 2012 Milliyet and Vatan combined held a 6 percent share in the Turkish newspaper market, where over 30 newspapers sell a total of some 5 million print copies every day.  Civil society initiatives  The Media Pluralism Monitor run by the European University Institute of Fiesole added Turkey among the monitored countries in 2016, working in partnership with the Galatasaray University. The project consists in a European-wide monitoring tool of risks for media pluralism: it is aimed at identifying threats to such pluralism based on a set of indicators, covering pertinent legal, economic and socio-cultural considerations. Furthermore, in 2016, Reporters Without Borders, together with the Turkish independent press agency Bianet, launched the project Media Ownership Monitor Turkey to promote transparency in media ownership and to map who owns and controls the media in Turkey, by creating a public available and updated database listing the owners of the main media outlets (both individual owners and media companies) and detailing also the interests and the affiliations of owners into companies or political parties. Another civil society initiative is the Network Data Compiling, a collective data compiling and mapping project dedicated to pursue the relations between capital and power in Turkey, released on July 14, 2014.

History In late 2011, guitarist/vocalist Jordan Cook moved to Seattle, Washington, from Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, where he was introduced to David \\"Stitch\\" Rapaport and Joseph Braley from the band The Mothers Anger. Cook formed the band Reignwolf and invited Rapaport and Braley to join him. In August 2013, after more than a full year of nonstop touring, the band released their first single, \\"Are You Satisfied?\\", the same day they performed at Lollapalooza. Later that year, they announced they had been selected as the direct support act on Black Sabbath‚Äôs 2014 North American tour. Two more singles followed (\\"In the Dark\\" and \\"Lonely Sunday\\"), and Reignwolf was declared one of \\"10 New Artists You Need to Know\\" by Rolling Stone in January 2014. The band played their final show of the year on New Year's Eve, 31 December 2014, at The Showbox in Seattle. In 2015, Reignwolf signed with Stardog Records under the Republic/UMG umbrella and went into the studio to write and record their debut album. During that time, they appeared in the episode \\"What Would Phil Do?\\" of Cameron Crowe's Showtime series Roadies. The album was never completed, however, and the band and label parted ways. Reignwolf returned in 2016 with a new bass player, Stacey James Kardash, for one show only at Voodoo Festival in New Orleans. September 2018 saw the band back on the road for a full North American headlining tour spanning close to forty shows, where they tested out new material in addition to playing their past catalog. In December 2018, they entered Sea Horse Studios in Los Angeles to try recording their debut album once more. Additional tracks were also recorded at Full Color Music and Recording in Saskatoon. Released on 1 February 2019, \\"Black and Red\\" was the first single from Hear Me Out, which came out on 1 March 2019. The band set out on a six-city record release tour before being named the opener on eleven shows for The Who on their Moving On! Tour. Appearances at such notable festivals as Bunbury, Osheaga, and Music Midtown followed, along with a direct support slot for Wu-Tang Clan at Aragon Ballroom in Chicago.

In the winter of 1629 Hong Taiji bypassed Ming's northeastern defenses by breaching the Great Wall of China west of the Shanhai Pass and reached the outskirts of Beijing before being repelled by reinforcements from Shanhai Pass. The Later Jin secured large amounts of war material by looting the region around Beijing. This was the first time the Jurchens had broken through the Great Wall into China proper since they rose up against Ming China. Course of battle In the winter of 1629 the Jin army broke through the Great Wall at Longjin Pass and Da'an Pass, west of Shanhai Pass. The Jin first secured Jizhou by encircling it and then advanced towards Zunhua, which fell easily with the help of defectors. The Ming official Liu Zhilun attempted to thwart the Jin invaders with two units of gunners, but his men mutinied and they died under a volley of arrows. Zhao Shuaijiao also died at Zunhua. Ming general Man Gui rushed to intercept the Jin army with 5,000 troops, but they were repulsed and driven toward Beijing's Desheng Gate, Man Gui was severely injured in close-quarters combat. Beijing's garrisons tried to support Man Gui with cannon fire, but ended up hitting Man Gui and his troops. Man Gui was forced to retreat into Beijing after losing 40 percent of his men. Another Ming general Hou Shilu attempted to intervene, but his forces were routed. At that point the Chongzhen Emperor started pleading the high officials in the capital to use their own personal funds and horses to supply the army. As the Jin army was about to assault the northern wall of Beijing, Yuan Chonghuan and Zu Dashou arrived from the northeast with reinforcements and drove back the invaders. After that Yuan was assigned the defense of the Guangqu Gate. Man Gui's army attempted to fortify the outskirts of Beijing with palisades, but an elite Jin army attacked, crushing his forces, Sun Zushou tried to save Man Gui from Jin encirclement but was injured by an arrow shot in his forehead, in the end both of them died, Man Gui's deputy generals Hei Yunlong and Ma Dengyun were captured by the Jin army. Zu Dashou attempted similar operations, but was also defeated by Jin cavalry and forced to flee east. Another contingent of Ming forces was defeated at the Marco Polo Bridge. More reinforcements were called in from the west, which contributed to the general mayhem as they looted their way to Beijing. Yongping fell to the Jin in early 1630 and the invaders captured some 22,000 taels as well as large amounts of food supplies. The Jin army attempted to advance further but was repulsed by Yuan Chonghuan and his commanders who personally fought against the Jin army at close quarters. Hong Taiji attempted to negotiate with the Chongzhen Emperor, but his envoys elicited no response. The Jin army retreated to Shenyang in the spring of 1630, but commanders and garrisons were left behind to occupy the cities they had captured. The Ming managed to retake these cities by mid-spring of 1630. Aftermath While the Jin had not managed to capture Beijing, they acquired significant amounts of war booty in the form of taels, grain, supplies, weapons, and captives. Hong Taiji released accusations through captured eunuchs implicating Yuan Chonghuan of colluding with him. Believing these claims, Chongzhen ordered the arrest and imprisonment of Yuan. Yuan was accused of having fired cannons at Man Gui's troops and injured Man Gui, colluding with the Jin, and executing Mao Wenlong on false charges. He was executed on 22 September 1630. Banditry in the Ming countryside continued. Hong Chengchou was called in to suppress rebels, but his subordinates, in particular the brothers Cao Wenzhao and Cao Bianjiao were reckless. Soldiers slaughtered rebels as well as civilians alike to turn in heads for rewards. At one point an official even submitted female heads, claiming they were bandits. He was demoted. It was estimated that by 1631 there were roughly 200,000 rebels separated into 36 groups. Among the rebels that popped up, Zhang Xianzhong and Li Zicheng would play major roles in the fall of the dynasty in the next 15 years. Zhang Xianzhong was a native of Yan'an, Shaanxi. He was said to be strong, valiant, but also hairy and had a lust for killing. In his official biography, it is said that \\"if a single day went by and he did not kill someone, then he was really unhappy.\\" Kenneth Swope suggests that he may have been mentally unstable and a psychopath. When his family disowned him for getting into repeated fights with his peers, he joined the army, which sentenced him to death for breaking military law. An officer named Chen Hongfan spared him due to being impressed by his valiance. Zhang Xianzhong then joined the rebellion and followed Ma Shouying, who made him a petty officer and named him the \\"Yellow Tiger\\". Eventually hardship struck in the winter of 1631 and Zhang was forced to surrender with Luo Rucai, the first of several times he would do so out of expedience. Li Zicheng was the second son of Li Shouzhong and hailed from Mizhi, Shaanxi. Li showed an aptitude for horse archery at an early age but was forced to become a shepherd at the age of ten due to poverty. He became an orphan when his mother died three years later. Li joined the army at the age of 16 but later left and entered the postal service in 1626. At some point Li became an outlaw for killing a man he found in bed with his wife after returning from an extended business trip. He was arrested and jailed until his nephew Li Guo freed him, and together they fled the area. In Gansu, Li Zicheng joined the army again and became a squad commander of 50 men. After taking part in the suppression of the rebel Gao Yingxiang, Li himself became a rebel due to charges of stealing rations. By 1632 Shaanxi was experiencing mass famine. Food supplies could not be delivered due to heavy snows and banditry spread to Sichuan, Shandong and Shanxi.

They issued two studio albums, The Numbers (October 1980), which peaked at No. 29 on the Kent Music Report Albums Chart, and 39.51 (April 1982). The group disbanded in 1984, the Morrows formed another band, Maybe Dolls, in 1991.  History  The Numbers were formed early in 1978 in Sydney by Annalisse Morrow on bass guitar and lead vocals and her elder brother, Chris Morrow on lead guitar and lead vocals; they were joined by Marty Newcombe on drums. Australian musicologist, Ian McFarlane, observed that they \\"emerged from the post-punk Sydney scene with a clean sound and a strong sense of direction. In spite of a regular touring schedule and a brace of accessible pop releases, the band never made the commercial breakthrough for which they so vigorously strived.\\" In January 1979 Newcombe was replaced on drums and percussion by Simon Vidale. The group supported the Australian leg of a tour by United Kingdom rockers, XTC. The Numbers released their debut three-track, extended play, Govt. Boy, on the Local Records label in September. All the tracks were written or co-written by Chris. McFarlane felt that it \\"featured three dazzling blasts of tough guitar pop reminiscent of The Jam or The Buzzcocks.\\" Late in 1979 the group signed with Deluxe Records, which issued their debut single, \\"The Modern Song\\", in the following March. The second single, \\"Five Letter Word\\", reached the Kent Music Report Singles Chart top 40. Note: Used for Australian Singles and Albums charting from 1974 until Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) created their own charts in mid-1988. In 1992, Kent back calculated chart positions for 1970‚Äì1974. A third single, \\"Mr President\\" (February 1981) failed to chart. Their debut album, The Numbers, appeared in October 1980, which reached No. 29 on the Kent Music Report Albums Chart. It was produced by Cameron Allan and was recorded at EMI Studios 301, Sydney in mid-year.
