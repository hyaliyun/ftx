The Maya moon goddess wields great influence in many areas. Being in the image of a woman, she is associated with sexuality and procreation, fertility and growth, not only of human beings, but also of the vegetation and the crops. Since growth can also cause all sorts of ailments, the moon goddess is also a goddess of disease. Everywhere in Mesoamerica, including the Mayan area, she is specifically associated with water, be it wells, rainfall, or the rainy season. In the codices, she has a terrestrial counterpart in goddess I. Lunar mythology The sources for Maya lunar mythology are almost entirely contemporaneous, with the exception of the Popol Vuh. A division can be made according to the moon's kinship roles. *Moon as a male sibling: celestial power. In the Popol Vuh (16th century), the Maya Hero Twins are finally transformed into sun and moon, implying the recognition of a male moon, in a departure from the main Maya tradition. However, the Popol Vuh hardly belongs to lunar mythology, and becoming Sun and Moon may well be a metonym for acquiring dominance over the sky and thus, metaphorically, political predominance. *Moon as a wife: origin of menstruation. True lunar mythology is first and foremost represented by the Q ºeqchi º myth of Sun and Moon first studied by Eric Thompson.Thompson 1930: 126-132, 125-138, and Thompson 1939 It makes the Moon Goddess (Po) the daughter of the Earth God, or 'Mountain-Valley'. She is wooed and finally captured by Sun. They sleep together. When this is discovered and the couple flees, the angry father reacts by having his daughter destroyed. In all likelihood, this patriarchal punishment of a basic infraction of the rules of alliance represents the origin of menstruation, the 'evil blood' of a disobedient daughter colouring the water of sea and lake red, or sinking into the earth.Braakhuis 2005:175-176; 2010:184-214 The menstrual blood is stored in thirteen jars. In the jars, it is first transformed into creatures such as snakes and insects, a transformation leading up to the origin of poison and the diseases caused by it. However, some jars also hold medicinal plants. The thirteenth jar is the lunar jar: On being opened, the Moon is reborn from it. The creation of her vagina on instigation of, or directly by, her husband represents the origin of human procreation. Subsequent episodes make the Moon Goddess cohabit with Sun's elder brother, Cloud, and with the devil in the shape of a king vulture, thus connecting her to rainfall and black sorcery. *Moon as a (grand)mother: the rabbit in the moon. Among the Mayas of Chiapas and the Northwestern Highlands of Guatemala, Moon is not Sun's wife, but his mother or grandmother, while Sun is a young boy harassed by his elder brethren. Only in this mythology do we find the origin of the lunar rabbit, either as one of the elder brethren transformed into wild animals and caught by his mother,Thompson 1970: 362 or as a creature responsible for the resurgence of the wild vegetation on Sun's maize field. In the latter case, the rabbit is caught by Sun, passed on to his mother, and again taken into the sky.Milbrath 1999: 24 In Northwestern Guatemala, the rabbit in the moon is sometimes replaced by a deer in the moon. The moon goddess in the Post- Classic and Classic periods In the three Post-Classic codices, the Moon Goddess is underrepresented. Instead, one finds almanacs devoted to what appears to be her terrestrial counterpart, the Goddess I ('White Woman'). In Classic Maya art, however, the Moon Goddess occurs frequently.Taube 1992: 64-68 She is shown as a young woman holding her rabbit, and framed by the crescent of the waxing moon, which is her most important, identifying attribute. The Moon Goddess may also be sitting on a throne, alone (as in the Dresden codex), or behind god D (Itzamna). Although, in oral tradition, the goddess is often treated as the consort of the Sun Deity, Classic iconography does not insist on this (see Kinich Ahau). The lunar rabbit (perhaps a Trickster character) has an important role to play in a poorly understood episode involving the Moon Goddess, the Twins, the Maya maize god, and the aged god L. In some cases, the Moon Goddess is fused with the main Maya maize god, making it uncertain whether what we see is a Moon Goddess with a maize aspect (that is, a maize-bringing moon), or a Maize God with a lunar aspect or function. Calendrical functions The Moon Goddess is the patroness of the month of Ch ºen 'Well'. (\\"Moon has gone to her well\\" is an expression referring to New Moon.Thompson 1960: 238) She is also the patroness of one of the Venus 'years'. Her importance is reflected by the eclipse tables of the Dresden Codex and by the Lunar Series of the Long Count. Glyph C of the Lunar Series (indicating sequences of six lunations for purposes of eclipse prediction)Milbrath 1999: 107-109 connects her to other deities, such as the death god (God A), the Jaguar God of the Underworld, and, perhaps, the Maize God.Thompson 1960: 240-241 and figs. 36, 37 See also *Awilix *List of lunar deities Notes Bibliography *H.E.M.

It uses symbolic descriptions and avoids continuous descriptions e.g. differential equations.The derivation of the dynamics from the interaction graphs of systems is not easy. A lot of parameters have to be inferred, for differential description, even if the type of each interaction is known in the graph. Even small modifications in parameters can lead to a strong change in the dynamics. Kinetic Logic is used to build discrete models, in which such details of the systems are not required. The information required can be derived directly from the graph of interactions or from a sufficiently explicit verbal description. It only considers the thresholds of the elements and uses logical equations to construct state tables. Through this procedure, it is a straightforward matter to determine the behavior of the system.Thomas R., (1973) Boolean formulization of genetic control circuits.

Example of Generalized Kinetic Logic in Software G. State Table for D H. Time Delays J. Statetable 2 Following is Ren√© Thomas‚Äôs formalism for Kinetic Logic : In a directed graph G = (V, A), we note G‚àí (v) and G+ (v) the set of predecessors and successors of a node v ‚àà V respectively. Definition 1: A biological regulatory network (BRN) is a tuple G = (V, A, l, s, t, K) where (V, A) is a directed graph denoted by G, l is a function from V to N, s is a function from A to {+, ‚àí}, t is a function from A to N such that, for all u ‚àà V, if G+(u) is not empty then {t(u, v)  v ‚àà G+(u)} = { 1, . . . , l(u)}. K = {Kv  v ‚àà V} is a set of maps: for each v ‚àà V, Kv is a function from 2G‚àí (v) to {0, . . . , l(v)} such that Kv(œâ) ‚â§ Kv(œâ_) for all œâ ‚äÜ œâ_ ‚äÜ G‚àí(v). The map l describes the domain of each variable v: if l (v) = k, the abstract concentration on v holds its value in {0, 1, . . . , k}. Similarly, the map s represents the sign of the regulation (+ for an activation, ‚àí for an inhibition). t (u, v) is the threshold of the regulation from u to v: this regulation takes place iff the abstract concentration of u is above t(u, v), in such a case the regulation is said active. The condition on these thresholds states that each variation of the level of u induces a modification of the set of active regulations starting from u. For all x ‚àà [0, . . ., l(u) ‚àí 1], the set of active regulations of u, when the discrete expression level of u is x, differs from the set when the discrete expression level is x + 1. Finally, the map Kv allows us to define what is the effect of a set of regulators on the specific target v. If this set is œâ ‚äÜ G‚àí (v), then, the target v is subject to a set of regulations which makes it to evolve towards a particular level Kv(œâ). Definition 2 (States): A state Œº of a BRN G = (V, A, l, s, t, K) is a function from V to N such that Œº (v) ‚àà {0 .., l (v)} for all variables v ‚àà V. We denote EG the set of states of G. When Œº (u) ‚â• t (u, v) and s (u, v) = +, we say that u is a resource of v since the activation takes place. Similarly when Œº (u) < t (u, v) and s (u, v) = ‚àí, u is also a resource of v since the inhibition does not take place (the absence of the inhibition is treated as an activation). Definition 3 (Resource function): Let G = (V, A, l, s, t, K) be a BRN. For each v ‚àà V we define the resource function œâv: EG ‚Üí 2G‚àí (v) by: œâv (Œº) = {u ‚àà G‚àí(v)  (Œº(u) ‚â• t(u, v) and s(u, v) = +) or (Œº (u) < t (u, v) and s (u, v) = ‚àí)}. As said before, at state Œº, Kv (œâv(Œº)) gives the level towards which the variable v tends to evolve. We consider three cases, * if Œº(v) < Kv(œâv(Œº)) then v can increase by one unit * if Œº(v) > Kv(œâv(Œº)) then v can decrease by one unit * if Œº(v) = Kv (œâv (Œº)) then v cannot evolve. Definition 4 (Signs of derivatives): Let G = (V, A, l, s, t, K) be a BRN and v ‚àà V. We define Œ±v: EG ‚Üí {+1, 0, ‚àí1} by Œ±v(Œº) = +1 if Kv (œâv(Œº)) > Œº(u) 0 if Kv (œâv(Œº)) = Œº(u) ‚àí1 if Kv (œâv(Œº)) < Œº(u) The signs of derivatives show the tendency of the solution trajectories. The state graph of BRN represents the set of the states that a BRN can adopt with transitions among them deduced from the previous rules: Definition 5 (State graph): Let G = (V, A, b, s, t,K) be a BRN. The state graph of G is a directed graph G = (EG, T) with (Œº, Œº_) ‚àà T if there exists v ‚àà V such that: Œ±v (Œº) ‚â† 0 and Œº‚Äô (v) = Œº (v) + Œ±v (Œº) and Œº (u) = Œº‚Äô (u), ‚àÄu ‚àà V \\\\ {v}.Thomas R., (1978) Logical analysis of systems comprising feedback loops. J Theor Biol.73(4): 631‚Äì656. = Critical Assumptions = The critical assumptions of Kinetic Logic are: # The elements of system have slight effect on each other until they reach a threshold. # At high levels the effect on each other tends to reach a plateau. So an element is present when greater than the threshold level and absent when it is below the threshold level.Kupper Z and Hoffmann H., (1995) Modeling the Dynamics of Psychosis by Kinetic Logic (4-95). Bern, Switzerland: University of Bern, Department of Social and Community Psychiatry.  Steps of Application  Following are the steps of Application of Kinetic Logic (Also shown in figure A).Thomas R., and D‚ÄôAri R., (1990) Biological feedback. FL: CRC Press, Boca Raton. =Biological Regulatory Network (BRN)= Keeping the research problem in mind, the behavior of elements in the system and their interactions are studied. Elements of a system can interact positively or negatively, that is, the level of an element may activate or reduce the rate of production of other elements or of itself. These interactions are represented as positive (activation) or negative (inhibition). When elements are connected in a topologically circular way, they exert an influence on their own rate of synthesis and they form a feedback loop. A feedback loop is positive or negative according to whether it contains an even or odd number of negative interactions. In a positive loop, each element of the system exerts a positive effect on its own rate of synthesis, whereas in a simple negative loop, each element has a negative effect on its own rate of synthesis. A simple positive feedback loop results in epigenetic regulation and have multiple steady states and a simple negative feedback loop results in homeostatic regulation. Abstraction: A chain of positive interactions is equivalent to a direct positive interaction between the two extreme elements, and any two negative interactions cancel out each other‚Äôs effect. In this way, any simple feedback loop can be abridged to a one-element loop, positive or negative according to the number of negative interactions (even or odd) in the original loop. Accordingly, through extensive literature survey and the application of the above-mentioned rules, a BRN is abstracted. =Logical Variable and Functions= Logical variables are associated with the elements of the system to describe the state of the system. They consist of the logical values. For example, a system whose state is appropriately described by the levels of substances a, b, and c, each of which can be absent, present at low level, or present at high level are represented by logical values 0, 1, and 2 respectively. If a product an acts to stimulate the production of b, it is a positive regulator. In this case, the rate of synthesis of b increases with increasing concentration of a, and makes a curve similar to that shown in figure B. There is little effect of a, until it reaches a threshold concentration theta, and at higher concentrations a plateau is reached which shows the maximal rate of synthesis of b. Such a nonlinear, bounded curve is called a sigmoid. It can be suggested that a is \\"absent\\" for a < theta and \\"present\\" for a > theta. The sigmoid curve can be approximated by the step function, as in figure C. Not only logical variables (x, y, z ...) are associated to the elements, that represent their level (e.g., concentration), but also logical functions (X, Y, Z ...) whose value reflects the rate of synthesis of the element. Thus, x = 0 means \\"gene product absent\\" x = 1 means \\"gene product present\\" & X = 0 means \\"gene off\\" X = 1 means \\"gene on\\" =Graph of Interactions and Logical Equations= Kinetic Logic has two forms depending on the following two types of descriptions: Na√Øve Logical Description Consider a simple two-element system in which product x activates gene Y and product y represses gene X as shown in figure D. Each variable takes only two values; 0 and 1. In other words, X = 1 if y = 0 (X \\"on‚Äù if y absent) Y = 1 if x = 1 (Y \\"on\\" if x present) The logical relation of the system can be written: X =y Y=x Generalized Kinetic Logic The naive logical description can be generalized and made to accommodate situations in which some variables take more than two values, without complicating the analysis. Any variable has a number of biologically relevant levels, determined by the number of elements regulated by the product x. There is a specific threshold for each regulatory interaction, so if x regulates n elements, it will have up to n different thresholds. For the logical sum, there is a procedure that assigns a specific weight to each term in the logical relation. According to the scale of thresholds of the corresponding variable, the weighted algebraic sum is then discretized, so an n-valued variable is associated with an n-valued function. After discretization the integers of certain weights or sums of weights are called logical parameters. Generalized Kinetic Logic, although maintaining the analytic simplicity of the naive description, has certain features in common with the differential description. The generalized logical relations are completely independent of the differential description and can be directly derived from the graph of interactions or from an explicit verbal description. Consider an example of two elements in figure E. Using a software, this graph of interactions is drawn as shown in figure F. There are two thresholds assigned to element y: —≤12, concerning its interaction with x and —≤22, concerning its interaction with itself. The variable y and function Y have three possible values: 0, 1, and 2. Element x have a single threshold, —≤21, because of the interaction x to +y, so the variable x and function X will be two-valued. =State Table and State Graph= The state table of graph of interactions in figure D is shown in figure G. This table states for each state of the variables (x, y) i.e. present or absent, which products are synthesized and which are not synthesized at a significant rate. Consider the state 00/10, in which both of the gene products are absent but gene X is on. As product x is absent but being synthesized so it can be expected that in near future it will be present and the logical value of x will change from 0 to 1. This can be described by the notation ≈å, in which the dash above the digit is due to the fact that variable x is committed to change its value from 0 to 1. Generally, a dash over the figure representing the logical value of a variable each time this value is different from that of the corresponding function. The state just considered can thus be represented as ≈åO. Time Delays The movement of a system from one state to another depends on the time delays. The time delays in systems are short time shifts of arbitrary duration. In view of the relation between a function (gene on or off) and its associated variable (gene product present or absent), the time delays become real entities whose values, far from being arbitrary, reflect specific physical processes (synthesis, degradation, dilution, etc.). The values of the different time delays play an important role in determining the pathway along which the system evolves. The temporal relation between a logical variable x which is associated with the level of an element and a logical function X which is associated with its evolution can be explained as follows. Consider a gene that is off (X = 0) for a considerable time, then is switched on (X = 1) by a signal, and then, after some time, it is switched off again (X= 0) by another signal and the product reappears but not immediately until a proper delay tx has elapsed. If a signal switches the gene off temporarily, the product is still present because it also requires a time delay tx‚Äô. This can be represented graphically as shown in figure H. Using the state table the temporal sequence of states of the system can be represented as shown in figure I. =Identifying Cycles and Stable Steady States= Cycles The state table in D can be used to identify the cyclic behavior of the system. We can see that state 01 changes to 00, and 00 changes to 10, 10 changes to 11 and 11 changes back to 01. This represents a cycle as the system starts from the state 01 and returns to the same state. The system keeps oscillating between these states. Deadlocks Consider another example in which: X=y Y=x The state table for the system is shown in figure J. The states that are encircled are stable states, as they do not evolve towards any other state. The logical stable states are defined as those for which the vectors xy . .. and XY ... are equal. When we considered the time delays i.e. from ≈å≈å the system will proceed to state 1 0 or to state 01, according to whether tx < ty or ty < tx, and from ƒ™ƒ™ the system will proceed to state 10 or to state 0 1 according to whether ty < tx or tx < ty. The state graph representing delays is shown in figure K. The sequence of states a system depends on the relative values of the time delays. It is assumed that two delays (or sums of delays) are never exactly equal, therefore that two variables will not change their values at the same instant. But do not exclude the possibility because if this rule is applied rigidly, it could occasionally lead to the loss of interesting pathways. =Analyzing the Results= The cycles and the deadlock states identified by this process are then analyzed by comparing them with the invitro and invivo findings. These results can be used to make important predictions about the system. Cyclic behaviors correspond to homeostatic regulations that retain the level of a variable at or near a fixed or optimal value. Deadlocks represent epigenetic regulation in which the concentrations exist between extreme levels.Thomas R., and D‚ÄôAri R., (1990) Biological feedback. FL: CRC Press, Boca Raton. History The first approach for qualitative modeling was based on extreme discretization since all genes could be either on (present) or off (absent).Thomas R., (1978) Logical analysis of systems comprising feedback loops. J Theor Biol.73(4): 631‚Äì656. This Boolean approach was generalized into a multi-valued approach i.e. Kinetic Logic,Thomas R., (1991) Regulatory networks seen as asynchronous automata: a logical description.

Bull Math Biol. 55(5):973‚Äì991. Application Kinetic logic has been employed to study the factors that influence the selection of specific pathway from many different pathways that the system can follow and the factors that lead the system towards stable states and cyclic behaviors. It has been used to reveal the logic that lie behind the functional organization and kinetic behavior of molecules. Model checking techniques have also been applied to models built through kinetic logic, in order to infer their continuous behaviors.J. Ahmad, and O. Roux, ‚ÄúAnalysing formal models of genetic regulatory networks with delays,‚Äù Int. J. Bioinformatics Research and Applications. vol. 4. pp. 240-262, 2008.

Life Presumably born in The Hague, Joanna was the second child of Duke Albert I of Bavaria (1336‚Äì1404), by his first wife Margaret (1342‚Äì1386), a daughter of the Piast duke Louis I of Brzeg. Her siblings included Count William VI of Holland, Johanna Sophia of Bavaria and Margaret of Bavaria. Her paternal grandparents were Emperor Louis IV and his consort Countess Margaret II of Hainaut. Joanna's itinerary to the Prague court, 1370 From August 1370 Joanna travelled to Prague, where she was married on 29 September 1370 to Wenceslaus, son and heir of Emperor Charles IV by his third wife, Anna of Swidnica. At the time of the wedding, Johanna was eight years' old, and Wenceslaus was nine. The emperor had to obtain a papal dispense due to the close relatedness of the couple. The marriage was not consummated until 1376. The conjugal bond suited the Luxembourg ruler to strengthen ties with the Bavarian duke, who held extensive estates in the Low Countries; nevertheless, Joanna was not the first choice of a bride for Wenceslaus. Charles IV had initially planned for him to marry the Hohenzollern princess Elisabeth of Nuremberg, but the marriage never took place, since Elisabeth married Rupert of the Palatinate instead. Charles had his son elected King of the Romans in 1376 and upon his death in 1378, Wenceslaus also inherited the Kingdom of Bohemia. With Wenceslaus' accession, Joanna became Queen of both Bohemia and Germany. She also became Electress of Brandenburg as successor to Wenceslaus' half-sister Catherine. Death The marriage lasted for sixteen years, however the couple had no children (it is said that Wenceslaus was infertile due to his alcoholism). Joanna died in 1386 at the age of twenty-three or twenty-four,Czech Wikipedia allegedly from the consequences of an attack by Wenceslaus' hunting dogs. Wenceslaus gave Johanna a magnificent funeral, which took place at ≈Ωebr√°k castle. According to custom, Joanna's body was exposed for a few days in Prague churches and was later buried in Prague Castle. Wenceslaus later married Joanna's cousin, Sofia of Bavaria, but this marriage also bore no issue. Wenceslaus was deposed from the throne of Germany in 1400 and was succeeded by Elisabeth of Nuremberg's husband, Rupert.

Muscle cramps caused by the disease tetanus are not classified as tetany; rather, they are due to a lack of inhibition to the neurons that supply muscles. Tetanic contractions (physiologic tetanus) are a broad range of muscle contraction types, of which tetany is only one. Signs and symptoms Tetany is characterized by contraction of distal muscles of the hands (carpal spasm with extension of interphalangeal joints and adduction and flexion of the metacarpophalangeal joints) and feet (pedal spasm) and is associated with tingling around the mouth and distally in the limbs. Causes *The usual cause of tetany is a deficiency of calcium. An excess of phosphate (high phosphate-to-calcium ratio) can also trigger the spasms. *Underfunction of the parathyroid gland can lead to tetany. *Low levels of carbon dioxide cause tetany by altering the albumin binding of calcium such that the ionized (physiologically influencing) fraction of calcium is reduced; one common reason for low carbon dioxide levels is hyperventilation. *Low levels of magnesium can lead to tetany. *Clostridium tetani toxin, via inhibition of glycine-mediated and GABA-ergic neurotransmission, may lead to tetany. Cow grazing on rapidly grown pasture with tetany of the neck suggesting grass tetany *An excess of potassium in grass hay or pasture can trigger winter tetany, or grass tetany, in ruminants. *Osteomalacia and rickets due to deficiency of vitamin D Pathophysiology Hypocalcemia is the primary cause of tetany. Low ionized calcium levels in the extracellular fluid increase the permeability of neuronal membranes to sodium ion, causing a progressive depolarization, which increases the possibility of action potentials. This occurs because calcium ions interact with the exterior surface of sodium channels in the plasma membrane of nerve cells and hypocalcemia effectively increases resting potential (rendering the cells more excitable) since less positive charge is present extracellularly. When calcium ions are absent the voltage level required to open voltage gated sodium channels is significantly altered (less excitation is required). If the plasma Ca2+ decreases to less than 50% of the normal value of 9.4 mg/dl, action potentials may be spontaneously generated, causing contraction of peripheral skeletal muscles. Hypocalcemia is not a term for tetany but is rather a cause of tetany. Diagnosis French Professor Armand Trousseau (1801‚Äì1867) devised the maneuver of occluding the brachial artery by squeezing, to trigger cramps in the fingers. This is now known as the Trousseau sign of latent tetany. Also, tetany can be demonstrated by tapping anterior to the ear, at the emergence of the facial nerve. A resultant twitch of the nose or lips suggests low calcium levels. This is now known as the Chvostek sign. EMG studies reveal single or often grouped motor unit discharges at low discharge frequency during tetany episodes. References *Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine 16th Edition ‚Äì Dennis L.

Currently, it operates a rehabilitation home in Kathmandu, as well as transit homes at the Indo-Nepal border towns, preventive homes in the countryside and an academy in Kathmandu . The word ‚ÄòMaiti‚Äô has no literal interpretation in English but in the Nepali language the word ‚Äòmaiti‚Äô means the home of the girl's birth parents. The word itself holds sentimental value for the women population of Nepal ‚Äúespecially for a married Nepali woman who has no longer any right towards her parents or their property‚Äù. Once a girl is married to another man, she becomes a perpetual member of her husband's family. She has all obligations to her husband and her new family. As this organization is a home to all the girls, women and children who are not accepted into their family and society, therefore this NGO has been named as ‚ÄòMaiti‚Äô Nepal to symbolize the love and affection that a girl receives in her birth parents place. History Maiti Nepal was established in 1993 by a group of socially committed professionals in order ‚Äúto protect Nepali girls and women from crimes like domestic violence, trafficking for flesh trade, child prostitution, child labor and various other forms of exploitation and torture‚Äù. Since 1993, this organization has been working towards ‚Äúpreventing trafficking for forced prostitution, rescuing flesh trade victims and rehabilitating them‚Äù. After rescuing women and children, this organization also works vigorously towards finding ‚Äújustice for the victimized girls and women by engaging in criminal investigation and waging legal battles against the criminals‚Äù. Due to continuous efforts, this organization has been able to raise awareness regarding this crucial issue of girl trafficking at international levels. Objective The main objective of Maiti Nepal is to provide comprehensive prevention from girls trafficking, rescuing and rehabilitating the survivors, advocating for justice in the cases of the rescued women and girls and ensuring that effective immediate action is taken against their traffickers. Founder of Maiti Nepal Anuradha Koirala was born in 1949, to parents Colonel Pratap Singh Gurung and Laxmi Gurung. She completed her schooling at a convent school in Kalimpong, India. Her inspiration to establish an organization for the betterment of women population came from her bitter relationship with her husband, Dinesh Prasad Koirala. After several years of violence, abuse and three miscarriages, she separated from her husband. Anuradha Koirala established Maiti Nepal in 1993 with the aim of providing services for both children and women who have endured untold pain and suffering, often in silence. She not only established Maiti Nepal, she also set up transit homes, academic and medical centre to provide support to the women and children who had no other place to go. Maiti Nepal‚Äôs Centers Maiti Nepal has three prevention homes, fourteen transit homes, a hospice, eight information desk and Teresa Academy. The data for the centres of Maiti Nepal has been taken from the website of South Asia Foundation. =Transit Homes = The transit homes of Maiti Nepal are located in different locations across Nepal, as listed below. # Pashupatinagar,Illam # Kakarvita,Jhapa # Biratnagar,Morang # Birgunj,Parsa # Bhairawa,Rupandehi # Nepalgunj,Banke # Dhangadhi,Kailali # Kathmandu,Thankot # Maheshpur,Nawalparasi # Mahendranagr, Kanchanpur =Rehabilitation Centers= The two rehabilitation centres of Maiti Nepal are located in Kathmandu and Ithari. # Women Rehabilitation Centre, Kathmandu # Women Rehabilitation Centre, Ithari =Prevention Homes= # Chisapaani - Nuwakot # Bardaghat - Nawalparasi # Hetauda ‚Äì Makwanpur # Chitwan - Bharatpur =Hospice= # Satighatta - Jhapa District Eastern Nepal Facilities The transit homes, rehabilitation and medical centres of Maiti Nepal are well facilitated to provide support and assistance to the rescued women, children and girls. The data for the facilities provided by Maiti Nepal has been extracted from the website of the Mother's Home Nepal website. =Rehabilitation Centers= These centers provide shelter, safety, education and vocational training and medical care to the rescued women and children. =Prevention Programs= This program provides information to vulnerable girls with information and education about human trafficking. This program also provides temporary shelter and residential services to these girls. =Hospices= The hospices provide treatment to those suffering from psychological disorders, and anti-retro- viral treatment to HIV/AIDS patients. =Halfway Houses= These types of houses provide shelter and protection to under age girls who are working in places like dance restaurants and massage parlors. =Medical Clinic= The medical clinic was built to provide treatment to the diseased women and children. There is a full-time doctor with a team of girls to look after the suffering women and children. Programmes/Activities Maiti Nepal organizes several activities including awareness campaigns regarding sex trafficking, rescue operations for the trafficked women and girls, apprehending traffickers, providing legal support to the needy, women empowerment programmes, and providing anti-retroviral therapy (ART) to HIV infected children and women. The organization provides halfway homes for the survivors of trafficking. It provides educational support to the children and women who have a desire for learning. It also provides psychological counseling, support, and life skills to girls/women who are at risk of being trafficked. The main activity includes rescuing other girls by setting up a team of survivors of trafficking. This team of girls talk to the girls who they suspect are being traded by the traffickers. List of Awards As the founder and director of Maiti Nepal, Anuradha Koirala won the CNN Hero of the Year award in 2010. She had previously received the Courage of Conscience Award from The Peace Abbey in Sherborn, Massachusetts on August 25, 2006. The Peace Abbey Courage of Conscience Recipients List The United States government has given a two-year grant of $500,000 to Maiti Nepal in April 2010. Until now, Anuradha Koirala has received 30 national and international awards for her courageous acts and lifetime achievement furthering the cause of children's and women's rights. Criticism Though Maiti Nepal has successfully rescued thousands of girls from trafficking, the ‚Äúcritics of Maiti Nepal were of the view that Maiti Nepal did not always respect the will of the women concerned and refused drastic measures to deal with the problem‚Äù. One of the major drawbacks of Maiti Nepal's work has been in rehabilitating the former prostitutes. The other criticism raised against this organization's work is with its affiliation with an Indian Organization named STOP. STOP has been accused of raiding brothels at midnight and then taking away the girls forcefully and later subjecting them to various kinds of threats. Since Maiti Nepal is affiliated with STOP so when this organization is accused of any issue then it ultimately becomes a concern for Maiti Nepal as STOP hands over all its rescued girls to Maiti Nepal. In May 2013 the Nepalese Supreme Court ordered Maiti Nepal to release a woman the court determined was being held against her will for the purpose of counselling her for being a lesbian.

San Silvestro al Quirinale (or St. Sylvester on Quirinal Hill) is a historic church in central Rome, Italy. It is located near Via XXIV Maggio corner with Via Mazzarino, a few blocks south of the Piazza del Quirinale. History The first mentions of a church on the site are from 1039, when it was called Santo Stefano in Cavallo in recognition of its site on Monte Cavallo, a small hill in the Campo Marzio. In 1507, the church was granted to the Dominicans of the Florentine Congregation of St Mark by Pope Julius II. It was rebuilt in 1524-1584, when it was taken over by the Theatine Order. The high altar was consecrated in 1584 by Bishop Thomas Goldwell of St. Asaph's in North Wales, the last Catholic bishop in England under Queen Mary Tudor's reign. In 1801, San Silvestro was granted to the Lazarists, having been abandoned by the Theatines some years before. In the period when conclaves to elect a new Pope were held at the Quirinal Palace, the inaugural procession of the Cardinals started from this church. When the street was widened in 1877, the 16th century fa√ßade was replaced. The old fa√ßade had been simple, while the present one, by Andrea Busiri Vici, is more decorated. There is a small garden outside the church, with a 16th-century oratory that was used in funerals. The fa√ßade, decorated in stucco, is original. Interior decoration The renaissance interior is almost completely covered with paintings. There is a long, vaulted choir behind the altar. In the ceiling is a fresco from the late 16th century by Giovanni and Cherubino Alberti. On the left wall is a fresco by Lazzaro Baldi, depicting St Gaetano and the Blessed Virgin. On the counterfacade of the entrance is the funeral monument of Cardinal Federico Cornaro (1531‚Äì1590) attributed to Giacomo della Porta.

On the walls are the Circumcision of Christ and Adoration of the Magi by Jacopo Zucchi and The Dream of St Joseph and The Slaughter of the Innocents by Raffaellino da Reggio. The first chapel on the left side has a fresco by Avanzino Nucci, Pope St Sylvester Baptizing Emperor Constantine. In the ceiling are scenes from the life of St Sylvester, painted in 1868. The altarpiece in the second chapel on the left is by Giacinto Gimignani, and depicts Pope St Pius V and Cardinal Alessandrino in Adoration of the Virgin. In the centre is an icon of the Madonna with Child of the Roman school, 13th century. At the end of the left transept, is the Chapel of the Assumption, also known as the Cappella Bandini. The large, octagonal, domed chapel designed by Ottaviano Mascherino in 1585. The Assumption painting is by Scipione Pulzone. The four painted roundels depicting scenes from the lives of David, Judith, Esther and Solomon (1628) are by Domenichino. There are four stucco statues; Magdalene and St John from 1628, by Alessandro Algardi, and St Joseph and St Martha by Francesco Mochi.

He was particularly active during the Depression and World War II era. Life Philip Evergood was born in New York City. His mother was English and his father, Miles Evergood, was an Australian artist of Polish Jewish descent who, in 1915, changed the family's name from Blashki to Evergood. Philip Evergood's formal education began in 1905. He studied music and by 1908 he was playing the piano in a concert with his teacher.Who Was Who in American Art, Soundview Press 1999, Evergood, Philip He attended different English boarding schools starting in 1909 and was educated mainly at Eton and Cambridge University. In 1921 he decided to study art, left Cambridge, and went to London to study with Henry Tonks at the Slade School. In 1923 Evergood went back to New York where he studied at the Art Students League of New York for a year. He then returned to Europe, worked at various jobs in Paris, painted independently, and studied at the Acad√©mie Julian with Andr√© Lhote. He also studied with Stanley William Hayter at Atelier 17; Hayter taught him engraving. He returned to New York in 1926 and began a career that was marked by the hardships of severe illness, an almost fatal operation, and constant financial trouble. It was not until the collector Joseph H. Hirshhorn purchased several of his paintings that he could consider his financial troubles over. Evergood worked on WPA art projects from 1934 to 1937 where he painted two murals: The Story of Richmond Hill (1936‚Äì37, Public Library branch, Queens, N.Y.) and 'Cotton from Field to Mill (1938, post office in Jackson, Ga.). He taught both music and art as late as 1943, and finally moved to Southbury, Connecticut, in 1952. He was a full member of the Art Students League of New York and the National Institute of Arts and Letters. He was killed in a house fire in Bridgewater, Connecticut, in 1973 at the age of 72. He is buried in Green-Wood Cemetery, Brooklyn. A New York City police officer was killed in the line of duty at Evergood's house located at 132 Bank Street, Greenwich Village on August 17, 1947. Police Officer Thomas J. Gargan, responding to a neighbor's call reporting a burglary, was fatally shot in the chest and his partner was wounded by the burglar. Gargan was posthumously awarded the Daily News Hero Award. It was the second time he had won this award.https://www.newspapers.com/image/409815735/?terms=police%20officer%20thomas%20gargan&match;=1 The burglar used a single shot signal flare gun (sawed off shotgun) he had found in the house. He was sentenced to death and executed in 1948. Evergood was charged with violating the Sullivan Act for failing to register the gun.https://www.newspapers.com/image/445223447/?terms=%22harris%20grey%22&match;=1 He was acquitted by a three judge panel.  Art  Evergood's influences include El Greco, Bosch, Brueghel, Goya, Daumier, Toulouse-Lautrec, Sloan's Ashcan paintings, and even prehistoric cave art. Though he experimented with etching and lithography in the 1920s, he did not begin to devote himself on a large scale to original printmaking until after 1945. At this time he studied printmaking techniques at the New York studio of Stanley William Hayter. During the following twenty-five years he produced many works of art in both lithography and etching. During the 1950s Evergood departed from his established \\"Social Realism\\" style and concentrated on symbolism, both biblical and mythological. A characteristic work of this period in Evergood's life is The New Lazarus, painted in 1954 and presently housed in the Whitney Museum of American Art.

Extremely important works of particular renown by this artist can reasonably be expected to break into the six figure range (USD) and are infrequently seen on the open market due to heavy museum consumption of important Evergood works from the 1950s through the 1980s. * 13‚Äì09‚Äì06 Victory Buttons Oil US$54,000 * 13‚Äì07‚Äì06 Self-portrait With Nudes Oil US$1,680 * 25‚Äì06‚Äì06 Girl in Garden Oil US$2,185 * 03‚Äì12‚Äì05 Little Rock Oil US$8,000 * 24‚Äì05‚Äì05 Still Life With Fishermen Oil US$8,500 * 22‚Äì05‚Äì05 Woman And Laughing Dog Brush US$2,300 * 20‚Äì05‚Äì05 Portrait Of Richard Esquire Oil US$1,057 * 23‚Äì03‚Äì05 Forest With Riders Oil US$6,600 * 27‚Äì09‚Äì04 Fruit 76.8 x 59.1 in Oil US$28,680 * 08‚Äì09‚Äì04 Fat of the Land Oil US$8,963 * 18‚Äì05‚Äì04 The Dog Bite Clinic Oil US$71,700 * 07‚Äì03‚Äì04 Children And Very Giant Squash Oil US$7,000 * 07‚Äì10‚Äì03 World War I Oil Unsold  Selected Exhibitions  * Corcoran Gallery of Art, 1928, 1939‚Äì1963 * Salons of America, 1934 * PAFA, 1934‚Äì66 (gold medal 1949, 1958) * AIC 1935 (prize) * AIC 1946 (prize) * WFNY, 1939 * La Pintura Contemporanea Norte America, 1941 * WMA, 1942 * AV 1942 (prize) * American-British Goodwill Art Exhibition, 1944 * Pepsi Cola Art Competition, 1944 (winner) * Tate Gallery: London 1946 * American Art Exhibition: Moscow, 1959 * Whitney Museum of American Art 1934‚Äì66 (Evergood Retrospective ‚Äì 1967) * Gallery Of Modern Art, Hunington, Hartford Museum, 1967 * ASL New York, 1967‚Äì68 * Smithsonian, 1968 * The WPA Art Of New York City Exhibit, Parsons School Of Design, 1977 (posthumous) Museum Collections This is a partial list of works by Evergood in museums.

Hungarian: Az arany ember, lit. \\"The Golden Man\\") is an 1872 novel by Hungarian novelist M√≥r J√≥kai. As J√≥kai states in the afterword of the novel, The Man with the Golden Touch was based on a true story he had heard from his grand-aunt as a child. Plot summary =Part I ‚Äì The St. Barbara= Mih√°ly Tim√°r is a young man working on the transport ship St. Barbara on the River Danube. The ship is owned by Athan√°z Brazovics, a rich Serbian merchant living in Kom√°rom, a town in Hungary, and is on its way back to Kom√°rom carrying sacks of wheat. The owner of the goods, Euthym Trikalisz, and his thirteen- year-old daughter Tim√©a are also aboard. On the way to Kom√°rom, they stop at an island, the \\"no man's island\\", which lies in the Danube between the Ottoman Empire and the Hungarian part of the Habsburg Empire, undiscovered and unclaimed by both. This island is the home of Ter√©za, a widow and her young daughter No√©mi, who lead a calm and idyllic life here. Another man, T√≥dor Kriszty√°n, arrives soon. He knows Ter√©za and No√©mi, but is apparently disliked by both. The travellers spend a night here, but Tim√°r can't sleep and overhears a conversation in which Kriszty√°n blackmails Ter√©za. He tells her that if she doesn't give him money he will reveal the existence of the island to the authorities. Ter√©za says they have no money since they don't need it, as everything they need grows on the island. Kriszty√°n takes away the golden bracelet Tim√©a gave to No√©mi, then leaves the island. Tim√°r tells Ter√©za that he overheard the conversation; in turn, Ter√©za tells him that her husband was ruined and driven to suicide by Kriszty√°n's father and Athan√°z Brazovics and so she fled to the island with her baby daughter who was raised there, unspoiled by civilization. She also tells him that Kriszty√°n always demands money from her and wants to marry No√©mi even though the girl hates him. Tim√°r feels frustrated that he cannot help Ter√©za. The next day the ship continues its journey. Mr. Trikalisz wantes to speak to Tim√°r in private. He reveals that he is in fact not a Greek merchant but Ali Csorbadzsi, a former high- ranking official of the Ottoman Empire, who is fleeing the Empire because the Sultan wants him dead, his wealth was confiscated, and his daughter was added to the harem. He wanted to go to Brazovics, who is his brother-in-law, but the previous day he recognized Kriszty√°n as a spy of the Ottoman Empire (Kriszty√°n is, in fact, a scoundrel, adventurer and a spy of both empires). He knows Kriszty√°n will betray him and Austria will extradite him to the Ottoman Empire, so he has taken poison, and makes Tim√°r swear that he will make sure Tim√©a arrives in Kom√°rom safe. He gives a small box with 1000 gold coins to Tim√°r and makes him promise he will keep it for Tim√©a; he also mentions that the rest of his wealth is the wheat in the sacks (which is worth ten thousand gold coins). Finally, he asks Tim√°r to wake up Tim√©a when he has died ‚Äì he gave her a potion so that she will sleep and they could speak in private, but if she was not given the antidote soon, the potion would kill her. Csorbadzsi then dies. Tim√°r is tempted by the amount of money ‚Äì if he let Tim√©a die and reported that Csorbadzsi traveled on the ship, one third of the confiscated wealth would be his by law. Because of his honesty and his awakening love for Tim√©a, he shrinks back from the evil thoughts. He wakes Tim√©a, gives her the antidote and tells her about her father's death. Later, when they arrive at the next city and the police catch up with their ship, he tells them he knows nothing about the escaped Turkish pasha and his treasure and that they only carried a Greek merchant on the ship, but he died. Thus he saved Tim√©a's wealth for her. Later he begins to wonder that if Csorbadzsi's remaining wealth was ten thousand gold coins, that could have been carried in a bag, why did he buy wheat with it, which fills a whole ship? And if this is the whole wealth, why does the Sultan pursue them? As they continue their journey, the ship runs on a cliff and sinks, with Tim√©a and Tim√°r barely escaping. =Part II ‚Äì Tim√©a= First edition title page Tim√°r takes Tim√©a to the Brazovics mansion in Kom√°rom. Brazovics himself is not at home, so they are greeted by his wife Zs√≥fia, their daughter Athalie and Athalie's suitor Lieutenant Kacsuka who was Tim√°r's friend since childhood. Brazovics arrives home just when Tim√©a is introduced to her new family. He has just read in the newspapers that Csorbadzsi fled the Ottoman Empire with his daughter, so he hurried home to meet them. He warmly welcomes Tim√©a, but when he receives the small box full of gold and learns that the ship went under with the rest of the pasha's possessions, he becomes angry and accuses Tim√°r of stealing the rest of the money. Tim√°r coldly refuses the accusation, and asks what should be done with the sunken ship. Brazovics charges him to auction off the wheat, which is worth almost nothing, lying soaked in the sunken ship. Tim√°r leaves. Brazovics and his wife agree that Tim√©a's inheritance is not enough to raise her as a noble lady, but since she is their niece, they have to look after her, so she will be a companion to Athalie ‚Äì not exactly a servant, but neither their adopted daughter. Tim√°r meets Lieutenant Imre Kacsuka, who is in charge of supplying the army with bread. Kacsuka advises Tim√°r to buy the shipload of worthless wheat and sell it cheap to the army. He assures him that the army will buy from him, not from others, since he can sell the cheapest wheat, and he will gain a great profit. Tim√°r is hesitating, for he knows what poor quality the bread made of that wheat will be, but when Kacsuka tells him that this way he could make some money to compensate Tim√©a for the loss of her inheritance, he agrees. He buys the shipload and inspects the workers bringing it out from the river. He notices a red crescent painted on one of the sacks and recalls Csorbadzsi's last words, when he said something about the red crescent but couldn't finish the sentence before he died. Tim√°r takes away that sack when nobody notices, and opening it he finds it to be full of treasure ‚Äì gold, gems, jewelry. He fights a battle with his conscience. He bought the whole shipload, not knowing what this sack is hiding, so the treasure is his. He feels that it rightfully belongs to Tim√©a, but he also knows that if he gave it to her now, all of it would be taken by Brazovics. Finally, he decides he will keep the money, invest it, increase his wealth and later he will ask Tim√©a to marry him, sharing his wealth with her. Still, a voice deep in his mind says \\"you are a thief\\". Tim√°r becomes rich, buys a house in the town and is invited to the social events of the elite. Only Brazovics suspects that there's something amiss. One night Tim√°r, to fend off all danger, pretends to be drunk and tells Brazovics about making bread from the drenched wheat and selling it to the army. Brazovics swears he will keep that information secret, but of course he immediately reports Tim√°r to the Ministry of Finance, which was in charge of funding the supply of the army. There is, however, no one to bear witness against Tim√°r; all the soldiers say they never ate better bread than what Tim√°r sold them. Tim√°r is thus acquitted of all charges, and everyone expects him to demand compensation from the minister who ordered the investigation. But Tim√°r is still looking for a way to explain to the world how he became rich, in order to be able to use the rest of his wealth too. He travels to Vienna, asks for an audience with the minister, and asks him to lease out a land on the countryside, in Levetinc to him. The minister, pleased that Tim√°r is not demanding an apology for the false accusations, and knowing that the previous tenant of that land went into debt, agrees. He also makes Tim√°r a nobleman, with the title \\"of Levetinc\\" added to his name. Tim√°r, as the new landlord of Levetinc, is supervising the agricultural work on the fields. He gains more and more money and becomes the richest wheat merchant in Kom√°rom. He gives a lot to charity, founds a hospital, gives money to schools, churches, and beggars. He is like King Midas, everything he touches becomes gold, each of his investments is successful, and the people in the town nickname him ‚Äúthe man with the golden touch‚Äù. However, he still feels deep in his heart that all this wealth does not belong to him. Meanwhile, Athalie Brazovics is preparing for her wedding with Kacsuka. Her father, Athan√°z Brazovics hates and envies Tim√°r for his success, but always greets him with a warm welcome in his house, thinking that he is courting Athalie, and not knowing that he visits them because of Tim√©a. Athalie is playing a cruel game ‚Äì she knows that Tim√©a is in love with Kacsuka, and told her that Kacsuka will marry her. Tim√©a is sewing and embroidering her bridal gown, not knowing that it is Athalie's, not her own, and it will be Athalie marrying Kacsuka, not her. She even converts to Christianity for the marriage's sake. Tim√°r knows about this cruel game and dislikes Athalie and her family more and more. Brazovics asks Tim√°r if he is planning to ask for Athalie's hand. Tim√°r refuses this, and tells Brazovics he finds his treatment of Tim√©a disgusting. He tells him that he had better fear the day when they'll meet again. He says goodbye to Tim√©a, promising her he will return, and then leaves. The whole town follows Tim√°r's actions in the financial world and when he starts buying land near Kom√°rom, Brazovics thinks Tim√°r knows something he doesn't. He guesses that it must be that the State plans fortifications to be extended around the town; therefore, the lands will be expropriated and the owners will get a large compensation, much more than the lands were originally worth. The only question is where will this work begin, since construction will last for at least thirty years, and in order to gain much, one has to buy the lands where the constructions will be started first. With false information, Tim√°r tricks Brazovics into investing all his money into lands where the construction will not start in the following decades. The day of Athalie's wedding has come. When Tim√©a wakes up, she sees Athalie in the bridal dress she made for herself, and realizes that it will be Athalie's wedding, not hers. The news comes that Brazovics is ruined, and that the lands he invested in are worthless. He dies. Kacsuka breaks his engagement with Athalie, for he only wanted her for her money. Brazovics's creditors are demanding their money, and all of his property is auctioned off. Tim√°r buys everything and gives it to Tim√©a, then asks her to marry him. Tim√©a, although she loves Kacsuka, agrees to marry him, out of gratitude. She asks Tim√°r to allow Athalie and her mother to stay with them. Tim√°r agrees and offers to give a rich dowry to Athalie so that she can marry the Kacsuka, but Athalie says she doesn't want Kacsuka any more. She says she will stay with them as Tim√©a's servant girl. =Part III ‚Äì The \\"No Man's Island\\"= After the wedding, Tim√°r realizes that though Tim√©a respects him enormously, she is not in love with him. He provides Tim√©a with gifts, jewels, and travels to foreign countries, in the hope of making her falling in love with him, but without any success. They move into the luxurious Brazovics mansion in Kom√°rom. Athalie is intent on making them miserable. Tim√°r begins to suspect that Tim√©a loves someone else. He decides to test her. He tells her he will travel to Levetinc and spend a month there. He leaves, but returns the same night to see if Tim√©a is with someone else. He finds the sleeping Tim√©a alone in her bedroom. He runs into Athalie who knows what's on his mind. Athalie, who is watching Tim√©a's every move, tells Tim√°r that Tim√©a does not love him, and confirms Tim√°r's suspicions about who Tim√©a loves; but she also tells him that Tim√©a is faithful to him and will always remain faithful. Tim√°r feels he cannot stay, and leaves his home as if pursued. In his travels he finds himself near the No Man's Island, and decides to visit its dwellers. He feels at home with Ter√©za and No√©mi, who is now sixteen years old. No√©mi carefully asks him if he has anybody waiting for him to return home, and Tim√°r lies and tells her that no one is waiting for him. =Part IV ‚Äì No√©mi= =Part V ‚Äì Athalie= Translations An English translation by Agnes Hegan Kennard, with the title Timar's Two Worlds, was published in 1888.

K√∂pmanbrinken (Swedish: \\"Merchant's Slope\\") is a street composed of two slopes, in Gamla stan, the old town in central Stockholm, Sweden. Both slopes connect the street √ñsterl√•nggatan west up to the small K√∂pmantorget and the street K√∂pmangatan. Since the foundation of the city the slopes reflects the original inclination treadled by the city's first inhabitants. The northern slope was referred to as Fiskestrandsbrinken (\\"Fishing Shore Slope\\") during the Middle Ages, because the area east of the slopes, between the alleys Nygr√§nd and Brunnsgr√§nd, used to be the city's main fish market Fiskaretorget until 1520. The statue of St George and his princess is replica made in 1912 of the medieval original in the cathedral Storkyrkan. On the narrow space along the slopes' eastern sides, where the statue of Saint George and the Dragon is found today, there was an entire block called Acteon which was demolished following a collapse in 1829. The slopes were made less steep following the collapse. During the 19th century, the slopes were regarded as two individual streets, separated by the square K√∂pmantorget. The two streets were subsequently united as a single street with its present name in 1885.

She has also written under the pseudonym Samantha Carter. Swendson is perhaps best known for the \\"Katie Chandler\\" series of novels, beginning with the 2005 publication of Enchanted, Inc. Biography Although Swendson majored in broadcast news at the University of Texas at Austin, she enrolled in a wide variety of courses that she thought could help her become a successful novelist. These courses included fencing (useful for fantasy novels), the search for extraterrestrial life (useful for science fiction novels) and parageography (the geography of imaginary lands). After her graduation, Swendson worked in public relations and became serious about learning to write a novel, joining local writing organizations, and researching the novel- writing process. She completed her first manuscripts for a contest, winning the science fiction/fantasy category and attracting the notice of an editor. Swendson sold this novel and two others in 1995 to a publisher who insisted that she use a pen name. She chose the name Samantha Carter, in part because she wanted to retain her own first initial but have a last initial from the other half of the alphabet from her own, and in part because she was a fan of The X-Files episode that included the Samantha clones. Her alter ego was named well before 1997 debut of the character on Stargate SG-1. After selling two more novels, this time to Harlequin Books, Swendson endured an eight-year period where she could not sell any of her other work. Her new job for a major international public relations firm required a great deal of travel and long hours, leaving her little or no time to write. Rather than allow her to resign, Swendson's supervisor asked her to work a three-quarter time schedule and gave her permission to telecommute, which freed her schedule enough that she could begin writing again. Office politics began to arise, however, and Swendson became less and less happy with the job. In 2004, she sold Enchanted, Inc. to Ballantine Books. Swendson has since written five sequels featuring the heroine Katie Chandler. Book 7, Kiss and Spell, is now available in the major bookstores. Strike Entertainment is in pre-production of a film adaptation of Enchanted, Inc. In January 2010, Steven Rogers was hired to write the screenplay. Rogers wrote the screenplays for romantic comedies Hope Floats, P.S. I Love You, and Kate & Leopold. Swendson, who is unpartnered, lives in Irving, Texas.

In other words, it is the idea that the nutritional value of a food is the sum of all its individual nutrients, vitamins, and other components. Another aspect of the term is the implication that the only point of eating is to promote bodily health. The term is largely pejorative, implying that this way of viewing food is simplistic and harmful, and the term is usually used to label others' views. The concept's most prominent opponent, and popularizer of the term, journalist Michael Pollan, argues that a food's nutritional value is \\"more than the sum of its parts.\\" Originally credited to Gyorgy Scrinis, the notion was popularized by Michael Pollan. The key to Pollan's understanding of nutritionism is \\"the widely shared but unexamined assumption ... that the key to understanding food is indeed the nutrient.\\" Since nutrients are invisible, it is now necessary to rely on nutrition experts to make food choices. Because science has an incomplete understanding of how food affects the human body, Pollan argues, relying solely on information regarding individual nutrients has led people and policy makers to repeatedly make poor decisions relating to nutrition. Pollan blames nutritionism for many of the health problems relating to diet in the Western World today. He compares Nutritionism to a religion, relying on \\"priests\\" (nutritional scientists and journalists) to interpret the latest orthodoxy for the masses. Like many religions, nutritionism has divided the world into good and evil components, although what is good or evil can change dramatically with time. Pollan believes that nutritionism is inherently flawed due to a reductive bias within science to isolate and study individual factors disconnected from their usual contexts such as diet and culture, factors which have repeatedly been shown to have a fundamental impact on nutritional outcomes. Even when scientists have attempted to study factors such as culture, diet, and long term consumption patterns, the enormous difficulties in making accurate measurements relating to individual nutritional components, and producing meaningful conclusions has resulted in incomplete results at best, and misleading or harmful results at worst. Ben Goldacre wrote that nutritionism, or its attribution to scientists, is the \\"bollocks du jour\\", and that it is \\"driven by a set of first year undergraduate errors in interpreting scientific data.\\" In his opinion, professional researchers and medical experts bear some blame for nutritionism because they at times created unrealistic expectations about the potential benefits of their research, but that the primary promoters of nutritionism are health food manufacturers, self- proclaimed \\"gurus\\" and journalists who have an incomplete understanding of science, along with a credulous public that is willing to believe whatever simplistic theories they are told in the mass media. At least one observer, Daniel Engber has argued that Pollan's anti-nutritionism, or anti-food science stance has taken on a dogmatic tint itself. He says, \\"Modern nutrition may be more of an ideology than a science, but so is Pollan's nutritional Darwinism. The two ideologies stand in direct opposition to one another, with the science-minded progressives on one side and the culinary conservatives on the other.\\" One criticism is that while many scientific studies of nutrition, or the conclusions extrapolated from them by both scientists and journalists have been bad, we should not reject a scientific approach to food altogether. One reviewer notes that the study of vitamins and nutrients led to vast improvement in treatment of diseases such as beriberi or scurvy and that with further refinement food science may well help combat other diseases and health conditions. The complexity of food science should not be taken as a reason to abandon systematic investigation of it. Daniel Engber also argues that Pollan over idealizes the diet of our ancestors, and believes that it may not be well suited to our modern needs.

Its type-site, Teleilat Ghassul (Teleilat el-Ghassul, Tulaylat al- Ghassul), is located in the eastern Jordan Valley near the northern edge of the Dead Sea, in modern Jordan. It was excavated in 1929-1938 and in 1959‚Äì1960, by the Jesuits.Hitti, 2004, p. 26. Basil Hennessy dug at the site in 1967 and in 1975‚Äì1977, and Stephen Bourke in 1994‚Äì1999. The Ghassulian stage was characterized by small hamlet settlements of mixed farming peoples, who had immigrated from the north and settled in the southern Levant - today's Jordan, Israel and Palestine. People of the Beersheba Culture (a Ghassulian subculture) lived in underground dwellings - a unique phenomenon in the archaeological history of the region - or in houses that were trapezoid-shaped and built of mud-brick. Those were often built partially underground (on top of collapsed underground dwellings) and were covered with remarkable polychrome wall paintings. Their pottery was highly elaborate, including footed bowls and horn-shaped drinking goblets, indicating the cultivation of wine. Several samples display the use of sculptural decoration or of a reserved slip (a clay and water coating partially wiped away while still wet). The Ghassulians were a Chalcolithic culture as they used stone tools but also smelted copper. Funerary customs show evidence that they buried their dead in stone dolmens A. Gorzalczany, \\"Centre and Periphery in Ancient Israel: New Approximations to Chalcolithic Funerary Practices in the Coastal Plain\\", Antiguo Oriente 5 (2007): 205-230. and also practiced secondary burial. Settlements belonging to the Ghassulian culture have been identified at numerous other sites in what is today southern Israel, especially in the region of Beersheba, where elaborate underground dwellings have been excavated. The Ghassulian culture correlates closely with the Amratian of Egypt and also seems to have affinities (e.g., the distinctive churns, or ‚Äúbird vases‚Äù) with early Minoan culture in Crete. Definition Ghassulian, a name applied to a Chalcolithic culture of the southern Levant, is derived from the eponymic site of Teleilat (el) Ghassul, northeast of the Dead Sea in the Great Rift Valley. The name has been used as a synonym for Chalcolithic in general and sometimes for late phases, associated with late strata at that site and other sites considered to be contemporary. More recently it has come to be associated with a regional cultural phenomenon (defined by sets of artifacts) in what is today central and southern Israel, the Palestinian territories in the West Bank, and the central area of western Jordan; all either well-watered or semi-arid zones. Other phases of the Chalcolithic, associated with different regions of the Levant, are Qatifian and Timnian (arid zones) and Golanian. The use of the name varies from scholar to scholar.  Origins  The main culture of the Chalcolithic era in Israel is the Ghassulian culture, named after the name of its type-site, Teleilat el- Ghassul, located in the eastern part of the Jordan Rift Valley, opposite Jericho. Afterwards, many additional settlements, located in other archaeological sites, were identified as Ghassulian settlements. All these settlements had been built in areas that had not been previously inhabited, mainly on the outskirts of populated areas. Thus, Chalcolithic settlements have been discovered in the Jordan Rift Valley, in the Israeli coastal plain and on its fringes, in the Judaean Desert and in the northern and western Negev. On the other hand, it seems that people of the Chalcolithic period did not settle in the mountainous regions of Israel or in northern Israel. Several facts allow us to assume that the carriers of this culture were immigrants who had brought their own culture with them: all excavated sites represent an advanced stage of this culture, whereas no evidence of its nascent stages has been discovered, so far, anywhere in the region. This culture's characteristics indicate they had connections with neighboring regions and that their culture had not evolved in the southern Levant. Their origins are not known. It is hard to determine the time of the Ghassulian settlement in the region, and whether or not they had evolved out of local, pre-Ghassulian, populations (such as the Bsorian culture). It could generally be said that most of these settlements date to the 2nd half of the 5th millennium BC, and that they usually existed for only a short period of time, with the exception of Teleilat el-Ghassul, where 8 successive layers of occupation from the Chalcolithic have been excavated, of which 6 are considered Ghassulian and the earlier, pre-Ghassulian, layers are thought to belong to the Besorian culture. The total depth of these layers is 4.5 meters.  Ghassulian Copper Industry  The earliest evidence to the existence of a copper-industry in Israel was discovered in Bir abu Matar, Near Be'er Sheba, which specialized in copper production and the casting of copper tools and artifacts. No copper ore is naturally available in the area of Beersheba, so it appears that the ore was brought here from Wadi Feynan, in southern Jordan, and possibly also from Timna, where an ancient copper mine was discovered. It was attributed by Beno Rothenberg to the Chalcolithic era. Dates and transition phases The Ghassulian, if used as a synonym for the entire Chalcolithic period and not, as more appropriately, just to the Late Chalcolithic, followed a Late Neolithic period and was succeeded by an Early Bronze I (EB I) period. Little is understood of the transition from the latest Chalcolithic to the earliest EB I, but there was apparently some transition of ceramic, flint-knapping and metallurgical traditions, especially in the southern regions of the southern Levant. The dates for Ghassulian are dependent upon 14C (radiocarbon) determinations, which suggest that the typical later Ghassulian began sometime around the mid-5th millennium and ended ca. 3800 BC. The transition from Late Ghassulian to EB I seems to have been ca. 3800-3500 BC. > The Issue of the nature of the transition from the Late Neolithic to the > Early Chalcolithic is re-examined in this article [...] The Late Neolithic > assemblages are to be closely identified with earlier Neolithic norms, > whereas the Early Chalcolithic assemblages display all the hallmarks of the > later Classic Ghassulian culture. -- S.J.

Two streets lead north and south: Bollhusgr√§nd and Baggensgatan respectively. History This small square was, notwithstanding the name, never used as a market. Instead, when it first appeared in historical records on a map dated 1733 as Ki√∂pmanne T., it was named after its location on the eastern end of K√∂pmangatan, the street leading to Stortorget, the square which used to be the main market place in Stockholm for centuries. Before 1685, the two blocks north and south of the square were united and on the location was a vault (K√∂pmanvalvet) during the Middle Ages forming one of the city gates (K√∂pmanporten). The penultimate name referring to the square appears in historical records as late as 1728 in the form Ki√∂pmans Hwalwet. In 1912, a bronze replica of Bernt Notke's sculpture Saint George and the Dragon was placed in the square. The original is in Storkyrkan.

The circles have been listed as Scheduled Ancient Monuments, and described as 'probable Neolithic ritual or ceremonial monuments similar to a henge'. The southernmost Priddy Circle falls on adjoining land to a house and stables that are owned by retired businessman Roger Penny. In 2012 Penny was fined ¬£10,000 after the earthwork was damaged by work he had permitted. Description The enclosures range in diameter from . Three of the circles are closely spaced in a nearly straight line, while the fourth is to the north and somewhat out of line with the other three. The total arrangement is spread over roughly . There is no missing enclosure in the gap between the northernmost enclosure and the others. This gap is bisected by the B3135 road and the course of the Roman road which runs between Charterhouse and Old Sarum. The four circles each consist of a flat circular area surrounded by a bank and external ditch enclosure with more than one entrance. Excavations carried out between 1956 and 1959 by members of the University of Bristol Spel√¶ological Society showed that the banks had stone cores with post and stake holes on either side. Geophysical surveys in 1995 and a magnetometer survey in 2006 are exploring further the make up of the circles. Aerial view of Priddy Circles, with the Priddy Nine Barrows and Ashen Hill Barrow Cemeteries in the distance. The circles are numbered in sequence 1 to 4, with number 1 being the most southerly of the group. Circle 1 is in diameter, with a surviving ditch up to wide and deep. It has several gaps, but the one to the north-north-east was a causewayed entrance feature. Circle 2 is in diameter, with a bank up to 6 m wide and high, and the ditch is up to deep. There are three gaps present in this earthwork, and the one to the north-north-east is possibly an original feature. Within circle 2 is a possible ovoid barrow mound measuring , and high. Circle 3 is up to across, with a bank up to 1 m high and wide, and ditch up to 1 m deep and wide. There are four gaps in this circle, the one to the south-south-west is considered an original entrance feature because it directly faces the north-north-west entrance of circle 2. Circle 4 has a diameter of up to 190 m but only two-thirds of the earthwork is present. Boreholes made in the 1950s suggested that the missing western section was never finished, possibly due to subsidence in the area. Associated with circle 4 is a group of mounds interpreted as barrows, one outside the circle to the west, and possibly four inside. 2011 damage In June 2011, it was reported that English Heritage was investigating damage to the site, and during July 2011 photographs were published that appear to show significant damage to a section of the southernmost circle. The owner of the southernmost ring, Roger Penny, was fined ¬£10,000 and ordered to restore the earthwork at a cost of ¬£38,000 following the damage caused by contractors he had hired. Rubble had been used to fill important ‚Äúswallet‚Äù holes in the ring, these have been described as natural cavities which may have been key to the monument‚Äôs creation. The workers also cleared gorse and bracken between April and October 2011, bringing rubble into the field to help rebuild a wall and moving a gate. In bringing in the rubble, ruts were made in the ground inside the circle by agricultural machinery. The damage included the destruction of a circular ditch said to be completely bulldozed. Penny was aware the ring was a scheduled monument and told the contractors not to touch it, but because part of the site is not visible to the naked eye \\"serious damage\\" was caused. English Heritage had not been consulted about the works. A spokeswoman for English Heritage described the damage as a \\"major incident\\", adding the structure was one of only about 80 henges in England. She said the loss of the fabric to the henge meant a \\"really, really rare piece of Neolithic engineering had been lost forever\\". Interpretation They are probably Neolithic ritual or ceremonial monuments similar to a henge but this interpretation is somewhat speculative due to the presence of external rather than internal ditches, a feature which makes them unique in Britain. Although no dating evidence has been found, they appear to be contemporary with Stonehenge, i.e. Neolithic circa 2500 BC \\\\- 2180 BC. Two round barrow cemeteries, Ashen Hill and Priddy Nine-Barrows, located less than south of the Circles, would seem to imply that the area to the northeast of Priddy held ritual significance into the Bronze Age.

Function LPA acts as a potent mitogen due to its activation of three high-affinity G-protein-coupled receptors called LPAR1, LPAR2, and LPAR3 (also known as EDG2, EDG4, and EDG7). Additional, newly identified LPA receptors include LPAR4 (P2RY9,GPR23), LPAR5 (GPR92) and LPAR6 (P2RY5,GPR87). Clinical significance Because of its ability to stimulate cell proliferation, aberrant LPA-signaling has been linked to cancer in numerous ways. Dysregulation of autotaxin or the LPA receptors can lead to hyperproliferation, which may contribute to oncogenesis and metastasis. LPA may be the cause of pruritus (itching) in individuals with cholestatic (impaired bile flow) diseases. GTPase activation Downstream of LPA receptor activation, the small GTPase Rho can be activated, subsequently activating Rho kinase. This can lead to the formation of stress fibers and cell migration through the inhibition of myosin light-chain phosphatase. Metabolism There are a number of potential routes to its biosynthesis, but the most well-characterized is by the action of a lysophospholipase D called autotaxin, which removes the choline group from lysophosphatidylcholine. Lysophosphatidic acid is also an intermediate in the synthesis of phosphatidic acid.

The name of the rank derives from the fact the rank corresponded to command of a warship of the largest class, the ship-of-the- line, as opposed to smaller types (corvettes and frigates). It is normally above the rank of frigate captain. Captain is equivalent to the naval rank of captain in most of the Commonwealth navies and captain in the United States Navy, and to the rank of captain at sea used in Germany and the Netherlands. Captain is rank OF-5 in the NATO rank codes, and equates to the land-forces rank of full colonel. Austro-Hungarian Empire Linienschiffskapit√§n was an officer rank in the Austro-Hungarian Navy, equivalent to Oberst in the land forces or Kapit√§n zur See in the Kaiserliche Marine. It is still partly used by the navies of the Empire's successor states, such as Yugoslavia and Croatia. In descending order, the other officer ranks below Linienschiffskapit√§n were *Frigate captain (Oberstleutnant in the land forces) *Corvette captain (Major in the land forces) *Ship-of-the-line lieutenant (Hauptmann in the land forces) *Frigate lieutenant (Oberleutnant in the land forces) *Corvette lieutenant (Leutnant in the land forces) Belgium In the Belgian Navy the rank of capitaine de vaisseau or kapitein-ter-zee is the third grade of superior officer, equivalent to colonel in the land forces. Its insignia is made up of four bands. He or she commands a capital ship (cruiser, battleship or aircraft carrier) or a shore establishment. Smaller vessels such as destroyers and frigates are commanded by a kapitein-luitenant. Canada In the Canadian Armed Forces, Captain(N) (French: ) is a rank for officers who wear navy uniform, equal to colonel for officers who wear army or air force uniform. Like colonel, captain(N) is the highest rank of senior officer. A captain(N) is senior to a commander or a lieutenant-colonel, and junior to a commodore or brigadier-general. Typical appointments for captains(N) include: * Commanding officer of a Canadian Forces base; * Commanding officer of a large school or research establishment, such as the Canadian Forces Maritime Warfare Centre; * Commanding officer of a ; * Chief of staff of a formation staff, or a director-general position on an administrative staff; * Foreign military attach√©. The rank insignia for a captain(N) is four stripes, worn on the cuffs of the service dress jacket, and on slip-ons on other uniforms. On the visor of the service cap is one row of gold oak leaves along the edge. Captains(N) wear the officers' pattern branch cap badge. The \\"(N)\\" is a part of the rank descriptor, and is used in official publications and documents to distinguish a captain(N) from a captain in the army or air force. It is also important to distinguish between the rank of captain(N) and the appointment of captain, meaning the commanding officer of a ship, regardless of his or her rank. A captain(N) is addressed initially as \\"Captain Bloggins\\", thereafter by superiors and peers as \\"Captain\\" and by subordinates as \\"Sir\\" or \\"Ma'am\\". The \\"(N)\\" is not part of the spoken address. Note: Before Unification of the Canadian Forces in 1968, rank structure and insignia followed the British pattern.

UNM Press publishes the Dialagos Series in Latin American Studies, the Mary Burritt Christiansen Poetry Series, and the Barbara Guth Worlds of Wonder Science Series for Young Readers.  The early years  On June 1, 1929, the Board of Regents of the University of New Mexico unanimously approved the establishment of the University of New Mexico Press (UNMP). At the time, the university enrolled about 1,000 students. The inaugural publications produced by the Press were pamphlets. It does not appear that when the Press was founded the Regents had plans other than for the Press to serve the university community by printing and distributing pamphlets, reports, and journals. The university printing plant and publishing arm were one entity, and for its first three years, UNMP was a printing facility for the university. On July 15, 1930, Stanford-educated Paul A.F. Walter, Jr., son of Santa Fe newspaperman Paul A. F. Walter, Sr., became the first director of UNMP. Leaving his post as editor of the Roswell Morning Dispatch, Walter moved to Santa Fe, where he was also assistant director of the Museum of New Mexico and the School of American Research. The School of American Research and UNM jointly paid his salary for his cooperative job assignment. In August 1930, at the annual meeting of the boards of the Museum of New Mexico and the School of American Research, Walter was authorized to move his father's printing plant for the periodical El Palacio to UNM campus. On August 13, 1930, the machinery was moved. In 1930, four publications were issued; in 1931, the number increased to ten, and in 1932, seven. These booklets were part of the \\"Bulletins Series\\", and featured studies by archaeology, education, geology, and engineering faculty at UNM, among others. The booklets sold for $.25 per copy, and UNMP housed stock and filled orders, though no marketing was done for these publications. Because early publications were printed by the UNMP plant, the copyright page often listed \\"University of New Mexico Press\\" as the publisher. The first hardcover, bound full-length book, was New Mexico History and Civics, by Lansing Bloom and Thomas Donnelly was published in September, 1933. The first book from UNMP printing facilities was Givers of Life by Emma Estabrook, though the first book considered a UNMP book (advertised, cataloged, and distributed) is New Mexico History and Civics. In its early years, the Press published the New Mexico Quarterly, a literary publication, and the New Mexico Historical Review. It continued to publish Walter's El Palacio.  The Great Depression and war years  Fred E. Harvey was hired as director in 1933, as Walter left to complete his Ph.D and become the founding faculty member of UNM's sociology department. Under Harvey, the Press began publishing its first hardcover books. The best-seller for this era was Practical Spoken Spanish by Arthur L. Campa and F.M. Kercheville, published in 1934, and still in print today. The first Press minutes on file are from the Committee on Publications meeting of April 20, 1937. The committee consisted of ‚ÄúBloom, Brand, Harvey, Pearce, Seyfried, John D. Clark, Popejoy, and Hammond‚Äù and was the editorial board of the Press. The committee received, discussed, and sent manuscripts out for critical review. The board also set the production budget. For the fiscal year 1937‚Äì1938, the printing budget was $6,000 and covered printing six University course catalogs and twelve faculty Bulletins, in addition to UNMP books. Also in 1937, UNMP joined the Association of American University Presses, an organization with whom it is still affiliated. During at least one year of the Depression era, no funds were available to pay Press employees during the summer months. Director Harvey told the Albuquerque Journal that the staff had agreed to work without pay until enough books were sold to compensate them. Harvey himself filled his car with books and sold them to bookstores and schools throughout New Mexico during these tough times. In 1940, the Press was involved in celebrating the four hundredth anniversary of the Coronado expedition to New Mexico. A statewide commission was set up to handle the celebration, and the Coronado Historical Fund, with federal and state moneys was established. Two series of books, later published by UNMP, were planned. The first‚Äîthe Coronado Historical Series‚Äîconsisted of ten titles authored by notable historians like Herbert E. Bolton, George P. Hammond, and Frances V. Scholes. The second series was an anthropological series that contained a two-volume set titled Pioneers in Anthropology. At the start of World War II the university wasstill relatively small. In the fall of 1943, University President Zimmerman, in assessing the work of various departments at UNM, asked Joseph A. Brandt, then director of the University of Chicago Press, to visit UNMP and submit suggestions for improvement. Brandt had been prime in launching the University of Oklahoma Press in 1928, and was a dynamic figure in university press publishing during this period. Brandt wrote a four-page letter to Zimmerman in June 1944, praising the university for its Press. He recommended a larger staff and subsidy and better equipment for the printing plant. Other suggestions included a focus on furthering the understanding of New Mexico citizens and their history and economics; a publishing schedule of six to ten new books to be published in two seasons each year; and a publishing proposal to accompany each book with reports from a qualified reader, a market estimate, and a financial plan. Many of Brandt's recommendations were incorporated into the publishing procedures still followed by UNMP. In 1945, Professor Dudley Wynn of the English department was made Director of UNMP. The printing plant continued as part of the Press but was made a separate division with Fred Harvey in charge. UNMP continued to print New Mexico Quarterly and also the Southwest Journal of Anthropology, New Mexico Historical Review, and New Mexico Business Review. Throughout the life of the Press, occasional subsidies or grant money helped offset publishing costs. In 1945, one of the first major grants was accepted when the Carnegie Corporation offered $1,500 for publication of It Happened in Taos, an educational study by J. T. Reid. By 1945, the Press had issued sixty-five books, employed a staff of twenty, and operated without a University subsidy. During the period of 1944‚Äì1946, the Press disassociated from joint publishing agreements with the School of American Research and Rydal Press, both in Santa Fe. The Press Committee drew up what appears to be the first comprehensive outline for Press operations in 1946. Budget appropriations, approval of manuscripts, qualifications of Press personnel, operating procedures, and an editorial program were all covered. The Committee and Press activities would be overseen by two executives: the Editor of Publications and the Press Manager. The Editor of Publications would build the list of the Press through acquisitions and the Press Manager would be responsible for the printing, marketing, and sales aspects. The editorial program at this time recognized that the Press would publish two kinds of materials: scholarly works that would be included in the Publications Series and other books. The Publications Series would be fully subsidized by the university, and others would be partially subsidized or published at the Press's own financial risk. Toward the end of the 1947-48 fiscal year, then- president of the university, Tom Popejoy, drew up business guidelines for UNMP. A deficit subsidy of $15,000 annually would be the university's maximum support and the Press was told to strive for increased sales and self- sufficiency. In mid-1949, Fred Harvey took a leave of absence and E. B. Mann replaced him. During this era, Mann published such writers as Ross Calvin and Frank Waters as the Press was giving serious attention to developing a regional list that would appeal to a wide audience. Mann, himself an author of Western fiction, proposed a series of reprints of Southwestern fiction, but the idea was tabled in 1950. The Press also made its first foray into publishing lithographed prints during Mann's tenure but, due to the marketing structure of the Press, sales for the prints were poor.  Reorganization  As a move toward greater economy and efficiency, UNM President Tom Popejoy decided to combine three departments‚ÄîUNM Press, the New Mexico Quarterly, and the Publications Series into one department. Printing operations moved to independent status as the University Printing Plant. As a result of this restructuring, all Press staff lost their jobs on September 15, 1956. The Regents then appointed Roland Dickey director, and in December 1956, four full-time and two part-time employees oversaw Press operations. In 1965, after a visit to UNMP by Frank H. Wardlaw‚Äîthen Director of the University of Texas Press‚ÄîDirector Dickey visited the University of Oklahoma Press to study their methods under Director Savoie Lottinville. On December 31, 1966, another reorganization of the Press took place. Dickey accepted a position with the University of Wisconsin Press, and on July 1, 1967, Roger Shugg, recently retired as head of the University of Chicago Press, became director. By the end of his first year, the Press had published sixteen new titles, compared to a total of nineteen over the previous three years. Sales income increased fifty-eight percent and the deficit was well below predictions. In 1969, UNMP published The Way to Rainy Mountain, N. Scott Momaday‚Äôs blockbuster that has become a modern-day classic of Kiowa Indian myth, history, and personal reminiscences. The New Yorker called the book ‚Äúfascinating‚Äù and ‚Äúbeautifully illustrated.‚Äù The book is still among UNMP's all-time best-selling titles. Around this same time, Jack D. Rittenhouse joined the Press. Rittenhouse left his position as director of the Museum of New Mexico Press. The popular Zia paperback reprint series was Editor Rittenhouse's brainchild and included more than thirty-five titles, including works from Edward Abbey, Larry McMurtry, and Frank Dobie. Roger Shugg retired in 1973, and Hugh Treadwell became director. When Treadwell resigned in early 1980, Shugg was once again brought out of retirement to act as interim director until the hiring late in the summer of 1980 of Luther Wilson, who came from the University of Oklahoma Press.  Modern times  After several years of overseeing growth of the Press's title output and revenue, Wilson left the Press in 1985 to become director at Syracuse University Press. Beth Hadas, editor-in-chief at UNMP, became director upon Wilson's departure. Hadas was one of only six women at the helm of a university press at the time. A year after Hadas became director, UNMP published The Education of Little Tree by Forrest Carter ‚Äî the Press's all-time best-selling title, having sold more than two million copies. Hadas and former director Wilson acquired reprint rights in 1985 from the author's agent and his widow. The book, originally positioned as a non-fiction account of the life of a Cherokee boy, with the sub-title \\"A True Story\\", was later deemed to be fiction because of the author's misrepresentation of his past, which included affiliation with the Ku Klux Klan and speech-writing for racist Alabama Governor George Wallace. Nevertheless, the story has maintained its popularity and enjoyed success on The New York Times Bestseller Lists for both fiction and nonfiction. In 1991, the book won the first annual Abby Award from the American Bookseller's Association for the book of the year. The Press has gained national and international stature since the 1970s in fields that parallel the strengths of UNM: western history, Latin American studies, anthropology and archaeology, photography and art, and Chicano/a and Native American studies. The Press also initiated distribution agreements to provide small client publishers with fulfillment and marketing services. Luther Wilson returned to the Press in 2000, after a stint at the University Press of Colorado. By the middle of the decade, list size had grown from fifty to eighty new titles a year and sales had doubled to $5 million. By 2006, turbulent downtrends associated with September 11 and the March 2003 invasion of Iraq occurred. Economic conditions necessitated a new wave of reorganization and downsizing in 2008‚Äì2009. Upon Luther Wilson's retirement in the summer of 2010, John W. Byram became director of the Press.

The name has been applied to three systems. CANTAT-1 CANTAT-1: Completed in 1961 by Cable & Wireless and Canadian Overseas Telecommunications Corporation (COTC). The system was installed in two segments as the first phase of the global system. The transatlantic segment linked Oban, Scotland - Hampden, Newfoundland on White Bay. The second undersea segment, linked by a land line to the White Bay terminus and completing the link to mainland Canada, was laid between Corner Brook, Newfoundland - Grosses Roches, Quebec. The official inauguration of the system was on December 19, 1961 when Canadian Prime Minister John Diefenbaker answered a call from Queen Elizabeth II. It was decommissioned in 1974. CANTAT-2 CANTAT-2: Completed in 1974 by the British General Post Office and Canadian Overseas Telecommunications Corporation (COTC). The cable with 489 repeaters linked Beaver Harbour, Canada with Widemouth Bay, England. The cable was withdrawn from service in 1992 but the Canadian end was rerouted to Sable Island and recommissioned as SITIFOG 2000 until it was abandoned after developing a fault.

It is the first episode of a two-part story written by Paul Cornell adapted from his 1995 Doctor Who novel Human Nature. Its second part, \\"The Family of Blood\\", aired on 2 June. Along with \\"The Family of Blood\\", it was nominated for the Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation, Short Form in 2008. In the episode, the alien time traveller the Tenth Doctor (David Tennant) hides from his pursuers, the Family of Blood, in 1913 England. He transforms himself into a human and implants the false persona of a schoolteacher called \\"John Smith\\" to avoid detection until the Family's life runs out. Plot The Tenth Doctor tells Martha that they are being pursued by the Family of Blood, who seek the Doctor's Time Lord life force to prevent themselves from dying. He tells Martha that he must transform into a human to escape the Family's detection until they die out, and gives her a list of instructions to follow. The Doctor turns himself into a human and transfers his Time Lord essence and memories into a fob watch that he asks Martha to guard. They land on Earth in 1913. The Doctor has taken the persona of John Smith, a teacher at Farringham School for boys, and Martha acts as a maid at the school. John is quiet and timid, but faint memories of the Doctor slip through in his dreams. He catalogues the dreams in a book he has titled A Journal of Impossible Things. John keeps the fob watch on his mantle, believing it is a normal watch. John has also become infatuated with the school nurse, young widow Joan Redfern, and shares his journal with her. Martha is concerned, as the Doctor did not instruct her on what to do should he fall in love. Timothy Latimer, a young student at the school who has extrasensory perception, discovers the fob watch and bonds with it, seeing visions of the Doctor. The Family of Blood track the Doctor to Earth, and cloak their ship with an invisibility shield to keep it hidden. The Family seek out humans to possess, and take the bodies of several people including one of the schoolboys, Jeremy Baines. They also animate scarecrows to use as their soldiers. When Timothy briefly opens the fob watch and experiences portions of the Doctor's memories, the Family detects its presence at the school. Martha realises that the Family has found them, and attempts to retrieve the watch but cannot find it. John asks Joan to accompany him to the village dance that night, and she accepts. At the dance, Martha again tries to persuade John to become the Doctor by showing him elements of his past such as his sonic screwdriver. Now aware that John Smith is the Doctor, the Family interrupt the dance and confront him. They take Martha and Joan as hostages and give John a choice to either become a Time Lord again or watch his companions die. =Continuity= All ten incarnations of the Doctor are also illustrated (albeit not all are shown on-screen), with the First, Fifth, Sixth, Seventh, and Eighth clearly visible, marking the first time the faces of the Doctors from the classic series had been depicted on screen in the revived series. The pocket watch from the episode is also sketched. Production Human Nature was Paul Cornell's fifth original novel, all having been Doctor Who stories for Virgin Publishing, and the thirty-eighth New Adventure. The plot was developed with fellow New Adventure novelist Kate Orman and the book was well received on its publication in 1995. Several years later, the revived Doctor Who television series included several people who had worked on the New Adventures. For his second story for the television series, Cornell adapted his novel. Although most praise for the script was directed at Cornell, a great deal of the episode had in fact been rewritten by executive producer Russell T Davies. Despite Julie Gardner's position as executive producer since \\"Rose\\", this episode marks the first time since Verity Lambert's 1965 swansong, \\"Mission to the Unknown\\", that a woman was the credited producer of an episode of Doctor Who. However, it is not producer Susie Liggat's first production job in the Doctor Who universe: in 2006, she produced Invasion of the Bane, the first episode of The Sarah Jane Adventures. Thus, only she and John Nathan-Turner have produced episodes from two different programmes set in the Doctor Who universe. The physical prop of John Smith's journal notebook was created by artist Kellyanne Walker, and incorporates text provided by writer Paul Cornell. Much of the episode was filmed at St Fagans National History Museum, an open-air museum near Cardiff, and Treberfydd, the Victorian Gothic mansion which served as Farringham School, located near Llangorse Lake in south Wales.\\"Human Nature\\" podcast Other interior locations were filmed at Llandaff Cathedral, Cardiff. The Doctor's list of 23 directives, much of which is sped through in the episode, is presented at normal speed in a deleted scene released on the BBC DVD. In place of the nonexistent unheard requests, David Tennant breaks the fourth wall to speak about a love for The Housemartins and also talk nonsense to pad out the time before returning to character for the 23rd and final directive. Another instruction, about not letting Smith eat pears, appears in both the deleted scene and in the novel Human Nature. Reception The scarecrows from the episode as they appear at the Doctor Who Experience. Along with \\"The Family of Blood\\", \\"Human Nature\\" was nominated for the 2008 Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation, Short Form. David Tennant won the Constellation Award for Best Male Performance in a 2007 Science Fiction Television Episode for the two-part story. The episode also received a favourable review from The Stage with reviewer Mark Wright commenting that the episode \\"is unlike any Doctor Who story you'll ever see\\", and that there was \\"nothing duff\\" about the episode. Wright singles out the performances of Agyeman and Tennant for considerable praise and he concludes by describing the episode as \\"BAFTA worthy Drama\\". IGN's Travis Fickett gave \\"Human Nature\\" a rating of 9.1 out of 10, writing that it \\"has some of the highest caliber of writing the series has seen\\". He particularly praised the performances of Stevenson and Sangster and the episode's \\"more deliberate pace\\". While he noted that the Family with Baines in particular were creepy, he felt that the scarecrows \\"might seem a little silly\\" to older viewers. In 2009, Doctor Who Magazine readers voted \\"Human Nature\\"/\\"The Family of Blood\\" as the sixth best Doctor Who story of all time. In a 2014 poll, Doctor Who Magazine readers voted the episodes as the ninth best. Matt Wales of IGN named the two-part story the best episode of Tennant's tenure as the Doctor, describing it as \\"stunningly produced\\" and praising Tennant's performance. In 2008, The Daily Telegraph named it the seventh best Doctor Who episode in the show's history.

Its studios and transmitter are at the ABS-CBN Broadcast Center, San Jose Road, Zamboanga City. Timeline *Channel 3 Zamboanga was launched by RT Broadcasting Specialist, Inc. in 1976, the first in the city after the declaration of Martial Law in 1972. During that time, it was then called as Pioneer 3 Zamboanga, a GMA Network affiliate. It was also the first station in Zamboanga to air a local newscast on early evenings. It also broadcast other local shows produced in Zamboanga. From 1992 to 1994, as part of GMA's expansion of coverage through the Rainbow Satellite, Pioneer RT3 stopped producing local newscasts and became a relay of GMA's flagship television station DZBB-TV channel 7. *On January 1, 1995, ABS-CBN Broadcasting Corporation (whose programs were aired via affiliate station First United Broadcasting Corporation's DXLA-TV Channel 9 since 1986) purchased Channel 3 from RT Broadcasting. To compensate the purchase, network affiliations were swapped between ABS-CBN and FUBC; with the former becoming an owned and operated station, and FUBC picking up the GMA affiliation on channel 9. *The station was one of the first stations airing Cebu-produced ABS-CBN programs under the Regional Network Group in March 1995; the others being ABS-CBN 2 Cagayan de Oro (now ABS-CBN 4 Cagayan de Oro), ABS-CBN 3 General Santos and ABS-CBN 4 Davao during the launching of two Visayan drama series \\"Kang Kinsa Isabwag ang Mga Bulak\\" and \\"Siya ug Ako sa Kangitngit\\" along with the original sitcom \\"Milyonaryong Mini\\".

The musical closed after one performance on Broadway. Background Based on John Steinbeck's novel East of Eden, the allegorical tale centers on the Trasks and the Hamiltons, two families drawn to the rich farmlands of Salinas, California, in the early 20th century. While Steinbeck traced the two clans through three generations, the musical limits the action to the period between 1915 and 1917 and focuses primarily on the Cain and Abel aspects of the work. Production McNally asked that his name be removed from the credits prior to opening night.Mandelbaum, Ken.

Directed by Michael Kahn and choreographed by Tony Mordente, the cast included Paul Rogers as Adam Trask, Walter McGinn as Caleb Trask, Ken Kercheval as Aron Trask, James Coco as Lee, Graciela Daniele as Faith, and Heather MacRae as Abra Bacon. The scenery was by Ming Cho Lee, costumes by Ruth Morley, and lighting by Jules Fisher.Barnes, Clive. \\"The Theater. 'Here's Where I Belong'\\", The New York Times, March 4, 1968, p. 32 The play was picketed by the newly formed Oriental Actors of America, a group of Asian American stage actors, as a protest against the practice of casting white actors in yellowface makeup to portray East Asian characters (usually Chinese or Japanese). The role of \\"Lee\\", the Trask family's Chinese cook, had been assigned to white actor (and future Academy Award nominee) James Coco. Variety would mention the picketing in its review of the failed musical and note, \\"On the basis of the show, they had a point.\\" Esther Kim Lee, A History of Asian American Theatre (Cambridge University Press, 2006) p29 Clive Barnes, in his review in The New York Times, questioned whether the book (East of Eden) could be a viable musical as it was \\"too serious\\", but praised the sets by Ming Cho Lee and wrote that Paul Rogers had a \\"strong singing voice\\" and was dignified.

Commonly known as golden-winged grosbeaks, they are attractive, chunky, medium-sized, robust-billed songbirds restricted to the southern Arabian and northern Somalian regions. These elusive birds are typically found between 1,060 and 2,800 metres ASL in forested wadis and areas of scrub. The fruits of junipers, acacias and spurges appear to form the bulk of their diet. Description These birds have slight sexual dichromatism. Males are grey- brown overall with a black bill, dark mask, white cheeks, and large, bright yellow patches on the wings and tail. The extent of the dark head-pattern and white cheek-patches varies considerably between taxa. The females are similar to the males though somewhat duller, and the juveniles are rather streaky and lack the adults' distinctive head pattern. Systematics The large bill suggests a relationship with the Asian grosbeaks - e.g. Mycerobas - but its song and calls are reminiscent of European goldfinch Carduelis carduelis, European greenfinch C. chloris, and Yemen linnet C. yemenensis. Also it has been observed performing a greenfinch-like slow-winged display flight which suggests its true affinities may lie within the genus Carduelis. Altogether, Rhynchostruthus seems to belong to a group of Carduelinae which includes such birds as Carduelis, the oriole finch (Linurgus olivaceus), and the canaries, many of which have large amounts of brilliant yellow plumage. But the exact placement of the golden-winged grosbeaks is not very well resolved. Molecular genetic studies have shown that Rhynchostruthus and Rhodospiza form a distinct clade but are not closely related to any other of the birds commonly referred to as \\"grosbeaks\\". The genus used to contain a single species, Rhynchostruthus socotranus. But more recently this is often split into three: * Socotra golden-winged grosbeak, Rhynchostruthus socotranus * Arabian golden-winged grosbeak, Rhynchostruthus percivali * Somali golden-winged grosbeak, Rhynchostruthus louisae References External links * Socotra Grosbeak photographs.

Typical costs are several cents per transaction to as high as one dollar or more. Lockbox services are sometimes called \\"remittance services\\" or \\"remittance processing\\". One benefit of the lockbox service to the commercial customer is that it can maintain special mailboxes in different locations around the country and a customer sends payment to the closest lockbox. The company then authorizes a bank to check these mailboxes as often as is reasonable, given the number of payments that will be received. Because the bank is making the collection, the funds that have been received are immediately deposited into the company's account without first being processed by the company's accounting system, thereby speeding up cash collection. Wholesale and retail Lockbox services are generally divided into wholesale and retail. Retail lockboxes are for companies with high volumes of consumer- oriented payments such as utility payments, loan payments, etc., and these remittances often include a standardized \\"payment coupon\\". Wholesale lockboxes are for corporate-to-corporate payments and tend to be higher dollar amounts than retail lockbox transactions. These transactions usually do not include a standardized payment coupon and require more manual effort for the bank to process. Electronic conversion With the advent of cheque truncation, it has become common to \\"capture\\" images of the checks and associated documentation (payment coupons, for example) into a digital format for use in computer systems (i.e., TIFF, JPEG or PDF files). These files can then undergo OCR and data validation when character confidence is low and then further specialized processing may take place. Banks often use specialized mail processing and document scanner equipment that can scan hundreds, or thousands, of checks per minute. Specialized software increases the productivity of the banking customers allowing them to receive electronic data and images from the bank and automation exists that can quickly move the images into document-management systems, work-flow systems and accounting systems. In the health-care industry, this data is converted into edi 835 5010 ERA format (electronic remittance advice). Due to the Check 21 Act, most lockbox services convert checks to electronic images, and the paper checks are shredded and the electronic checks are sent electronically to the originating bank. =Online bill-payment services= Many online electronic bill-pay services are not 100 percent online. The payee might not be set up to accept electronic payments, so the bill-pay service will print out large numbers of paper checks and then mail them to the lockbox, where they will be processed alongside all the other paper checks. =Offshoring= Transferring data from paper to electronic format involves labor-intensive data entry work. This has prompted a movement to \\"offshore\\" the data entry of the information on checks to countries (e.g., India) that have abundant employees which helps in ultimately lowering the costs.See for example Carretek's advertising for Retail and Wholesale operations they do in India.India Times article about ABN Amro transferring work (including lockbox work) to Chennai.edata India 's advert for \\"lockbox processing\\".

It is sold over-the-counter in the United States as Solotuss, or in combination with other medications, especially decongestants. One such product is Certuss, a combination of guaifenesin and pentoxyverine. The drug is available in the form of drops, suspensions and suppositories. Uses The drug is used for the treatment of dry cough associated with conditions such as common cold, bronchitis or sinusitis. Like codeine and other antitussives, it relieves the symptom, but does not heal the illness. No controlled clinical trials regarding the efficiency of pentoyxverine are available. Pharmacologists use the substance as a selective agonist at the sigma-1 receptor in animal and in vitro experiments. Contraindications Pentoxyverine is contraindicated in persons with bronchial asthma or other kinds of respiratory insufficiency (breathing difficulties), as well as angle-closure glaucoma. No data are available for the use of pentoxyverine during pregnancy, lactation, or children under two years of age, wherefore the drug must not be used under these circumstances. Antitussive drugs are not useful in patients with extensive phlegm production because they prevent coughing up the phlegm. Adverse effects The most common side effects (seen in more than 1% of patients) are upper abdominal (belly) pain, diarrhoea, dry mouth, and nausea or vomiting. Allergic reactions of the skin like itching, rashes, hives and angiooedema are rare. The same is true for anaphylactic shock and convulsions. Overdose Overdosage leads to drowsiness, agitation, nausea and anticholinergic effects like tachycardia (high heart rate), dry mouth, blurred vision, glaucoma, or urinary retention. Especially in children, pentoxyverine can cause hypoventilation, but much more seldom than codeine and other opioid antitussives. The treatment of overdosage aims at the symptoms; there are no specific antidotes available.  Interactions  No interactions have been described at usual doses. It is possible that pentoxyverine can increase the potency of sedative drugs like benzodiazepines, some anticonvulsants and antidepressants, and alcohol. Likewise, some consumer informations warn patients from taking the drug in combination with or up to two weeks after monoamine oxidase inhibitors, which are known to cause potentially fatal reactions in combination with the (chemically only distantly related) antitussive dextromethorphan. Mechanism of action Pentoxyverine suppresses the cough reflex in the central nervous system, but the exact mechanism of action is not known with certainty. The drug acts as an antagonist at muscarinic receptors (subtype M1) and as an agonist at sigma receptors (subtype œÉ1). Its anticholinergic properties can theoretically relax the pulmonary alveoli and reduce phlegm production. Spasmolytic and local anaesthetic properties have also been described. The clinical relevance of these mechanisms is uncertain. Pharmacokinetics The substance is absorbed quickly from the gut and reaches its maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) after about two hours. If applied rectally, Cmax is reached after four hours. The bioavailability of the suppositories, measured as area under the curve (AUC), is about twofold that of oral formulations, due to a first pass effect of over 50%. By far the most important metabolisation reaction is ester hydrolysis, which accounts for 26.3% of the total clearance through the kidneys. Only 0.37% are cleared in form of the original substance. The plasma half life is 2.3 hours for oral formulations and three to 3.5 hours for suppositories. Pentoxyverine is also excreted into the breast milk. Chemical properties Pentoxyverine dihydrogen citrate, the salt that is commonly used for oral preparations, is a white to off-white, crystalline powder. It dissolves easily in water or chloroform, but not in benzene, diethyl ether, or petroleum ether. It melts at . Other orally available salts are the hydrochloride and the tannate; suppositories contain the free base.

Saint Budoc is the patron of Plourin Ploudalmezeau in Finist√®re where his relics are preserved. His feast day was celebrated on 8 December, the date still used in Devon, but in Brittany this was moved to 9 December.\\"Budoc\\", Oxford Dictionary of Saints Name The name Budoc, or Beuzec, means \\"saved from the waters\\" from the Breton beuzi√± meaning \\"drown\\"; but Baring-Gould finds this \\"fanciful\\". In old Celtic, boudi means \\"victory\\" and \\"profit,\\" Life Baring-Gould suggests that the princess Azenor fled Brittany with her young son due to dynastic conflict. Arriving first in Cornwall, they then proceeded to Ireland, where Budoc became a monk. They later returned to Brittany, landing at Porspoder near Brest.Baring-Gould, Sabine. \\"S. Budoc, Abbot and Confessor\\", The Lives of the British Saints, C. J. Clark, 1907, p. 329 Hagiographer G.H. Doble is of the opinion that Budoc was a once famous abbot whose chief establishment was on the Breton coast. The vita of Breton Saint Winwaloe describes Budoc as a teacher living on the island of Laurea. Later Budoc succeeded Saint Samson and Magloire as bishop of Dol and ruled for 26 years (according to the 10th century vita of Magloire and the 11th century 'Chronicle of Dol'). Baring-Gould distinguishes between the abbot Budoc and the successor to bishop Magloire at Dol.  Legend  Budoc is reputed to have been grandson of the King Even of Brest. His mother, Princess Azenor of Brest, had been falsely accused of infidelity by her jealous stepmother, who had thrown the pregnant Azenor into the sea in a cask. (A tower of the Ch√¢teau de Brest is named for her.) Azenor invoked the help of Saint Brigid. The cask drifted for five months. Shorty after Azenor's baby was born, the cask washed ashore on the coast of Ireland.The story echoes the Greek myth regarding the young Perseus. A villager summoned the abbot of Beau Port, near Waterford, and the child was christened the next day. Azenor became the washer-woman of the monastery, and Budoc was raised there. Azenor's stepmother fell ill, and upon her deathbed she recanted the evil lies she had spread. Azenor's husband sailed in search of Azenor, and arriving in Ireland, the couple was reconciled, but both died before they could return to Brittany. (However, a tradition in Cornouaille has Azenor founding a religious establishment at Cap Sizun). Budoc became a monk.http://www.catholic- forum.com/Saints/saintb63.htm He eventually left Ireland, sailing in a stone trough that landed at Porspoder.  Budoc in South-West England  Budoc is reputed to have sailed across the Plymouth Sound, until he found an inlet on the Devon side of the River Tamar. He landed in Budshead Creek, part of the present district of Plymouth called St Budeaux. His supposed activity suggests the foundation of an early church in Plymouth.http://members.fortunecity.com/gerdewnansek/devonssaints.html However, there is no evidence of the name in Devon prior to the 16th century. There is also an ancient church said to have been dedicated by him at Budock in Cornwall, and there was once one in Oxford too.Doble, G. H. (1964) The Saints of Cornwall: part 3.

He studied Biology and Composition concurrently at Oberlin College and Oberlin Conservatory of Music before attending Harvard University on a full fellowship. He holds a PhD in Composition from Harvard. ;Awards Among his awards as a composer are a BMI Award, First Prize in the National Society of Arts and Letters Composition Competition, an American Music Center Grant and a Fellowship from the German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD) for further study of composition with Isang Yun in Berlin in 1977. ;Continued Studies During his time in Berlin, he continued piano studies as well as conducting under Professor Hans Martin Rabenstein. It was during this period that he composed his Sinfonie N¬∞ 2 (Grodek) before assuming a position as pianist at the opera house in Graz, Austria. Career in the Symphony In 1982, he was engaged to Lorin Maazel as Repetiteur at the Vienna State Opera, a position which he held until his appointment by Maazel as Associate Conductor of the Pittsburgh Symphony from 1988 to 1991. He returned to Europe as I. Kapellmeister at the Aachen Opera where he subsequently also served as Music Director and Studienleiter.

He was Member of Parliament (MP) for Eastbourne from 1910 to 1924. He was the father of cookery writer Elizabeth David. Early years Gwynne was the third son and fourth child of nine children of James Eglinton Anderson Gwynne (1834-1915) of Gwynnes Limited and of Wootton Manor, Polegate, Sussex. He was educated at Shrewsbury School and then Pembroke College, Cambridge.Ken Good, The House of Gwynne, Bookmarque Publishing 2002 He was called to the Bar at the Inner Temple in 1908.

He was Financial Secretary to the War Office from 15 March 1923 until 23 January 1924. On 1 October 1923 he was made a member of the Army Council.London Gazette He was renowned for his opposition to the Irish Republican Army which he termed \\"the Murder Gang\\".

Newtown Football Club is a football club in County Clare, Republic of Ireland. The club was founded in 1977 and entered the Clare Junior League. Its founder members Red Austin, Jim Rocks, Tom McDade (Senior) and Donal Magee (Senior), all originally hailed from Belfast. Jimmy is still involved in the club but all the founder members have sons and grandsons all heavily involved at present. The link with their origins is reflected in their crest which includes the red hand of Ulster surrounded by the 3 ships of Clare. The club currently have two junior teams, a youth team and five schoolboy‚Äôs teams and a girls team. All work at the club is voluntary and our existence depends on community support and on a small number of \\"behind the scenes\\" people. Facilities Since the club‚Äôs foundation in 1977 they have played on Shannon Development‚Äôs property in Ballycasey with the bare essentials and without facilities to supply water and electricity. Having decided to take the decision to purchase their own land, the club committed to develop this area to the highest standard and now boast the best pitches in Clare if not the province. Their main objective was to develop good playing surfaces to facilitate the young in Shannon and to encourage good quality football throughout the season regardless of weather. Surfaces in Shannon must be developed from scratch as the area is mostly former bogland and below sea level and the club was aware that a six-figure sum would be required in order to develop the proper playing surfaces for pitches. They were the first club in Clare to obtain the use of three playing pitches with proper dressing room facilities. Having developed schoolboy soccer for the last 25 years they have recently added girls/women's teams as a further commitment to the town. Newtown started playing on these pitches in September 1998. Not one penny was borrowed. The weekly club lottery paid out big jackpot prizes in the local area as well as contributing handsomely to the grounds development. The same familiar faces buy and sell tickets week in, week out. Without this local grass root support the enterprise would have been a non-starter. Local businesses also came on board to give a helping hand. Shannon Town Commissioners, Clare County Council and the National Lottery also helped with well-timed cash grants. Newtown had now come a long way. In 1982 club records show its profits for that year were a handsome ¬£32. Phase 2 is now commencing and the club is again starting from scratch. The next phase is to provide proper training facilities. Competition Although a relatively new club the \\"A\\" team won its first premier league title in 1987 under manager Brendan Wall and that same season they defeated League of Ireland opponents Limerick City (1-0) under Billy Hamilton. Two years later they won the league and cup double and reached the quarter finals of the Munster Junior Cup where they were narrowly defeated after a replay. In 1992 Newtown made its mark at national level by reaching the last 16 in the FAI Junior Cup (over 1000 teams originally entered). A year later incredibly Newtown went one step further and reached the last eight in the country ‚Äì only to be defeated 1-0 by Buttevant AFC (Cork AUL) after a replay (3-3 in drawn game). Manager during this period was founder member and former player Jimmy Rocks. Numerous league and cup titles have been won at schoolboy and youths level as well as some great success in the SFAI national cup competitions. Newtown can boast having supplied both of Clare's Junior/Amateur internationals in Paul Carr, who later starred for Limerick FC and Waterford in the LOI and David Wall, with the latter also playing for Limerick 37 FC. Their latest success is their Women's team which, in its second year in existence, have won the Limerick Leagues 2nd Division and reached the semifinal of the WFAI Junior Cup Present Recently Newtown Football Club have decided to Co-partner Park A.F.C in the Limerick League with Newtown Managers, some Players and other members of staff joining the facilities at Riverside Park. Latest news is that former Newtown player and junior international Davey Wall has taken over as first team manager cementing joining of both clubs in what should be a bright future for the club and the town. Shannon Hibernians FC was formed as a result of Newtown FC and Park AFC joining forces. Currently Shannon Hibs First team play in the LDMC (LIMERICK) division 1A. Hibs as they are now known also have a B team, ladies' team, Youth team, 17's and school boy/girls teams ranging from under 5's up to under 16 years of age.

Piper and Chambers themselves have both gone on to achieve veteran status as educators, writers and curators.

In furtherance of its obligation to protect and serve the public, the WSBA both regulates lawyers and other legal professionals and serves its members as a professional association ‚Äî all without public funding. The WSBA's mission is to serve the public and the members of the Bar, to ensure the integrity of the legal profession, and to champion justice. Kyle D. Sciuchetti is the President of WSBA. He, along with 14 members of the Board of Governors and WSBA's Interim Executive Director Terra Nevitt, make up the Bar's governance. President Sciuchetti, previously served on the Board of Governors representing the 3rd Federal Congressional District after being elected to represent the members in 2017. Rajeev Majumdar is the Immediate Past President and former governor representing the 2nd Federal Congressional District. WSBA is the first state bar in the United States to issue alternative licenses to practice law for practitioners who are not lawyers. The Washington Supreme Court on June 15, 2012, issued an order adopting the Limited License Legal Technician (LLLT) Rule, directing WSBA to create a license that allows trained professionals to practice law on a limited basis as a means to further access to justice for those who cannot afford a lawyer. In March 2013 the Court approved family law as the first practice area authorized for limited license legal technicians under the Court's Admission and Practice Rule (APR) 28. The first group of legal technicians were licensed in 2015. As of March 20, 2018, 31 active legal technicians were license to practice in Washington state. WSBA also administers, under APR 12, the Limited Practice Officer (LPO) license for nonlawyers to select, prepare, and complete approved documents for use in closing a loan, extension of credit, sale, or other transfer of real or personal property. As of March 20, 2018, there were 796 active LPOs licensed to practice in Washington state. History In the days of Washington Territory, lawyers who had cases set for argument before the State Supreme Court were required to be present at the beginning of the Court term in January. Sometimes they waited for weeks for their cases to be called. On January 19, 1888, a group of these lawyers met in the Supreme Court chambers to form the Washington Bar Association. This was a voluntary organization and did not include all lawyers admitted to practice; originally it consisted of 35 lawyers, at a cost of $5 a year. In 1890, the name changed to Washington State Bar Association. In 1930, as more lawyers were admitted to practice, it was proposed that the Bar Association have a paid executive secretary and a paid representative in Olympia when the Legislature was meeting, that it have an official publication, and that it be incorporated. George McCush of Bellingham headed an Incorporation Committee to draft a Bar Association Act proposal. The committee proposed that the Bar Association be an agency of the state, creating \\"a complete integrated (i.e., mandatory membership) Bar which is officially organized, self-governed and all inclusive.\\" The annual license fee would be $5. In 1933, after much debate and some redrafting, the legislature enacted the State Bar Act (Ch. 2.48 RCW). According to its Bylaws, WSBA will not take positions on issues concerning the politics or social positions of foreign nations; take positions on political or social issues which do not relate to or affect the practice of law or the administration of justice; or support or oppose, in an election, candidates for public office. =Current Structure= Today, a 14-member Board of Governors (BOG), elected geographically, directs the WSBA. There is one governor for each of the 10 districts (except for the 7th District, which is divided into 7th-North and 7th-South), plus three at-large governors (one of whom must be a \\"young lawyer\\" as that term is defined under WSBA bylaws). The Board is elected solely by WSBA members, except for the at-large governors who are selected by the Board. Annually, the Board selects a president-elect and elects one of its members as treasurer. It employs an executive director to carry out the purposes and functions of the Bar. The WSBA employs a staff of approximately 150. =Financing= WSBA is funded by mandatory license fees imposed upon Washington lawyers by order of the Supreme Court. At the time of an American Bar Association 2007 Dues and Mandatory Fees Survey (available from ABA), of the 32 mandatory state bars in the country, Washington's license fees rank near the middle among those states with comparable membership size (e.g., Michigan, Wisconsin, Georgia). In 2012, license fees were reduced to $325 as a result of a member referendum, thus placing the WSBA annual fee near the median for all state bar associations, according to the ABA Survey. Based on WSBA bylaws, any member may propose a member referendum to overturn a Board decision, if he/she submits a specified number of signatures in support of his/her effort. After submitting the required number of signatures, a member referendum was put before the membership to reduce license fees to $325. It passed by a vote of 52% of those who voted, cutting the WSBA budget by 26%. A wave of staff layoffs ensued, as well as budget reductions and changes to programs and services. Services to Lawyers WSBA implements the rules for admitting persons to the practice of law by means of biannual Bar Exams and annual relicensing. Its Office of Disciplinary Counsel investigates and prosecutes claims of lawyer misconduct, as specified in the Washington State Court Rules of Professional Conduct. WSBA's Lawyer Services Department provides a variety of services: *The Job Seeking Assistance program offers job listings, career counseling, support groups, and information about job search skills. *The Ethics/Professional Responsibility Program provides education on ethical matters. A telephone Ethics Line allows anonymous inquires by lawyers needing advice. WSBA Ethics Opinions are maintained online. *The Law Office Management Assistance Program provides education and advice on running a law office, including a lending library and on-site education. *The Lawyer Assistance Program (LAP) offers confidential mental health and chemical dependency counseling services for Washington state judges, lawyers, and third-year law students. Services include peer advisors, confidential individual consultations, support groups and statewide 24/7 phone access to WSBA Connects, which offers support to lawyers needing health and well-being support. The LAP was established to prevent or alleviate problems before they jeopardize an individual's ability to practice law. Services are confidential, as provided under Washington State Rules APR 19(b) WSBA's Advancement Department provides a broad array of educational opportunities for lawyers, primarily through its Continuing Legal Education seminars. New Lawyer Education is a library of free and low-cost accredited programs tailored to new lawyers. The Preadmission Education Program is a mandatory four-hour training course for new attorneys that must be taken prior to admission to the WSBA. Services to Legal Professionals The Washington Supreme Court adopted the Limited License Legal Technician (LLLT) Rule, effective Sept. 1, 2012. This rule authorizes non-attorneys who meet certain educational requirements to advise clients on specific areas of law, which have yet to be determined. The Limited License Legal Technician Board was created at the order of the Washington Supreme Court to administer the program. The LLLT Board began its work in January 2013. As one of its first actions, the Board recommended family law as the first practice area in which to license LLLTs, which the Supreme Court unanimously approved in March 2013. The work of the LLLT Board is expected to take at least one year before it will be able to accept applications and begin licensing of LLLTs. The first courses to be offered toward licensure are slated to begin through the University of Washington School of Law in January 2014. Sections WSBA hosts 27 Sections, which are voluntary associations of attorneys interested in a common topic, such as Animal Law, Corporate Law, Criminal Law, Family Law and Human Rights Law. These organizations provide educational and networking opportunities. New lawyers (admitted to practice for less than five years or under age 36) are the special province of the Washington Young Lawyers Committee (WYLC). The WYLC has three focus areas: Member Outreach & Leadership, Transition to Practice, and Pro Bono and Public Service. Services to the Public WSBA promotes justice through a variety of projects: *Access to Justice programs improves and expands access to the justice system for low- and moderate-income people. *The Moderate Means Program was established in 2012 to connect clients whose income is within 200‚Äì400% of the Federal Poverty Level to lawyers who offer legal assistance at a reduced fee. *The Washington First Responder Will Clinic aims to provide basic estate-planning documents ‚Äî wills, powers of attorney, and healthcare directives ‚Äî for Washington first responders and their spouses/state-registered domestic partners at no cost. *The ATJ Board Technology Committee promulgates the principle that technology must be implemented in a way that improves the quality of justice for all persons in Washington state, increases opportunities, and eliminates barriers to access and effective utilization of the justice system. *Law Week organizes lawyers and judges to visit classrooms in their communities during the first week of May. http://www.lawweek.org * The Lawyers' Fund for Client Protection was established for the purpose of relieving or mitigating a monetary loss sustained by any client due to the dishonesty of, or failure to account for money or property entrusted to, any member of the WSBA in connection with the member's practice of law or while acting as a fiduciary in a matter related to the member's practice of law. The Fund is funded by an annual assessment of members of the WSBA by order of the Washington Supreme Court and produces an annual report on its activities. *The WSBA Speakers Bureau is made up of attorneys around the state who are eager to address students, legal professionals, civic organizations, service groups, and other audiences on legal topics, generally at no charge. *WSBA maintains an online lawyer directory, including contact information and information about whether a lawyer has been disciplined. Washington State Bar Foundation The Washington State Bar Foundation is a 501(c)(3) public charity dedicated to fundraising on behalf of the WSBA. The Bar Foundation ensures WSBA has the resources to lead on issues of justice, public service, and diversity. It helps to support programs such as the Moderate Means Program. Print/Online Communications WSBA communicates and provides information in a number of ways: *NWLawyer is WSBA's print periodical, published nine times a year. It publishes official notices (including disciplinary notices), educational articles, news of interest to the legal profession, and more. *NWSidebar is WSBA's blog, intended for WSBA members and the greater legal community.

Each novel's story is told in the form of a limited series, the issues of which are later collected as a trade paperback. Writer Roy Thomas has adapted many of the titles; the imprint is also known for its six adaptations of books from the Land of Oz series, all done by Eric Shanower and Skottie Young; and its four adaptations of Jane Austen novels by writer Nancy Butler.  History  Marvel Illustrated was started in 2007, the first attempt by the company to adapt classic literature since the short-lived 1970s series Marvel Classics Comics. Their first title was a 64-page one-shot adaptation of Rudyard Kipling's The Jungle Book, by Mary Jo Duffy, Gil Kane, and P. Craig Russell, which collected material originally published in 1983 in Marvel Fanfare. Other titles launched in 2007 included The Last of the Mohicans, The Man in the Iron Mask, and Treasure Island, all of which were adapted by Roy Thomas. 2008 saw publications of The Iliad, Moby-Dick, The Picture of Dorian Gray, and The Three Musketeers, all adapted by Thomas. In 2009 Marvel Illustrated published Kidnapped and Thomas' telling of the Trojan War, as well as the first of Nancy Butler's adaptations of Jane Austen, Pride and Prejudice. That was the year they also released Shanower & Young's adaptation of The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, which has been followed by The Marvelous Land of Oz (2010), Ozma of Oz (2011), Dorothy and the Wizard in Oz (2011‚Äì2012), and The Road to Oz (2012‚Äì2013). In 2010, the imprint published Dracula, adapted by Thomas and Dick Giordano, which collected material originally published in the 1970s and mid-2000s. They also published Butler's adaptation of Sense and Sensibility, illustrated by Sonny Liew. In 2011, they published Butler and Janet K. Lee's adaptation of Emma; since then the imprint has only released Oz adaptations.

Oxford English Dictionary Second Edition on CD- ROM (v. 4.0) ¬© Oxford University Press 2009 an element of the task of logging. The person cutting the trees is a feller. A feller buncher is a machine capable of felling a single large tree or grouping and felling several small ones simultaneously. Methods =Hand felling= In hand felling, an axe, saw, or chainsaw is used to fell a tree, followed up by limbing and bucking in traditional applications. In the modern commercial logging industry, felling is typically followed by limbing and skidding. =Feller buncher= A feller- buncher is a motorized vehicle with an attachment which rapidly cuts and gathers several trees in the process of felling them. In cut-to-length logging a harvester performs the tasks of a feller-buncher, additionally doing the delimbing and bucking. When harvesting wood from a felled tree, the recommended methods should be followed in order to maximize wood recovery. The suggested trend is to make deeper cuts and smaller openness when performing undercuts.  Types of Cut  = Undercut = This is the guiding or aiming slot for the tree and is a V-shaped notch placed on the side of the tree in the direction of Its intended fall. There are two types of undercut: # Standard Undercut # Reverse Undercut = Back Cut = The back cut is made on the opposite side of the tree of the undercut and severs the ‚Äúhinge‚Äù holding the tree up. considerable stress may be released from the tree in making this cut .  Boom - Corridor Experiment  This was an experiment conducted regarding felling trees and the continuous felling of trees in boom-corridors which might lead to an increase in harvester productivity. An efficient way to do this would be to use felling heads which would increase efficiency and fall time.

Ball Hockey is the same sport as Floor Hockey. Ball hockey is patterned after and closely related to ice hockey, except the game is played on foot on a non-ice surface, player equipment is different, and an orange ball is used instead of a hockey puck. The objective of the game is to score more goals than the opposing team by shooting the ball into the opposing team's net. Gameplay Teams consist of five runners and one goaltender. The five runners are broken down into positions of three forwards and two defensemen, right and left. The forwards are further described by position name: Left Wing, Right Wing, and Center. These positions are the same as in ice hockey. Tournament Ball Hockey rules are numerous and too long to list in this article. A list of the official ball hockey tournament rules of the I.S.B.H.F. can be found online. For general information's sake, Ball Hockey rules typically stipulate the following basics, meaning if you are playing under these rules, then you are playing Ball Hockey: *Offside is determined by a \\"floating blue line\\". The concept can be difficult to understand for non-hockey enthusiasts, but the simplest explanation is as follows: When the ball crosses the defending team's blue line, the attacking team is onside. The attacking team then has the entire zone up to the center line with which to work the ball around and still be considered onside. Once the ball crosses the center red line the attacking zone is \\"lost\\", and the attacking team's players must clear (retreat past) the defending team's blue line and have the ball enter past the defending team's blue line to be considered onside again. *Icing is called \\"flooring\\"in ball hockey. *You can raise your stick above the shoulder to call for a pass. *You can close your hand around the ball provided that you bring the ball straight down to your feet and do not change the direction you are moving in. *International rink dimensions are the same as international ice hockey rinks 197 ft √ó 98.4 ft. *North American rink dimensions are the same as North American ice hockey rinks 200 ft √ó 85 ft. Equipment The ball used is a specially designed one for ball hockey and street hockey. The International Street and Ball Hockey Federation, the worldwide governing body of official street hockey tournaments and leagues, officially recognizes two types of ball for play: a hard (Pro) version for adult warm climate play and a soft version for non-summer play and younger youth age groups. At the highest levels of ball hockey, teams use a hard, orange, small, round, and smooth orange/reddish ball 3 inches in diameter. This allows for players to make the ball curve by over/under exaggerating a windup and follow through on their shots. Several ball manufacturers now market the balls with the temperature range the ball was designed for on the packaging itself. Although there is no certified industry standard for the balls since no street hockey standards organization exists, all hockey ball manufacturers sell their balls according to the following temperature range: red/orange = hot/warm above 60 degrees (15 C), pink = cool - between 40-60 degrees (4.5-15 C)yellow = cold - below 40 degrees (4.5 C). In most non-international tournaments, the following equipment requirements are instituted for the runners: *Helmets are optional for adults but mandatory for players 17 and under. *Some type of hand gloves must be worn, and they do not have to be hockey gloves but they can not have strings lose. Specific gloves for the sport of ball hockey have been developed and are manufactured and sold to ball hockey players. *Some type of shin guards must be worn, and they do not have to be hockey shin guards. Specific guards for the sport of ball hockey have been developed and are manufactured and sold to ball hockey players. *Teams must have matching jerseys with numbers. These can often be T-shirts with numbers on them. *Appropriate footwear for running. *Some type of official hockey stick NOTE: Specific helmets, shin guards, and gloves for the sport of ball hockey have been developed and are manufactured and sold to ball hockey players, but it is not mandatory for players to wear these for all tournaments. The following equipment requirements are instituted for goaltenders: *Goaltender's helmet with full face mask *Chest protector *Thigh pads *Goaltender leg pads *Goaltender Glove or trapper *Goaltender Blocker *Goaltender Stick *Shirt that fits OVER all chest equipment *Appropriate footwear The flooring used for ball hockey tournaments is typically a specific type of a game court, often referred to as a \\"sport court\\". Sport courts very simply are plastic modular tiles, typically 1 square foot, that snap together for quick installation and removal. Sport court, is the tiling of choice in Montreal at the famous arena Le Rinque. The tiles come in a variety of colors and are manufactured by several different companies. The tiles often come prefabricated with lines on them which make up the markings required for tournament play, such as center and blue lines, face-off circles, and goal creases. For official international tournaments, the I.S.B.H.F. rules apply, and players must wear protective equipment as stipulated in their rule book. Governing bodies =International= The official worldwide governing body of the sport is the International Street and Ball Hockey Federation (ISBHF), which operates out of the Czech Republic and Canada. The federation consists of 39 countries and recognizes hundreds of thousands of players playing in organized leagues throughout the world. =Canada= The Canadian Ball Hockey Association is the official governing body of ball hockey in Canada, however, numerous leagues operate independently of this organization in Canada. Official CBHA sanctioned leagues include: British Columbia ¬∑ BC Ball Hockey Association ¬∑ West Coast Minor Hockey Association Alberta ¬∑ Wild Rose Ball Hockey Association ¬∑ Alberta Minor Ball Hockey Association Saskatchewan ¬∑ Prairie Central Ball Hockey Association Manitoba ¬∑ Manitoba Ball Hockey Association Ontario ¬∑ Ontario Ball Hockey Federation Quebec ¬∑ Quebec Ball Hockey Association New Brunswick ¬∑ New Brunswick Ball Hockey Association Nova Scotia ¬∑ Nova Scotia Ball Hockey Association Newfoundland & Labrador ¬∑ Newfoundland & Labrador Ball Hockey Association =United States= The governing body for ball hockey is USA Ball Hockey https://usaballhockey.com =Europe and Asia= Several European and Asian countries have their own governing bodies where the sport has enough players to have a national following and presence. A listing can be found at the ISBHF website. History In North America, Natives were first observed playing a variant of the game in 1572. In the 1960s Canada became the first nation to play the sport in organized leagues, followed by the United States the next decade, then countries in Europe in the 1980s and 1990s.

He was the son of the Austrian paleontologist Othenio Abel. From 1931 Wolfgang Abel was engaged at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute of Anthropology, Human Heredity, and Eugenics. In 1933 he became a member of the NSDAP. He was involved in compulsory sterilization of children, who resulted from relationships between German women and dark- skinned French soldiers. In 1934 he wrote an article, which was published in the German newspaper \\"Neues Volk\\", with the title \\"Bastarde am Rhein\\" (Rhineland Bastards). In 1935 he joined the SS. In 1942 Abel was successor to Eugen Fischer for the professorship of racial biology at the University of Berlin. Wolfgang Abel delivered in 1938 a speech at the \\"Congres International des Sciences Anthropologiques et Ethnologiques, Deuxieme Session, Copenhague 1938\\". The topic was: Die Rasse der rum√§nischen Zigeuner. Meaning, On the Race of the Romanian Gypsies. In the same year Abel was in addition to his work at the KWI lecturer in anthropology, as well as Deputy Head of the Department of racial hygiene of the German High School for Politics. After joining the SS in 1935, he worked as an expert for the Race and Settlement Main Office (RuSHA) of the SS and as Chief Appraiser for the Imperial Family Office. At the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute, Wolfgang Abel rose in 1940 to the head of Department of Ethnography. In July 1941, he was appointed extraordinary Professor. Previously already Assistant of Eugenics to Eugen Fischer, he was from 1943 to 1945 his successor to the Chair of professorship in the University of Berlin. At the same time, he worked at this time for the high command of the German Army (OKH). In the framework of the General Plan East, Abel worked out a plan for a \\"progressive elimination\\" of the \\"Russian race' with which he wanted all \\"Russian Nordic types \\"Germanized\\" and the rest deported to Siberia, in May 1942. In addition to his teaching Wolfgang Abel assumed the management of the Institute Awards of the German High School for Politics in 1943. In 1945, Abel was dismissed from the University of Berlin. From 1945 to 1947 he was interned. He then lived as a portrait painter in Austria. After World War II, he lived in Austria until his death in 1997.

Joe franchise. He appeared in the Battle Action Force comic books and annuals of the 1980s and was cast as an action figure by toy- makers Palitoy and distributed around Europe. In West Germany, he was known as Baron Eisenblut. Character Baron Ironblood unmasked. Baron Ironblood is the leader of the Red Shadows, sworn enemies of Action Force. According to Battle Action Force his real name and birthplace are unknown (though a detailed comic book back-story, which featured in the 1985 Battle Action Force annual, places him of possible Swiss descent). It provisionally identifies him as 'Marcus Kassells', the son of a Swiss diplomat who was raised and educated in Britain, attending Eton college. After compulsory national service in the British Army's Parachute Regiment (marred by an unproven allegation of the murder of a fellow officer who fell from the escape hatch of a plane after an argument) Kassells studied nuclear physics at Trinity College Cambridge. However rather than pursuing a scientific career Kassells joined the US Army and led his own unit during the Korean War nicknamed 'The Baron's Brigade', specialising in behind-the-lines revenge operations. Accused of the massacre of six peasants Kassells subsequently disappeared. Afterwards rumours began to circulate of an ex-British Army officer using the pseudonym 'The Baron' fighting as a mercenary in various African and South American conflicts, eventually forming his own private army. Towards the end of the Vietnam War numerous rockets which fell on American positions bore the inscription 'Sanguineo Ferris', the ancient motto of the Kassells family, literally translated as 'Our blood is of iron'. He is described as a man of scholarly tastes with a passion for chess, wine and horticulture but prone to violent outbursts of anger. In addition, Ironblood's datafile (as it appeared in Battle Action Force) states that his \\"primary military speciality\\" is organisational military strategy and that his \\"secondary military speciality\\" is that he is a born leader. Ironblood was said to be... > Twisted criminal brain dreams of world dominance. Noted for hypnotic control > over men, his madness leads to wild fury in defeat, often taken out on his > own troops. He is also described as a: > Genius of Evil. Ironblood's sworn intent is to destroy all organised > government in Europe. Ironblood was said to be the culprit of several armed revolutions in Latin America and was previously a South American-based warlord. In addition, he uses hypnotic control to indoctrinate the Red Shadow soldiers. =Graphic representation= Both as an action figure and comic book character (first drawn by artist Jim Watson in a strip written by Gerry Day) Baron Ironblood appears dressed in all white suit (jacket and trousers) with a red 'V' design on the torso, together with a skull and crossbones decoration, the insignia of the Red Shadows. He also wears long black boots, reminiscent of German military uniforms of World War II. Various editions of the figure were produced with either black or white gloves. Ironblood wears a Ned Kelly-style iron helmet, with a small slot opening for vision. As an action figure this helmet is removable, revealing a Caucasian male with white hair and a dark goatee beard. This representation is also clear in his early appearances in the Battle Action Force comics and in the action figure. He also comes armed with an Uzi. =Transition to Cobra Commander= In 1985, Hasbro began moves to market G.I. Joe in the UK, under the Action Force name. This would affect the comic version of Battle Action Force, as the writers were to get rid of the Red Shadows and Baron Ironblood and replace them with Cobra and Cobra Commander. To preserve continuity within the comic, the decision was made to transform Baron Ironblood in to the Action Force version of Cobra Commander. The transition came as Baron Ironblood grew tired of his group's failures and decided to destroy the Red Shadows, by secretly informing Action Force of the group's bases. Going into hiding, Ironblood relocated to Southeast Asia, where he had plastic surgery on his face, constructed a new mask and costumed identity (that of Cobra Commander), and underwent extensive treatment to give him immunity towards all forms of snake venom (a process known as mithridatism). He then began the process of recruiting a new inner circle and organisation, known as Cobra. Unfortunately for Ironblood, his illicit fortune to finance this new army is stolen by former Red Shadow member, Red Jackal, who he is forced to rebuild as a cyborg (and rechristened as \\"Destro\\"). Furthermore, both surviving members of the Red Shadows and the retooled Action Force repeatedly foil his plans. In the final Battle Action Force storyline, after an attempt to locate the headquarters of the Action Force team fails and leads to a crushing defeat of his forces, Ironblood/Cobra Commander goes insane and collapses into a near catatonic state. Other media =Comics= Toys The original Baron Ironblood figure, released in 1983, featured white gloves and an Uzi while the second variant of the figure had black gloves. A third variant also had black gloves but had a Palitoy Star Wars Han Solo blaster. In March 2012, at the 'Roll Out Roll Call' convention, the Action Force fan-site 'Blood for the Baron' released a convention exclusive action figure of Baron Ironblood to commemorate the 30th anniversary of Action Force and the 9th anniversary of the website.

This form of campaigning allows organizations to reach out and establish relationships with an audience in a more individualized, intimate way. The foundational function of mobile campaigns is regularly referred to as mobile marketing. A campaign's goal can have varied consumer consumption objectives including flashing (showing an image), informing (informational text / product info) or engaging (response or click required). Mobile campaigns have developed from the periphery of advertising to being an integral part of an effective marketing strategy. Online advertising is the second largest advertising spend at $113 billion, next to television's $196.5 billion (2013 figures). Near the introduction of mobile campaigns, they were primarily created to boost the impact of primary campaigns. A good example of one of the first mobile campaigns is the viewer voting system employed in American Idol. Using the American Idol example, the primary campaign was television, and the engagement was mobile, ‚Äúwatch this show, and text to vote‚Äù. In 2012, there were over 131 million votes in a single night, setting the world mobile voting record. With over 90% of Americans having cell phones, and there being over 6.8 billion cell phones in circulation globally versus 2.4 billion with internet access, mobile campaigns are evolving to be the way of the future in advertising and consumer engagement. As advertisers enhance existing strategies to reach potential customers, technological advances create new ways for consumers and corporations to interact. New technologies are being developed to maximize the effectiveness of one's mobile device as a personal marketing platform including the facilitation of the GPS enabled smart-phone to provide location-based services and near by coupons. Elements of mobile campaigns can be distributed by advertisements in apps, text messages or emails and can include a combination of the following: * Text to Vote: ** This method of mobile user engagement involves there being a list of choices provided by a content provider for a consumer to vote on. This can be from a television show, movie theater, baseball game or other. * Text to Win: ** Provides mobile users the opportunity to text their information to a pre- set number as a ballot to be entered to win a prize. * Click to Call: ** An sms, email or app alert is sent to a mobile user, generally with a telephone number to make a one touch connection point possible. Advertisers find this a great way to inform customers about their products or to enter into a conversation about the list of products they offer. * Click to order brochures: ** Users have the option of receiving additional printed or promotional materials by providing their email address or postal code and additional information. * Click to receive mobile coupons: ** Mobile users have the opportunity to receive coupons from a content provider based on user specified data or directly related to an advertisement. (The app FourSquare has become a popular GPS based coupon delivery system). * Click to buy: ** Mobile users receive a link or direct access to purchasing a product or service which may include some form of mobile, credit card or paypayl type payment. * Click to download content: ** Mobile users download content from content provider. This may include mobile applications, ringtones, wallpaper, etc. This is very popular for an exchange of offering personal data, ‚Äúchecking in‚Äù or completing a survey or viewing advertising. * Click to enter branded mobile websites: Mobile users click a banner to get connected to a campaign- specific mobile website. ** Click to forward content: Mobile users are given the option to forward content or advertising to a contact, creating a viral campaign effect. * Click / text to donate: ** Not for profits received government permission in 2005 (Canada, US, Mexico, UK) to begin ‚ÄòText to Donate‚Äô programs where mobile users could text a message to a special number to make a donation that would then be applied to their phone bill.

NYSSMA is a professional organization that evaluates student musicians in New York state from elementary school to high school. Each spring, thousands of students register through their school music programs to attend NYSSMA Evaluation Festivals where they are adjudicated. These festivals take place at local middle and high schools, as well as state colleges and state universities within the fifteen NYSSMA zones, each of which covers an area in New York State. Usually, county high schools take turns to host the festival every few years. At each festival, students perform scales, a solo or ensemble piece of their choice from the designated NYSSMA repertoire, and a sight reading piece. The judges score and comment on the students' performances according to defined guidelines set by NYSSMA. The grade sheets are then certified and sent to the music departments at the individual schools to be distributed to the students. Instruments evaluated include voice, piano, strings, woodwinds/brasses, and percussion. NYSSMA scores and evaluators' comments are often used by music teachers as diagnostics and progress monitoring. They also determine selection into orchestra, band, or choral groups depending on their instrument. Students who play saxophones, brasses or percussion or sing can choose to be evaluated in NYSSMA Jazz Festival where they have an opportunity to be selected into various jazz ensembles. Performance groups include All-County, Area All-State (part of New York State), and Conference All-State (entire New York State). Judgment Criteria Participants in all categories prepare and perform a solo selected from the NYSSMA Manual, perform scales, and demonstrate sight reading from original music provided by NYSSMA at the audition. Each NYSSMA solo is preassigned a difficulty level from I (easiest) to VI (most difficult). Instrumental soloists also must play scales, the number of which are determined by difficulty level of the solo. Overall each participant is judged on seven categories, tone, intonation, technique, accuracy, interpretation, scales, and sight reading. Level I-IV solos are judged on a 28 point scale and level V-VI solos are judged on a 100 point scale. Participants may also elect to receive a \\"festival\\" rating in which written comments are given but no score. Vocalists (Levels I - IV) are judged on seven categories: Tone (Quality, Consistency, Projection) Intonation Technique (Breath Control, Flexibility, Posture, Appropriate Range) Diction (Vowels, Consonants, Naturalness) Accuracy (Accuracy of Notes, Accuracy of Rhythms, Steadiness of Rhythms, Pulse) Interpretation (Dynamics, Style, Tempo, Phrasing, Expression, Artistry, Stage Presence) Sight reading (Accuracy of Dynamics, Accuracy of Notes, Accuracy of Rhythm, Correct tempo) Woodwind/brass players are judged similarly, except \\"articulation\\" replaces \\"diction\\". String players are evaluated on their bowing techniques. Levels and Grading System There are a total of six levels, each with its own level of progressively more challenging repertoire. Levels I through IV are scored on a scale of 0 to 28, where each section is scored out of 4 points. Levels V and VI are scored from 0 to 100. Each of the judging categories are allotted a set points out of the total. For example, on Level V and VI String Solos, \\"Tone\\" is worth 20 points, \\"Intonation\\" 10, \\"Technique\\" 20, \\"Accuracy\\" 15, \\"Interpretation\\" 20, \\"Scales\\" 5, and \\"Sight reading\\" 10. NYSSMA provides sight reading passages of all six levels from a proprietary manual. Scale requirement depends on level as well. Levels I and II require knowledge of three scales, III and IV require seven, and V and VI require all major scales. In levels I-IV, the performer can choose the scales they have prepared on the evaluation sheet. During the performance and evaluation, the judge would choose three scales at random among the expected set for the performer to play. In contrast, NYSSMA requires a list of rudiments that the soloist must prepare for their evaluation depending on the level of the solo for snare drum. Also, the soloist must perform a \\"long roll\\" for snare drum. For Levels I and II, the soloist must perform a long roll without speeding up and slowing down. However, in levels III, IV, V, and VI, the soloist must speed up to an orchestral roll (multiple bounce stroke roll) and slow back down to where they started. Some students wish to forgo the numerical rating entirely in favor of a completely comment-based evaluation. Such students indicate this before the festival by checking the \\"Festival\\" box on the evaluation sheet. They need not perform all the required components of the evaluation if they wish, but the judge does not score the performance regardless. Therefore, for this option, the judge may only write comments.

The production totalled 41 units.  Development  Design work on a new demining vehicle began in 1986 and the first prototype was ready in 1990. The basic structure was borrowed from the SA-110 prototype but with extensive modification to suit the new vehicle's purpose. Technology and design assets of Pasi were utilised in the development of the armoured cabin. Sisu military vehicles typically have a nickname in addition to the official model name. The vehicle was nearly given the nickname Misu which means \\"kitty\\" or \\"pussycat\\". It was derived from Miina-Sisu (\\"Mine Sisu\\"), and it was already printed on some brochures. However, the engineering department quickly changed the name to Raisu, from Raivaus-Sisu (\\"Clearance Sisu\\"), as 'Misu' was considered infantile. Raisu also means \\"boisterous\\".  Production  Production of the RA-140 DS took place in H√§meenlinna and it was the last Sisu design to be developed there. Four vehicles were produced for Danish Defence in the years 1996‚Äì1997; the rest were assigned to different brigades of Finnish Defence Forces.  Operation and characteristics  The RA-140 DS is intended for clearing of minefields composed of surface-placed or conventionally buried non-directional mines set against infantry, and sparsely placed anti-tank mines up to 10 kg. It can clear a suitable passage for a vehicle convoy. Raisu is not meant for combat missions. The mine clearing tool includes 82 hammers which are fastened to a rotating flail by chains. In operation the vehicle is driven in reverse to ensure the best protection for the crew. The driver and passenger are protected against the pressure and mine fragments by a protection shield next to the flail. The vehicle makes a 3.4-metre wide path and the clearing depth can be controlled manually or automatically. The maximum speed in operation is 6 km/h and the Raisu can eliminate mines up to 10 kg of explosive. The clearing flail is turned longitudinally and mounted on the top of the vehicle for during transportation. The maximum gradient that the vehicle can navigate is 60% and the steepest side slope 30%. The highest vertical step the vehicle can climb is 0.5 metres and the trenching capability is 0.6 metres. The maximum fording depth is 0.8 metres. The Raisu's cross-country mobility is good and it can be quickly moved to a new site. This is a key benefit compared to conventional, heavier tank-based applications.  Technical data  The vehicle is powered by air-cooled six-cylinder Deutz BF 6L 913 C turbodiesel engine. The gearbox is a four-speed automatic Renk Doromat 874 AM/PTO. The front axle is portal type and sprung with coil springs. Both axles are driven and equipped with lockable differentials. The front axle has got disc brakes and the rear axle is with drum brakes. When in service, the vehicle is driven by hydraulic transmission which is also using the flail and lifting or lowering an armoured-steel-made deflector shield between the flail and vehicle. The flail rotating speed can be infinitely adjusted between 0‚Äì500 rpm. The armoured cabin contains seats for the driver and commander and is designed with NBC protection and to withstand a 10 kg explosion under the vehicle. The armour protects against 7.62 calibre bullets. A 2061 VHF radio is for communication. The wheels are mine and bullet resistant. There is an option to mount a 12.7-calibre machine gun. A self-recovery winch is fitted as standard.  Operational history  The four vehicles of Danish Defence were used in the former Yugoslavia. The vehicles faced severe problems in Bosnia and therefore the Danish army placed their further mine clearing vehicle orders for domestic made Hydrema 910 MCV. Finland has used Raisu's in UN missions.  References   External links  * A UN-painted Sisu RA-140 DS in action. * A UN- painted Sisu RA-140 DS in transportation.

The training included drill, first aid, military courtesies, organization of medical corps, defense against chemical warfare, principles of anatomy and physiology, physical exercises and character development.https://www.ministrymagazine.org/archive/1940/05/medical-cadet- corps-training The program was temporarily suspended at the end of World War II. It was reactivated in 1950 and in the next few years was adapted internationally. The program was deactivated by the General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists (General Conference) in the early 1972 but continued independently in a few locations with an emphasis on rescue and disaster response. In 2016, the Medical Cadet Corps, a component of the World Service Organization that is under the umbrella of the General Conference Department of Adventist Chaplaincy Ministries, was reactivated as a worldwide program. Background WWII. When the Seventh-day Adventist movement was formally organized in 1863 during the height of the American Civil War, military conscription was one of the first major challenges to be addressed by the fledgling denomination. Even before 1863, Adventist beliefs about combatancy generally fell into one of three opinion groups: pacifists who felt any military service was a violation of God's command to not commit murder; militant abolitionists who felt that military service would honor God's will in ending slavery; and non-combatants who believed it to be their Christian duty to support the government in roles which did not violate the fourth and sixth commandments (see Ten Commandments). This latter position ultimately emerged as the denomination's policy and set precedent for future periods of conscription in the United States. When conscription became law in March 1863, most drafted Adventists took advantage of the option to purchase an exemption which cost $300 per person. This sum was not easy for many to come by and church leaders encouraged all members to contribute toward purchasing these exemptions for drafted members. In February 1864 the conscription law was amended to allow conscientious objectors to serve the military in noncombatant roles. A short time later this provision was revised so that it would apply only to recognized conscientious objectors. Church leaders quickly moved to acquire this recognition from state governors in Michigan, Wisconsin, Illinois, Pennsylvania, and finally the Federal government.Roger G. Davis, \\"Conscientious Cooperators: The Seventh-day Adventists and Military Service, 1860-1945,\\" (Ph.D., George Washington University, 1970), 54; Robert L. Mole, God Also Loves Military People (General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists, 1977), 10-24; R. W. Schwarz, Light Bearers to the Remnant (Boise, ID: Pacific Press, 1979), 98-101; Francis McLellan Wilcox, Seventh-day Adventists in Time of War (Takoma Park, MD: Review and Herald Publishing Association, 1936), 55-65. Following the Civil War, the United States military returned to an all- volunteer force. The Indian Wars and Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War did not require large numbers of soldiers. Adventist denominational history is mostly silent in regard to these conflicts. When World War I erupted in Europe there was much more cause for concern. The Seventh-day Adventist Church looked at the issue in the Autumn Council of 1916 in the General Conference Committee for a way in keeping with the church's noncombatant beliefs, to allow the young men of the church to fulfill their obligations, and the medical military service was the direction they took. However, since 1863 the Adventist church had grown both inside and outside of the United States. Members in Europe were divided by political and battle lines, sometimes isolating them from the rest of the church. The war in Europe began so quickly it was difficult for the church to form a cohesive policy or to support drafted church members. In the United States, efforts to support drafted church members were more orderly and the government continued to make provisions for conscientious objectors. However, misunderstandings did arise between some Adventists draftees who took extreme positions and their company officers who often did not understand or respect the position of conscientious objectors. It is unknown how many Adventists were actually drafted during World War I. Charles Longacre, who was in charge of church military relations in the United States for most of World War I, claimed that 186 American Seventh-day Adventists were court-martialed during the war and 35 were imprisoned in disciplinary barracks at Fort Leavenworth at the end of the war. The denomination's initiative to support draftees and the war effort in general was multifaceted encouraging church members to support government conservation programs, calling for pre-induction medical training, providing camp pastors, and planning to set up Servicemen's Rest Homes in Europe. The short time between the United States' entry into the war and its end meant that some of these actions were not implemented and the effectiveness of others is undetermined.Mole, 25-33; Schwarz, 424-433; Wilcox. 81-159. The experience of American Adventists during World War I generated several lessons which shaped the church's response to the draft during World War II, the Korean War, and the Vietnam War. First, Adventists working in the Medical Corps (United States Army) experienced the fewest conflicts regarding the keeping of Sabbath and bearing of arms. Second, pre-induction military medical training enhanced the effectiveness of Adventists who did serve and reduced the problems they faced. Third, educating church members regarding their obligations to both God and society reduced the extremism which often led to courts-martial.Mole, 32. History =Origin= Following World War I a number of faculty members in Adventist colleges believed that pre-military training and guidance should continue to be given students of draft age. At Emmanuel Missionary College (now Andrews University) in 1927, Lewis S. Williams started a program, but when it was criticized as being \\"too militaristic\\" it was stopped. At Walla Walla College (now Walla Walla University) students directed a set of questions to the General Conference regarding whether it was better to enlist or be drafted, clarification regarding appropriate duties for Sabbath, whether it was ever okay to bear arms, and whether the moral nature of a conflict changed one's responsibility for military service. The students' questions were discussed by a General Conference committee of seven individuals charged with studying noncombatancy. However, this group could not reach a consensus, so the questions remained unanswered.Berg, Thomas Harold, \\"The Seventh-Day Adventist Medical Cadet Corps, 1934-1945: Reconciling War, Conscience, and Noncombatancy,\\" University of Nebraska, 1990, 20-22; Schwarz, 439-438. The College Medical Corps was founded by Everett N. Dick at Union College in 1934 as a way to train males for noncombatant medic military service. The Medical Cadet Corps was founded for students of the College of Medical Evangelists in 1936 by Cyril B. Courville. In 1937, Dick presented his program to other Adventist educators which led to other college adopting the program. In 1937 in Glendale, California, a new Pathfinder group was founded which also added military drills from the MCC. With other Adventist colleges following suit by installing similar programs, the Fall Council of the General Conference Executive Committee in 1939 gave it official sanction and centralization under the name of Medical Cadet Corps. In various places, a Women's Cadet Corps also existed. The GC appointed Dick as the denominational program director and recommended that all Adventist colleges start a MCC program. When the General Conference met for its Autumn Council in 1939 shortly after fighting broke out in Europe, church leaders finally sanctioned the Union College Medical Corps program but formally adopted Courville's Medical Cadet Corps name, although the program would always focus on preparing enlisted soldiers. About this time, Everett Dick and two other leaders met with officials of the U.S. Surgeon General's office to establish a unified curriculum for the MCC. Thus started a twenty-year relationship between Dick and officers of the Surgeon General's office. This relationship resulted in a curriculum continuously revised to meet evolving military standards and recognition for Adventist soldiers which routinely placed them in the Army's Medical Corps.Schwarz, 441; Dick, 20. World War II Nearly every Adventist college and secondary school in the United States participated in the MCC program. Each one chose its own uniform, but patches were used in common. Training manuals also differed from location to location. Everett Dick, on temporary leave from Union College, was placed in charge of the central region of the country. Chris P. Sorenson was in charge of the eastern third and Floyd G. Ashbaugh was in charge of the program west of the Rocky Mountains. Each man was expected to promote the program in his region and to conduct officer training camps which trained leaders for the corps established on Adventist academic campuses and, in some places, churches. When this system developed flaws, Dick was asked to direct the program nationwide which he did until he returned to full-time work at Union College in 1942. Women first received training at Atlantic Union College and many academies required training for both men and women. Summer camps were held in order to facilitate training for men who were not attending Adventist academies or colleges. With the cessation of World War II, many campuses stopped teaching the courses. Only Union College and Southwestern Junior College (now Southwestern Adventist University) continued their MCC programs without interruption.Dick, 22,24. =Cold War Era= With the end of World War II, the program ended. The Corps was reactivated in 1950 in response to the reestablishment of the draft continuing in parallel with the draft with its end in 1972 in the US. In other countries with mandatory military service or a draft, their similar program still operates. The MCC was officially reactivated in 1950 with an officer's training camp in a former Civilian Conservation Corps camp (now Mountain Park) near Beulah, Colorado. The MCC program took on a different feel during this decade. Uniforms were standardized and all officers were required to train at national camps so that every MCC unit across the nation operated under the same guidelines and instruction. Leadership was centralized under Everett Dick, who as MCC commander held the rank of colonel and beginning in 1954 was also associate secretary of the War Service Commission.Dick, 25; Mole, 300. thumb2nd Lieutenant James F. Osborne MCC Instructor Jan '51 - Jan '53 SDA Academy, Lodi CAcenter =Decline= After Everett Dick resigned in 1958, Clark Smith who had worked with Dick since the MCC's beginning at Union College in 1934, became the commander. Camp Doss continued to be held in the summers through at least 1970. However support for the MCC in the United States declined after Dick's retirement, perhaps more due to the U.S. Army's implementation of its own noncombatant training program at Fort Sam Houston. Most Adventist colleges and academies stopped offering MCC courses by 1960. Interest further declined as the war in Vietnam grew increasingly unpopular. When the draft in the United States ended in 1973, the General Conference closed the denomination-wide program. Similarly MCC programs in other countries which were strong while the countries were under military dictatorships declined when more democratic governments gained power. The MCC continued to operate locally in some areas but with an emphasis on disaster response and collaboration with Adventist Community Services rather than pre- induction military medical training.Berg, 113 center Uniform Patches - 1950s Camp Desmond T. Doss Corporal Doss receiving the Medal of Honor from President Harry Truman on October 12, 1945 In 1950 a 10-day summer camp training program was held at Grand Ledge, Michigan on the Michigan Conference camp meeting grounds. Named for Desmond T. Doss, the first conscientious objector to receive the Medal of Honor, this camp became an annual event until about 1970. Doss himself frequently attended, an attraction that helped bring more young men to the camp each year. From 1951 until 1958, Everett Dick commanded Camp Doss aided by a core group of MCC leaders who gathered at Grand Ledge each summer from across the nation. The camp also attracted international visitors interested in creating MCC programs in their home countries. Visitors and inquiries about the camp came from Brazil, Cuba, Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico, Mexico, and South Africa.Mole, 300; Dick, 25. The camp was active throughout the Korean and Vietnam wars before the property was sold in 1988. International Expansion With the reactivation of the MCC, its proven success for American Adventists, and promotion by American missionaries serving internationally, interest grew in establishing the MCC in many countries around the world. During World War II, MCC training was initiated independently in a few locations, but in 1951 the General Conference purposefully began promoting the MCC program throughout the world through the newly established International Commission for Medical Cadet Service. Everett Dick was invited to Canada in 1951 to assist with creating a training program for officers. In 1953, 1955, and 1957 he traveled to the Far East to establish and supervise corps. He also visited the Caribbean and Lebanon. In each country where the MCC was adopted, relationships were established with the local military and the curriculum adapted to the standards of that country. The MCC was most popular in countries ruled by military governments or under immediate threat of conflict. It was not popular in Europe and was established with reluctance in Japan. *Argentina: Training was held at River Plate Junior College (now Universidad Adventista del Plata) in Argentina during January and February 1944. Instructors included Ellis R. Maas, Dr. Carlos E. Westphal, Dr. Marcelo Hammerly, Oreste Biaggi, and Justo J. Vallejos.Ellis R.

The program was not successful until June 1953 when Domingo Peixoto, Department of Civil Rights and Duties for the Brazil Union, obtained government approval for the program. Peixoto went on to become the commanding colonel for the MCC in Brazil.A. M. TIllman, \\"Medical Cadets in the South American Division,\\" South American Bulletin 23 no. 2 (March 1, 1948): 4; H. E.

Later that year Everett Dick was invited to participate in Camp Almansask which met from July 24 to August 7 at the Manitoba-Saskatchewan Conference campmeeting grounds in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan. It was sponsored by the Manitoba-Saskatchewan and Alberta Conferences.Berg, 102 *Chile: The MCC program at Chile College was authorized by the federal government and cadets were inspected by the Chilean army's chief surgeon.Merardo Leon, \\"Tidings from Chile College,\\" South American Bulletin 29 no. 2 (March 1, 1954): 2‚Äì3. *Cuba: Red Cross classes and some MCC training may have been promoted in Cuba during World War II. The first MCC camp to be part of the denomination-wide program was held during Christmas break in 1951 at Antillian Junior College (now Antillean Adventist University) then located in Santa Clara. *Dominican Republic: First MCC camp in the Dominican Republic was held August 1951 at Santo Domingo under the direction Valentin Schoen, Lawrence A. Wheeler, Paul W. Kemper, and Chaplain E. A. Girado.Vernon E. Berry, \\"First Medical Cadet Camp in Santo Domingo,\\" Inter-American Division Messenger 28, no. 11 (December 1951): 4. *Indonesia: Although there was interest in the MCC in Indonesia, activity was limited when American missionaries expressed concern related to communism.Berg, 105 *Japan: Everett Dick visited MCC units in Japan in 1953, 1955, and 1957.Union College. \\"Union College Heritage Collections: Medical Cadet Corps.\\" Accessed August 5, 2015. *Mexico: Charles R. Taylor of Mexico City attended Camp Carlyle B. Haynes in 1950 and was commissioned second lieutenant.\\"Inter-America Issues First Cadet Officers Commissions,\\" Inter- American Division Messenger 28 no. 5 (May 1, 1951): 2. *Philippines: During World War II, American missionaries inquired about MCC training. In the 1950s enthusiasm was unprecedented. The Philippines boasted more participation than any other nation. C. M. Sorenson directed the Philippine MCC program in the 1950s. Dick visited in 1953.Dick, 27. When Dick sought memoirs and information about MCC history in 1983 in preparation for the MCC's 50th anniversary, he was surprised to learn the program was still active in the Philippines. *Taiwan: Everett Dick visited MCC units in Japan in 1953, 1955, and 1957. In 1953 American military officers also visited the Taiwanese MCC camp.Union College Heritage Collections *Singapore: Dr. James H. Nelson and James Wong led the MCC in Singapore after the government implemented national registration.W. J. Hackett, \\"War Service Commission in the Far East,\\" Far Eastern Division Outlook 40, no. 8 (August 1954): 2. *Vietnam: In 1953, after Indochina began compulsory conscription, William H.

Philosophy  The Adventist Medical Cadet Corps in Puerto Rico is administered by the Youth Department. Cadets may be male or female and at least 16 years of age. They are trained and equipped to serve God and the community in order to provide aid during natural disasters or accidents. It effectively organizes personnel and materials to provide spiritual and logistical aid. The program's motto is \\" Serve, Serve, Serve\\". The organization promotes spiritual growth for its members. In collaboration with the American Red Cross, medical training includes Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), advanced rescue, and preventive health and care among others. A regimen of physical training promotes mental and physical discipline in the cadets. =Emblems= centercenter References Bibliography * Berg, Thomas Harold. \\"The Seventh-Day Adventist Medical Cadet Corps, 1934-1945: Reconciling War, Conscience, and Noncombatancy.\\" University of Nebraska, 1990. * Berry, Vernon E. \\"First Medical Cadet Camp in Santo Domingo.\\" Inter-American Division Messenger 28, no. 11 (December 1951): 4. * Davis, Roger G. \\"Conscientious Cooperators: The Seventh-day Adventists and Military Service, 1860-1945.\\" Ph.D., George Washington University, 1970. * Dick, Everett N. \\"The Adventist Medical Cadet Corps as Seen by its Founder.\\" Adventist Heritage 1 no. 2 (July 1974): 18-27. * Dick, Everett N. \\"The Military Chaplaincy and Seventh-day Adventists: The Evolution of an Attitude,\\" Adventist Heritage 3 no. 1 (Summer 1976): 33-45 * Hicks, John D. \\"Everett Dick: Teacher, Scholar, Churchman.\\" In People of the plains and mountains: Essays in the history of the West dedicated to Everett Dick.

Having been told that his health was such that he was unlikely to live to adulthood, his surrogate parents later sent him to live with his Aunt Harriet in Eastbourne, where she educated him herself at home. As a young adult he spent much of his time travelling and studying in Europe, mainly in Germany, Austria and Italy. In 1905 he joined the editorial staff of the Globe, during which time he also worked on his six-volume history, The English People Overseas. In 1915 he was appointed editor of the Evening Standard, but presumed tuberculosis forced him to reduce his journalistic commitments the following year. The illness left him with a permanently deformed hip which also prevented the continuation of his history writing; instead he turned to writing on philosophy. A frequent contributor to The Edinburgh Review and The Nineteenth Century, he had a thirty-five-year association with The Glasgow Herald as a reviewer, special correspondent and (from 1944) a leader-writer.

The album contains singer Michael Sadler's most sensitive song, \\"(Goodbye) Once Upon a Time\\", which he said was written about his late father and which still brought up strong emotions when performed years after the album's release. Changes and band break-up The 1985 album was a marked departure for the band as Saga moved on from working with Rupert Hine, a successful producer famous in the 1980s who had produced the band's last two albums and helped to land the band commercial success during the early part of that decade. There was an overhaul of both the sounds and styles incorporated by the band during the development of the new album, leading Saga to produce a more pop-oriented sound than their previous progressive rock works. Tensions during the production because of these changes eventually led lead singer Michael Sadler to inform drummer Steve Negus and Jim Gilmour after the album was released that they were no longer welcome in the band, beginning a rift in the band that lasted until 1991. Speaking in interviews during 2002, the band members stated that they regarded this division at the time as only temporary and knew that the five members would be reunited eventually.

Historically, this area is best known as the site of the Battle of Otumba and as an important crossroads during the colonial period where incoming viceroys ceremoniously were handed power by their predecessors. Today, it is a rural municipality undergoing changes as urbanization arrives here from the Mexico City area. However, one element from the past that is still remembered is that of burros or donkeys. During the colonial period, Otumba was an important market for the animals, and they are still culturally important. Each year, the municipality sponsors a Feria de Burros or Donkey Fair, where the animals star in fashion shows, costume contests, and races. There is also a donkey sanctuary for unwanted animals. The name Otumba comes from Nahuatl and means \\"place of otomis.\\" The appendage \\"G√≥mez Far√≠as\\" was added in honor of Valent√≠n G√≥mez Far√≠as. The Aztec glyph for the area depicts an Otomi character with the sign meaning place. The municipality is represented by this glyph and by a Spanish coat of arms. History This area was most likely settled by the Otomi although it is said that these Otomi descended from the Chichimeca. A series of villages were established in this area in the Classic period between 200 and 900 AD with the first known ruler being Motolina. When the chiefdom of Xaltocan fell in 1200, many other Otomis came to take refuge here, founding the town. The area came under the rule of Azcapotzalco during the reign of Tezozomoc. Aztec rule was established here by Nezahualcoyotl from Texcoco, who made Otumba a regional capital, serving as a point of collection for tribute. As an Aztec city, it contained a sacred plaza with a temple and perhaps a lord's palace. Outside this plaza area was the residential area for the elite called the pipiltin, consisting of large houses occupied by extended families. There was probably also a central market. Outside of that was a second residential zone for the common population, called the macehualtin. The organization of the city reflected that of Texcoco but at a smaller scale. There is evidence that this city produced crafts such as ceramics on a large scale. Battle of Otumba The Battle of Otumba is part of the story of the Fall of Tenochtitlan, specifically La Noche Triste. The Spanish had to flee the Aztec capital and reach Tlaxcalan, where they would find allies. After being beleaguered on the causeway leading out of the city, Hern√°n Cort√©s fled towards Tlaxcala, and was intercepted by a group of warriors of the Tenocha, Tepaneca, Xochimilco and other peoples. However, despite the fact that they had already seen horses, seeing Spanish knights in full regalia proved to have shock value, as the warriors had never seen such in open battle. The fight lasted for four hours until Cort√©s attacked a warrior named Cihuac√≥atl Matlatzincatzin, the tallest and most adorned of the attackers. He and thirteen knights charged the army's leader and killed him. This charge broke the natives‚Äô ranks and they fled. This battle gives Otumba the denomination of \\"La Heroica Otumba.\\" Despite the poor condition and heavy losses of the Spanish army and the overwhelming number of Aztec warriors, the Spanish prevailed and were able to reach Tlaxcala to regroup.Gruzinski, Serge. The Aztecs: Rise and Fall of an Empire. New York: Harry N. Abrams, 1987. Some 20,000 Aztecs were killed. While the town lends its name to this battle, it really occurred in a place called Temalacatitl√°n. After the battle, people from Otumba and other surrounding areas sent ambassadors to Cortes to ask forgiveness for fighting against him with the Aztecs. The ambassador from Tenochtitlan, however, still expressed the city's opposition to him. Cortes had the natives from Otumba capture the ambassador from Tenochtitlan for him as proof of their loyalty. After the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire, Cortes passed through here a second time sometime later to visit mines in Pachuca. The Spanish divided Otumba into among a number of encomiendas, many of which belonged to Cortes himself. When Cortes went to Spain in 1528, the Otumba area was seized by Nu√±o de Guzm√°n who declared it a province of the crown, along with a number of other areas. When Cortes returned, he retook Otumba and installed his son Mart√≠n Cort√©s as tribute collector. For the rest of the colonial period, Otumba was an important stopping point on the royal roads that connected Mexico City with Puebla, Hidalgo and especially the port of Veracruz. It was also the place where incoming viceroys would meet their predecessors and receive the scepter of rule before entering Mexico City itself. Because of the road traffic, the town grew into an important commercial center for the rest of the colonial period. During the Mexican War of Independence, one important insurgent, Eugenio Monta√±o, was from Otumba. He, along with Jos√© Francisco Osorno, fought mostly in the Apan area until 1813, when the royalist forces battled his troops near Calpulalpan. Monta√±o lost and his body was found by the royalists at the Tepetates Hacienda. Looking for vengeance, the royalists cut off Monta√±o's head and cut the rest of the body into four pieces. The head was sent to his family and the body parts were hung in at the four corners of his house in Otumba. The parish priest tried to bury the body in at the church but the royalist dug it back up and rehung the pieces. A short time later, the body was permanently interred in the baptistery of the church. Here Guadalupe Victoria proclaimed his Montano Plan in 1827. Here also, Nicol√°s Bravo was proclaimed the president of Mexico in 1839. For much of its colonial history, Otumba had been a district seat of one type or another. Its current status of municipality was established in 1821. In 1861, it was officially declared a town. A rail line was constructed through here in the late 19th century and the municipal palace was constructed in 1890. A second rail line would be constructed in the mid 20th century. The train station would become the scene of some important incidents of the Mexican Revolution. In 1915, General Rodolfo Fierro, allied with Francisco Villa, seized the local telegraph station and sent orders in √Ålvaro Obreg√≥n's name to that General's troops to perform maneuvers that were beneficial to the Villa army. Another occurrence was an attack on a train called El Dorado, which was carrying Venustiano Carranza. The attack was carried out by forces loyal to Alvaro Obregon, but did not succeed in killing Carranza. √Ångel Mar√≠a Garibay K., who was a noted linguist, humanist and canon law expert, was the parish priest of Otumba from 1932 to 1941. While stationed here he wrote a number of important works. Today Today, the municipality of Otumba is in transition towards a more urban area. Crime rates have risen as well as the frustrations of the local populace. In 2006, police intervened to prevent the public lynching of a 15-year-old who was caught trying to steal a computer and chair from a distance education center in the community of San Marcos Ahuatepec. In 2008, Sergio Cid Arandas was kidnapped from his home in Ecatepec and found dead on the highway between Otumba and Ciudad Sahag√∫n. The body was decapitated and mutilated. One year later, about 200 farmers confronted police, destroying a police vehicle in protest over the detention of a person in Santiago Tolman. The incident occurred when two police were arresting a local teacher. The residents detained the police for three hours, suspecting that they were kidnapping the teacher, and threatened to lynch the officers. The people were dispersed by an anti-riot squad, but a number of protesters regrouped and blocked the Mexico City-Tulancingo highway, demanding the return of the suspected kidnappers, Later, two police vehicles were torched in protest of the police intervention. The municipality is also the home of the Topochico prison, containing more than 900 inmates. In 2009, more than twenty prisoners began a revolt in the maximum security area, claiming mistreatment. Two prison workers were taken hostage as the riot spread to other parts of the facilities. Control of the prison by authorities was achieved about eight hours later. The town Parish of the Pur√≠sima Concepci√≥n For several years, the government has worked on restoration and beautification projects with the aim of being included as one of the Pueblos con Encanto del Bicentenario (Bicentennial Towns with Charm). The program was initiated in 2008, with Otumba as one of the eighteen towns selected. The hope is also that the improvements and designation will attract tourists. Like most towns in Mexico, the center of Otumba is a main plaza surrounded the most important buildings of the community. The main plaza is decorated with leafy trees and a kiosk, which has a small caf√© inside, surrounded by the Parish of the Purisima Concepci√≥n with its cloister from the 16th century, the municipal palace and the Gonzalo Carrasco Museum. The Parish of the Pur√≠sima Concepci√≥n began as the Franciscan monastery, probably built in the 1530s. The parish was established in 1603 with important aspects of the parish church dating to the 18th century. It was one of the most important and visited constructions in the early colonial period. The church is constructed over a pre-Hispanic platform. On its saints day, the town of Otumba lays out a carpet of flower petals on the atrium of the church along with decorative floral portals, dances, barbacoa and mole. A stone monument from the colonial era called La Picota is situated in the atrium of the parish church. It was broken after the Mexican War of Independence, reducing its height from four meters to two. Beside this monument is where new viceroys received their power symbolically from the outgoing viceroy. The vandalism of the column is thought to be a popular repudiation of the colonial system. The portal is in Plateresque and has an arch framed by thin columns on which wind sculpted vines and flowers. The door is surrounded by an alfiz, a design that is repeated in the choir area. The interior is covered by a barrel vault, which probably dates from the 18th century. The facade of the cloister contains an open chapel with the interior of simple design and murals. The municipal palace is a sober Neo- colonial construction. The facade has two levels of arches with windows and ironwork balconies on the other sides. These details and the balustrade make the building appear older, but it was constructed in the 20th century. It was built this way to respect the colonial look of its predecessor. Recreation of general store in the Carrasco Museum The Gonzalo Carrasco Museum and Cultural Center is located in the house in which the painter was born, which is on one side of the main plaza on Plaza de la Constitucion 17. It has been designated as an architectural monument. The house traditionally was called the Portal El F√©nix, home of the Carrasco family, who were merchants. Gonzalo Carrasco was a Jesuit, theologian and painter who was active in the late 19th century and early 20th. He studied at the Academy of San Carlos and with Jos√© Mar√≠a Velasco and his work adorns a number of buildings in Mexico and other countries. Portal El F√©nix is a two-story structure with a central courtyard. The lower floor was dedicated to businesses such as a general store, hairdressers and wine shop, with the family's residence upstairs. A number of rooms have been restored to what they were like in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. However, the most representative part of the building was called the Tienda Grande (Large Store), a term which came to be used to refer to the entire structure. It was located in the front under the balconies. Here were sold basic necessities such as bread, fabric, wax, grains and more. This house burned in 1876, but was rebuilt. Local residents initiated the restoration of the building in the latter 20th century, which was opened in 1981 as the Casa de Cultura y Museo Gonzalo Carrasco. It contains eleven halls. Five halls are dedicated to pre-Hispanic pieces from the Aztec, Teotihuacan and Otomi cultures. There are also photographs of codices, of civil and religious constructions, of the construction of the Otumba rail line, and haciendas and of the pulque they made. A number of rooms such as the dining room, bedrooms, kitchen and living room which are left as the family lived in them, with some of the original furniture. One room is dedicated to Carrasco's work. Railroad Museum Outside of the main plaza area, but just as important, is the railroad station. Its establishment made Otumba a key communication interchange as well as important point of transfer for the shipment of pulque to Mexico City. The first rail concession through the Otumba area was granted in 1837, although it was cancelled later. In small sections a rail line was built through here and put into service in 1873, transporting passengers and cargo to and from Mexico City to points east and south. The current station was built in 1906 as part of the Mexico City- Veracruz line of the old Ferrocarril Mexicano. The station was abandoned shortly after 1995, when the railroad system was privatized. Today, the station serves as a museum for the municipality, the Museo del Ferrocarril en Otumba. It contains exhibits such as a copy of the first train ticket issued in Mexico along with the reconditioned telegraph office and an archive of photographs from the late 19th and early 20th century. In the municipal market one can find tlacoyos, quesadillas made with squash flowers, mushrooms, barbacoa, mixiote, mole and pulque. In season, a number of other unusual dishes are served such as maguey larvae, chinicuiles, escamoles and snails. Feria del Burro and the Burroland donkey shelter Otumba was a major center for the sale and trading of donkeys during the colonial period because it was at the crossroads of the highways into Mexico City, where many donkeys passed by carrying merchandise and riders. Donkeys were used well into the 20th century due to the poor conditions of many roads in Mexico and the inability of trucks to enter farms and haciendas producing pulque, milk and cactus fruit. Even though the municipality is transitioning to a suburb of Mexico City, the donkey is still considered a valuable part of the culture and in some places is still used for work. The Feria del Burro (Donkey Fair) was first held in 1965, and is the oldest annual fair in existence in the State of Mexico. The fair was begun as an adjunct to the celebration of the Se√±or de Animas, which has since been forgotten. The principal attraction, the donkeys, are presented in a number of ways. There is polo played on donkeys, costume contests where the animals are dressed as famous people, a donkey race around the main plaza, and a large parade with floats. In addition, there are traditional festival attractions such as sports events, local food, fireworks, and folk dance. There a crafts expo with more than 85 producers with 17 different types of crafts, with a Crafts Contest. Money earned from the event has gone to improving the appearance of the town, such as a burying electric and telephone cables. The annual event has drawn as many as 50,000 visitors. Burrolandia, or the Donkey Sanctuary of Mexico, is an animal shelter that specializes in donkeys and contains about twenty animals. Burrolandia was begun by the Flores family on land next to the family's home in 2006. It is not scenic, as donkeys wander around rusting 1940s era cars. Visitors are given donkey ears and tails to wear as they visit a small museum, along with papier-m√¢ch√© burros. There are puppet shows and burro rides. Burroland is sustained by donations from visitors, local companies and international groups like Donkey Sanctuary in Britain. Despite the animals‚Äô historical importance in Mexico, pick up trucks and tractors are preferred by farmers even in the poorest areas. While the animals may still have their place culturally, the lack of work has made them more of a burden than an asset. The donkey population plummeted from one million in 1991 to about 581,000 in 2007 as many were killed by their owners or sold to slaughterhouses. Another reason farmers get rid of the animals is that they are associated with backwardness, and now the animals are not even worth 500 pesos anymore. This has spawned the Otumba effort to create the sanctuary as well as other projects such as free veterinary care for those animals still on farms. The municipality Municipal palace As municipal seat, the town of Otumba is the local governing authority for over eighty other communities, covering a territory of 143.42 km2. The population of the municipality is 29,873 with less than a third living in the town proper. The municipality borders the municipalities of Axapusco, Tepetlaoxtoc, San Mart√≠n de las Pir√°mides and the states of Tlaxcala and Hidalgo to the southeast and east. Geographically about fifteen percent of the territory is rugged terrain, forty percent is rolling hills and forty five percent is flat. Elevation varies between 2300 and 2900 meters above sea level and includes the Las Bateas, San Pedro, La Charra, Pel√≥n and La Cruz mountains. There are no rivers here but intermittent streams which flow during the rainy season such as El Soldado, Las Bateas, Huixcoloco, Mihuaca and San Vicente. The climate is temperate to moderately cold with a dry climate with maguey and nopal cactus growing wild and less than eight percent of the land forested. High temperatures can reach 31C in the summer and -2.3C in the winter. Wild vegetation and wildlife is mostly restricted to the highest elevations and include pines, willows, mimosas, jacarandas, squirrels, armadillos, opossums, coyotes and various reptiles and insects. About 59% of the municipality's land is used for agriculture, which depends on both seasonal rains and irrigation. Major crops are cactus fruit and nopal Livestock raised here includes domestic fowl, horses, sheep, goats, pigs and cattle. Industry consists on only small scale operations that produce locally needed products such as processed foods, textiles, furniture and bricks. Likewise, most commerce is of a local nature. Crafts are practiced on a minor scale working with fine woods, obsidian and onyx. Church and ex monastery of Oxtotipac The municipality contains a number of tourist attractions but these not fully are not taken advantage of. One of these is the ex monastery of Oxtotipac, which was established by the Franciscans over what was a teocalli, or Aztec sacred precinct. The complex is in Plateresque style and consecrated to San Nicolas de Bari. The facade looks a bit like a reliquary with its two rose windows, with a porter√≠a, or main entryway, consists of five arches with finely carved columns. This facade dates from 1675, and breaks with the usual austerity of Franciscan monasteries decorated with vegetable motifs. The interior columns are delicately worked in stone and contain interlinked Renaissance and Romance style ornamentation as well as Otomi elements. The monastery contains two baptismal fonts, one of which is from the 16th century. It recently underwent a four-year restoration projects costing approximately 700,000 pesos.Work on this monastery was sponsored by a civil association called Adopte una Obra de Arte (Adopt a Work of Art) along with the State of Mexico. One of the major causes of damage to the monastery was the theft of its religious art, so security measures were installed. Indoor and outdoor walls were repaired and three altarpieces were cleaned and restored, along with a number of other sculptures and paintings. The cloister area holds a collection of art works original to the monastery. In some of the smaller communities of the municipality, such as Huayapan, San Antonio, San Miguel and Soapayuca, about 80% of the constructions are non-modern, many of which have had their facades renovated. A number of old haciendas in the municipality have been renovated and adapted to new uses. Haciendas in this area turned to pulque production after the cattle had overgrazed the pastures. The San Antonio Xala Haciendas was a pulque hacienda from the 19th century which now is a hotel and restaurant. The elegant rooms and main chapel are open for visits. The San Antonio Xala Hacienda has been reconditioned as a rustic vacation center with cabins, horse facilities, a pool, event hall and a car from one of the first trains to go through the region. It also has a restaurant that specialized in local cuisine including breads and cheeses made on the premises. The Soapayuca Hacienda today houses offices of the Adidas Corporation. The courtyard contains a majestic fountain and its chapel with an image of Christ in the entrance is unique. The former Santa Mar√≠a de Guadalupe Tepa Hacienda has a ceremonial mound with 40 meters in diameter and other constructions that date from the Teotihuacan period. In the mid 2000s, the state government granted permission to the municipality to use the land to build ball fields and a municipal cemetery, but this work was halted by INAH in order to preserve the pre-Hispanic ruins. The San Antonio Ometuxco Hacienda is located about fifteen km outside the town of Otumba. The main house, according to some of the oldest residents here, shined in the sun which reflected off of its fine ceramic tiles. Today, Roman style statues, remains of Talavera tile and leafy trees still remain. The hacienda belonged to Ignacio Torres Adalid, who was the director of taxation during the regime of Porfirio D√≠az. After that, it belonged to a foreigner, and after that it belonged to a group of ten farmers, who decided to sell it in 1910.

Citizenship may also be granted by naturalization. Naturalization requires a residency period, an examination in the Lithuanian language, examination results demonstrating familiarity with the Lithuanian Constitution, a demonstrated means of support, and an oath of loyalty. A right of return clause was included in the 1991 constitution for persons who left Lithuania after its occupation by the Soviet Union in 1940 and their descendants. Lithuanian citizens are also citizens of the European Union and thus enjoy rights of free movement and have the right to vote in elections for the European Parliament. Post-Soviet implementation In 1989, the legislature passed a nationality act granting automatic citizenship to those persons who could establish their own birth, or that of a parent or grandparent, within Lithuanian borders. Permanent residents not covered by these criteria were granted citizenship upon signing a loyalty oath. Language proficiency was not required. A 1991 treaty with Russia extended the definition of residency to those who had immigrated to Lithuania from Russia between 1989 and the ratification of the treaty. Subsequent applicants for citizenship were required to meet a set of naturalization standards, including Lithuanian language testing. The citizenship requirements were the most liberal of those in the newly independent Baltic states. This is usually attributed to a relatively low level of immigration from other areas within the Soviet Union, resulting in a more ethnically homogenous population. Dual citizenship Lithuanian passport In November 2006, the Constitutional Court of the Republic of Lithuania ruled that the Law on Citizenship (wording of 17 September 2002 with subsequent amendments and supplements) was \\"controversial, inconsistent and confusing\\".Lithuanian Constitutional Court ruling on the Law of Citizenship At issue was the possession of dual citizenship; the provision extended the right of citizenship, and hence the right to vote, to members of the post-Soviet Lithuanian diaspora, which was concentrated in the United States, Canada, Australia, and Argentina, and their children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren. The most notable member of this diaspora was Lithuanian President Valdas Adamkus, who had become a United States citizen; he formally renounced US citizenship before taking the oath of office. The petitioners held that basing citizenship on ethnic origin or nationality of the person violated the equality of persons and was discriminatory. The use and meaning of the term \\"repatriated\\" was especially controversial. The Lithuanian Seimas (parliament) passed a temporary law, expiring in 2010, that granted dual citizenship in exceptional cases, most notably to those who were Lithuanian citizens prior to 1940 and who fled during the Soviet occupations, as well as to their children and grandchildren. The Constitution states that Lithuanian citizenship is acquired by birth except in certain cases established by law and that no person may be a citizen of Lithuania and another country or state at the same time, except in special cases. This provision of the Constitution can only be changed by a referendum. Currently, the law on citizenship allows dual citizenship only in exceptional cases for those whose ancestors left Lithuania before its independence from the Soviet Union 1990, but still had Lithuanian citizenship in 1940. There are some things to consider before someone could be able to pass the Lithuanian citizenship eligibility, and by having these, gives the person the right to claim it's Lithuanian citizenship. Persons, who were citizens of independent Lithuania (between 1918 up to 1940) as well as their children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren can restore Lithuanian citizenship. Persons of Lithuanian descent can restore dual Lithuanian citizenship if their ancestor still had Lithuanian citizenship in 1940. Dual citizenship can also be extended to descendants of Lithuanian citizens who were exiled to Siberia and stayed in Soviet Union countries. \\\\---- During November 2010 the Seimas passed a law liberalizing dual citizenship requirements. President Dalia Grybauskaitƒó vetoed it, stating that: \\"According to the Constitution, dual citizenship is a rare exception, not a common case.\\" On June 23, 2016, the Seimas passed a law further liberalizing dual citizenship requirements. It went into effect on July 6, 2016, amending the Law on Citizenship of the Republic of Lithuania (Law XI-1196 Dec 2, 2010). Article 7 of the Law on Citizenship as amended on 23 June 2016 lists the following criteria for dual citizenship: # They have acquired citizenship of the Republic of Lithuania and citizenship of another state at birth. # They are a person who left Lithuania before 11 March 1990. This is defined as: #* at least one of their ancestors (parents, grandparents or great grandparents) was a citizen of the Republic of Lithuania (between 1918 1940); #* the ancestor left Lithuania (the law changed the former 'fled' requirement) some time before Lithuania restored its independence on March 11, 1990; #* the ancestor did not depart to the former Soviet Union after June 15, 1940. # They are a person who was exiled from the occupied Republic of Lithuania before 11 March 1990. #* They are a person, or their descendants, who until June 15, 1940 had Lithuanian citizenship and was forcibly deported from Lithuania before March 11, 1990, because of political, social, or ethnic persecution by Soviet and Nazi occupation regimes. # They have by virtue of marriage to a citizen of another state ipso facto acquired citizenship of another state. # They are adopted by citizen of the Republic of Lithuania before reaching 18 years of age. # They have acquired citizenship of the Republic of Lithuania by way of exception while being a citizen of another state. # They are a person who has retained citizenship of the Republic of Lithuania or who has citizenship of the Republic of Lithuania restored for his outstanding merits to the State of Lithuania. # They have acquired citizenship of the Republic of Lithuania while having refugee status in the Republic of Lithuania. Some countries (such as Argentina, Uruguay and Mexico) do not allow renouncing their citizenship, so applicants might de facto keep dual citizenship even if they are eligible only for single Lithuanian citizenship. In certain cases, only restoration of Lithuanian citizenship as single Lithuanian citizenship is allowed. For example, persons that voluntarily left to former USSR countries prior to 1990 (i.e. were not deported) and have Lithuanian ancestors can restore Lithuanian citizenship but have to renounce their current citizenship. This does not apply to the people that fled or emigrated from Soviet Union before 1990, these persons can restore dual citizenship, since it is considered that they fled occupation. In 2018, at the request of Lithuanian parliament, the constitutional court clarified that being a citizen of both Lithuania and another state at the same time is not acceptable. Those who left Lithuania after it regained independence in 1990 cannot hold dual citizenship therefore it could be changed only by referendum. The referendum to change the Constitution in order to allow Lithuanian citizens also to be citizens of other countries was held on May 12th, 2019. Even though most of the voters were in favor of changing the Constitution - the referendum on Lithuanian dual citizenship failed because the turnout was too low. Citizenship of the European Union Because Lithuania forms part of the European Union, Lithuanian citizens are also citizens of the European Union under European Union law and thus enjoy rights of free movement and have the right to vote in elections for the European Parliament. When in a non-EU country where there is no Lithuanian embassy, Lithuanian citizens have the right to get consular protection from the embassy of any other EU country present in that country.Article 20(2)(c) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.Rights abroad: Right to consular protection: a right to protection by the diplomatic or consular authorities of other Member States when in a non-EU Member State, if there are no diplomatic or consular authorities from the citizen's own state (Article 23): this is due to the fact that not all member states maintain embassies in every country in the world (14 countries have only one embassy from an EU state). Antigua and Barbuda (UK), Barbados (UK), Belize (UK), Central African Republic (France), Comoros (France), Gambia (UK), Guyana (UK), Liberia (Germany), Saint Vincent and the Grenadines (UK), San Marino (Italy), S√£o Tom√© and Pr√≠ncipe (Portugal), Solomon Islands (UK), Timor-Leste (Portugal), Vanuatu (France) Lithuanian citizens can live and work in any country within the EU as a result of the right of free movement and residence granted in Article 21 of the EU Treaty. Travel freedom of Lithuanian citizens Visa requirements for Lithuanian citizens Visa requirements for Lithuanian citizens are administrative entry restrictions by the authorities of other states placed on citizens of Lithuania. In 2015, Lithuanian citizens had visa-free or visa-on-arrival access to 159 countries and territories, ranking the Lithuanian passport 10th in the world according to the Visa Restrictions Index. In 2017, the Lithuanian nationality is ranked twenty-second in the Nationality Index (QNI). This index differs from the Visa Restrictions Index, which focuses on external factors including travel freedom. The QNI considers, in addition to travel freedom, on internal factors such as peace & stability, economic strength, and human development as well.

A bird control spike, also known as an anti-roosting spike or roost modification, is a device consisting of long, needle-like rods used for bird control. Bird control spikes can be attached to building ledges, street lighting, and commercial signage to prevent wild or feral birds from perching or roosting. Birds can produce large quantities of unsightly and unhygienic feces, and some birds have very loud calls that can be inconvenient for nearby residents, especially at night. As a result, bird control spikes are used to deter these birds without causing them harm or killing them. Styles and usage Bird control spikes on a roof in Denmark Bird control deterrent spikes are normally around long, and work by reducing the area available for birds to land on. This forces larger varieties of birds, such as seagulls, pigeons, and crows, to land elsewhere. Birds that attempt to alight on spike-protected surfaces receive a light prick from one or more of the spikes, which is uncomfortable but generally not harmful. As a result, the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB) recommends bird control spikes for deterring pigeons from gardens. While deterring perching, bird spikes may not shift birds able to build large nests, and in fact can help them by providing a support to build the nest on. While spikes can be inspected and nests removed, in many countries there are restrictions preventing or restricting the removal of bird nests. Described as \\"the most effective (type of) stand-alone bird deterrent\\", bird control spikes can be placed along ledges, walls, on top of commercial signage, closed circuit television cameras and in rain gutters, in order to prevent birds from perching on the surfaces. Bird control spikes are most common in city centres and coastal areas, where feral birds are more common and more likely to come into conflict with humans. In addition, killing or harming birds without a valid reason is illegal in some areas; for example the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 in the United Kingdom forbids killing wild birds that are not causing serious damage to property or posing a serious risk to human health, which puts pressure on authorities and landowners to find non-lethal bird control methods. Stainless Steel Anti Bird Spikes As well as being used to control wild birds, bird control spikes and similar deterrent measures see use in preventing larger climbing animals such as squirrels, raccoons, opossums and snakes from crossing an area. Rings of sturdy metal spikes or plates with a sawtooth-shaped edge are often mounted horizontally or vertically around exposed or suspended water, sewerage, electrical, and communications infrastructure in areas where such species are highly active. The intention is to prevent possible damage and increased maintenance costs of such essential infrastructure by safely discouraging these animals from using it as a system of transit. herring gull. Some bird control deterrent spikes are electrified, using the same principle as an electric fence to increase effectiveness, and the distress call of the shocked bird can frighten others in the area. However, such devices cause unnecessary harm to birds or other wildlife, and are therefore illegal in some areas, such as the United Kingdom. Sharp-tipped bird control spikes are illegal in much of the rest of the world, and are unsuitable for areas which are regularly accessible for humans. As a result, some companies manufacture special blunted spikes for use where sharp spikes are dangerous or illegal. However, the blunt spikes are less effective at deterring birds, and cannot block climbing animals. The same \\"passive deterrent\\" concept is also frequently employed to discourage human intrusion into secured or dangerous areas. In this application, spikes are employed in a similar manner to barbed wire or razor wire, providing a clearly visible and obvious deterrent to climbing or attempts to traverse a particular area. A common example is where pipes, conduits, structural beams and other such infrastructure must penetrate a fence or similar barrier and may provide a means to circumvent the barrier. A collar of large spikes approximately long is fixed around part or all of the circumference of the penetrating element. Such measures are often employed near bridges, dams, cliffs and other such fall risks as an aid to public safety. Alternatives A bird deterrent attached to a light pole on the Houghton Highway viaduct, Australia. The spikes can become clogged by leaves, debris and bird feathers. If left unchecked, this can allow birds to perch easily on top. In addition, spikes can make buildings appear less attractive or untidy, especially landmark buildings. In these cases, other methods of control must be used. The only reliable bird control methods are barriers that do not allow the birds to be in an area or on a surface. Netting and mesh exclude or totally block birds from unwanted areas. Low current electric barrier will protect any surface or ledge from unwanted birds nesting, roosting, or loafing. Because spikes attract small birds or pigeons nesting right into the spikes by adding nesting debris, twigs, and grass it is advisable to start with netting and low current barriers because these methods always work.

The single was helped with a music video which appeared on MTV during the station's inaugural year on the air. Videos were also made for the singles \\"Wind Him Up\\" and \\"Amnesia\\". The success of the album was also largely credited to an expanded tour roster which saw the band enter new territories and venues, particularly in the United States, to expand their musical presence. Worlds Apart has been certified Platinum in Canada (100,000) and Gold in Germany (250,000), Denmark (50,000), the United States (500,000), and Norway (15,000). The album was released on Maze Records in Canada, Portrait CBS Records in America and England, and Polydor Records for the remainder of the global market. \\"Wind Him Up\\" is another one of Saga's most popular songs, which deals with a fellow named Aldo being addicted to gambling.. The Chapters Two of the songs, \\"No Regrets (Chapter V)\\" and \\"No Stranger (Chapter VIII)\\", were part of a series of eight (but later sixteen) songs that Saga included within their first four albums called \\"The Chapters\\", which told the story of a young Albert Einstein.

It is the location of the Wookey Hole show caves. Location Wookey Hole is located in the civil parish of St Cuthbert Out, in Mendip District. It is one mile north-west of the city of Wells, and lies on the border of the Mendip Hills Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB). Toponymy One possible origin for the name Wookey is from the Old English wocig (an animal trap), although it is also a possible alteration from a Celtic word ogo (cave), referring to Wookey Hole Caves. Features Glencot House The village of Wookey Hole is dominated by the Wookey Hole Caves tourist site which has show caves and a controversial crazy golf course which was built on the site of the village bowling green. The village has shops, a pub, restaurants, hotels and a campsite. The Grade II listed Church of St Mary Magdalene dates to 1873-74.https://historicengland.org.uk/listing/the-list/list-entry/1390977 The former paper mill building, whose water wheel is powered by a small canal from the river, dates from around 1860 and is a Grade II-listed building. The production of handmade paper ceased in February 2008 after the owner Gerry Cottle concluded there was no longer a market for the product, and therefore sold most of the historic machinery. Glencot House is a Grade II listed country house dating from 1887, by Ernest George and Harold Peto, for W. S. Hodgkinson. A report of the building appeared in The Building News, 13 May 1887; the architect's drawing was exhibited at the Royal Academy, and is now at RIBA.

This connection state is usually facilitated through the simultaneous use of a Local Area Network (LAN) Network Interface Card (NIC), radio NIC, Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) NIC, and VPN client software application without the benefit of access control. For example, suppose a user utilizes a remote access VPN software client connecting to a corporate network using a hotel wireless network. The user with split tunneling enabled is able to connect to file servers, database servers, mail servers and other servers on the corporate network through the VPN connection. When the user connects to Internet resources (Web sites, FTP sites, etc.), the connection request goes directly out the gateway provided by the hotel network. Split tunneling is sometimes categorized based on how it is configured. A split tunnel configured to only tunnel traffic destined to a specific set of destinations is called a split-include tunnel. When configured to accept all traffic except traffic destined to a specific set of destinations, it is called a split-exclude tunnel.  Advantages  One advantage of using split tunneling is that it alleviates bottlenecks and conserves bandwidth as Internet traffic does not have to pass through the VPN server. Another advantage is in the case where a user works at a supplier or partner site and needs access to network resources on both networks throughout the day. Split tunneling prevents the user from having to continually connect and disconnect.  Disadvantages  A disadvantage is that when split tunneling is enabled, users bypass gateway level security that might be in place within the company infrastructure. For example, if web or content filtering is in place, this is something usually controlled at a gateway level, not the client PC. ISPs that implement DNS hijacking break name resolution of private addresses with a split tunnel.  Variants and related technology  = Inverse split tunneling = A variant of this split tunneling is called \\"inverse\\" split tunneling. By default all datagrams enter the tunnel except those destination IPs explicitly allowed by VPN gateway. The criteria for allowing datagrams to exit the local network interface (outside the tunnel) may vary from vendor to vendor (i.e.: port, service, etc.) This keeps control of network gateways to a centralized policy device such as the VPN terminator. This can be augmented by endpoint policy enforcement technologies such as an interface firewall on the endpoint device's network interface driver, group policy object or anti-malware agent. This is related in many ways to network access control (NAC). = IPv6 dual- stack networking = Internal IPv6 content can be hosted and presented to sites via a unique local address range at the VPN level, while external IPv4 & IPv6 content can be accessed via site routers.

It was founded by Washington, D.C artist and arts activist George Koch, and has been held since 1999 up to the present at intervals from one to three years, depending upon the availability of a site. The non-juried, open event provides a forum for artists of all types (visual, performance, and literary) and abilities (from novice to professional). There are also arts education and professional development workshops and discussions. Structure A steering committee comprising local artists, arts administrators, and community activists develops outreach procedures and participation guidelines to ensure the broadest possible artistic representation from the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area. Each participant pays a fee and commits to volunteering for 15 hours. Most participants, however, give much more of their time; volunteers execute every task, from hauling trash and building exhibit structures to maintaining the website. As a result, the show draws artists and visitors of different races, cultural backgrounds, ages and experience levels. Artomatic provides a mechanism for emerging and established artists to have the chance to work with and learn from one another. The diversity of artwork and performances attract a broad range of people, providing a forum to build institutional connections; linking public and private schools, universities, community development organizations, human service organizations, corporations, foundations, and cultural organizations.

Artomatic hired Natalie Graves Tucker as its first executive director in October 2019.  History  The first Art-O-Matic, as it was spelled then, ran from May 21 to June 19, 1999. It started as a fairly spontaneous event in the Manhattan Laundry buildings on Florida Avenue in Northwest Washington. The location, in an old laundromat, accounts for the name. The D.C. Commission on the Arts and Humanities acquired about $25,000 of artwork from this show for permanent display in the capital's public buildings through its Art in Public Places program. The second Art-O-Matic was held from September 29 to October 28, 2000. This time, it was held in the Tenleytown neighborhood of Northwest Washington, in a then vacant building that had at various times been a Sears and a Hechinger. Artist Tim Tate's \\"artwork at Artomatic 2000 was seen by the curator of the Smithsonian‚Äôs Renwick Museum, and that show both got his work into the Museum‚Äôs permanent collection, and his sales at the show provided the seed money that started the Washington Glass School.\\" October 31 to November 30, 2002 saw the third Art-O-Matic, in a former EPA building in the Southwest Waterfront neighborhood of Washington, D.C., at 401 M Street SW, adjacent to Waterside Mall (the EPA building and the mall were both later demolished). At this Art-O-Matic, for the first time, the Figure Models Guild of the Washington, D.C., area sponsored open life drawing events. There would be live, often nude, models posing, and artists drawing. The fourth Artomatic, as it was now spelled and has been spelled since, was held from November 12 through December 5, 2004, at the old Capital Children's Museum in the H Street Corridor of Washington, D.C. The Washington Post art critic, Blake Gopnik, wrote a review of the show labeling the majority of the work mediocre or worse, and decrying the waste of money and effort that could have gone to worthwhile, professional arts activities in DC. The fifth Artomatic was held from April 13 to May 20, 2007. This was the first time Artomatic was held outside the District of Columbia. It occupied two floors of a vacated office building in Crystal City in Arlington, Virginia. The space had previously been occupied by the Patent and Trademark Office. Artomatic returned to the District of Columbia with the sixth iteration, held from May 9 through June 15, 2008. This time, they occupied 10 floors of Capitol Plaza I, a new ‚Äì not yet completed ‚Äì office building in the NoMa neighborhood. In February 2009, Artomatic collaborated with the Pink Line Project for \\"Luck of the Draw: An Art and Music Experience.\\" This event attracted over 1,500 people and was held at the Capitol Riverfront Neighborhood. Also in this seventh version of the event, several artists received interesting letters from someone who called himself \\"The Benefactor\\", causing both admiration and alarm in several of the artists. The seventh Artomatic was also the tenth anniversary event. It ran from May 29 to July 5, 2009 in the Navy Yard neighborhood of Washington, D.C. It occupied a brand new building, 55 M Street SE, in a development near the new Washington Nationals ballpark located right over an entrance of the Navy Yard Metro Station. Over 76,000 visitors attended. The eighth Artomatic was held from May 18 to June 23, 2012, in Crystal City, Virginia. It was held in a vacant office building, the event's largest space ever. The ninth Artomatic was held in New Carrollton, Maryland, from October 30 to December 12, 2015. The tenth Artomatic was held in Potomac, Maryland, in November 2016. Diane Tuckman, a pioneering silk artist and author on the same genre exhibited and taught classes at this Artomatic. The eleventh Artomatic returned to Crystal City, Virginia running from March 24 to May 6, 2017. It was staged using seven floors of an empty office building. The artfair organizers wanted to mark the 20th anniversary year in a meaningful way. However, 2019 came and went without finding a location to host the exhibition, so anniversary plans were moved to 2020, only to be upended by the outbreak of COVID-19. It was announced that for 2020, the production of Artomatic would be a totally online exhibition. =Licensed events and partnerships= The Artomatic concept has been licensed out to other places, including Frederick, Maryland, in October and November 2011, and Toledo, Ohio, in April 2015. In 2005 the Fraser Gallery of Bethesda, MD exhibited \\"Artomatic Top 10.\\" The show was curated to exhibit the work of the top ten artists selected by the gallery director from the 2004 Artomatic, and included work by Mark Jenkins, Michael Janis, Tim Tate and others. The show was selected as a \\"Hot Pick\\" of the week by The Washington Post. Also in 2005, the Anne C. Fisher Gallery in Georgetown selected an exhibition selected from Artomatic artists titled \\"10 Most Wanted.\\" The exhibition was curated by Fisher and by F. Lennox Campello, and included work by Frank Warren, the creator of the PostSecret project. In 2007, three art galleries in Bethesda, Maryland, put on a coordinated selected show of artists who had taken part in Artomatic. The galleries mounted the art for their monthly Bethesda Art Walk of January 12, 2007. In 2009 this was repeated by the Fraser Gallery in Bethesda, with a second curated exhibition of Artomatic artists. Smaller events and partnerships have also happened in following years, including a small display in the oldest wing of National Airport in 2011 and select Artomatic artists were featured with poetry by BRASH at Studio Gallery on R Street NW in Washington, D.C., in 2010. In 2013, thirty-five artists who participated at Artomatic 2012 were curated by juror F. Lennox Campello to show work at the PEPCO Edison gallery in Downtown Washington, D.C. Artomatic has also partnered with art groups from other cities and countries, specifically glass studios from England for the 2009 iteration, in order to bring work from elsewhere into the DC art scene. The 2009 Artomatic included of one of Washington, DC's Sister Cities: Sunderland, England.

Christmas Dampfnudel ''''' (plural ', lit. \\"steam-noodle\\"; Alsatian: ') is a sort of white bread roll or sweet roll eaten as a meal or as a dessert in Germany, Austria and in France (Alsace). It is a typical dish in southern Germany. History Coat of arms of Freckenfeld, Rhineland- Palatinate There are ' city gates in Freckenfeld and Kandel, two towns in the Rhineland-Palatinate, in western Germany, very near the border with French Alsace. It is reputed that, during the Thirty Years' War, Swedish troops arrived at Freckenfeld and demanded ransom. Master baker Johannes Muck, with his wife and apprentice, made 1,286 ' to feed the soldiers, who then spared the village from further extortion and pillage. The ' (Dampfnudel gate) even features on the coat of arms of the municipality of Freckenfeld. Ingredients and preparation ' are made from a dough composed of white flour, water, yeast, salt, butter or margarine, and sometimes also eggs and a little sugar. The dough is formed into balls about the size of an egg or a fist, left to rise and then cooked in a closed pot, preferably a high-rimmed iron pan with a lid, with milk and butter (the Bavarian-style) or salt water and fat (the Rhineland-Palatinate style) until a golden-brown crust forms at the bottom after the liquid has evaporated. The tops remain white. Serving ' are typically served as a main course with savoury accompaniment such as cabbage, salad, gherkins, potato soup, lentil soup, or mushrooms in a B√©chamel sauce. They can also be served as a dessert with vanilla custard, jam, or boiled fruit.

This confusion stems from the recent endorsement (allegedly by the KBL) of Marcos loyalist lawyer Oliver Lozano to dubious senatorial candidate Joselito Pepito \\"Peter\\" Cayetano, who has the namesake of Rep. Alan Peter Cayetano, an opposition stalwart. Rep. Cayetano said that Gov. Bongbong Marcos, who is the president of the KBL, has certified that Joselito Cayetano has no party affiliation whatsoever with the KBL and that no endorsement was called for his namesake's candidacy. More recently, Marcos has denounced loyalist lawyer and senatorial candidate Oliver Lozano along with his candidates for turning the KBL into an \\"embarrassment\\". Marcos said that the party leadership will deal with the \\"renegade members\\" of the KBL after the elections. However, Lozano has repeatedly contended on television and radio that Marcos is an \\"honorary\\" president, and the real power within the party lies with Vicente Millora, who is the duly noted party chairman. =Quotes= On not being allowed to attend a COMELEC meeting: ‚ÄúThey locked me out from the meeting.

Others } Short descriptions Not all tools have the same goal and the same feature set. To help distinguish between all of these software packages, here is a short description of each one. ;Ansible :Combines multi-node deployment, ad- hoc task execution, and configuration management in one package. Manages nodes over SSH and requires python (2.6+ or 3.5+) to be installed on them. Modules work over JSON and standard output and can be written in any language. Uses YAML to express reusable descriptions of systems. ;Bcfg2 :Software to manage the configuration of a large number of computers using a central configuration model and the client‚Äìserver paradigm. The system enables reconciliation between clients' state and the central configuration specification. Detailed reports provide a way to identify unmanaged configuration on hosts. Generators enable code or template-based generation of configuration files from a central data repository. ;CFEngine :Lightweight agent system. Manages configuration of a large number of computers using the client‚Äìserver paradigm or stand-alone. Any client state which is different from the policy description is reverted to the desired state. Configuration state is specified via a declarative language.https://www.upguard.com/blog/puppet-cfengine CFEngine's paradigm is convergent \\"computer immunology\\".http://www.usenix.org/event/lisa98/full_papers/burgess/burgess.pdf ;cdist :cdist is a zero dependency configuration management system: It requires only ssh on the target host, which is usually enabled on all Unix- like machines. Only the administration host needs to have Python 3.2 installed. ;Chef :Chef is a configuration management tool written in Erlang, and uses a pure Ruby DSL for writing configuration \\"recipes\\". These recipes contain resources that should be put into the declared state. Chef can be used as a client‚Äìserver tool, or used in \\"solo\\" mode. ;ISconf :Tool to execute commands and replicate files on all nodes. The nodes do not need to be up; the commands will be executed when they boot. The system has no central server so commands can be launched from any node and they will replicate to all nodes. ;Juju :Juju concentrates on the notion of service, abstracting the notion of machine or server, and defines relations between those services that are automatically updated when two linked services observe a notable modification. ;Local Configuration system (LCFG) :LCFG manages the configuration with a central description language in XML, specifying resources, aspects and profiles. Configuration is deployed using the client‚Äìserver paradigm. Appropriate scripts on clients (called components) transcribe the resources into configuration files and restart services as needed. ;Open PC server integration (Opsi) :Opsi is desktop management software for Windows clients based on Linux servers. It provides automatic software deployment (distribution), unattended installation of OS, patch management, hard- and software inventory, license management and software asset management, and administrative tasks for the configuration management. ;PIKT :PIKT is foremost a monitoring system that also does configuration management. \\"PIKT consists of a sophisticated, feature-rich file preprocessor; an innovative scripting language with unique labor-saving features; a flexible, centrally directed process scheduler; a customizing file installer; a collection of powerful command-line extensions; and other useful tools.\\" ;Puppet :Puppet consists of a custom declarative language to describe system configuration, distributed using the client‚Äìserver paradigm (using XML-RPC protocol in older versions, with a recent switch to REST), and a library to realize the configuration. The resource abstraction layer enables administrators to describe the configuration in high-level terms, such as users, services and packages. Puppet will then ensure the server's state matches the description. There was brief support in Puppet for using a pure Ruby DSL as an alternative configuration language starting at version 2.6.0. However this feature was deprecated beginning with version 3.1. ;Quattor :The quattor information model is based on the distinction between the desired state and the actual state. The desired state is registered in a fabric-wide configuration database, using a specially designed configuration language called Pan for expressing and validating configurations, composed out of reusable hierarchical building blocks called templates. Configurations are propagated to and cached on the managed nodes. ;Radmind :Radmind manages hosts configuration at the file system level. In a similar way to Tripwire (and other configuration management tools), it can detect external changes to managed configuration, and can optionally reverse the changes. Radmind does not have higher-level configuration element (services, packages) abstraction. A graphical interface is available (only) for OS X. ;Rex :Rex is a remote execution system with integrated configuration management and software deployment capabilities. The admin provides configuration instructions via so-called Rexfiles. They are written in a small DSL but can also contain arbitrary Perl. It integrates well with an automated build system used in CI environments. ;Salt :Salt started out as a tool for remote server management. As its usage has grown, it has gained a number of extended features, including a more comprehensive mechanism for host configuration. This is a relatively new feature facilitated through the Salt States component. With the traction that Salt has gotten in the last bit, the support for more features and platforms might continue to grow. ;SmartFrog :Java-based tool to deploy and configure applications distributed across multiple machines. There is no central server; you can deploy a .SF configuration file to any node and have it distributed to peer nodes according to the distribution information contained inside the deployment descriptor itself. ;Spacewalk :Spacewalk is an open source Linux and Solaris systems management solution and is the upstream project for the source of Red Hat Network Satellite. Spacewalk works with RHEL, Fedora, and other RHEL derivative distributions like CentOS, Scientific Linux, etc. There are ongoing efforts on getting it packaged for inclusion in Fedora. Spacewalk provides systems inventory (hardware and software information, installation and updates of software, collection and distribution of custom software packages into manageable groups, provision systems, management and deployment of configuration files, system monitoring, virtual guest provisioning, starting/stopping/configuring virtual guests and delegating all of these actions to local or LDAP users and system entitlements). ;STAF :The Software Testing Automation Framework (STAF) enables users to create cross-platform, distributed software test environments. STAF removes the tedium of building an automation infrastructure, thus enabling users to focus on building their automation solution. The STAF framework provides the foundation upon which to build higher-level solutions, and provides a pluggable approach supported across a large variety of platforms and languages. ;Synctool :Synctool aims to be easy to understand, learn and use. It is written in Python and makes use of SSH (passwordless, with host-based or key-based authentication) and rsync. No specific language is needed to configure Synctool. Synctool has dry run capabilities that enable surgical precision.

The only daughter of Alfred Bey Sursock, a Lebanese aristocrat, and Donna Maria Theresa Serra di Casino, the daughter of Francesco Serra, 7th Duke of Casino. Her father owned thousands of tracts of land which included much of Jezebel Valley, the Western Galilee, Haifa, and Jaffa. She studied at Les Oiseaux, in southern England and was fluent in Italian, French, and Lebanese Arabic. In 1946, she married Sir Desmond Cochrane, 3rd Baronet.Lady Cochrane Sursock: Information and Much More from Answers.com When her husbands father died, the couple inherited the Woodbrook estate outside of Bray, Co Wicklow and moved into the home in 1952 and had three sons and a daughter. The couple separated in the 1960s, and Sir Desmond Cochrane moved to Cyprus and died in 1979. After her family sold much of the land to the newly formed Israel, she retained some properties and land in the territory and embarked on a long legal battle to have her assists released from Israel after the declaration of state. She was repeatedly turned down under the Absentee's Property Law of 1950, but with added support from the then President of Lebanon, Camille Chamoun the court ruled in her favor and financial compensation was agreed upon. She died in 2020 after sustaining injuries from the explosion in the Beirut port on August 4th, 2020. Her children and grandchildren accepted a wreath and a posthumous National Order of the Cedar medal from a representative of the Lebanese president. Philanthropy She was president of the committee and general manager of the Sursock Museum in Beirut from 1960 until 1966. She founded the Association for the Protection of the Natural Sites and Ancient Buildings (French: Association pour la protection des sites et anciennes demeures; APSAD) in Lebanon and was its president from 1960 until 2002. Her work focused on projects that seek to reduce Lebanese emigration and to support people in their villages of origin, by creating jobs for them in the fields of agriculture, textiles and handcrafts. She was also involved in the protection of the natural environment in Lebanon and in the preservation of the country's unique architectural and cultural heritage. She was the owner of Sursock House, plus a broad swath of property along Rue Sursock, up to the trendy Rue Gouraud. Gemmayzeh : is the quarter becoming 'less and less convivial'?

In 1957 the National Benzole Co. became wholly owned by Shell-Mex and B.P. Ltd (through British Petroleum) but continued its separate trading identity. In the early 1960s National Benzole was re-branded as National and continued trading as a UK retailer of petroleum products until the early 1990s, when the brand was phased out by parent company BP. Foundation The company was founded in February 1919 in a room next to the boiler house of the Gas Light and Coke Company in London's Horseferry Road. In the early years of the century, benzole production had been small scale. But, because it was as good at propelling shells as motor cars, production was expanded massively during World War One. And this led to something of a post-war \\"benzole-lake\\". A group of men, including Samuel Henshaw, then the chairman of the Staffordshire Chemical Company, reckoned there was money to be made from these surplus-to-requirements stocks. Henshaw became the first chairman of the National Benzole Company. Although the idea of using benzole to power automobiles was not new, cars fuelled on neat benzole needed altered carburetter settings which was inconvenient for owners who had previously used petrol and the effectiveness of neat benzole as a paint stripper raised concern about the possible effect on carburettor floats made of varnished cork ‚Äì a common feature in US vehicles which at the time were being imported in greater numbers. There was also concern about the variable quality and specification of the benzole. It was in the need to address these concerns, especially regarding consistency of fuel quality, that Henshaw and his colleagues recognised their commercial opportunity. A distribution network was established consisting of a few (initially) storage depots round the country, supplied by a small fleet of used lorries with solid tyres (tires), acquired from the War Disposals Board. These transported the fuel in war-surplus drums and cans of 2, 4 or 50 gallons. The 1920s: Rapid growth The young company received a boost in 1920 with the award of the RAC Dewar Trophy to a Rolls- Royce 40/50 hp that successfully completed a 10,000-mile reliability trial fuelled exclusively by National Benzole. Problems arose in the same year from a coal strike which restricted benzole availability, and increased demand in the ensuing years led to frequent shortages of coal shale from which the benzole was made. At the same time, some reckoned neat benzole was a little strong for the average engine and started to mix it with petrol. This led in 1922 to the replacement of benzole fuel with a \\"fifty-fifty mixture\\" of benzole and petroleum which addressed the supply issue and could be seen as an early example of customer responsiveness. Neat benzole continued to be marketed as an effective anti-knocking performance enhancing additive. Military service in the First World War introduced many British men to motoring for the first time: returning survivors began, where funds permitted, to purchase small motor cars or motor bikes, while others set up in business to maintain and repair the motor cars of the wealthy. Before the war motor fuel suppliers in the UK had typically included pharmacies, cycle shops or even blacksmiths, but after the war commercial roadside garages began to appear, slowly at first. Because garages were initially sparse the Automobile Association itself set up twelve strategically located filling stations, supplying fuel only to its own members and making no profit from the transactions. Initially the AA fuel stations supplied only National Benzole which was seen a particularly patriotic fuel choice because the coal shale which was the principal ingredient of benzole was domestically produced. In 1927 the AA dismantled its small chain of service stations as the growth of a commercially motivated service station network rendered them unnecessary, but by this time National Benzole was a nationally established fuel brand in the UK. During this period the company consciously \\"smartened up\\" its public face. Initially the enthusiastic driver/ salesmen delivery drivers had also been the company's sales force, touting relentlessly for new business as they made deliveries to existing customers. Ten years later the head office had relocated to an upmarket location in London's Grosvenor Gardens and a sales force was recruited, equipped with Morris Cowleys painted yellow, which had become the company's colour. Mr Mercury Mr Mercury sign of a former National petrol station at Friskney, Lincolnshire The now famous 50/50 blend became a resounding success. To sustain the success, an imaginative advertising campaign was developed, and in 1928, Mr Mercury ‚Äì startlingly naked ‚Äì leapt for the first time from the pages of the national newspapers. Mr Mercury, in National Benzole's black and chrome gold corporate colours, became one of the most powerful marketing images of this age. Almost every service station in the 1930s had a National Benzole pump, for single-brand sites were unknown in those days. Eventually Mr Mercury's head was used as the brand's logo. At the outbreak of the Second World War, all petrol brands gave way to pool petrol. Mr Mercury returned in 1953, now more modestly attired in the advertisements, though he retained his winged helmet, and National Benzole quickly re-established itself as a market leader. The 1930s: Competitor issues Switching from neat benzole to the fifty-fifty mixture was not a complete solution to the supply issue. It reduced but did not eliminate the company's dependence on the UK coal mining cartel, while it introduced an inherent tension in the relationship with the petroleum suppliers who were also major competitors for road fuel sales. The petroleum supply issue was to some extent addressed by \\"buying on the high seas\\" whereby the company, having no oil refining capacity of its own, contracted to buy from shippers full tanker loads of refined fuel. As motoring passed from being a recreation for the leisure hours of a leisured class to a mainstream means of transport, the National Benzole business continued its growth path. A partial solution to the supply concerns was a long term petroleum contract with the Anglo-Persian Oil Company which foreshadowed still closer links with the future British Petroleum company: in the meantime National Benzole acquired oceangoing tankers of its own. Benzole phase out Effectively promoted and distributed into the second half of the twentieth century, National Benzole continued to be very popular with British motorists and the National Benzole brand remained a common sight at the roadside. However the proportion of benzole in the mixture was reduced progressively after the Second World War as the number of more lucrative specialist applications for the chemical grew with the development of the UK's chemical industry. During the late 1950s Benzole was determined to be hazardous to health: its anti-knocking properties as a fuel ingredient were no longer so important for the smooth running of engines, since various additives including, ironically, tetraethyllead were now routinely included in refined petroleum. Therefore, from the early 1960s onwards National sold only petrol. Shell-Mex and BP National Benzole joined the Shell-Mex and BP Ltd family in 1957 but continued to trade separately. In 1959, responding to the growing importance of benzole as a specialist chemical, it was decided to concentrate on this market by means of a new company named Benzole Producers Limited. At the same time the motor fuel marketing business was now fully merged with Shell-Mex and BP Ltd. Benzole (no longer part of the mixture) was dropped from the fuel's name and Mr Mercury's black and chrome gave way to sparkling new yellow, blue and white. Following the de-merger of Shell-Mex and British Petroleum (BP) in 1976, the National brand continued to be distinctively marketed by BP for over a decade. Decline In the 1970s and 1980s the company's petrol stations sold figurines of The Smurfs comic characters whose blue and white colouring matched the National colours. However, during the 1980s, the National brand declined as BP focused on the strength of the BP brand. By the early 1990s the brand name was phased out in favour of BP. There was a brief re-appearance of the National Brand from 2000 when Scottish Fuels branded its retail outlets as 'National'. These outlets have since been re-branded into the colours of Scottish Fuels. A number of outlets in Shetland are still branded as National as are a few outlets on the Isle of Wight.

In the course of her career she is alternately billed as \\"Madaline Traverse\\", \\"Madeline Traverse\\" and \\"Madeline Travers\\".Pictorial History of the Silent Screen by Daniel Blum c. 1953 pages 37, 59 & 108 Silent movie actress In When Fate Decides (1919) Traverse was a leading lady of the Fox Film Corporation in the second decade of the twentieth century. In 1917 she played the mother of Mary Pickford in The Poor Little Rich Girl (1917). In What Would You Do? (1920) director Edmund Lawrence required Traverse to wear the clothes of a Boer woman of South Africa. Lawrence stressed realism to the point of insisting that Traverse not wash her face for several days before her scenes were shot. Her most successful films are The Caillaux Case (1918) and Three Weeks (1914). In 1920 she made her first movie for Madlaine Traverse Productions, Snares of Paris (1919), in New York City. Her wardrobe for the motion picture was purchased in Paris and she stayed in Fort Lee, New Jersey while on location. Traverse was rescued from drowning while she was bathing at high tide in the Pacific Ocean in October 1918. A man who was swimming nearby noticed Traverse did not come to the surface after struggling with strong waves. He pulled her by her skirt and took her to safety from the water off the coast of Ocean Park, California. She became an avid duck hunter in southern California after settling there to make motion pictures. Madlaine Traverse died in Cleveland in 1964. Additional information Madlaine Traverse's birth name was Mary Businsky. She was born August 1, 1875. Madlaine began her acting career on the stage in England. She married Max Traverse, who died in 1906. The lights from filming permanently damaged her eyes, forcing her into retirement. Mary Pickford, who starred with her in Poor Little Rich Girl, visited her in 1962, which was the highlight of her retirement years. She was 88 when she died January 7, 1964.

Barrington-Coupe Hatto's birth, marriage and death certificates (1931 ‚Äì 19 October 2014) was a Welsh record producer and music impresario. Married in 1956 to concert pianist Joyce Hatto, he was jailed for a year in 1966 for \\"blatant and impertinent frauds\\". He attained further notoriety in 2007 when he confessed that a large number of piano CDs that he had sold on his Concert Artist/Fidelio Recordings label were not in fact performed by his wife but were copies, in some cases digitally manipulated, of commercially available recordings by other pianists. Biography Barrington-Coupe was born in Llanelli. In the early 1950s, he worked in London as a classical musicians' agent. A directory from 1953‚Äì1954 showed him with two exclusive artists on his books. A 1955 article in Billboard magazine refers to Barrington-Coupe, as President of Concert Artists, licensing Mozart recordings by the \\"London Mozart Ensemble\\". The Saga Films and Records Company, of which he was an employee,Piano ‚Äògenius‚Äô is branded a fake (reader comment) collapsed in 1960, with the Official Receiver declaring that Barrington-Coupe was chiefly responsible for the company's demise.'Music and Musicians', Private Eye No. 1180, 16‚Äì29 March 2007 Following the Saga collapse in late 1960, he created the Lyrique record label with Marcel Rodd, who had a record-pressing factory, and began to release records by artists under different pseudonyms, a not uncommon practice of the era.http://www.scena.org/columns/lebrecht/070221-NL-hatto.html Norman Lebrecht. How to make a classical fake. 21 February 2007 'Havagesse' was a conductor whose name was fabricated by Barrington-Coupe (from 'have a guess', claims Simon Townley). The actual conductor and orchestra have not been identified.Simon Townley, 'Cut-Price Classics' BBC Radio 4, 11 Dec 2004. \\"Who was Wilhelm Havagesse (go on, have a guess!)? Simon Townley goes in search of the most elusive orchestral conductor of all time.\\" Recordings of classical works issued on his Delta label were believed to have been copied from radio broadcasts from behind the Iron Curtain, mixed to disguise the sources. Private Eye has claimed that on one recording of Tchaikovsky's 4th Symphony, he made the mistake of inserting a number of bars backwards. A recording issued featuring the Danzig Philharmonic was in stereo, when it was known that that orchestra had ceased to exist a decade or more before stereo recording was common. He also made up artists' names: \\"Wilhelm Havagesse\\" was the falsely-named conductor of the \\"Zurich Municipal Orchestra\\" in a recording of Scheherazade released on Barrington-Coupe's Fidelio label in 1962 (ATL 4006).It should be said that other 'budget' record labels from the 1950s to the present day also frequently use made-up names for their artistes where the master tapes are made by moonlighting musicians, or all trace of origin has been lost. Charles Haynes, who worked with Barrington-Coupe at Delta, recounted that \\"quite often they used to 'monkey around', hence conductors Havagesse and Homer Lott and the soprano Herda Wobbel\\", lamenting that the practice stopped when \\"the Trades Descriptions Act threatened the continuing existence of these fine artists: 'End of the Road for Musician Havagesse' proclaimed the Daily Telegraph's headline.\\"Charles Haynes, Pearls Before. Self-published Tunbridge Wells 1991; see also Marc Shepherd, 'Gilbert & Sullivan for Orchestra, Eric Johnson, conductor a/k/a The Best Loved Melodies of Gilbert and Sullivan, Malcolm Hughes, conductor' Nov. 2001. Barrington- Coupe set up a further label, on 25 February 1960, with Major Wilfred Alonzo Banks's financial backing: Triumph Records. This time his collaborator was Joe Meek, a record producer who became best known for \\"Telstar\\", the 1962 hit by the Tornados.The JOE MEEK Page  Triumph Records, Part 1 The two men later fell out and Meek left the company, which subsequently went into liquidation. Meek was followed by David Gooch, who produced a number of extended-play and long-playing records on a new label, Dial Records. This association was terminated when Barrington-Coupe had obvious financial difficulties. Desperate to make ends meet, he began importing radios from Hong Kong, which he sold in London markets and by mail order, but became the subject of legal action when he failed to pay purchase tax. On 17 May 1966, after what was then the longest-running and most expensive trial at the Old Bailey, costing the British taxpayer ¬£150,000, Barrington-Coupe and four other defendants were found guilty of failing to pay ¬£84,000 in purchase tax (over ¬£1 million in 2007 currency). Barrington-Coupe was fined ¬£3,600 and jailed for 12 months. His company, W.H. Barrington-Coupe Ltd, was fined ¬£4,000 and finally wound up in 1971. Summing up, Judge Alan King-Hamilton said: \\"These were blatant and impertinent frauds, carried out in my opinion rather clumsily. But such was your conceit that you thought yourself smart enough to get away with it.\\" After he was released from prison, Barrington-Coupe was reunited with Hatto. While she began to earn a modest reputation for her recitals of Liszt and Chopin, Barrington-Coupe maintained a lower profile. In the 1970s, the couple disappeared from the public eye, becoming virtual recluses in their detached modern home in Royston, Hertfordshire. The great piano swindle It was not until 2002 that they were heard of again. During the previous 13 years they had apparently recorded another 103 CDs of Hatto's playing, which Barrington- Coupe began issuing on his Concert Artist label. In 2007, these CDs were found to be fraudulent copies of recordings of other artists issued by other labels. Barrington-Coupe initially denied any wrongdoing but subsequently admitted the fraud in a letter to Robert von Bahr, the head of the Swedish BIS record label that had originally issued some of the recordings plagiarised by Concert Artist. Bahr immediately shared the contents of the letter with Gramophone magazine, telling journalist Jessica Duchen afterwards that he \\"had given a lot of thought\\" to suing Barrington-Coupe for damages, but was inclined not to do so, on the assumption that the hoax recordings were \\"a desperate attempt to build a shrine to a dying wife\\". Death Barrington-Coupe died in Royston, England on 19 October 2014.

Dietz (June 16, 1882 ‚Äì May 13, 1950) was an American weaver best known for her 1949 monograph Algebraic Expressions in Handwoven Textiles, which defines a novel method for generating weaving patterns based on algebraic patterns. Her method employs the expansion of multivariate polynomials to devise a weaving scheme. Dietz' work is still well-regarded today, by both weavers and mathematicians. Along with the references listed below, Griswold (2001) cites several additional articles on her work. Algebraic weaving Ada Dietz developed her algebraic method in 1946 while living in Long Beach, California. An avid weaver, Dietz drew upon her experience as a former math teacher to devise a threading pattern based on a cubic binomial expansion. She describes her idea as follows: :\\"Taking the cube of a binomial [ (x + y)3], I approached [the pattern] in the way applied algebraic problems are approached - by letting x equal one unknown and y equal the other unknown. :\\"In this case, x equaled the first and second harnesses, and y equaled the third and fourth harnesses. Then it was simply a matter of expanding the cube of the binomial and substituting the values of x and y to write the threading draft.\\" (Dietz, 1949) A piece based on the formula (a + b + c + d + e + f)2, submitted to the Little Loomhouse Country Fair in Louisville, Kentucky received such a positive response, which prompted a collaboration between Dietz and Little Loomhouse's founder, Lou Tate.

The lake has a surface area of 61 hectares, and the mean and maximum depth are 3.2 meters and 5.3 meters, respectively. The lake was used to study the effects of biomanipulation on a small, mesotrophic lake. From 1993 to 1997, over 200 kilograms per hectare of fish, mainly roach (Rutilus rutilus) and bream (Abramis brama) were caught and removed. This resulted in a reduction of nearly 80% of fish biomass. The effects on the benthic invertebrates were investigated using biomass and density, during the years of fish removal and for the following three years. The decrease in benthivorous fish stock led to higher biomass and density in all the major benthic invertebrate groups. Three years after fish removal had been discontinued, the fish biomass had recovered to almost its initial value; the community structure, however, was different because of much greater abundance of perch. The biomasses of the benthic invertebrates in many groups was seen to drop in the years 1999-2000, apparently due to the increased predation. The relationship between the two trophic levels is thought to be as a consequence of the open and sparsely vegetated bottom, which offers minimal shelter to invertebrate prey. An additional factor in the reduced invertebrate biomasses was a fall in both phosphorus and chlorophyll a concentrations, which led to a drop in primary production. The phosphorus and chlorophyll a decreases occurred after the three years of fishing and have remained low since. This could be related to the loss of waste products and detritus the fish would have produced over the years.

This is especially the case with seriality, i.e. the fact that television series are told in several, separate episodes. To Mittell, this form of television drama emerged in the early 1990s and is characterized by its use of ‚Äúnarrative special effect‚Äù which is to say that a program sometimes \\"flexes its storytelling muscles to confound and amaze a viewer‚Äù, e.g. by using flashbacks in innovative ways.Jason Mittell (2015) Complex TV: The Poetics of Contemporary Television Storytelling.

History  In 1969, several hundred women gathered at a \\"counter- convention\\" at Glide Memorial Church rather than attend the ASA meetings at the Hilton Hotel. Sharing feelings of insecurity and stories of initially mystifying experiences as graduate students and faculty, and encouraging each other with applause, they came to see that some of the stresses in being sociologists were not idiosyncratic, but part of the experience of being women. Later that year, some 20 founding women met to build an organization and network. Although SWS was created to redress the plight of women sociologists, SWS has become an organization that also focuses on improving the social position of women in society through feminist sociological research and writing.

Life and work Born in 1937 in Buenos Aires, Dumont first worked in Bunge y Born, Argentina's largest grain wholesaler and one of the principal grain conglomerates in the World. Later that year (1956), he made his first appearance on the stage, developing an affinity for the art that, for economic reasons, he postponed pursuing for several more years. After a modest career in sales, Dumont was given his first film role, a bit part in a 1964 comedy. The otherwise forgettable experience opened doors for him in Buenos Aires' vibrant theatre scene, and he returned to film only in 1971. Eschewing classical theatre, he contributed mostly to locally-written productions, soon becoming a fixture in works by noted Argentine dramatists such as Villanueva Cosse, Carlos Gorostiza and Griselda Gambaro. Receiving his first starring film role in Sergio Ren√°n's 1976 film adaptation of an Haroldo Conti play, Crecer de golpe (\\"Maturing Suddenly\\") secured Dumont's reputation in Argentine drama. He was offered numerous leading theatre roles in 1977, the most memorable of which were probably Carlos Gorostiza's El puente (\\"The Bridge\\") and what would become his signature role, that of a crusty, ravenous Italian-Argentine grandmother in Roberto Cossa's La nona. The following year, Dumont lent his talent to a young, hitherto unknown Argentine director, Adolfo Aristarain. The 1978 thriller, La Parte del le√≥n (\\"The Lion's Share\\") began a successful string of similar collaborations between the two and an actor already well-established as a leading man since the 1960s, Federico Luppi. The three collaborated similarly in the muck-raking Tiempo de revancha (\\"Time for Revenge,\\" 1981) and the thriller √öltimos d√≠as de la v√≠ctima (\\"The Victim's Last Days,\\" 1982). True to Dumont's understated style, the three acclaimed and commercially successful films criticized the pravailing climate of fear (during a regime in which doing so was often perilous) with metaphor and veiled references to current events. Developing a close friendship with Federico Luppi, he and Dumont co- starred with various other directors over the following years and, in the interim, Dumont married Marcela Luppi, Federico's daughter. The two starred in Hector Olivera's No habr√° m√°s penas ni olvido (\\"Little Dirty War,\\" 1983), a tragic comedy set during the 1974 conflict between left and right-wing Peronists; 1983 also saw Dumont star in Eduardo Calcagno's Los Enemigos (\\"The Enemies\\"). The dark thriller, released months before Argentina's return to democracy, focused on use that the well-connected had made of their ties to the military during the dictatorship in ridding themselves of enemies, with impunity. Working prolifically following the advent of democracy, Dumont played, among others, an opinionated hobo in Lautaro Mur√∫a's Cuarteles de invierno (\\"Winter Barracks,\\" 1984) and a no-nonsense producer faced with an unpredictable film maker in La pel√≠cula del rey (\\"A King and His Movie,\\" 1985), a title which has enjoyed international exposure since its VHS release the following year. His role in \\"Winter Barracks\\" remained, by his own admission, his favorite. He was reunited with Luppi in 1987, cast in a supporting role in El A√±o del conejo (\\"The Year of the Rabbit\\") a divorce comedy made during Luppi's own contentious separation from wife and former co- star Hayd√©e Padilla. During an era in which Argentine cinema often revisited the traumas lived during the 1976‚Äì83 dictatorship, Dumont was cast in a leading role as an aging, targeted intellectual in Fernando Solanas' Sur (\\"South,\\" 1987), one of the defining films on the subject. Working in varied genres, he also starred in a crime caper, Juan Carlos Desanzo's Al filo de la ley (\\"On the Edge of the Law,\\" 1992) and was reunited with director Eduardo Calcagno in El Censor (\\"The Censor,\\" 1995), a surreal historical drama loosely based on Miguel Paulino Tato's notorious tenure as National Film Rater (censor) during the 1970s. Turning to more sentimental work in his later years, Dumont traveled to Cuba to play an aging businessman in the throes of hopelessness in Diego Musiak's Historias clandestinas en la Habana (\\"Hidden Stories in Havana,\\" 1996). Continuing to be active in the theatre, he performed in the title role of an alienated professor in Roberto Cossa's Yepeto (\\"Gepetto\\"), a play that enjoyed an approximately 5,000-performance run during the 1990s. Yepeto was adapted for the screen by director Eduardo Calcagno in 1999. A heavy smoker, Dumont suffered from worsening cardiovascular health subsequently and, yet, his work in film remained as vigorous as ever, playing a socially conscious priest in Cerca de la frontera (\\"Near the Border,\\" 1999), an ex convict in a bind in Rosarigasinos (\\"Rosario Boys,\\" 2001), a widower lost without his better half in La esperanza (\\"Hope,\\" 2003), an elderly woman's inopportune lover in Conversaciones con mam√° (2004), and a railroad worker laid off by the sector's mass 1992 privatizations in Pr√≥xima salida (\\"Next Stop,\\" 2004), to name only a few of his recent film, theatre and television roles. Dumont earned three Silver Condor Awards and three awards at the Havana Film Festival, among numerous other recognitions.Internet Movie Data Base. Ulises Dumont: Awards.

It was the last recorded by the band (not including compilations) after the change of direction and personnel of their 1966 album As Is. It continued a transition away from jazz and blues towards self-composed art-pop. Despite including two UK 'Top 5' hit singles (Bob Dylan's \\"Mighty Quinn\\" and Tony Hazzard's \\"Ha! Ha! Said The Clown\\"), the album did not chart and the band split up the year after. In the US and Canada, it was released as The Mighty Quinn by Mercury Records. Overview The group's continued pop success with material by established songwriters such as Dylan and Hazzard made its handlers averse to the risk of releasing self-written singles, a state of affairs that had prevailed ever since the success of \\"Do Wah Diddy Diddy\\", even though the group's first hits had been self-composed, at least one example of drummer Mike Hugg's new-found productivity had been seen as potentially chart-worthySleeve notes, What a Mann!, Fontana Records compilation, Fontana SFL 13003. Released 28 June 1968 and singer Mike d'Abo was able to provide other artists with hits such as \\"Build Me Up Buttercup\\" and \\"Handbags and Gladrags\\". The resultant pop image did not encourage album sales to \\"serious\\" listeners, particularly when trends were turning from baroque pop to hard rock. So, like contemporary releases by The Kinks and The Zombies, Mighty Garvey! became a record esteemed more in retrospectSee, for example, the critical review at http://starling.rinet.ru/music/mann.htm than at the time. It was later re-issued in 2003, with bonus tracks. The group's commercial compromises also led to \\"self-knocking\\",Sleeve note, As Is, Fontana TL/STL 5377. Released 21 October 1966 and its recordings developed an ironic distance that on Mighty Garvey sometimes invites comparison with The Kinks, Dave Dee, Dozy, Beaky, Mick & Tich, Frank Zappa or The Bonzo Dog Band. Even on Hugg's intricate and sentimental \\"Harry the One Man Band\\" the vocal track finally dissolves into schoolboy mirth and silly noises. The three different versions of d'Abo's song \\"Happy Families\\", credited as; (Track 1) Performed by Eddie 'Fingers' Garvey, (Track 6) Performed by Ed Garvey and The Trio and (Track 14) Performed by Edwin O'Garvey and His Showband, are outright parodies of \\"the pompous big rock band style, the sleazy lounge jazz style, and then the semi-drunk family entertainment \\"country-shape Christmas\\" style\\" that appropriate and poke fun at the Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band concept (\\"Edwin Garvey\\" being an invented character introduced on the similarly flippant flip side of \\"Mighty Quinn\\"). These three parodies and two hit singles take up over a third of a relatively short L.P. and of the remainder, d'Abo's \\"Country Dancing\\" and \\"The Vicar's Daughter\\" are likewise somewhat arch, besides strengthening an impression of \\"chameleonism\\" and lack of sincere direction. \\"Big Betty\\" is also non-original, a treatment of Huddie Ledbetter's song \\"Black Betty\\" in a manner reminiscent of The Spencer Davis Group's hits, providing the only real point of contact with the band's rhythm and blues past. Yet this still leaves a core of worthwhile, intelligent and melodic songs, also by Hugg and d'Abo apart from \\"Cubist Town\\", written by guitarist Tom McGuinness in a one-off collaboration. The group made full use of the new possibilities of multi-tracking, overlaying complex and inventive textures of flutes, keyboards and vibraphones, while the group's backing vocals, originally limited to a tribal unison, began to take on an almost Pet Sounds complexity.

Bo≈°ko Bo≈°koviƒá father of Nikola Bo≈°koviƒá was mentioned in the document from 1690 (\\"Bosikus Boscouich de Popouo mihi cancellario optime notus\\") from which is evident that family surname Boskoviƒá is much older and was surname of his ancestors long time before they arrive to Dubrovnik.Siviriƒá Marijan, 2003, Migracije iz Hercegovine na dubrovaƒçko podruƒçje od potresa 1667. do pada Republike 1808. godine https://library.foi.hr/lib/knjiga.php?B=20&sqlx;=39037&ser;=&sqlid;=20&sqlnivo;=&css;=&H;=&U;=MIGRACIJE #page= 204 He had a brother, Petar (d. 1724). Work Nikola came to Ragusa (Dubrovnik), Republic of Ragusa, as a boy when his parents had sent him to become an apprentice to wealthy Ragusan merchant Rad Gleƒëeviƒá, who then dispatched him to Yeni Pazar (Novi Pazar) in the Ottoman Empire (today Serbia) to learn from the local traders. Bo≈°koviƒá returned to Dubrovnik as a very wealthy man. His father then also moved to Dubrovnik. His travels through \\"Ra≈°ka\\" (Old Serbia) were written down by a Jesuit priest Riggeputti as Relazione della Provincia della Rassia, who was collecting material for his work Illyricum Sacrum, a history of Christianity in the Balkans. Bo≈°koviƒá described the historical and sacral monuments of Ra≈°ka including Orthodox monasteries and royal palaces, and also commented on the \\"sad state\\" of the Roman Catholic Church in these lands under the Ottoman rule. After settling down in Dubrovnik, Nikola married a daughter of a local noble of Italian origin, Paola Bettera (Pavica Betera). The two had eight children, the second youngest, Ruƒëer Bo≈°koviƒá (Roger Boscovich), being the most famous. Origin debate There is a debate on the ethnicity and origin of Nikola Bo≈°koviƒá. In 1910 Branislav Petronijeviƒá reviewed an article by Vladimir Variƒáak about Ruƒëer Bo≈°koviƒá and stated that Ruƒëer Bo≈°koviƒá's descent is \\"at least as much Serb as it is Croat\\" and that the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts (in Belgrade) should collaborate with the Yugoslav Academy of Sciences and Arts (in Zagreb) to publish a reprint of all of Bo≈°koviƒá's works to celebrate the 200th anniversary of his birth. An English translation of Bo≈°koviƒá's \\"Theory of Natural Philosophy\\" was published by the Open Court Publishing Company in 1922, prefaced by Branislav Petronijeviƒá's biography of Bo≈°koviƒá. In 1925, Vladimir Variƒáak published a review of it, and criticized it extensively for various factual errors, among other things for asserting without references that the Bo≈°koviƒá family was \\"of purely Servian origin\\", that Bo≈°ko was \\"an orthodox Serbian peasant\\" and that Nikola became \\"a Roman Catholic\\" in Dubrovnik. In 1995 a Montenegrin author named Slobodan ≈†ƒáepanoviƒá published an article in the journal of the Institute of History of Montenegro where he claimed, based partly on \\"oral history\\", that Nikola Bo≈°koviƒá converted to the Catholic faith from Orthodoxy, and that he was a descended from a Montenegrin clan. According to Serbian sources, the Bo≈°koviƒá brotherhood, originally surnamed Pokrajƒçiƒá, had settled the village from the surrounding mountains of Popovo. Branches of the brotherhood also settled the surroundings of Stolac. In 2012, the Serbian newspaper Press published an article claiming Nikola Bo≈°koviƒá was a Serb, based partly on Serbian president Boris Tadiƒá's claims that Ruƒëer Bo≈°koviƒá was a \\"Serb Catholic\\".

Isotonic contractions differ from isokinetic contractions in that in isokinetic contractions the muscle speed remains constant. While superficially identical, as the muscle's force changes via the length-tension relationship during a contraction, an isotonic contraction will keep force constant while velocity changes, but an isokinetic contraction will keep velocity constant while force changes. A near isotonic contraction is known as Auxotonic contraction. There are two types of isotonic contractions: (1) concentric and (2) eccentric. In a concentric contraction, the muscle tension rises to meet the resistance, then remains the same as the muscle shortens. In eccentric, the muscle lengthens due to the resistance being greater than the force the muscle is producing. Concentric This type is typical of most exercise. The external force on the muscle is less than the force the muscle is generating - a shortening contraction. The effect is not visible during the classic biceps curl, which is in fact auxotonic because the resistance (torque due to the weight being lifted) does not remain the same through the exercise. Tension is highest at a parallel to the floor level, and eases off above and below this point. Therefore, tension changes as well as muscle length. Eccentric There are two main features to note regarding eccentric contractions. First, the absolute tensions achieved can be very high relative to the muscle's maximum tetanic tension generating capacity (you can set down a much heavier object than you can lift). Second, the absolute tension is relatively independent of lengthening velocity. Muscle injury and soreness are selectively associated with eccentric contraction.Evans et al. 1985 Muscle strengthening using exercises that involve eccentric contractions is lower than using concentric exercises. However because higher levels of tension are easier to attain during exercises that involve eccentric contractions it may be that, by generating higher signals for muscle strengthening, muscle hypertrophy is better than exercises that involve concentric contractions, albeit at a higher level of resistance. Auxotonic contraction This is almost an isotonic contraction because there is some fluctuation towards the end of the contraction. For example, the heart's ventricles contract to expel blood into the pulmonary artery and aorta. As the blood flows out, the previous built-up load is decreased and hence less force is required to expel the rest of the blood. Thus the tension is reduced.

Originally a piano and violin player, Wekre did not take up the horn until age 17, having become fascinated with its sound. Her choice for the horn was also partly inspired by her having heard that it was a particularly difficult instrument to play. After only two years of studying horn with Wilhelm Lanzky-Otto and Vitaly Bujanovsky, she was invited to join the Norwegian Opera Orchestra. She obtained a post with the Oslo Philharmonic Orchestra in 1961, where she became co-principal horn in 1965. Wekre stayed with the orchestra until her retirement in 1991. Wekre is horn and wind chamber music professor at the Norwegian Academy of Music. She is an active lecturer and participates in juries at international competitions. Her book Thoughts on Playing the Horn Well has been translated into several languages. Fr√∏ydis Ree Wekre has been an honorary member of the International Horn Society since 1994, where she served as president for two years. She is a strong advocate for free buzzing and mouthpiece buzzing, even saying you should be doing it while waiting for the bus. Though this may seem eccentric, her justification is, \\"If people don't know you, it doesn't matter what they think of you, and if they do know you, well, then it's not a surprise.\\" Renowned as a teacher and performer, Wekre has given masterclasses and workshops throughout Europe and North America. Because of Fr√∏ydis‚Äô young age when she won her first job, she has become an inspiration and icon to many young female brass players, showing them they have just as much a place in the orchestra as anyone else.

The film follows the further adventures of the McLaughlin family who live on a horse ranch in Wyoming. Marilyn Monroe appeared as an uncredited extra. The original cast from the first two films did not reprise their roles in the third. Plot Beaver Greenway, a longtime horse owner with a drinking problem, is upset because one of his mares has been lured away by Thunderhead, the wild stallion that previously belonged to Rob and Nell McLaughlin. He goes to Goose Bar Ranch to assist in the hunt for the wild stallion, who is now well known for taking the Albino's place in stealing mares from many different states but the McLaughlins no longer have any control of the horse. Ken McLaughlin returns home to his parents from a horse-buying trip with Crown Jewel, a trotter. Rob is skeptical about the purchase, more so when Crown Jewel develops altitude sickness in the Wyoming hills. Ken goes on a date with Greenway's granddaughter Carey. A veterinarian advises Crown Jewel be put down due to her congested lungs, but Beaver Greenway, a former sulky driver, recommends a treatment that works. Thunderhead returns and lifts the mare's spirits. Crown Jewel is taken to Ohio to compete in the Governor's Cup sweepstakes, where Ken McLaughlin has entered his own horse, Sundance.

It is thought to have previously been a white dwarf that, as a result of a very late thermal pulse, swelled and became a red giant. It is located at the center of a planetary nebula and is believed to currently be in thermal instability and within its final shell helium flash phase. At the time of its discovery, astronomers believed Sakurai's Object to be a slow nova. Later spectroscopic analysis suggested that the star was not a nova, but had instead undergone a very late thermal pulse similar to that of V605 Aquilae, causing it to vastly expand. V605 Aquilae, which was discovered in 1919, is the only other star known to have been observed during the high luminosity phase of a very late thermal pulse, and models predict that Sakurai's Object, over the next few decades, will follow a similar life cycle. Sakurai's Object and other similar stars are expected to end up as helium-rich white dwarfs after retracing their evolution track from the \\"born-again\\" giant phase back to the white dwarf cooling track. There are few other suspected \\"born-again\\" objects, one example being FG Sagittae. Having erupted in 1995, it is expected that Sakurai's Object's final helium flash will be the first well-observed one. Observation history Sakurai's Object, by Hilmar Duerbeck, ESO An International Astronomical Union Circular sent on 23 February 1996 announced the discovery of a \\"possible 'slow' nova\\" of magnitude 11.4 by Yukio Sakurai, an amateur astronomer. Japanese astronomer Syuichi Nakano reported the discovery, drawing attention to the fact that the object had not been visible in images from 1993 nor in Harvard‚ÄìSmithsonian Center for Astrophysics records for the years 1930-1951, despite it appearing to slowly brighten over the previous years. Nakano wrote that \\"While the outburst [suggests] a slow or symbiotic nova, the lack of obvious emission lines one year after brightening is very unusual.\\" Following the initial announcement, Hilmar Duerbeck published a study investigating the \\"possible final helium flash\\" seen by Sakurai. In it, they noted that the location of Sakurai's Object corresponded to a faint object detected in 1976 of magnitude 21, and discussed other observations in the years 1994‚Äì1996, by which time the magnitude had increased to around 11‚Äì15. By investigating the measured fluxes, angular diameter, and mass of the nebula, a distance of 5.5 kpc and luminosity of was determined. The researchers noted that this was in agreement with their appearance and model predictions and that the outburst luminosity was in the area of 3100 solar luminosities; lower than predicted by a factor of 3. The first infrared observations were published in 1998, in which both near and far infrared spectroscopy data was presented. The collected data showed Sakurai's Object's steep brightening in 1996, followed by a sharp decline in 1999 as expected. It was later found that the star's steep decline in light was due to the circumstellar dust located around the star, which was present at a temperature of ~680 K. Further infrared data recorded by the United Kingdom Infrared Telescope was published in 2000, in which findings of the changing absorption lines were discussed. Observations from the United Kingdom Infrared Telescope (UKIRT) in 1999 revealed that the star is in a RCB-like phase with the release of dust and huge loss of mass. Since 2005, it has been observed in the ejected particles of Sakurai's Object that photoionization of carbon is taking place. Properties Sakurai's Object is a highly evolved post-asymptotic giant branch star which has, following a brief period on the white dwarf cooling track, undergone a helium shell flash (also known as a very late thermal pulse). The star is thought to have a mass of around . Observations of Sakurai's Object show increasing reddening and pulsing activity, suggesting that the star is exhibiting thermal instability during its final helium-shell flash. Prior to its reignition V4334 Sgr is thought to have been cooling towards a white dwarf with a temperature around 100,000 K and a luminosity around . The luminosity rapidly increased about a hundred-fold and then the temperature decreased to around 10,000 K. The star developed the appearance of an F class supergiant (F2 Ia). The apparent temperature continued to cool to below 6,000 K and the star was gradually obscured at optical wavelengths by the formation of carbon dust, similar to an R CrB star. Since then the temperature has increased to around 20,000 K. The properties of Sakurai's Object are quite similar to that of V605 Aquilae. V605, discovered in 1919, is the only other known star observed during the high luminosity phase of a very late thermal pulse, and Sakurai's Object is modeled to increase in temperature in the next few decades to match the current state of V605. =Dust cloud= During the second half of 1998 an optically thick dust shell obscured Sakurai's Object, causing a rapid decrease in visibility of the star, until in 1999 it disappeared from optical wavelength observations altogether. Infrared observations showed that the dust cloud around the star is primarily carbon in an amorphous form. In 2009 it was discovered that the dust shell is strongly asymmetrical, as a disc with a major axis oriented at an angle of 134¬∞, and inclination of around 75¬∞. The disc is thought to be growing more opaque due to the fast spectral evolution of the source towards lower temperatures. =Planetary nebula= Sakurai's Object is surrounded by a planetary nebula created following the star's red giant phase around 8300 years ago. It has been determined that the nebula has a diameter of 44 arcseconds and expansion velocity of roughly 32 km/s. =Similarities to other stars= Research in 1996 revealed that Sakurai's Object possessed the characteristics of a R Coronae Borealis variable star with the anomaly of Carbon-13 (13C) deficit. Also, the metallicity of Sakurai's object in 1996 was similar to that of V605 Aquilae in 1921. However, it is expected that Sakurai's object will grow in its metallicity to match that of V605 Aquilae. Significance in astronomical research A significant amount of new star formation and star destruction data is expected to be recorded from continued observation of Sakurai's Object, as well as be used as reference data in the future research of similar stars. The reason that stars such as Sakurai's Object and V605 Aquilae exist, as well as experience a shorter lifespan compared to most stars, is largely unknown. Sakurai's Object and V605 Aquilae have been observed experiencing born-again behavior for only 10 years, while FG Sagittae has undergone such behavior for 120 years. It is hypothesized that this is due to Sakurai's Object and V605 Aquilae evolving to the asymptotic giant branch of stars for the first time, while FG Sagittae is undergoing the process a second time.

Culture stocks originate from a collection from Tamil Nadu, India. Like the majority of the Phasmatodea, C. morosus are nocturnal. Culture stocks are parthenogenetic females that can reproduce without mating. There are no reports of males, although in captivity, gynandromorphs (individuals with both female and male characteristics) are sometimes reared. Description Females are elongated and about 80‚Äì100 mm in length, ranging from a light green to a darkish brown in colour. The front legs have red patches at the base of the forelegs, and similar but yellow patches on the mid-legs. Eggs are ovoid and brown, with a beige capitula at one end. When the eggs hatch, the plug opens and dark, tiny, string-like young crawl out of the opening. The eggs are haploid. Behaviour When disturbed, the major defence method is feigning death, the body becoming rigid, and the legs held along the line of the body. They may also be found swaying to mimic the movement of foliage in wind. The insects feed at night, when they are active. During the day, they rest, often with legs in line with the body, on their food plants. Care in captivity C. morosus is easy species to rear, feeding on a number of fresh plants including privet, ivy, spiderwort, bramble, rowan, and lettuce. They must be kept in a cage around 25 cm in height to allow for successful moulting. Females lay eggs shortly after reaching adulthood, at the rate of several per night. These can be hatched by keeping them on a dry paper towel or in a dry dish. Eggs can take four months to hatch, depending on many factors, including temperature. C. morusus is species #1 on the Phasmid Study Group Culture List. Accidental introductions C. morosus in Pennsylvania Due to their inconspicuous nature, accidental introductions of C. morosus have been recorded around the world, including South Africa, Great Britain and the United States, where in some cases they have become a pest. Studies at San Diego Zoo found the introduced species on a large number of ornamental plants.

The Ringwood - Belgrave Rail Trail is a shared use path for cyclists and pedestrians, which follows the Belgrave railway line from the Mullum Mullum Creek Trail in Ringwood to Belgrave railway station in Belgrave, in the outer eastern suburbs of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.VicRoads - Bicycle Facilities Map Melbourne and Geelong's shared paths in Google MapsMelbourne and Geelong's shared paths in Google Earth This trail is known to be a convenient and popular trail as it connects with various other trails in the area as well as being directly serviced by eight railway stations on the Belgrave railway line along its 19.2 km route. An interactive map of the trail as well as others in the Melbourne area is available from the 'External Links' section in this article.  Following the trail  Despite the trail being marked in several publications and on cycle route websites, the trail has minimal directional signage. The following sections describe the route of the trail: = Ringwood - Bayswater = Starting in Ringwood and ending in Belgrave, the trail begins as a turn-off from the Mullum Mullum Creek Trail near the Ringwood Bypass underpass in Ringwood, before the trail travels on a short 250 m section of local streets before a short path goes to the Maroondah Highway / Ringwood Bypass / Mount Dandenong Road intersection. The trail resumes at the south-east corner of this intersection before travelling through Ringwood Lake and crossing the Lilydale railway line before travelling through Bedford Reserve on a sealed access road. The trail now follows Bedford Road east for 170 m, which can be traversed either on-road or via the roadside footpaths and the pedestrian traffic lights outside Ringwood Secondary College. The trail takes a right and runs south down Lena Grove for 360 m before the off-road shared path resumes at the cul-de-sac. The trail now follows the Belgrave railway line on the eastern side until Heathmont railway station, before the trail swaps to the western side of the railway at Canterbury Road. The trail now goes downhill to H.E. Parker reserve in Heathmont. Using the reserve access road heading south, a left turn at the footbridge over the Dandenong Creek takes you to the Dandenong Creek Trail. At this point, the Ringwood - Belgrave Rail Trail and the Dandenong Creek Trail share the same path for 835 m east before the trails branch off from each other. A right turn immediately after the tunnel under the railway then takes you south along the eastern side of the railway line towards Mountain Highway and Bayswater railway station. = Bayswater - Upper Ferntree Gully = Around Bayswater railway station, the trail runs past the bus stops and the station car park, which usually creates a congested environment with many pedestrian and vehicular movements, so care needs to be taken when traversing this section. The Department of Transport is currently (2008) working with Knox City Council on an alternative route through the station car park. The trail then continues on the western side of the railway until Bayswater Road, where the trail then switches back to the eastern side. The trail then travels uninterrupted to Boronia railway station where the user has to cautiously navigate through the Boronia Junction Shopping Centre car park to reach the Boronia Road / Dorset road intersection. The trail resumes on the south-east corner of the intersection, where it once again follows the railway on the eastern side. The turn-off for the Blind Creek Trail is encountered halfway between Boronia and Ferntree Gully. Once reaching Ferntree Gully railway station, the trail travels through the station car park to the level crossing, where the trail resumes. After crossing at the Alpine Street / Station Street / The Avenue intersection, the trail continues south on the western side of the railway, with a scenic footbridge over Forest Road before the trail arrives at pedestrian traffic lights at Burwood Highway in Upper Ferntree Gully. A short 400 m shared use path takes the user to the entrance to Upper Ferntree Gully railway station while crossing at the traffic lights takes you further along the trail. = Upper Ferntree Gully - Belgrave = The trail now travels south on a shared use path alongside Forest Oak Drive before arriving at the turn-off for the Ferny Creek Trail. A left turn then takes you east through the area immediately south of Upper Ferntree Gully. Most of this section runs along shared-use paths alongside local streets. Upon reaching the railway bridge over Burwood Highway, the trail runs east alongside native trees and shrubs between the northern side of the railway and the southern side of Burwood Highway. This takes the user to Upwey and Upwey railway station. Staying on the northern side of the railway, the trail continues to run alongside Burwood Highway until Glenfern Road, where the trail leaves the highway and follows the railway once again until arriving at the end of Campbell street in Tecoma. A 130 m trip along Campbell Street and a right turn down McNicol Road leads to an immediate right turn to Tecoma railway station while an immediate left turn is where the trail continues. A short trip down this final section of shared use path leads to the back of the Belgrave strip shops where a short 220 m on-road trip down Blacksmiths Way east leads to the entrance to Belgrave railway station, where the trail finishes.  Connections  Travelling downhill, from south to north, the Ferny Creek Trail is encountered first, then the Blind Creek Trail, then the Dandenong Creek Trail and finally the upper Mullum Mullum Creek Trail.

Even though they have retained the name \\"Amish\\" they are quite different from the common idea of Amish: they do not use horse and buggy for transportation, with a few exceptions they do not speak Pennsylvania German anymore, nor do they have restrictions on technology except for radio and television. In the years 1946 to 1977 a majority was transformed into an evangelical revivalist denomination.http://www.gameo.org/encyclopedia/contents/B435ME.html Beachy Amish Mennonite Fellowship in Global Anabaptist Mennonite Encyclopedia The traditionalists who wanted to preserve the old Beachy Amish ways then withdrew and formed their own congregations. Today they are known as Midwest Beachy Amish Mennonites or Old Beachy Amish.Midwest Beachy Amish Mennonite Church in Global Anabaptist Mennonite Encyclopedia online] They form a loose association of churches without a central governing body; therefore, few common characteristics are shared by all Beachy congregations. Some similarities include adhering to the Dordrecht Confession of Faith and practicing varying degrees of Anabaptist practice, such as nonresistance, separation from the state, and adult baptism.  History  The Beachy church arose from a 1927 division in the (Casselman) River Old Order Amish congregation in Somerset County, Pennsylvania.Elmer S. Yoder: The Beachy Amish Mennonite Fellowship Churches. Hartville, OH 1987. Bishop Moses M. Beachy led the congregation during that time and his name became associated with the faction. The Beachys favored a milder discipline for members whose only offense was transferring membership to other Anabaptist churches, specifically the conservative Amish Mennonite congregation that broke from Moses Beachy's congregation (then not under Beachy's leadership) in 1895.For a detailed discussion of the 1927 split and its history, see http://www.beachyam.org/librarybooks/BeachyAJThesis.pdf . The author, Alvin J. Beachy (1913-1986), was Moses' eleventh child. The Beachy Amish were transformed at mid-20th century into a more evangelical group by both the incorporation of revivalist Amish who had left their original churches and joined the Beachy Amish and by a growing revivalist influence within the Beachys. One especially influential man in Lancaster County was an Amish (and later Beachy Amish) evangelist from Oklahoma, David A. Miller. Through his and other revivalist influences an Amish youth group evolved known as the \\"Goodies\\" due to their emphasis on a renewed spiritual life and avoiding the period of rumspringa as experienced in many Amish youth groups. Many of the \\"Goodies\\" eventually joined the Beachy Amish community in Lancaster County.  Distinctives  In contrast to the Old Order Amish, the Beachys have meetinghouses, Sunday School, and a Bible School for young adults, and most also support missionary work. Excommunication is used less frequently and accompanying bans are even rarer. Most Beachy churches today more closely resemble the Conservative Mennonites (which see for fuller discussion of beliefs/distinctive under that entry) rather than the Old Order Amish. The practices and lifestyle still similar to the Old Order Amish include: * Women wear head covering * Married men have beards in most congregations * Television and radio are forbidden Practices that distinguish the Beachy church from the Old Order Amish include: * Filtered Internet is permitted by most congregations * Men wear ready-made clothing * Ownership of personal automobiles.  Population and distribution  In 2006, there were 11,487 Beachy members in 207 churches, with the highest representation in Pennsylvania, Indiana and Ohio. International Beachy churches or mission work can be found in El Salvador, Belize, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Paraguay, Ireland,\\"http://www.irishcentral.com/news/Did-you-know-Ireland-has-an-Amish- community.html Ukraine, Romania, Kenya, Australia, and Canada.

The electron beam is usually provided by a scanning electron microscope, which results in high spatial accuracy (potentially below one nanometer) and the possibility to produce free-standing, three-dimensional structures.  Process  Schematic of the EBID process EBID setup The focused electron beam of a scanning electron microscope (SEM) or scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) is commonly used. Another method is ion-beam- induced deposition (IBID), where a focused ion beam is applied instead. Precursor materials are typically liquid or solid and gasified prior to deposition, usually through vaporization or sublimation, and introduced, at accurately controlled rate, into the high-vacuum chamber of the electron microscope. Alternatively, solid precursors can be sublimated by the electron beam itself. When deposition occurs at a high temperature or involves corrosive gases, a specially designed deposition chamber is used; it is isolated from the microscope, and the beam is introduced into it through a micrometre-sized orifice. The small orifice size maintains differential pressure in the microscope (vacuum) and deposition chamber (no vacuum). Such deposition mode has been used for EBID of diamond. In the presence of the precursor gas, the electron beam is scanned over the substrate, resulting in deposition of material. The scanning is usually computer-controlled. The deposition rate depends on a variety of processing parameters, such as the partial precursor pressure, substrate temperature, electron beam parameters, applied current density, etc. It usually is in the order of 10 nm/s. Deposition mechanism Primary electron energies in SEMs or STEMs are usually between 10 and 300 keV, where reactions induced by electron impact, i.e. precursor dissociation, have a relatively low cross section. The majority of decomposition occurs via low energy electron impact: either by low energy secondary electrons, which cross the substrate-vacuum interface and contribute to the total current density, or inelastically scattered (backscattered) electrons. Spatial resolution Primary S(T)EM electrons can be focused into spots as small as ~0.045 nm. While the smallest structures deposited so far by EBID are point deposits of ~0.7 nm diameter., deposits usually have a larger lateral size than the beam spot size. The reason are the so-called proximity effects, meaning that secondary, backscattered and forward scattered (if the beam dwells on already deposited material) electrons contribute to the deposition. As these electrons can leave the substrate up to several microns away from the point of impact of the electron beam (depending on its energy), material deposition is not necessarily confined to the irradiated spot. To overcome this problem, compensation algorithms can be applied, which is typical for electron beam lithography. Materials and precursors As of 2008 the range of materials deposited by EBID included Al, Au, amorphous carbon, diamond, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, GaAs, GaN, Ge, Mo, Nb, Ni, Os, Pd, Pt, Rh, Ru, Re, Si, Si3N4, SiOx, TiOx, W, and was being expanded. The limiting factor is the availability of appropriate precursors, gaseous or having a low sublimation temperature. The most popular precursors for deposition of elemental solids are metal carbonyls of Me(CO)x structure or metallocenes. They are easily available, however, due to incorporation of carbon atoms from the CO ligands, deposits often exhibit a low metal content. Metal-halogen complexes (WF6, etc.) result in cleaner deposition, but are more difficult to handle as they are toxic and corrosive. Compound materials are deposited from specially crafted, exotic gases, e.g. D2GaN3 for GaN. Advantages *Very flexible regarding deposit shape and composition; the electron beam is lithographically controlled and a multitude of potential precursors is available *Lateral size of the produced structures and accuracy of deposition are unprecedented *The deposited material can be characterized using the electron microscopy techniques (TEM, EELS, EDS, electron diffraction) during or right after deposition. In situ electrical and optical characterization is also possible. Disadvantages *Serial material deposition and low deposition rates in general limit throughput and thus mass production *Controlling the elemental or chemical deposit composition is still a major challenge, as the precursor decomposition pathways are mostly unknown *Proximity effects can lead to unintended structure broadening Ion-beam-induced deposition Ion-beam- induced deposition (IBID) is very similar to EBID with the major difference that focused ion beam, usually 30 keV Ga+, is used instead of the electron beam. In both techniques, it is not the primary beam, but secondary electrons which cause the deposition. IBID has the following disadvantages as compared to EBID: *Angular spread of secondary electrons is larger in IBID thus resulting in lower spatial resolution. *Ga+ ions introduce additional contamination and radiation damage to the deposited structure, which is important for electronic applications. *Deposition occurs in a focused ion beam (FIB) setup, which strongly limits characterization of the deposit during or right after the deposition. Only SEM-like imaging using secondary electrons is possible, and even that imaging is restricted to short observations due to sample damaging by the Ga+ beam. The use of a dual beam instrument, that combines a FIB and an SEM in one, circumvents this limitation. The advantages of IBID are: *Much higher deposition rate *Higher purity Shapes Nanostructures of virtually any 3-dimensional shape can be deposited using computer-controlled scanning of electron beam. Only the starting point has to be attached to the substrate, the rest of the structure can be free standing. The achieved shapes and devices are remarkable: *World smallest magnet *Fractal nanotrees *Nanoloops (potential nanoSQUID device) *Superconducting nanowires IBID human growth.jpgSnapshots of growing a doll-like nanostructure by IBID IBID bacteriophage.jpgA model of bacteriophage grown by IBID IBID tower.jpgA model of Leaning Tower of Pisa grown by IBID EBIDloop.JPGLetter Œ¶ grown by EBID See also * Electron microscopy * Focused ion beam * Metal carbonyl * Metallocene * Organometallic chemistry * Scanning electron microscope * Scanning transmission electron microscopy * Transmission electron microscopy * Researcher : Lisa McElwee-White  References  External links * \\"Nanofabrication: Fundamentals and Applications\\" Ed.: Ampere A.

Conotton Creek is a tributary of the Ohio River via the Tuscarawas River and the Muskingum River. Mineral City is the only incorporated town within the Huff Run Watershed. The mouth of the stream is at 875 feet altitude. Dover Dam ,GNIS Entry Dover Dam downstream on the Tuscarawas River, is normally dry, but can inundate this waterway to a pool elevation of 916 feet for downstream flood control by the Corps of Engineers.MWCD Lake Levels This can cause flooding and closure of Route 800 south of Mineral City and other roads out of the village. The stream gauge south of Mineral City is at 886.98 feet, and is rendered inoperable when reservoir elevation exceeds that. History The first recognized settler of Sandy Township was Godfrey Huff, who Huff Run was named after. Records show that he was from Bedford County, Pennsylvania. In May 1805 he purchased a tract of 1,000 acres (4 km¬≤) in the southwest corner of the third quarter of Township 10, Range 1, or the southwest corner of Sandy Township, embracing also the corner of Lawrence across the river from Godfrey Haga, for $1,062.50. Old settlers have assigned the year 1803 as the date of his emigration to this tract, but historical societies have found evidence that he was here in 1801. Mr. Huff was a man of large frame, and wore the broad-brimmed hat and the garb of the Dunkard Brethren church, of which he was a member. He is said to have raised many hogs on the river bottoms, driven them to Detroit, Michigan for sale, and used the proceeds to pay for his land. He had five sons‚ÄîMichael, Henry, Samuel, Frederick and Andrew. Most of the boys subsequently emigrated to Iowa. Godfrey Huff died in Sandy Township about 1825. See Native American History and additional early settlement history at the Tuscarawas County Wikipedia entry. Pollution Huff Run has been badly affected by acid mine drainage (AMD) as well as illegal open dumping, raw sewage entering the stream due to improperly maintained septic systems and sewer systems, poor riparian buffer zones, some poor agriculture land management practices and over extraction of oil and gas within the watershed. The Huff Run Watershed Restoration Partnership , sponsored by Rural Action , has been working since 1996 to address water quality issues in the Huff Run watershed. As of 2009, the partnership had received and spent about 6.2 million dollars in state and federal grant money to reduce the impact of acid mine drainage on the watershed. They currently oversee the development and management of over 16 major acid mine drainage reclamation projects.

It is a common, worldwide pest of grain and grain products as well as chocolate, drugs, and tobacco. The species's binomial name, meaning \\"rice-lover from Surinam,\\" was coined by Carl Linnaeus, who received specimens of the beetle from Surinam. Description and Identification O. surinamensis is a slender, dark brown beetle 2.4‚Äì3 mm in size, with characteristic \\"teeth\\" running down the side of the prothorax. It is nearly identical to Oryzaephilus mercator, or the Merchant Grain Beetle, however, O. surinamensis has smaller eyes and a broader, more triangular head; O. surinamensis unlike O. mercator are unable to fly. Distribution O. surinamensis can be found worldwide. The beetle is one of the most commonly encountered stored product pests and is widespread within the food industry and can be found in food manufacturing, storage, and retail facilities, as well as in home pantries. O. surinamensis is less common in colder climates such as Canada and the Northern United States Life Cycle =Eggs= A female can produce 43-285 eggs in their six to ten month average lifespan which are deposited on a food mass. The ideal temperature range for larvae development within eggs is about 27-29¬∞C (80-85¬∞F), under such conditions they hatch in three to five days. =Larvae= Larvae are yellow-white with brown heads and grow up to 3mm. They crawl freely around the food mass and feed on broken pieces of grain or grain kernels damaged by other insects, larger larvae may bore into kernels. Larvae account for the majority of damage done to grain. Larvae molt two to four times before pupation =Pupae= Larvae pupate by constructing cocoon-like coverings using broken pieces of grain. Emergence as adults occurs after about one week =Adults= Adults can live on average six to ten months, though they can live as long as three years. The total life cycle is 27 ‚Äì 51 days at . Adults seek out new sources of food for breeding. In areas which have severe infestations of O. surinamensis adults have been reported to nibble on the skin of people, however, these bites are not harmful. Role as a Stored Product Pest and Control of Infestations O. surinamensis is one of the most commonly encountered insects in grain, pet foods, and seeds. Feeding results in shrinkage of the dry mass of the infested product and in increased water content due to the metabolic activity of the insects which can result in mold growth. In grain, insect damage decreases value and can make it unfit for use; sufficient numbers of insect fragments or live insects can result in rejection by the purchaser. In the home, infestations can be avoided by storing dried food products in sealed containers. To control already present infestations, the infested material needs to be identified and disposed of, or frozen- as all life stages of the beetle can be killed by being frozen for six days. In food processing operations and warehouses other means of control may be necessary and fumigation is commonly used, in large-scale grain storage operations a pesticide application may be needed for storage over six months. Fumigation is commonly used to control stored product pests in food and grain, this involves the treatment of product with gasses which are able to diffuse throughout the treated area. The gasses used in fumigation (most often phosphine) are highly toxic to both insects and mammals (including humans) but when applied properly, no fumigant will remain in product after treatment is complete. Because of the high toxicity of fumigants, their use is restricted to qualified applicators and areas which can be tightly sealed.

The change in pH is especially pronounced with acidic fluid losses caused by problems like vomiting. Pathophysiology There are several possible explanations for the process of alkalosis observed after volume contraction. One popular theory is that alkalosis is simply the loss of solvent volume without a proportional loss in bicarbonate concentration or increase in carbon dioxide concentration. This explanation may be especially appropriate for the very short term after volume loss. Another suggests that the alkalosis is due to renal compensatory mechanisms used to correct volume loss. Extracellular fluid (ECF) volume contraction is associated with decreased blood volume and decreased renal perfusion pressure. Three compensation mechanisms engage as a result: # renin secretion is increased, # production of angiotensin II is increased, and # secretion of aldosterone is increased. Increases in angiotensin II cause increased Na+‚ÄìH+ exchange in the proximal tubule and increased HCO3‚àí (bicarbonate) reabsorption in the proximal tubule due to increased luminal H+. Increased aldosterone secretion stimulates the H-ATPase of alpha-intercalated cells of the collecting duct, which causes 1) increased distal tubule H+ secretion, worsening the metabolic alkalosis, and 2) increased generation of \\"new\\" bicarbonate within these same cells, which will be reabsorbed. Additionally, increased aldosterone secretion causes increased collecting duct K+ secretion, in turn causing the hypokalemia seen with contraction alkalosis. Finally, it has been suggested that the term \\"contraction alkalosis\\" is actually a misnomer, and that the alkalosis observed during volume contraction is actually attributable entirely to chloride depletion, which leads to a failure of pendrin, a chloride/bicarbonate exchanger in the collecting duct. Diagnosis Diagnosis of contraction alkalosis is made by correlating laboratory data with clinical history and examination. Metabolic alkalosis in the presence of decreased effective circulatory volume, loop diuretic use, or other causes of intravascular depletion such as profound diarrhea should raise suspicion for contraction alkalosis as a likely etiology in the absence of other causes. Treatment Treatment consists of NaCl infusion to correct ECF volume contraction and administration of K+ to replace urinary losses.

He joined the company just after its founding in 1983 and stepped down in 2011. He frequently speaks on topics including sustainability, organic agriculture and the profitability of green business. In 2011, Hirshberg was mentioned as a possible Democratic candidate for the U.S. Senate against New Hampshire's junior U.S. Senator John E. Sununu. Early life and education Hirshberg was born in Manchester, New Hampshire in 1954. Hirshberg was one of the first graduates of Hampshire College in Amherst, Massachusetts in 1976. He was also one of the first graduates of The Derryfield School in Manchester, New Hampshire. Work history In his early career, Hirshberg served as the Executive Director of The New Alchemy Institute, a research and education center dedicated to organic farming, aquaculture and renewable energy. He also held positions ranging from water pumping windmill specialist, to environmental educator with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. In 1983, Hirshberg joined the Board of The Rural Education Center (TREC), a small, seven-cow organic farming school in Wilton, NH from which Stonyfield was born. Hirshberg led Stonyfield from its infancy to $360 million in annual sales when he stepped down as CE-Yo at the end of 2011. Under Hirshberg's reign, Stonyfield launched many innovative marketing programs aimed not only at growing customer loyalty to the brand but also in building public interest in sustainability, the environment, and small family farming. In 1989, the Adopt-a-Cow Program (which was later renamed to the Have-a-Cow Educational Program), allowed frequent customers to \\"adopt\\" their own cow, learning about the value of small family farms in the process. Participants would receive a photo of their sponsored Stonyfield cow, updates about life on the farm and issues small farmers faced, as well as information about sustainable farming methods. Although originally envisioned as a one- cow-one-parent model, each cow ended up with multiple sponsors just weeks after the program launched due to its instant popularity. Other Stonyfield programs include Profits for the Planet, by which Stonyfield donated 10% of their profits annually through grants to various environmentally focused non- profit organizations and Salute Your Commute, a program designed encouraged consumers to use alternative modes of transportation to help reduce carbon emissions. During Hirshberg's tenure, Stonyfield enjoyed a compounded annual growth rate of over 23% by consistently producing superior products and using innovative marketing that blended the company's social, environmental, and financial missions. Hirshberg arranged the sale of Stonyfield to Danone in 2001, and stayed on as CEO for an additional 10 years, naming former Ben & Jerry's CEO Walt Freese as his successor in January 2012. At that time, Hirshberg moved into the role of Chairman and also became the Managing Director of Stonyfield Europe, launching organic brands in France, Ireland, Italy and Spain. He resigned from his Danone responsibilities in March 2017 when Danone was required by the US Dept of Justice to divest its Stonyfield holdings. Hirshberg remains Stonyfield's Chair under the new ownership, Lactalis.  Activities  Hirshberg serves on several corporate and non- profit boards including Blue Apron, Inc. (NYSE- APRN), Forager Project (organic plant-based dairy alternatives), Late July Snacks (organic salty snacks), Orgain (organic protein drinks and powders), Peak Organic Brewing, sweetgreen (national organic and natural fast casual restaurant chain), Sweet Earth Natural Foods (organic and natural vegan and vegetarian entrees), and Unreal (producer of organic and non-gmo candy), as well as on the Advisory Board of Applegate (organic meats). He was also the chairman and co-founder of O'Naturals, a chain of fast food restaurants. Outside the corporate world, Hirshberg is Chairman and a founding Partner of Just Label It, the national campaign to label genetically engineered foods. He is also the Chairman of Organic Voices, a consortium that seeks to eliminate consumer confusion about the benefits of organic. In March, 2011, President Obama appointed Hirshberg to serve on the Advisory Committee for Trade Policy and Negotiations, where he served from 2011 until February 2017. Publications Hirshberg is the author of the 2008 book, Stirring it Up: How to Make Money and Save the World, a book about socially-minded business that calls on individuals to realize their power to make a difference in the marketplace, while doing business in ways that adhere to a multiple bottom line - one that takes into consideration not only finance, but the environment and health as well. *Label it Now: What You Need to Know About Genetically Engineered Foods, co-author, eBook, New Word City, Inc. 2012 *Anything But Neutral About Going (Carbon) Neutral, eBook, New Word City, Inc. 2011 *Stirring it Up: How to Make Money and Save the World.

The Review balances the interests of academia with pragmatic issues important to practicing attorneys and judges. The Review publishes on topics related to procedure, evidence, trial, and appellate advocacy, alternative dispute resolution, and often-litigated substantive law. Published articles not only address issues pertinent to litigation practice, but also comment on substantive and theoretical aspects of the law. The Review annually publishes four issues including articles written by lawyers, judges or practitioners, and student notes written by staff members on The Review. These articles are routinely cited in published court opinions. In fact, The Review is the third most cited student-edited, specialty journal in the country and the most cited student-edited, civil litigation and dispute resolution journal in the country according to the Washington & Lee Law School Survey of published court decisions. In 2011, the U.S. Supreme Court cited one of its articles. The subscription base includes judges, academics, corporations, firms, libraries, and sole-practitioners ‚Äì more from outside of Texas, than within the state. 2014 marks the 34th year of publication of The Review. Past authors reflect both the diversity of the readership and the subject areas covered. Recently, The Review has published articles by professors, federal judges, and practitioners covering topics from fiduciary duty to homeland security. The Review organizes and hosts a symposium every year on an emerging legal topic or a changing aspect of the law. These symposia are attended by practitioners, judges, academics, and students. Past symposium topics include products liability, ethics and mass torts, conflicts of interest, medical and health care litigation, the Americans with Disabilities Act, and the modern jury trial. Past speakers include Edward C. Prado (Judge, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit), Patrick E. Higginbotham (Judge, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit), and Scott A. Brister (Justice, The Supreme Court of Texas). The Review solicits articles for publication year-round, especially articles that focus on arguments, issues, and points of view that have not yet received national attention, but would be helpful to attorneys throughout the country. The full text of the articles and notes is available in many law libraries, on HeinOnline, on Westlaw and on LexisNexis.

He was the maternal grandfather of Sadako Ogata, the former United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees from 1991‚Äì2001. Biography Yoshizawa was a native of what is now part of Joetsu city, Niigata Prefecture. He was a graduate of the English literature department of the Tokyo Imperial University and entered the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in 1899. He was assigned to the Japanese consulate in Amoy, China in 1902, and later to the consulate in Shanghai. In 1905, Yoshizawa married the eldest daughter of politician (and future Prime Minister) Tsuyoshi Inukai, and moved to London. He continued to live in England for the next several years, eventually becoming First Secretary to the Japanese embassy. He was given the post of Consul-General in Hankou, China in 1912. Diplomatic career Yoshizawa served as Minister to China from 1923‚Äì1929, and was stationed at the Japanese consulates at Beijing and Tianjin. He met with Soviet Foreign Minister Lev Karakhan in Beijing in 1925 for talks which led to the formal establishment of diplomatic relations between Japan and the Soviet Union per the Soviet‚ÄìJapanese Basic Convention. Yoshizawa later served as Japanese ambassador to France and official representative to the League of Nations. He was appointed to the cabinet of Prime Minister Inukai Tsuyoshi as Foreign Minister from 14 January 1932 to 26 May 1932. On receiving word of his appointment, Yoshizawa traveled from Europe back to Japan via the Trans- Siberian Railway and Manchuria to see conditions first-hand. Following the assassination of Inukai in the May 15 Incident, the Inukai cabinet was dissolved. However, Yoshizawa received an appointment to the House of Peers (present day House of Councillors) by command of Emperor Sh≈çwa, and joined the Rikken Seiy≈´kai political party. In the period immediately prior to the start of the Pacific War, Yoshizawa was appointed as a special envoy by Prime Minister Fumimaro Konoe to the Netherlands East Indies following the diplomatic mission of Ichizo Kobayashi. Yoshizawa was assigned to present a new set of demands on the Dutch government in Batavia, which were deliberately intended to be unacceptable. > *Adherence to Japan's vision and policy in South East Asia, *Unrestricted > rights to explore and exploit minerals all over the Dutch East Indies > *Unrestricted fishing and shipping rights in all the waters of the Dutch > East Indies *Unrestricted rights to start all sorts of commercial > enterprises *Japans export to the Dutch East Indies must be increased to > more than 80% of all imports of the Dutch East Indies *The existing demand > for oil was slightly increased to 3,800,000 tons *The Dutch East Indies was > to supply Japan with 1,000,000 tons of tin, 400,000 tons of bauxite, 180,000 > tons of nickel, 30,000 tons of rubber, 30,000 tons of coconut oil and 10,000 > tons of sugar. *Airline and telegraph connections between Japan and the > Dutch East Indies In December 1940, Yoshizawa was met by Hubertus Johannes van Mook, deputy minister of Economic Affairs, K. L. J. Enthoven, director of Justice, and Hoessein Djajadiningrat, director of Education and Religion. The negotiations dragged on unsuccessfully, and on 11 June 1941, the Liaison Meeting of the Imperial General Headquarters and Government decided to recall Yoshizawa and terminate the talks.The 29th Imperial General Headquarters and Government Liaison Conference. 11 June 1941. Japan Center for Asian Historical Records Yoshizawa suddenly announced to the Dutch his plan to depart and asked to be received by the Dutch Governor-General A. W. L. Tjarda van Starkenborgh Stachouwer on 17 June 1941. The latter was worried that he might receive a declaration of war, but to his relief Yoshizawa only handed him a draft declaration stating that the negotiations had ended without an agreement. From 1941‚Äì1944, Yoshizawa served as Japanese ambassador to French Indochina. The posting was mostly symbolic, as by then mostly under Japanese military occupation. In August 1945, he became a member of the Privy Council. After the end of World War II, the surrender of Japan, Yoshizawa was purged from public office by the American occupation authorities. In post-war Japan, he was appointed as Japanese ambassador to the Republic of China on Taiwan in 1952. He retired from public life in December 1956.

Life and work Power was born in Harpenden, England, in 1959. He studied Fine Art at Brighton Polytechnic (1978‚Äì1981), and then travelled extensively, discovering a love for photography along the way. Upon his return, he worked as a freelance for several UK publications and charities. Power happened to be in Berlin on 9 November 1989 and photographed the fall of the Berlin Wall. He later published the photographs in the book Die Mauer ist Weg! (2014). Between 1992 and 1996, he embarked on The Shipping Forecast -- a project that involved travelling to and photographing all 31 areas covered by the Shipping Forecast broadcast on BBC Radio 4. This project was published as a book and was a touring exhibition across the UK and France. He used a Volkswagen campervan as his mode of transport for the project, echoing the late Tony Ray-Jones, whose work has similarities in style and meaning to Power's. Between 1997 and 2000, Power was commissioned to document the Millennium Dome in London, a project that resulted in another touring exhibition and the accompanying book, Superstructure.British Arts Council Mark Power: The Millennium Dome Around this time his technical methods changed and he began to use colour film and a large format camera. This was followed by The Treasury Project, published in 2002, which recorded the renovation of the UK government's treasury building on Whitehall, London. In 2003, he undertook another personal project, using the London A-Z map as inspiration.

Inspired by M√§dchen in Uniform, it tells the story of a boarding school student who falls in love with her teacher. Plot Annabelle Tillman, the worldly and emotionally mature 17 year-old daughter of a senator, is sent to Saint Theresa Catholic boarding school after being expelled from two previous schools. Simone Bradley, a poetry teacher at the school, is in charge of her dormitory. Annabelle shares the dormitory with an amiable classmate, Kristen. She also shares her room with Catherine, who tends to bully people, and Colins, a student with a nervous disposition. Simone is a dependable and respectable teacher who occasionally bends the rules out of concern for her students. Her personal life is synonymous with abiding by the conventions of society and her religion. Annabelle is her antiagent, with unrestrained behavior, unconventional choices and outright defiance of authority. Annabelle receives a stern rebuke from the principal, Mother Immaculata, for audaciously flaunting her Buddhist prayer beads. Simone is given the responsibility of controlling her. At first, Simone requests that the principal move Annabelle to another dormitory but soon notices her maturity and sensitivity and convinces her to comply with the school regulations. In the process Annabelle falls in love with Simone. Simone ignores Annabelle's delicate overtures until they are left alone at the school during spring break. Simone takes Annabelle on a day trip to her beach house, where Annabelle discovers painful details about Simone's past. Annabelle holds Simone tightly in her arms as Simone breaks down and a deep emotional connection is established between them. Simone struggles within herself to resist Annabelle, but is eventually moved by her relentless pursuit. At the annual school dance, Annabelle goes up on stage with her guitar and sings a song she wrote for Simone. Simone runs outside, but Annabelle catches up with her. They kiss, then go to Simone's room and make love. The next morning, when Colins wonders were Annabelle was because she did not spend the night in her room, Catherine suspects what happened and out of spite tells Mother Immaculata to check on Annabelle and Simone. The clock alarm had not gone off and as they rush to get dressed, Mother Immaculata walks in on them and orders Simone to come to her office immediately. Upon being questioned if she had thought about the consequences beforehand, Simone admits that she loves Annabelle. Police detectives arrest Simone (for statutory rape or a similar crime) and just as she is leaving, Annabelle places her most prized possession ‚Äî the Buddhist prayer beads ‚Äî in Simone's hand. Annabelle, inside Simone's room, tearfully looks at the photographs taken by her at the beach house, as Simone is driven away, gazing serenely out the car window. The film ends quoting Rainer Maria Rilke: \\"For one human being to love another that is perhaps the most difficult of all our tasks...the work for which all other work is but preparation.\\" Cast * Erin Kelly as Annabelle Tillman, an openly lesbian young woman in love with her teacher, Simone Bradley * Diane Gaidry as Simone Bradley, a closeted lesbian teacher who falls in love with her student, Annabelle * Laura Breckenridge as Colins, a troubled girl who becomes Annabelle's friend * Michelle Horn as Kristen, Catherine's best friend * Gustine Fudickar as Catherine (\\"Cat\\"), a student who bullies her fellow pupils, especially Colins * Ilene Graff as Mother Immaculata, Simone's aunt and school principal * Markus Flanagan as Michael, Simone's ex-boyfriend * Kevin McCarthy as Father Harris, the school priest Filming The school scenes were filmed at Marymount High School in Los Angeles, California.

All three species belong to the family Ptinidae. L. serricorne is around 2‚Äì3 mm long, and brown in colour. The beetles, which can fly, live 2‚Äì6 weeks and do not feed as adults. They can be distinguished from A. punctatum by the fact that A. punctatum has a thorax with a pronounced \\"humped\\" shape. S. paniceum and L. serricorne have thoraces which have a much less obtuse looking angle when viewed from the side compared to A. punctatum, and thus could be difficult to tell apart. However S. paniceum has a distinct three- segmented \\"club\\" at the end of each antenna whereas L. serricorne has uniformly serrated antennae of 11 segments. L. serricorne also has much weaker punctures on the surface of the wing covers (elytra) than the other two species. As indicated by its common name, the cigarette beetle is a pest of tobacco, both in the refined cigarette packet presentation and also as stored in hogsheads and bales, but is also a minor pest of oilcake, oilseeds, cereals, dried fruit, sage, flour, and some animal products. The female beetle lays around 100 eggs loosely on the substrate to be fed upon. The larvae are active and will move around on and bore into the product, feeding as they go. The complete life cycle takes 26 days at 37 ¬∞C and 120 days at 20 ¬∞C. L. serricorne cannot tolerate the cold; adults die within 6 days at 4 ¬∞C, and eggs survive 5 days at 0‚Äì5 ¬∞C. The beetles carry a symbiotic yeast, Symbiotaphrina kochii, that is transmitted to the next generation superficially on the eggs and carried internally in larvae and adults in the mycetome, a specialized organ that is linked to the gut. The yeast cells assist in the digestion of less nutritious foods, supply needed B-vitamins and sterols, and provide resistance to certain toxins. Control in commercial/industrial settings several views Insect monitoring traps are available for L. serricorne, which contain specific pheromones to attract male beetles, and help detect and monitor infestations. Infested bulk tobacco in the form of bales or hogsheads can be fumigated using methyl bromide or phosphine. Dosage rates and treatment times with methyl bromide are 20 grams/m3 at 21 ¬∞C above and 32 grams/m3 for 48‚Äì72 hours at 7‚Äì20 ¬∞C. Methyl bromide is not recommended for cigar tobacco since it can produce off odours in the product. With phosphine dosage rates are one gram of phosphine (equivalent to a 3-gram table) per m3 for 5 days at 12‚Äì15 ¬∞C and 4 days at 16‚Äì20 ¬∞C and 3 days above 20 ¬∞C. For localised or household-level infestations the preferred control measure is to find the infested product, dispose of it, and treat around the area with a residual insecticide such as cypermethrin to kill off any remaining beetles.

Biography Julian Movchan Born in the village of Zorokiv to a family of well-to-do peasants, in the Cherniakhiv region of what is now the Zhytomyr Oblast, his works first appeared in the local oblast newspaper Radianska Volyn when he was fourteen years old. Movchan moved to Zhytomyr to pursue secondary school but, due to his family's persecution as kurkuls, left for Kharkiv, Ukraine's capital at the time where he began a new life. Escaping the ravages of the famine that engulfed most of rural Ukraine, Julian Movchan worked in a factory while editing its newspaper. At this time, he completed his education at an institute for journalism. However, disappointed with increasing censorship of the 1930s and unwilling for moral reasons to join the communist party, Movchan abandoned his career in journalism and entered medical school. When the Soviet Army occupied western Ukraine in 1939, he transferred his studies to Lviv. During the subsequent German occupation, he resumed his journalistic work, denouncing the Stalinist regime. During this time he also treated wounded soldiers of the UPA when they were smuggled into the city. When the Soviets returned, he fled westward and completed his medical studies in Munich. In 1949, he moved to America, eventually settling outside Cleveland, Ohio. He married, and had two children and four grandchildren. After leaving Ukraine Movchan befriended Volodymyr Vynnychenko, the exiled president of Ukraine. The two had much in common: they were both eastern Ukrainian writers of humble origins with a left-wing but anti-Soviet patriotic Ukrainian political orientation. After Vynnychenko's death, Movchan was invited by his widow to move to France and serve as caretaker of Vynnychenko's archives. Movchan declined, but donated many of Vynnychenko's letters to the archives at Columbia University. Movchan continued to write until his death in January 2002. Writings While maintaining a medical practice in the United States, Movchan was a prolific writer, with over 1,800 published articles or letters, primarily but not exclusively in Ukrainian diaspora newspapers. Some of the many journals and newspapers that have included his articles and letters have included: the historically most important Ukrainian diaspora newspaper Svoboda ; Homin Ukrayiny ; Narodnia Volia (newspaper of Ukrainian Social Revolutionaries); Novi Dni ; Novoye Russkoye Slovo , and The Militant. Movchan primarily wrote on political and health-care related issues. He also wrote several books, including: *Doctor's Notes (–ó–∞–ø–∏—Å–∫–∏ –õi–∫–∞—Ä–∏—è), Toronto, (1966).

Life Carlo Gaetano Calosirto was born on 15 August 1654 on the island of Ischia off the coast of Naples. He entered the Order of Friars Minor in Naples before he turned sixteen and assumed the religious name of \\"John Joseph of the Cross\\". He was the first Italian to follow the reform movement of Saint Peter of Alcantara. In 1674 he was sent to found a convent for the order at Afila in Piedmont and assisted in the actual construction itself. He was ordained to the priesthood - much against his will it should be noted - and as the superior performed the lowliest tasks. In 1702 the Italian convents were no longer dependent on the Spanish houses but were formed into a separate province. He was appointed as the Vicar Provincial of the Alcantarine Reform in the Italian peninsula as a result of this. As the superior he ordered that no beggar should be dismissed from the convent gate without some form of relief: in times of need he devoted to their necessities his own portions and even that of the convent he lived at. When he trekked across the mainland as the provincial he would not make himself known at the inns where he lodged because he disliked distinction and did not believe such should be paid to him. He desired those whom he restored to health to take some certain medicine that the cure might be attributed to a mere natural source and with regard to his own prophecies - which were numerous - he affected to judge from analogies and experiences. Sainthood He was beatified under Pope Pius VI on 24 May 1789 and was later canonized as a saint of the Roman Catholic Church on 26 May 1839 under Pope Gregory XVI. At the Aragonese Castle (Il Castello Aragonese) on Ischia there is a small chapel consecrated to the late friar.

Political career =Oakwood Mutiny= Trillanes was known for leading the 2003 Oakwood Mutiny when he and 321 junior officers and enlisted men of the Armed Forces of the Philippines who called themselves \\"Bagong Katipuneros\\" took over the Oakwood Premier Ayala Center (now Ascott Makati) serviced apartment tower in Makati City as protest for alleged rampant corruption of the Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo administration in the Philippine government - in the Armed Forces of the Philippines. He was detained for almost seven and a half years. =Manila Peninsula siege= Trillanes filed his certificate of candidacy on February 7, 2007, to run as an independent senatorial candidate despite being detained for complicity in a failed coup d'√©tat. Later, he accepted an invitation from the Genuine Opposition party (GO) as one of its guest candidates to field against the Arroyo administration. He campaigned successfully, while in jail, through the social networking site, Friendster. Trillanes was proclaimed Senator-elect on June 15, 2007 by the Commission on Elections. He is the 2nd youngest senator after Benigno Aquino, Jr. elected at the age of 35 (his partymate Bam Aquino joined him as youngest senator elected in 2013) On July 23, 2007, Trillanes' motion for an \\"arrangement\\" with the Makati RTC that would allow him to fulfill his duties as a Senator while under detention, and to allow him to attend the SONA, remained unacted upon. A week after, judge Oscar Pimentel denied Trillanes' plea to be granted leave from detention to attend Senate sessions, and to set up an office inside Fort Bonifacio in Taguig City where he had been detained. In response to Trillanes' continued imprisonment despite his election as Senator, former University of the Philippines president Francisco Nemenzo, Jr. and former vice president Teofisto Guingona, Jr. of civil society launched the \\"Paglingkurin si Trillanes [Let Trillanes Serve] Movement\\" in Pasay City on August 23, 2007. Akbayan Representative Risa Hontiveros, Ana Maria Nemenzo of the Freedom from Debt Coalition, opposition leader Jose Alcuaz, and Trillanes' spokesperson Sonny Rivera, were present. In the Senate election held in May 2007, Trillanes successfully launched a nationwide campaign from his prison cell as he ran and won a seat in the Philippine Senate on a shoestring budget. He was elected to the Senate as guest candidate for the anti-administration Genuine Opposition ticket, and assumed office on June 30, 2007. He made history for being the first Philippine senator to be elected while in jail when more than 11 million people voted him into office. On November 29, 2007, Trillanes, together with the soldiers facing coup d'√©tat charges in connection with the 2003 Oakwood Mutiny, marched out of the courtroom while attending a hearing towards the Peninsula Manila hotel in Makati City, to reiterate their call for the ouster of then President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo. Notwithstanding calls from civil society groups to allow Trillanes to serve as Senator pursuant to his election, Judge Oscar Pimentel denied Trillanes's petition to attend Senate sessions on September 20, 2007, for lack of merit, ruling that his incarceration would not be a bar to fulfilling his duties as a Senator. His petition, having been denied by the lower court, Senator Trillanes filed a petition with the Supreme Court of the Philippines, asking that his petition to be allowed to attend Senate sessions be granted. Representing him was his lawyer Reynaldo Robles. Included in said petition was a request that he be allowed to receive visitors in his jail at Fort Bonifacio. On October 17, 2007, the Supreme Court of the Philippines, in an en banc resolution, directed the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP), and Makati Regional Trial Court Judge Oscar Pimentel to comment within 10 days on Senator Antonio Trillanes IV's petition. These requests were however later overshadowed by Trillanes' decision to stage another action against Gloria Arroyo's administration. On November 29, 2007, the senator led a siege, this time at the Manila Peninsula Hotel in Makati. After walking out of his court hearing, he and Brigadier General Danilo Lim led their supporters to the hotel where they staged another coup d'√©tat calling on the public to join them. Six hours later, after military teams surrounded the hotel and armored personnel carriers broke through the hotel's front doors, Trillanes and his companions surrendered. =Senate= On December 20, 2010, Trillanes was given provisional freedom pending the recognition of the court's amnesty declaration of President Benigno Aquino III. Under Proclamation 75, Secretary of National Defense Voltaire Gazmin granted amnesty to Trillanes and other military personnel who participated in the coup d' etats. He was able for the first time to enter the Senate and perform his duties as a senator. After formalizing his re-election bid in October 2012, Trillanes filed his certificate of candidacy for 2013 elections at the Commission on Elections main office in Manila. He ran under the banner of the Nacionalista Party, which was allied with the ruling Liberal Party in the 2013 midterm elections. Trillanes was ranked ninth out of the out of the 12 winning senators. Trillanes was proclaimed senator-elect on May 20, 2013 by the Commission on Elections with an official tally of 14,127,722 votes. At the Senate, he is one of the most productive senators in terms of number bills, resolutions and committee reports filed, totalling to 1,490 bills and resolutions, 97 of which have been passed into law from 2007 to present. He ranks 1st based on the total number of: *National Bills passed into law (as Principal Author) (2010-2019) *National Bills passed into law (as Principal Sponsor) (2010-2016) *Total number of bills and resolutions filed (2010-2019) *National bills passed into law (2007-2019) On June 4, 2019, the Philippine Senate adopted Resolution No. 157 to express gratitude and appreciation to Trillanes for his invaluable contributions to the Senate and the nation during his term as senator. He has served as Senator for two (2) consecutive terms (2007-2013 and 2013-2019) and registered the most number of legislative measures enacted into laws as principal author and principal sponsor. =Vice-presidential campaign= Trillanes declared his intention to run for higher office as vice president in the 2016 national elections. Trillanes, started his vice presidential campaign during the MAGDALO Coalition's general assembly at the Amoranto Sports Complex in Quezon City, and declared his candidacy on October 3. 2015. Trillanes and the Magdalo group has formally showed support to the presidential bid of fellow senator Grace Poe. Trillanes paid several advertisements featuring schoolchildren and snippets of videos of Rodrigo Duterte, including one video showing him dropping the finger, on May 5, 2016 on ABS-CBN, which sparked controversy and adverse reactions. The broadcasts were described as \\"black propaganda.\\" Alan Peter Cayetano petitioned the Taguig regional trial court, and they soon placed a temporary restraining order (TRO) to stop the airing of the anti-Duterte ads for 72 hours. Cayetano told GMA News that the political advertisement was part of a conspiracy devised by the Malaca√±ang and other candidates against Duterte. Trillanes eventually lost the 2016 vice presidential race to Liberal Party Candidate Leni Robredo. Criticism and controversies =Rivalry against Duterte= Before the 2016 election, he alleged that former Davao City Mayor and incumbent president Rodrigo Duterte had an account in the Julia Vargas branch of BPI (allegedly Php 211 M) according to him.http://news.abs- cbn.com/halalan2016/nation/05/02/16/trillanes-duterte-lawyer-show-up-at-bpi- julia-vargas Likewise President Duterte, alleges that Trillanes closed his accounts in DBS Bank days before going to Singapore and then showed that there were no such accounts. This became a source of polemics in social media such as Twitter and Facebook. Since then, Trillanes become a rival of Duterte. Duterte's common law wife, Honeylet Avancena, defended Duterte against Trillanes' controversies. On February 13, 2018, Trillanes was declared as persona non grata by Davao City officials. On July 19, 2019, the PNP‚ÄìCriminal Investigation and Detection Group (CIDG) filed charges against Trillanes and other members of the opposition for \\"sedition, cyber libel, libel, estafa, harboring a criminal, and obstruction of justice\\". On February 10, 2020, Trillanes and 10 others were indicted for \\"conspiracy to commit sedition\\" over an alleged ouster plot against President Rodrigo Duterte. =Revocation of amnesty by President Duterte= On August 31, 2018, President Rodrigo Duterte signed Proclamation No. 572, revoking Trillanes's amnesty. Duterte ordered the Department of Justice and the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) to review all criminal cases in relation to the 2003 Oakwood mutiny and 2007 Peninsula siege. Shortly after that, Trillanes told to the reporters that he would not evade the case and he also told to Duterte that he is not afraid of him. The amnesty (Proclamation No 50) was granted by then-President Benigno Aquino III and later issued Proclamation 75 superseding Proclamation no. 50 back in 2010. On September 7, the DOJ filed the application for an arrest and hold departure against Trillanes and it was signed at Makati Regional Trial Court Branch 150 by Acting Prosecutor General Richard Fadullon as \\"very urgent\\". Opposition politicians expressed condemnation over the revocation of the amnesty: Magdalo Representative Gary Alejano, who also lead the mutiny with Trillanes, calls it \\"political persecution\\" of Duterte critic and he also slammed Duterte for what was called a \\"clear act of revenge\\" against Trillanes. Akbayan Representative Tom Villarin called the revocation \\"highly preposterous\\" and \\"clearly a political vendetta.\\" On September 7, former Solicitor General Florin Hilbay said in an interview that the decision against Trillanes is similar to the case of Senator Leila de Lima, who was detained for allegedly violating the drug trafficking law almost a year and a half ago. Supporters of Trillanes gathered outside the Senate and held a vigil. Duterte severely lambasted Trillanes by describing the latter as \\"corrupt\\" and accused him of \\"abandoning\\" the military for his personal interests. On October 22, The Regional Trial Court in Makati denied the government's petition to have Trillanes arrested, saying the coup d'etat case against the senator was already dismissed on September 21, 2011, and that the dismissal was \\"final and executory\\". Personal life Trillanes is married to Arlene G. Orejana, a former member of the Philippine Military Academy corps of professors -- a PMA Class 1997 graduate herself -- and together they have had three children; Francis Seth, Thea Estelle, and Alan Andrew (who died at 21 days old).

According to the provisions of Article 176, an incarcerated person becomes eligible for a grant of libert√† condizionata if he or she satisfies at least the following conditions: (1) The prisoner has spent more than thirty months in confinement, or in the case of someone subject to a life sentence, at least 26 years; (2) The prisoner has served more than half of their sentence, or if the inmate has served another sentence for another crime in the past, he has served three-quarters of that sentence; (3) The prisoner has less than five years remaining on a sentence between 7¬Ω years and life. Once eligible for consideration, a prisoner must also be certified, based on his conduct in prison, as unlikely to commit another crime; otherwise, libert√† condizionata need not be granted. In addition, the tribunale di sorveglianza (English: surveillance court) may impose conditions on the ex-convict's release. Typical conditions are that he must be at home during night-time hours or live in a certain municipality (Italian: comune) and not leave without explicit court permission. If someone released under libert√† condizionata commits a crime, he will be remanded to custody and serve the full term of the original sentence, in addition to any new penalty. Also, if he violates the conditions imposed by the tribunale di sorveglianza, he may be returned to prison. A person who behaves satisfactorily under libert√† condizionata for a period of five years is considered to have paid his debt to society. A person sentenced for a crime related to the mafia or terrorism is ineligible for libert√† condizionata unless he cooperates with the authorities. This effectively means that the convicted person will spend the remainder of their life in prison, but some critics argue that it is hard to know what evidence might support the assertion that ties of this sort have, in fact, been broken. Becoming a pentito and giving substantial help to the authorities is generally considered to be sufficient evidence of a change of heart. Of the approximately fifty thousand inmates in Italian prisons, only twenty-one were granted libert√† condizionata in 2006. It is much more common to be allowed to work outside the prison during the day (semilibert√†, i.e. semi-freedom).

At the suggestion of Bishop Hugh C. Boyle they opened the Mt. Gallitzin High School for Girls in September 1934. The first class graduated in 1938, the centennial year of Baden Township. The school offered both academic and commercial courses and touted its broad cultural program and the individual attention and direction given to each student. Most of the girls were commuters, save some boarders who were preparing to the Congregation of the Sisters. Once Quigley Catholic opened its doors in 1967 the school was forced to consolidate. At the time of the consolidation in 1967, the student enrollment was 245. There was one other school that consolidated to Quigley Catholic, St. Veronica's. St. Veronica High School was opened in September 1924, under the supervision of Fr. John Martin, pastor, and the Sisters of St. Joseph who staffed the new parish high school. Seventeen students were in the first graduating class. Growth continued so quickly that within 15 years new space was desperately needed. Rev. James O‚ÄôConnell and Rev. Paul Nee continued the education expansion at St. Veronica's. A building at 5th and Beaver Road was obtained through cooperation from the Ambridge School board in 1945. When a new school for elementary level students was built in 1959, the high school eventually moved back to its original home on Melrose Avenue. At the time of the consolidation in 1967 the enrollment of 243 included students from many other parishes besides St. Veronica. In the mid-1960s the Superintendent of Schools for the Diocese of Pittsburgh was Auxiliary Bishop, Most Reverend John B. McDowell. At that time he and Bishop of the Diocese of Pittsburgh, John J. Wright saw a need for expanding the Diocesan presence in a regional Catholic high school to serve the people of the Beaver Valley. In 1966, under the supervision of Bishop McDowell, land was purchased from the Sisters of St. Joseph and ground was broken. Quigley Catholic High School first opened its doors to students in September 1967. The 440 students came to the new school while construction of the building was still being finished around them. The formal dedication and blessing of the building took place on April 28, 1968. The school opened under the leadership of Father Robert J. Reardon as Headmaster and with the guidance of Sister St. Bede Downey, CSJ, who continued to serve Quigley Catholic for many years until her death. Additional principals have been Rev. George Leech, John S. Hoehl, who was later convicted of sexual abuse, Sr. Anna Marie Gaglia, CSJ, Rev. Ronald R. Cellini, Rev. David C. Menegay, Dr. Madonna Helbling and Mrs. Rita McCormick. Growth and construction of one sort or another had been going on ever since. Quigley Catholic was the first and only regional Catholic high school in Beaver County. =About the namesake of Quigley= MONSIGNOR THOMAS J. QUIGLEY: 1905-1960 superintendent of schools for the Roman Catholic Diocese of Pittsburgh until his death in 1960 ‚Äú‚Ä¶This new school has been named in honor of the late and beloved Monsignor Thomas J. Quigley, who was Superintendent of Schools from August 1939 to December 1955. This extraordinary priest served the diocese, its schools, and the general community as a spiritual leader and an accomplished educator from 1931 until his untimely death in 1960. No man gave so much to education or to the Church as did he. In every area of education he was outstanding. Readily recognized as a leader by public and non-public educators, this priest contributed, in an extraordinary way, to the development of education for all children and for all segments of our community. It is significant that the priests of Beaver County voted by an overwhelming majority to dedicate this school in his memory. In this way they hoped to memorialize and to express appreciation for a life spent in improving both the city of God and the city of humankind. Dedicated priest, scholarly educator, prolific writer, able administrator, but most of all a man committed to a cause ‚Äì this was Monsignor Quigley. And while we honor his memory by naming this school after him, we do, in fact, honor this school by using his name and identifying it with all that is good in education and community life.‚Äù Auxiliary Bishop, Most Reverend John B. McDowell (then, Superintendent of Schools) April 1968 from the Dedication of Quigley Catholic High School. Academics Quigley Catholic had been named as a Catholic High School of Excellence consistently and consecutively since the inception of the honor. This honor of distinction is earned by less than 5% of all Catholic high schools in the nation. 99% of Quigley Catholic's graduates had matriculated to college. Graduates had been awarded an average of $161,000 per student in non- need based grants and scholarships. During the school's existence, graduates were accepted to many prestigious schools, including: West Point, United States Air Force Academy, Carnegie Mellon University, University of Notre Dame, John Carroll University, MIT, Case Western Reserve, Fordham University, Harvard University, Allegheny College, Duquesne University, Saint Vincent College, University of Pittsburgh, and New York University, to name a few. =Forensics and Mock Trial= The art of Public Speaking was once taught at Quigley Catholic High School through its once nationally recognized Forensics and Mock Trial teams. Mock Trial The Mock Trial Team had won nine Pennsylvania State Championships, making it the number one ranked team in the state. The Mock Trial team was national runner-up for the year 2002. Controversy (Fr.) John \\"Jack\\" S. Hoehl was school principal from 1971 to 1985. Hoehl (a priest at the time) was accused, by at least 7 men in 2001, of sexual abuse while they were students at Quigley Catholic High School during Hoehl's tenure as principal there.Rodgers, A. (2004). \\"Vatican Severs Church Ties to Former Quigley Headmaster\\" Post Gazette, 15 January The men claim they were invited to the rectory for, \\"wrestling team sleep overs\\" where they were allowed to drink alcohol and smoke marijuana. While they were incapacitated Hoehl sexually abused them.Sheehan, A. (2007). Former Priest Can No Longer Work As Counselor KDKA 30 March One former Quigley Catholic student claims the abuse continued for four years.Hasch, M. (2004) Six More Law Suits Filed Against Pittsburgh Diocese Tribune Review 1 July The lawsuits have been dropped because the statute of limitations has run out. However, Hoehl was permanently banned from ministry in 1988 by then Bishop, Donald Wuerl, because Wuerl considered the accusations to be credible. On June 16, 2004 the Vatican severed all ties with Heohl. Hoehl went on to become a youth counselor in West Virginia. He was subsequently removed from this post by the West Virginia Board of Counselors because of the credible accusations of sexual abuse from former students at Quigley Catholic High School.

Being Servais's first and to date only feature film, Taxandria is notable for the use of Servais's distinct animation style, the servaisgraphie, as well as its connection to the Belgian graphic novel series Les Cit√©s Obscures whose creator Fran√ßois Schuiten was the film's production designer. Plot Young prince Jan has been sent to a quiet coastal resort to study for his final exams, but instead he spends most of his time with his new friend, the lighthouse keeper. Jan ignores the warnings of the locals who claim that the loony lighthouse man (Armin Mueller- Stahl) eats seagulls for breakfast. Maybe the lighthouse keeper is crazy, but this does not prevent him from introducing prince Jan to the dreamland Taxandria, a phantasmagorical place devoid of time, memory, and progress. Jan learns that a reason for the lighthouse keeper's notoriety among the locals is that from time to time he hides political refugees from Taxandria from the authorities; in one scene, we see some of these fugitives arrive at the coast in a boat and taken in by the lighthouse keeper. It is however never made clear whether Taxandria really exists or if the viewer only sees what the lighthouse keeper relates to prince Jan, although once Jan is transported to Taxandria simply by looking into the lighthouse's rotating light while the keeper is away. As a failed scientific experiment in the past accidentally removed Taxandria from its home planet (a disaster now recalled by the citizens of Taxandria as the Great Cataclysm), all science, progress, and measure of time are outlawed as a consequence, whereas the Perennial Present reigns supreme. The land is ruled by two conjoined princes, always hidden behind a curtain, and their police force who insure that everyone there lives in the Perennial Present, as it is illegal to discuss the past or future. The police is headed by this world's evil counterpart of the benevolent lighthouse keeper (a double role for actor Armin Mueller-Stahl), communicating the will and orders of the mute Two Princes, making him the effective ruler of Taxandria. While at first Taxandria seems a magical, wonderful place, Jan soon sees the darker side of this strange world. The people are not happy living only in the present; it is repressive. Soon he sees that many suffer from extreme paranoia. Aim√© (Elliott Spiers), the son of the evil Head of Police, seems to be a catalyst for change in Taxandria, as he is obsessed with making new inventions and learning about the country's past. Later, Aim√© falls in love with Princess Ail√©e who is trying to free herself from the paradisaical confines of the Garden of Mirth, where women are kept away from men, and discovers the secret of his father that made him Taxandria's effective ruler while being the Head of Police, as well as the true nature of the Two Princes. Filming and release Taxandria was filmed in Budapest in 1989. However, due to the enormous amount of post-production work that needed to be completed, it was not released until October 1994. In the interim, Elliott Spiers, who portrayed Aim√© Perel in the film, became gravely ill from the side-effects of an anti-malaria inoculation. As a result, he was unable to complete the voice- dubbing required for his character and, consequently, the voice of Aim√© Perel is that of another actor. Spiers died in January 1994,https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/26378080 before the film's release. Taxandria was premiered at the 1994 Flanders Film Festival and was dedicated to his memory. Taxandria and Les Cit√©s Obscures Beno√Æt Peeters, co-creator of the Belgian graphic novel series Les Cit√©s Obscures, had collaborated with Servais before on a documentary entitled Servaisgraphia on Servais's unique animation style that was released in 1992. With Fran√ßois Schuiten as the film's production designer, Taxandria exhibits a loose connection with Les Cit√©s Obscures by Schuiten and Peeters. In the Obscure Cities series, at times characters refer to the vanished city-state of Taxandria which was accidentally removed from the planet during a failed scientific experiment, an event also related in the movie Taxandria. A common theme in steampunk- influenced Les Cit√©s Obscures, Taxandrian clothing and technology appear to resemble Victorian times on our earth, Taxandria's architecture is reminiscent of Schuiten's trademark phantasmagorical architectural fantasies, and another feature the film shares with Les Cit√©s Obscures is a bloated absurd, Kafkaesque bureaucracy. A reinterpreting graphic novel adaptation of the movie Taxandria was published by Schuiten and Peeters one year prior to the film's official release under the title Souvenirs de l'Eternel Pr√©sent: Variation sur le Film Taxandria de Raoul Servais (Arboris, 1993, , ), also including production background information on the film.

He later played with the Birmingham Stallions of the United States Football League. During the off season, Parsons did some substitute teaching in Wheaton, Illinois.https://www.pro-football- reference.com/players/P/ParsBo00.htm He has 3 kids; Michelle, Greg, and Mallory, the youngest who currently plays volleyball at Carthage College in Kenosha, Wisconsin. College career Parsons enrolled at Penn State, coached by the legendary Joe Paterno and saw his first game action during the 1969 season as the team's third string quarterback. Playing behind starter Chuck Burkhart and Mike Cooper, Parsons saw limited action, appearing in a couple of games, complete five of twelve passes and one interception. Penn State finished second in the AP poll that year. With Burkhart graduated, Parsons moved up to second string behind Cooper on a stacked squad that featured future NFL stars Franco Harris and Lydell Mitchell in the backfield. With the veteran Burkhart gone, and just the inexperienced Cooper and Parsons at the helm, Penn State slipped to 7‚Äì3 in 1970. The following season, Paterno made a radical change to the quarterback position. He named John Hufnagel as the starter and made Parsons a tight end. In his first and only college season as a receiver, Parsons responded by catching 30 passes for 489 yards and 5 touchdown receptions.https://www.sports-reference.com/cfb/players/bob- parsons-1.html Penn State took on Texas at the conclusion of the season in the Cotton Bowl. The Nittany Lions routed the Longhorns, 30‚Äì6, A key 19 yard pass from Hufnagel to Parsons helped set up a Penn state score.https://www.nytimes.com/1972/01/02/archives/lions-rout-texas-on-2dhalf- surge-penn-state-306-victor-in-cotton.html Pro Career The Chicago Bears selected Parsons with their fifth round selection, (117th player overall) in the 1972 NFL Draft. Parsons made the team as a rookie, playing behind starter Earl Thomas. The Bears finished 4-9-1 under head coach Abe Gibron, but Parsons scored a touchdown during rookie season, in his first game as a pro. Not long after Atlanta Falcons defensive end John Zook returned a fumble for a score, Bears quarterback Bobby Douglas found Parsons for a game tying six yard touchdown pass. That would be as close as the Bears would get, as the Falcons routed Chicago 37‚Äì21.https://www.pro-football- reference.com/boxscores/197209170chi.htm Parsons remained a back-up tight end the following season, catching a few passes throughout the season. The Bears fell to 3‚Äì11 in 1973 under Gibron. 1974 would be the first time in his pro career that Parsons would be a starter, but it wasn't at tight end. Instead, Parsons replaced Bobby Joe Green as the Bears punter. In his first season as a punter, Parsons punted 90 times for a 37.9 yard average with one punt blocked. However, the Bears were still a terrible team under Gibron, once again ending the season with double digit losses. The 1975 season saw the arrival of new head coach Jack Pardee and a rookie running back named Walter Payton. Parsons was even doing double duty. He was the teams punter as well as the starting tight end. That season Parsons caught 13 passes for 184 yards, and a touchdown, his first since the first game of his rookie season. Parsons' second career touchdown came from quarterback Gary Huff in the Bears 27‚Äì14 win over the rival Green Bay Packers.https://www.pro-football- reference.com/boxscores/197511090chi.htm In 1976, Parsons was back to being the teams punter, though he did complete two passes during the season. One was a 23-yard pass against the Detroit Lions week one, and the second one a 25-yard pass week eight against the Minnesota Vikings. Both games were Bears victories. In 1977, the Bears finally had a winning season, going 9‚Äì5, and making the play offs, though they lost to the Dallas Cowboys 37‚Äì7. Parsons punted six times that game as the Bears offense struggled to get on track. After that season was over, Pardee left to coach the Washington Redskins and Neill Armstrong took over as the Bears head coach. While the Bears slipped to 7‚Äì9, Parsons had himself as the Bears punter. He would remain so until 1983, when Mike Ditka cut Parsons after week 14 and replaced him with ex packers punter Ray Stachowicz. It wasn't Parsons' play or declining quality that lead to his release. Ditka had become enraged when he learned that Parsons had been talking to the owners of the Chicago Blitz of the USFL about signing on as the teams punter of the possibility of a role as a special teams coach. Ditka, already reeling from quarterback Vince Evans pending departure to the upstart spring league, and that the league had been talking to other members of the Bears, cut Parsons, citing he only wanted players that would be loyal to the Bears.https://www.upi.com/Archives/1983/12/05/An-angry-Chicago-Bears-Coach- Mike-Ditka-said-Monday/4650439448400/ After departing the Bears, Parsons signed with the Birmingham Stallions of the USFl. The Stallions had managed to sign quarterback Cliff Stoudt away from the Pittsburgh Steelers and running back Joe Cribbs from the Buffalo Bills. With the Stallions, Parsons got to play with a team that was a play off contender, something he didn't get to experience much with the Bears. In a 1985 play off game against the Houston Gamblers, led by quarterback Jim Kelly, The Stallions eliminated Houston, thanks in part to Parsons punt that pinned Houston on their own one yard line.https://www.nytimes.com/1985/06/30/sports/stallions-eliminate- gamblers.html During his time the Stallions, Parsons served mainly as the teams punter. In 1984, he punted 42 times for 1,625 yards. In 1985, he punted 67 times for 2,626 yards.https://www.justsportsstats.com/footballstatsindex.php?player_id=parsobob001 After the 1985 season, with the USFL's future in doubt due to a lawsuit against the NFL, Parsons retired from pro football. In 1975, 1981 and 1982 seasons, Parsons lead the NFL in punting attempts, while leading the NFL in punt yards in both 1982 and 1983. With 34,180 career punting yards, he ranks 45th all-time in NFL history, and 53rd all-time with most punts blocked with five.https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/P/ParsBo00.htm References 1950 births Living people Sportspeople from Bethlehem, Pennsylvania American football punters Players of American football from Pennsylvania Penn State Nittany Lions football players Chicago Bears players Birmingham Stallions players ","title":"Bob Parsons (American football)"},{"id":"9674309","text":"{{Infobox rugby league biography name = Andrew Gee fullname = image = caption = birth_date = birth_place = Brisbane, Queensland, Australia height = weight = position = club1 = Brisbane Broncos year1start = 1989 year1end = 99 appearances1 = 215 tries1 = 10 goals1 = 0 fieldgoals1 = 0 points1 = 40 club2 = Warrington Wolves year2start = 2000 year2end = 01 appearances2 = 40 tries2 = 4 goals2 = 0 fieldgoals2 = 0 points2 = 16 club3 = Brisbane Broncos year3start = 2002 year3end = 03 appearances3 = 40 tries3 = 2 goals3 = 0 fieldgoals3 = 0 points3 = 8 teamA = Queensland yearAstart = 1990 yearAend = 03 appearancesA = 17 triesA = 1 goalsA = 0 fieldgoalsA = 0 pointsA = 4 teamB = Queensland (SL) yearBstart = 1997 yearBend = appearancesB = 1 triesB = 0 goalsB = 0 fieldgoalsB = 0 pointsB = 0 teamC = Australia yearCstart = 1991 yearCend = appearancesC = triesC = goalsC = fieldgoalsC = pointsC = retired = yes updated = 29 May 2013 source =] source = ] Andrew Gee (born 23 April 1970) is an Australian rugby league administrator and former football operations manager at the Brisbane Broncos of the NRL. Also a former player with the club, he was a Queensland State of Origin representative , and at the time of his retirement, held the Broncos' club record for most appearances of any forward. Playing career While attending Beaudesert High School, Gee played for the Australian Schoolboys team in 1986. He transferred from Beaudesert, Queensland to play in the NSWRL Premiership for the Brisbane Broncos in 1989, the club's second season. He started his representative career for Queensland the following year, selected as a reserve in games 2 and 3 of the 1990 State of Origin series. Gee was rewarded after his strong display in the 1991 State of Origin series with selection for the 1991 Kangaroo tour of Papua New Guinea, making just one non-Test match appearance before being injured. He also met a similar fate the following season, played just seven matches and was left out of the starting line up that defeated St George Dragons 28‚Äì8 in the 1992 NSWRL Grand Final. In the weeks following the grand final Gee traveled with the Broncos to England, where he played as a in the 1992 World Club Challenge against British champions Wigan, helping Brisbane become the first Australian club to win the World Club Challenge in Britain. Gee was a reserve when the club won the second of its two consecutive premierships in 1993. He overcame a lengthy suspension at the beginning of the 1994 season to take his place in the side that lost the 1994 World Club Challenge to Wigan, 20‚Äì14, at ANZ Stadium in June in front of a WCC record attendance of 54,220 fans. Gee toiled with the Broncos through the club's domination of the 1997 Super League season and took his place in the champion Brisbane team that won the 1998 NRL grand final. In 1998 he also won the club's player of the year award. He left the club at the end of 1999 to join Warrington but later returned to the Broncos, along with former captain Allan Langer, for the 2002 season. Sometimes criticized for lack of discipline resulting in needless penalties which potentially cost his team victories, Gee finished his playing career in 2003. That year he also made the State of Origin team, some 13 years after his first representative match. He was the first player to play 250+ games for the Broncos. Early in the 2007 season at the Broncos' 20-year anniversary celebration, the club announced a list of the 20 best players to play for them to date which included Gee. In 2009 Gee was inducted into the Broncos official Hall of Fame. Coaching and administration career Gee continued to serve at the Broncos assisting the coaching staff. In 2010 he was appointed the club's general manager of football operations.  Family life  Gee has 2 sons; Joshua and Jacob Gee - and one daughter Jessica Gee.

He was an Eastern Orthodox monk who advocated for the freedom of worship of the Romanian population in Transylvania. Early life Sofronie was born in the first half of the 18th century in the Romanian village of Cioara, now SƒÉli»ôtea, Transylvania, which was at the time part of the Austrian Habsburg Empire. His Christian given name was Stan and his family name was Popa (or Popovici, according to other sources). His family name suggests that one of his ancestors was a priest, as in Romanian pop«é means priest. Sofronie also became an Orthodox priest and he remained in Cioara until the death of his wife, when he went to the a monastery in Wallachia (possibly the Cozia Monastery) and became a monk. After becoming a monk, Sofronie returned to Cioara and built a small wooden Orthodox monastery in the forest close to the village. He devoted his life to monasticism until 1757, when he started to lead the peaceful uprising of the Romanian Orthodox population in Transylvania against the Habsburg policy of encouraging all Romanians to join the Greek-Catholic Church. Religion in Habsburg Transylvania The Habsburg Empire was a conglomerate of different states and people. In this conglomerate, the Roman Catholic religion served to strengthen the other forces of cohesion, dynastic, absolutism, bureaucratic, or military, and provided a political instrument for domination and unification. In addition to various measures designed to protect Catholicism, which at the time was very weak in Transylvania (predominantly Romanian Orthodox), the Habsburgs tried to strengthen it in other ways. The fact that the Romanian people, due to their Orthodox religion, were only tolerated in Transylvania presented an excellent opportunity, and the Habsburgs believed that by winning over the Romanians they would strengthen their position in the region.»òtefan Pascu, A History of Transylvania, Wayne State University Press, 1983. In 1701, the Emperor Leopold I decreed Transylvania's Orthodox Church to be one with the Roman Catholic Church. Therefore, Transylvanians were encouraged to become Catholics and adhere to the newly created Greek-Catholic Church by retaining their Orthodox ritual, but accepting the four doctrinal points established by the Council of Florence between 1431 and 1445: the Pope as the supreme head of the church; the existence of Purgatory; the Filioque clause; and the use of unleavened bread in Holy Communion. The clergy first had to be won over with the material advantages of the union, which would mean equality with the Catholic priesthood, including their income and their privileges.Keith Hitchins, The Idea of Nation: the Romanians of Transylvania, 1691-1849, Bucharest: Editura »ôtiin»õificƒÉ »ôi enciclopedicƒÉ, 1985. However, many of the Orthodox priests did not join the Union and, as Seton-Watson wrote in his book, \\"despite all handicaps, the devotion of the common people to the ancient faith was truly touching and the latent demand for an Orthodox bishop and freedom of religion slowly became more vocal and was roused by the Uniate example\\".Robert William Seton-Watson, A History of the Roumanians, London: Cambridge University Press, 1934, pp. 181-182. Sofronie's movement (1759‚Äì1761) Sofronie, as a Transylvanian Orthodox monk, preached against the union with the Catholics and against the increasing pressure put on the Orthodox communities to join this union. In the spring of 1757, the Austrian authorities from the nearby village of Vin≈£u de Jos destroyed Sofronie's small monastery in an attempt to eliminate the Orthodox resistance in Transylvania. The authorities also started to arrest all the members of the Orthodox clergy preaching against the union. In order to escape the arrest, Sofronie was forced to leave Cioara, but the Orthodox community of the region, continued to remain faithful to their religion. After some evidence of popular discontent of the Transylvanian Orthodox, in 1759 the Empress Maria Theresa issued her first Edict of Toleration, which seemed far too modest in scale to the people concerned, and only served to increase disturbances.Georges Castellan, A History of the Romanians, Boulder: East European Monographs, 1989, p. 109. On 6 October 1759, Sofronie addressed the Romanian Orthodox community from Brad, in Hunedoara county, informing the people that the Empress' Edict of Toleration allowed the Romanian population in Transylvania to choose freely between the Orthodox and the Greek-Catholic Church. The authorities in Vienna became worried and imperial troops hunted down the preacher. He was arrested by the authorities and jailed in Bob√¢lna, a village in the Hunedoara county. On 13 February 1760, Sofronie was forcibly released, after the revolt of some 600 Romanian peasants led by the Orthodox priest from Cioara, Ioan. Sofronie continued his preachings against the Union with Rome in ≈¢ara Zarandului and ≈¢ara Mo≈£ilor. On 21 April 1760 he addressed the Romanian Orthodox community from Zlatna, and on 12 May, he addressed the one from Abrud. The Austrian Council of Ministers in Vienna, alarmed by his popularity, decided on 3 June to arrest and then kill Sofronie. On 2 August in the Abrud Church, Sofronie was once again arrested by the authorities and transferred to Zlatna. After the revolt of some 7,000 peasants from the area, he was once again forcibly released and then guarded and kept in hiding by the peasantry employed in the royal mines of Abrud. For a time, they were in virtual revolt and openly declared that \\"the power of the lords is at an end, it is we who are now the masters\\". On 14-18 February 1761, at Alba Iulia, Sofronie organized a meeting of the Transylvanian Orthodox Synod, which demanded total freedom of worship in Transylvania. The Austrian authorities sent the General Adolf von Buccow to pacify the region and arrest Sofronie, who, just before being arrested, managed to escape to Wallachia, where he had many sympathizers. Sofronie remained in Wallachia until his death. He continued to dedicate his life to Orthodox monasticism, as a monk at the monasteries of Robaia (1764‚Äì1766), Viero≈üi (1766‚Äì1771) and then Curtea de Arge≈ü, all in the Arge»ô County. In reprisal for Sofronie's escape to Wallachia, General Buccow had almost all Orthodox monasteries in Transylvania burnt down. However, disturbances went on and, to bring back order, the Empress issued a new Edict of Toleration in 1769, which gave legal status to the \\"Eastern Greek Cult\\" (i.e. the Orthodox), making it an official religion in Transylvania. In reality tensions remained, and only under Emperor Joseph II was a climate of religious tolerance brought in with the Edict of 13 October 1781. This resulted in many Romanians going back to the Orthodox Church, showing that an element of compulsion was present in many of the previous conversions. Results of the movement and its legacy Sofronie's movement led to the peaceful uprising of the Romanian Orthodox peasant population in order to change the status of their Church from only \\"tolerated\\", despite being the majority of the Transylvanian population, to \\"officially recognised\\". In the end, the Orthodox achieved a notable victory: recognition by the court of Vienna of the legal existence of their church and the appointment of a bishop in the person of Dionisie Novacovic.Keith Hitchins, The Romanians 1774-1866, Oxford University Press, 1996, pp. 202-203. He was the first bishop for the Transylvanian Orthodox population since 1701, when the authorities abolished the Orthodox Metropolitanate from Alba Iulia. Historian Keith Hitchins proposed an explanation for the strong devotion of the common people to their ancient faith, even though the Union with Rome would have brought them many more advantages and privileges. The intellectuals linked with the Romanian Greek- Catholic Church had a different approach to the problem of the Romanian nation in Transylvania. They possessed a keen sense of history and they thought increasingly in terms of 'nation', creating in this way a new path of development for the Romanians in Transylvania. The Orthodox movement led by Sofronie, focused on religion, and the movement of the Greek-Catholic scholars, focused on the idea of nation, in the end had complementary effects. They both kept alive the connection between the Romanians in Transylvania and those from Wallachia and Moldavia and can therefore both be seen as important steps made by Romanians towards their national unity.

In a wide-ranging analysis on intersex human rights and health issues, the Council of Europe published an Issue Paper entitled Human rights and intersex people in May 2015.

Background Born at Heston, he was the son of Sir Francis Blake, 2nd Baronet and his wife, the daughter of Alexander Douglas. In 1818, he succeeded his father as baronet. Career Blake was commissioned captain in the Northumberland Militia in 1794 and was appointed colonel of the Northumberland Fencibles in 1795. He entered the British House of Commons in 1820, sitting as Member of Parliament (MP) for Berwick-upon-Tweed until 1826. A year later, he was reelected for the constituency, representing it until 1834. Blake owned estates at Twizell Castle, Tillmouth House, Seghill and Duddo, which later he sold for ¬£45000 in 1823. Death and legacy He married Jane, daughter of William Neale, in 1827 but had no legitimate children and the baronetcy became extinct on his death. His illegitimate son Frederick Blake (1835‚Äì1909) suffered severe sunstroke while serving as an army officer and was confined to a mental asylum in 1873. His father granted him a life interest in property at Seghill and also bequeathed Helen, the widow of his brother Robert Dudley Blake (1776‚Äì1860). Blake's principal beneficiary was Captain Francis Blake (1832‚Äì1861) whose son Francis Douglas Blake was created a baronet in his own right in 1907. The family repurchased Seghill Park from the Treasury Solicitor following the intestacy of Helen Blake.

In Russian chronicles it is known as Oshel (). Whereas archaeologic excavations prove that the city appeared as early as the 11th century, the Tatar legends and the Russian Tver Chronicle state that the city was founded by Alexander the Great. At its heyday Ashli was a major trade and political centre. In 1220 it was ruined and burned by the troops of Sviatoslav III of Vladimir. The Tver Chronicle is the only written source where Ashli is mentioned. –ì–∞–∑–µ—Ç–∞ \\"–†–µ—Å–ø—É–±–ª–∏–∫–∞ –¢–∞—Ç–∞—Ä—Å—Ç–∞–Ω\\" –ü–æ–¥ –≥—Ä–∞–¥ –û—à–µ–ª—å –Ω–∞ –í–æ–ª–≥–µ‚Ä¶ Downfall The downfall of the city is mentioned in the Tver Chronicle, the only written mention of the city. The prince of Vladimir Yuri Vsevolodovich sent the expedition to sack Ashli under his brother, Sviatoslav. The Russians under prince Sviatoslav, his brother Yaroslav and voyevoda Yeremey Glebovich reached the city by the Volga on their boats. They landed to the east of the city at the flat bank of the Volga. The Rostovans formed the right flank, the Pereslavleans the left, the prince and the Muromeans stayed in the center. One regiment stayed to protect the boats. The Russians came across the forest and met the horseback Bulgars under their prince. Bulgars shot their arrows and retreated to the citadel. The Russians reached the walls in a harsh battle and managed to set a fire at the walls. However the fire, smoke and wind were so strong, that the Russians were forced to retreat and to enter the city from another side. However, Ashli's prince and his cavalry retinue escaped under cover of the smoke. However, foot warriors and civilians were killed in action. The fire was so strong that many invaders who dared to enter Ashli to rob the city perished. The Russians took into many civilians captive and retreated by the Volga. Bulgar reinforcements, sent from Bil√§r, the capital, were too late. Search and excavations For a long period there weren't any ruins identified as Ashli. Vasily Tatishchev assumed that the ruins near Yantikovsky (Kirelsky) in what is today Kamsko-Ustyinsky District (Kama-Ustjin District) were the remains of Ashla. Another supporter of this version, A. Smirnov, advanced that the name of the city comes from the Esegel tribe of the Volga Bulgars. Yantikovsky's ruins were flooded with the infill of the Kuybyshev Reservoir in the 1950s, however, they were totally explored. There weren't scents of the mentioned great fire in Yantikovsky ruins. Today the ruins are assumed to be near the village of Bogodashkino, Tetyushsky District. Bogdashkino is a village located on the upper course of the Kilna River, between Proley-Kasha and Iokovo villages, about five kilometres north of Uryum village, on the land which is inhabited by Tetyushi Mordvins, about 16 kilometres south-west of Tetyushi. The Bogodashkino ruins were found in 1909 by ƒû√§ynetdin √Ñxm√§rev and the excavations took place in 1949-1950 under Nikolay Kalinin. He also excavated Yantikovsky's ruins and decided that Ashli was situated near Bogodashkino. The remains of the fortress, the apartments, workshops, pottery and foundry were unearthed. The Muslim burial ground found there dates back to the 11-13th centuries. The last expeditions of 1987 and 2003 provided a good matter for historians.

Overview Sembel was the site of a village near Asmara. It was subsequently made a suburb of the capital to its south. Immediately after the Eritrean War of Independence, a large government subsidized housing project was constructed in the area. During its construction and that of a nearby Intercontinental Hotel, evidence of ancient settlement was found. The National Museum of Eritrea later constructed a building to allow viewing of the excavation. The excavations at Sembel found evidence of an ancient pre-Aksumite civilization in greater Asmara. This Ona urban culture is believed to have been among the earliest pastoral and agricultural communities in the Horn region. Artefacts at the site have been dated to between 800 BC and 400 BC, contemporaneous with other pre-Aksumite settlements in the Eritrean and Ethiopian highlands during the mid-first millennium BC. Additionally, the Ona culture may have had connections with the ancient Land of Punt. In a tomb in Thebes dated to the reign of Pharaoh Amenophis II (Amenhotep II), long-necked pots similar to those made by the Ona people are depicted as part of the cargo in a ship from Punt.

Life and work Born Francisco √Ångel Luksich in Villa Ballester, he developed an early interest in acting and in 1950 was given his first Argentine cinema role in El otro yo de Marcela, directed by Alberto de Zaval√≠a. His deep voice and keen sense of timing earned him numerous radio drama roles during the 1950s, and later in the Channel 7 telenovela series, La tarde de Palmolive. He earned renown for his 1965 screen adaptation of Dalmiro S√°enz's El pecado necesario. His film version of this work, Nadie oy√≥ gritar a Cecilio Fuentes, marked his directorial debut and earned Siro a Silver Seashell at the San Sebasti√°n International Film Festival. He remained in Spain until 1970, and starred as Julio Col√≥n, the protagonist in a top-rated sitcom, La familia Col√≥n. Returning to Argentina, he appeared in Fernando Ayala's adaptation of historian F√©lix Luna's historical drama, Argentino hasta la muerte (1971), and directed the picaresque comedy Autocine mon amour (1972). He directed numerous comedies and musical films, which became popular in Argentina during the troubled 1970s, and would star in a number of these, notably with Jorge Porcel in Te rompo el rating (1981), and in Alejandro Azzano's tragicomic Venido a menos (1981). Siro was also active in the theatre, playing over 60 roles in his career, notably in Leo Tolstoi's Anna Karenina, Jean-Paul Sartre's The Respectful Prostitute, Tennessee Williams' A Streetcar Named Desire, Arthur Miller's A View From the Bridge, and Ken Ludwig's Lend Me a Tenor. Among his notable roles in later years were for director Fernando Solanas in Sur (1987) and El Viaje (1992), in El mundo de Gasalla (Antonio Gasalla's television comedy skit series of the early 1990s), and in Orlando Posse's romantic comedy, Apariencias (2000). His last work as director was the regionalist Sapucay, mi pueblo (1997). Siro and his wife and frequent co-star, Elena Cruz, were politically conservative. Their decision to join a small rally on March 24, 2001, in support of the former dictator in power during the height of the Dirty War, General Jorge Videla, led to their expulsion from the Argentine Actors Association. He died of cancer on September 4, 2006, at age 74.

(1974), The Monongalia Story: A Bicentennial History, Vol. I: Prelude (1984), Parsons, West Virginia: McClain Printing Co., page 55. The term appears in many old maps and land documents, often persisting for many decades. It also remains in a number of present-day place names of the Eastern US. History Pioneer settlers, in applying for their land grants, exhibited a strong preference for sites located along major trails and particularly those coinciding with these Old Fields, as the Native Americans had often prepared land for settlement. Thus, early land survey plats emphasized these features and many place names from New England south to Florida represent vestiges of these places. The earliest white settlers of Virginia's Shenandoah Valley, which had been vacated by the Indians, noted \\"Indian old fields\\". On the earliest Virginia map to show the upper Chesapeake watershed and Allegheny Mountains in any detail (the Jefferson-Fry map of 1751) an extensive area of \\"old fields\\" known as \\"Shawno Fields\\" was designated at the mouth of the South Branch of the Upper Potomac River.Mitchell, Robert D., Warren R. Hofstra and Edward F. Connor, \\"Reconstructing the Colonial Environment of the Upper Chesapeake Watershed‚Äù, pp 167-190 of Curtin, Philip D., Grace Somers Brush, and George Wescott Fisher (editors), Discovering the Chesapeake: The History of an Ecosystem (2001); Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press. (About nine miles upstream further extensive clearings were noted by the first settlers. A post office and community, \\"Old Fields\\", exists at this site to the present day.Core, Earl L. (1949), \\"Original Treeless Areas in West Virginia\\", J. Elisha Mitchell Sci. Soc., 65:306-310.) In the 1750s, the explorer and surveyor Christopher Gist, traveling near the Ohio River in what later became western West Virginia, wrote in his journal of \\"Indian old fields.\\" He described \\"large meadows, fine clover Bottoms & spacious Plains covered with wild Rye\\".Darlington, William M. (1893), Christopher Gist's Journals, with Historical, Geographical and Ethnological Notes and Biographies of his Contemporaries, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania: J.H. Weldin & Co., page 296. A 1761 visitor to the colony of South Carolina noted: > There are dispersed up and down the country several large Indian old fields, > which are lands that have been cleared by the Indians, and now remain just > as they left them. There arise in many places fine savannahs, or wide > extended plains, which do not produce any trees; these are a kind of natural > lawns, and some of them as beautiful as those made by art. As recently as 1912, a genealogist in northern West Virginia published the following definition: > \\"Old Fields\\" is a common expression for land that has been cultivated by the > Indians and left fallow, which is generally overrun with what they call > \\"broom grass\\".Butcher, Bernard L.

The Home Nations were not however members of FIFA due to disputes over the growing professionalism in continental and South American football. As a result, they were not able to attend and indicated that even if they were invited they would have no interest in attending, deeming foreign opposition too weak for serious contest. The England team, which dominated the 1930 championship, had lost to Spain the year before in the first defeat by a foreign football team, and in the same year they only managed draws with Germany and Austria. The Scottish side, which had won most of the previous ten championships, was likewise unprepared, only playing its first game outside the British Isles in 1929, and being heavily defeated on tour in 1931 by both the Austrians and the Italians. The tournament reflected the highly attacking style of play popular in Britain at the time, with very high scoring in all games, the lowest total was three and two games saw seven goals and two more six. The English won all three matches at a canter, scoring fourteen goals and brushing aside their opposition to take the title. The fancied Scots also performed well, winning against Wales and Northern Ireland before succumbing to England in the final match.

For surface combat they had one deck gun. Construction and service The Holland 602 design was widely exported during World War I and the Imperial Russian Navy ordered a total of 17, in three batches, of a version known as the American Holland-class (AG in Russian for Amerikansky Golland (American Holland)). The submarines were to be built in Canada as knock-down kits for assembly in Russia. Components for the first batch of five submarines were assembled in Barnet, near Vancouver, Canada, and shipped to Vladivostok. There they were loaded onto the Trans-Siberian Railroad and transported to Saint Petersburg where they were assembled by the Baltic Works by June 1916. During World War I Russian and British submarines operated from bases in Finland. The Russian submarines of Holland type (AG-11, AG-12, AG-15 and AG-16) were scuttled in the harbor of Hanko on 3 April 1918 just prior to the German landing there.Polmar & Noot, pp. 239‚Äì40 AG-12 and AG-16 seemed to be in relatively good shape and the Finns decided to salvage them.

It is significant for being the location of the Aspectuck Historic District, a well-preserved collection of houses from the 18th and 19th centuries. The area was settled in the 17th century. It was a long-time home of Helen Keller. According to a New York Times real estate section article, \\"The district gets its name from the Aspetuck Indians, who lived along the river. In 1670, they sold the land to English settlers for cloth, winter wheat and maize valued at $.36.\\" Weston was incorporated in 1787, and Easton was split out and incorporated in 1845. Aspetuck Historic District The Aspetuck Historic District is a historic district that preserves part of the historic village. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1991. It occupies about on the banks of the Aspetuck River and includes the oldest section of Easton. The 22 houses in the historic district date from 1750 to 1850. Some structures in the district are examples of Colonial Revival architecture. The district is considered significant for being a \\"Connecticut farming community that hasn't seen much change\\" and the home of Helen Keller in her later years.Mary McAleer Vizard, If You're Thinking of Living in: Easton, The New York Times, Published: Sunday, April 14, 1991 Helen Keller, who was blind and deaf, often walked through the neighborhood by herself, using as her guide a fence that extended down to the Aspetuck River. The historic district is defined to \\"exclude excessive back acreage\\" and also \\"the district stops short of the historical extent of the community in order to exclude an area where the majority of buildings would be noncontributing due to alterations or recent origin.\\" The district \\"is significant because it embodies the distinctive architectural and cultural-landscape characteristics of a farming community from the late colonial and early national periods.... The widely spaced distribution of houses, most accompanied by a barn and all with ample yards that once served as pasture, field or garden recalls the appearance of an inland Connecticut farming community when agriculture was the basis of the local economy.

They were caught in a storm while crossing the English Channel and prayed to die on land rather than at sea. Their ship being driven ashore by the storm onto the Isle of Wight, they were quickly seized by the local authorities. In court, they pleaded that they had not violated the law by landing in England, as their landing was involuntary, being forced ashore by the storm. This led to their being summoned to London, where they were given the opportunity to take the Oath of Supremacy, acknowledging Elizabeth as the Supreme Governor of the Church of England. Although they acknowledged Elizabeth as their lawful queen in all secular affairs, they would not swear the Oath. As failure to take the oath was considered treason under the Second Act of Supremacy, Anderton and Marsden were found guilty of treason. The sentence was then confirmed, and a proclamation was published, explaining their guilt. They were taken back to the Isle of Wight near the spot where they had landed and executed by hanging, drawing, and quartering on 25 April 1586. He was beatified by Pope Pius XI in 1929.

The submarine was fabricated in Canada, shipped to Russia and reassembled for service with the Baltic Fleet. The boat was originally named AG-13, but was redesignated AG-16 after it sank and was repaired in 1917. Description AG-13 was a single-hulled submarine, with a pressure hull divided into five watertight compartments. The submarine had a length of overall, a beam of and a draft of . She displaced on the surface and submerged. The AG-class submarines had a diving depth of and a crew of 30 officers and enlisted men.Polmar & Noot, pp. 240‚Äì41 The submarine had two 3-bladed propellers, each of which was driven by a diesel engine as well as a electric motors. This arrangement gave AG-22 a maximum speed of while surfaced and submerged. She had a range of at while on the surface and at while submerged.Polmar & Noot, p. 240 Her fuel capacity was of fuel oil.Watts, p. 170 The AG-class submarines were equipped with four torpedo tubes in the bow and carried eight torpedoes. For surface combat they had one deck gun. Construction and service The Holland 602 design was widely exported during World War I and the Imperial Russian Navy ordered a total of 17, in three batches, of a version known as the American Holland-class (AG in Russian for Amerikansky Golland (American Holland)). The submarines were to be built in Canada as knock-down kits for assembly in Russia. Components for the first batch of five submarines were assembled in Barnet, near Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, and shipped to Vladivostok. There they were loaded onto the Trans-Siberian Railroad and transported to Saint Petersburg where they were assembled by the Baltic Works by June 1916. AG-13 accidentally sank in 1917 and was redesignated AG-16 when salvaged and put back into service. During World War I Russian and British submarines operated from bases in Finland. The Russian submarines of Holland type (AG-11, AG-12, AG-15 and AG-16) were scuttled in the harbor of Hanko on 3 April 1918 just prior to the German landing there.Polmar & Noot, pp. 239‚Äì40 AG-12 and AG-16 seemed to be in relatively good shape and the Finns decided to salvage them. AG-16 was transferred to Helsinki and the Finns asked both Germany and Electric Boat for estimates on the cost of repairs. The latter was so costly so only the German alternative remained. German experts evaluated AG-16, but the Finnish government never provided funds for the repairing of the submarine. The repairs would be costly and no shipyard were prepared to guarantee the results. The submarine was stored on dry land until 1929 when the Finnish government finally agreed on the new Fleet program, which also included new submarines. AG-16 was then scrapped.

The event was part of the greater Russian famine of 1921‚Äì22 that affected other parts of the USSR, in which up 5,000,000 people died in total. According to Roman Serbyn, a professor of Russian and East European history, the Tatarstan famine was the first man-made famine in the Soviet Union and systematically targeted ethnic minorities such as Volga Tatars and Volga Germans. Background Soviet leadership had long sought to suppress Tatar nationalism in the USSR. Tatars were frequently charged with \\"bourgeois nationalism\\" and other revisionist crimes. Tatar leadership was executed or imprisoned, which many fled the USSR to Turkey for refuge. Collectivization of Tatar agriculture began in 1921. According to historian James Minahan, Crimean Tatars in particular \\"suffered proportionally greater population losses than any other Soviet national group during the first decades of Soviet rule.\\" Farming methods in the Tatar ASSR were outdated, similar to most non-Russian nationalities in the Soviet Union. In addition, very few indigenous Tatar proletariat existed due to Russian imperial dominance. Famine In early spring of 1921, the Cheka reported massive protests and riots among peasants. By 23 March, reports began to describe the developments in some kantons as a \\"famine\\" and documented peasants starving to death and committing suicide. In response to the lack of food, many peasants prevented grain trucks from leaving Tatarstan and some refused to sow their fields. The famine also saw a large rise in the number of children submitted to orphanages, with poorer parents leaving their children in state institutions and some just abandoning them on the streets to fend for themselves. Orphanages could not keep up with demand, and the Tatar ASSR government devoted resources to expand the number of institutions available. For example, the Sviyazhsk kanton had two orphanages, which kept 64 children in July 1920. By, January 1922, this had expanded to 12 orphanages with 704 children. By March 1922, some villages had lost half their population. The famine also led to a sharp decline in the number of livestock and farming equipment as starving peasants sold off their property or slaughtered the draft animals for food. KGB records from the time note the deaths of at least 500,000 people in Tatarstan, but more recent estimates conclude the actual value was much higher at 2,000,000. Historian James Long approximates that roughly 13% of the Tatar ASSR population fled to other parts of the country while another 10% died. This famine is also known as \\"terror-famine\\" and \\"famine-genocide\\" in Tatarstan. Relief In the summer of 1922, the special committee Tatpomgol was established to cope with the famine. By August 1922, Tatpomgol imported 8 million pood (Russian pounds) of food, including 2 million pounds of seed, with a loan. From the affected regions, hundreds of thousands of people, mostly children, were evacuated to Central Asia, Belarus and Siberia. Emergency feeding points were established throughout the republic. The Soviet government invited international organizations, such as Workers International Relief to assist. The United States government provided aid to starving Tatars in from 1920 to 1923 through the American Relief Administration. Aftermath Though the most hard-hitting phase of the famine ended in 1922, shortages, starvation, and illness continued in the Volga region throughout 1923 and into 1924, and the Soviet government settled ethnic Russians into the Tatar ASSR and in Idel-Ural region in this time causing the Tatars' share of the population to eventually decline to less than 50%. In 2008, the All-Russian Tatar Social Center (VTOTs) asked the United Nations to condemn the 1921‚Äì22 Tatarstan famine as genocide of Muslim Tatars.

The family, through lucrative business ventures, savvy political maneuvering, and strategic marriages, embarked on what Leila Fawaz called \\"the most spectacular social climb of the nineteenth century,\\" and, by their peak, had built a close network of relations to the families of Egyptian, French, Irish, Russian, Italian and German aristocracies, alongside a manufacturing and distribution empire spanning the Mediterranean. Overview Sursock Museum in Beirut, Lebanon Sursock Villa The Sursocks were one of Beirut's aristocratic Christian families that moved freely in Ottoman, Egyptian and European high societies. The Sursocks were an integral part of an international bourgeoisie centered in Alexandria, Beirut, Cairo, Constantinople, Paris and Rome. They were one of the \\"Seven Families\\" in Beirut's aristocratic nobility. Their wealth and sophistication are also reflected in their residences, equal in elegance to any Italian palazzo, which remained largely unscathed despite fifteen years of mortar fire and violence. In the 17th century, members of the Sursock family served as tax collectors and held other key positions on behalf of the Ottoman Empire. As a result, they benefitted greatly from the 1858 Ottoman land reforms, during which they acquired large tracts of fertile land in Palestine and Syria, in addition to extensive holdings from Egypt to Beirut. The means by which this Greek- Orthodox Ottoman family came into possession of such particularly palatial real estate were multiple. As a long line of land owners and tax collectors, the Sursocks were able to leverage their finances and capital using their connections to American, Russian, German and French consuls over the decades to establish extensive economic and political connections. The family developed wide social ties and was close to key Ottoman and European figures, frequently playing host to a wide range of royals and diplomats, including King Abdul Aziz of Saudi Arabia, William I, Sultan Abdul Hamid II and Emperor Franz Joseph of Austria, amongst other monarchs. Search for \\"Sursuq\\". The Sursocks built their fortune through their successful manufacturing and transportation empire, which extended from Turkey to Egypt and ultimately to the United Kingdom. Dimitri Sursock was the founder of \\"Sursock and Brothers,\\" a prominent firm in nineteenth century Beirut which acted as an agent for Lascaridi and Company in the 1850s and 1860s and shipped grain to London, Cyprus and throughout Europe. The firm and its assets were subsequently taken over by his sons after his death: Nicolas, Moussa, Loutfallah, Khalil, Ibrahim and Joseph. In addition to their manufacturing and export activities, the family increased its fortune as landowners in the Ottoman Levant, amassing profits from both rent and tax collection, as well as from the sale of their many properties. Based in Beirut, the family owned many properties along the Mediterranean region, and, for over one hundred years, the Sursocks owned a significant amount of real estate in the heart of Mersin, Turkey, including many shops and properties in the eponymous Sursock Quarter of the city.http://www.rosegeorge.com/frameworks/generic/public_users/morearticles.asp?ArticleID=51 Their financial activities were wide-ranging, and included shipping and the production of silk and other goods built for transport to London and throughout the region. The Sursocks also became heavily involved in banking in Egypt and Lebanon, where they helped finance major projects including the Suez Canal, the Beirut-Damascus highway, and the Beirut Harbour Company. The family also served as direct creditors to Ismail Pasha and other members of Egyptian royalty, who soon found themselves heavily involved with and indebted to the family. As a result of their extensive financial activities, the family was branded \\"the Rothschilds of the East,\\" and indeed engaged the Rothschild banking family during their sale of the Jezreel Valley to the Jewish National Fund in 1906. The Sursocks are recorded as having been deeply intertwined in Freemasonry at the time, under the Grand Orient of France, with many speculating on the reasons behind the family's rise. George Dimitri Sursock, Worshipful Master of the Grand Orient lodge, recorded his extensive dealings with, and on behalf of, the masonry. However, members of the family also gained notoriety for taking advantage of the famine in Lebanon during the First World War by selling overpriced basic food supplies, and for selling large swaths of Arab land in Palestine to Jewish settlers, who demanded the oftentimes forceful eviction of the peasant residents. Beirut how you've changed ... or have you?MidEastWeb The Report of Sir John Hope Simpson, 1930 In the wake of the Lebanese Civil War many members of the family relocated to various European and Asian capitals, but Lady Cochrane Sursock remained in Beirut as the family matriarch. Despite the vast damage to Beirut during the conflict, the main Sursock residence lies untouched alongside buildings whose outer walls bear scars caused by years of violence. History For many decades, the Sursocks were Lebanon's leading business family. As business partners of the Otis Elevator Company, they were successful industrialists and played a key role in the development and manufacturing of elevators.Saudi Aramco World : Made In: Lebanon The Sursocks have shaped Lebanon's history from the late Ottoman period to present; indeed, the selection of Beirut, which would come to be known as the 'Pearl of the Orient,' as the provincial capital was in no small part the result of their entreaties to the Porte. According to Lady Cochrane Sursock, daughter of Alfred Bey Sursock and Donna Maria Teresa Serra di Cassano, the name is a corruption of ŒöœÖœÅŒπŒµ ŒôœÉŒ±Œ±Œ∫ (\\"Kyrie Isaac\\", meaning Lord Isaac).Lady Cochrane Sursock: Information and Much More from Answers.com settling near Byblos. Other sources list the name as having been derived from the Arabic phrases for \\"secrets\\" and \\"market.\\" Towards the close of the 18th century the Sursock family then moved to Beirut where they subsequently became successful traders, exporting grain from the east Mediterranean to the United Kingdom, whilst also engaging in the import of textiles from Europe to be sold throughout the Middle East. Nicolas Sursock founded the Banque Sursock et Fr√®res in 1858 and purchased extensive properties throughout different parts of the Ottoman Empire. The Sursocks soon became prot√©g√©s and dragomen to numerous European and American consul-generals and were afforded political privileges and protection by the various countries with whom they had ties, including Russia, Germany, Greece, Ireland and the United States of America. Moussa Sursock, the 8th Duke of Cassano, his brothers and his father Alfred are reported to have travelled on Greek and Russian passports as well as to have gained prot√©g√© status with other European consulates in Beirut as a result of their wide-ranging activities. Furthermore, the Sursocks' heavy involvement in Egyptian affairs allowed the family to form close relations with members of the monarchy including Khedive Sa'id of Egypt, who reigned from 1854 to 1863, and his nephew Isma'il Pasha (1863-1879), affording them preferential deals on large infrastructural projects and extravagant public works. Alfred Sursock's Pine Residence The Sursocks‚Ä≤ success was measured by their admission to the highest circles of both the Ottoman and European elite political spheres. They formed close connections with officials in Constantinople, while aristocrats often approached them to intercede on their behalf with the Ottoman government. One sign of their intimacy with the sources of Ottoman power was the appointment of Alfred Sursock to the post of secretary at the Ottoman embassy in Paris in 1905, who then joined Moussa, Michel and Yusuf Sursock in taking seats within the Ottoman power structure. In addition to connections with Paris, a French report written the following year listed Moussa Sursock as dragoman of the German Consul, and a year later, Mathilde Sursock married Alberto Theodoli, the Italian president of the League of Nations Permanent Mandates Commission, in Paris, thereby extending the family's reach around the Mediterranean. Further evidence of the Sursocks' influence can be found in the court accounts recorded under Russian Grand Duke Nicolai Nikolaevich, identifying Nicolas Sursock, who had long maintained a strong relationship with the court, as an \\"Honorary Dragoman\\" of Russia. Alfred, meanwhile, moved throughout the titled circles of Europe and married Donna Maria Teresa Serra di Cassano, daughter of Francesco Serra, 7th Duke of Cassano, who came from an old Italian princely family from Naples. Their daughter Yvonne would be known as Lady Cochrane after marrying Sir Desmond Cochrane, 3rd Baronet, bearing four children. Michel Sursock, a deputy to the Ottoman parliament, became infamous during the great famine in the First World War for hoarding grain and speculating on the supply. He would not sell the grain, which cost 40 piastres in peacetime, for less than 250 piastres. Assets ;Beirut When Moussa Sursock died in 1890, his grand share of the Sursock family assets was divided amongst his brothers, nephews, wife, three sons and five daughters. The assets left to the family included a wide range of real estate in and around Beirut, Mersin (Adana, Turkey), Tartus (Syria) and Alexandria (Egypt) which afforded the heirs significant influence over the region. Moussa also passed on extensive rural holdings, including entire villages in Egypt and Palestine, land situated on Mount Lebanon and, notably, a chateau that would become the fashionable resort of Sofar on Mount Lebanon. The Sursock villa in Sofar, constructed in the early twentieth century by Alfred Sursock for his wife Donna Maria di Cassano, bears original foundation inscriptions that proclaim the wealth of these merchants-turned-aristocrats. Though this Greek Orthodox family of foreign proteges often adopted the style and manners of French and other European elite, the Arabic inscriptions indicate deep traces of an Ottoman alliance stretching back centuries. Nicolas Sursock built himself a spectacular private villa in 1912 and decreed in his will that the villa be transformed into a museum after his death. Thus, when he died in 1952 the villa was bequeathed to the city of Beirut. The Sursock mansion, built in 1912, is an exceptional, pearl white structure at the top of a hill in Beirut's luxurious Achrafieh neighbourhood. Bringing out the best of both Venetian and Ottoman architecture, the building is a pool of influences, not dissimilar to the capital itself. Originally the residence of aristocratic art-lover Nicolas Sursock, it was bequeathed to the city on his death in 1952. The Sursock Museum collection consists of 5,000 pieces, including paintings, sculptures, ceramics, glassware, and iconography, all of which date back to the 18th, 19th, and 20th centuries.Guides.hotelbook.com, Events Guide: Sursock Museum (Sursock Museum, Beirut, Lebanon) The Sursock Museum building embodies Lebanese architecture with its Italianate, specifically Venetian, and Ottoman architectural influences.Daratalfunun.org The museum is currently undergoing an extensive US$12 million renovation led by French architect Jean-Michel Wilmotte and Lebanese architect Jacques Aboukhaled. Rue Sursock, in the Achrafieh district of Beirut, is named after the family, which owned and continues to own palatial homes on the street, such as Sursock House. Lady Cochrane Sursock, who in 1946 married Sir Desmond Cochrane, is the owner of the Sursock House, as well as a vast amount of property along Rue Sursock, up to the fashionable Rue Gouraud. Gemmayzeh : is the quarter becoming 'less and less convivial'? Nicolas Sursock transformed the house into a museum of art and amassed a large collection of art and glass. But it was Lady Cochrane's father, Alfred Bey Sursock, who initially expanded the size of the Sursock palace gardens and contributed most to the collections of art, carpets and other exquisite items, which are amongst the finest and best preserved in the Middle East. The palace is also home to a large collection of Italian artwork from the 16th and 17th centuries, many contemporary Lebanese pieces and antique Lebanese jewelry. In 1918, the Sursock family financed the building of the Beirut Hippodrome.Mannheim, Ivan. Syria & Lebanon Handbook: The Travel Guide, page 409 Alfred Sursock, who funded the endeavor, agreed to a deal with the city of Beirut regarding the development of 600,000 square meters in Beirut's pine forest. The Hippodrome project was to include a public causeway, a movie theater and a casino in addition to the hippodrome itself. The hippodrome complex was ultimately built in 1921, with the casino eventually becoming the seat of the French Mandate Authorities in Lebanon. The Sursocks had also previously built Lebanon's first casino, the Sawfar Grand Hotel, in the late 1880s. In 1882, a consortium headed by the Sursock family won an Ottoman concession for the construction of a railway across the Jezreel Valley. The family sought to build a railway there both to raise land value around the line, which was mostly family-owned, and to enjoy economies of scale in the transport of goods from the Hauran, also owned by the family, to the Mediterranean Sea for export. In 1883, Sir Laurence Oliphant founded a company along with Gottlieb Schumacher, one of the founders of the German Colony of Haifa, to find investors for attaining a construction permit for the Sursock family, and capital for the construction itself.Land of Progress: Palestine in the Age of Colonial Development, 1905-1948, Jacob Norris On June 13, 1883, early surveying work was completed and Oliphant began to look for investors, both in Britain and Germany. In a letter he wrote to the Duke of Sutherland, Oliphant claimed that the construction of the line was extremely important both politically and economically, that it would eventually serve as the connection between Asia Minor, the Fertile Crescent, and Egypt, and expressed fear that the line would be under sole German ownership. Oliphant and his peers advertised the line as extremely profitable for investors, estimating the gain at 34%, and promising additional permits to construct additional extensions, a modern port in Haifa or Acre, and a shipping company. For that purpose, Oliphant purchased additional lands on Haifa's coast, and in the Megiddo area. Despite these efforts, the plans failed ‚Äî the British government, the only one interested in the project, sent the Duke of Sutherland to inspect it, who refused to help sponsor the project. The Lebanese families headed by Mr. Sursock, who wished to build the railway for their personal needs, instead saw their permit and subsequent deposit with Sultan Abdul Hamid II expire two years later. Notable members Sursock lineage since 1712 Michel Sursock was a high-ranking member of Ottoman parliament and a senior dragoman to the Persian Empire, having been granted the title \\"Senator of the Empire.\\" Similarly, Moussa, Michel-Ibrahim and Yusuf Sursock all served as members of Ottoman parliament for a number of years, beginning in 1912. Girgi Dimitri Sursock (1852-1913), married Marie Assad Zahar and was dragoman at the German General Consulate in Beirut. He was decorated with the Order of Osmanieh. He published several books, including Tarikh al-Yunan and Kitab al-ta'lim al-adabi. He was in contact with many intellectuals of al-Nahda, but also with foreign scientists, including the orientalist Martin Hartmann.Sa√Ød Chaaya, Lettres de Girgi Dimitri Sursock √† Martin Hartmann: La diplomatie allemande dans la Beyrouth ottomane, Paris, Geuthner, 2018. Freemason, he was for many years the Worshipful Master of \\"Le Liban\\" Lodge in Beirut. George Moussa Sursock had developed close ties with a wide variety of rulers and members of Europe's monarchy, from Franz Joseph of Austria to William of Germany and Louis Prince of Battenberg. Moussa was also involved in Freemasonry, as is evidenced in archives and letters addressed to the Grand Orient in Paris, dated April 1906, as well as in other sources such as \\"Les Grandes Families.\\" Alfred Bey Sursock married Donna Maria Teresa Serra, daughter of Francesco Serra, 7th Duke of Cassano. His daughter Yvonne married the British aristocrat Sir Desmond Cochrane, 3rd Bart. and became known as Lady Cochrane Sursock. His first cousin Nicolas married Alfred‚Ä≤s sister-in-law Donna Vittoria Serra of the Dukes di Cassano, also a daughter of the Duke. Nicolas‚Ä≤ eldest sister married Marchese Alberto Theodoli, and his youngest, Isabelle, married the head of the Colonna family, an ancient Roman family whose history spans nine hundred years. Catherine Aleya Beriketti Sursock, who was born in Alexandria, Egypt in 1938 and was formerly the wife of Lebanese aristocrat Cyril Sursock (son of Nicolas Sursock and Donna Vittoria Serra of the Dukes di Cassano), married Prince Sadruddin Aga Khan in November 1972 in the British West Indies. (His father, Sir Sultan Muhammad Shah, Aga Khan III is said to have traced his bloodline to the Prophet Muhammad and was the leader of the Ismailis, who form the second largest branch of Shia Islam). The Prince's marriage to Catherine brought with it three sons: Alexandre Sursock, who married Thai Mom Rajawongse Charuvan Rangsit Prayurasakdi, Marc Sursock and Nicolas Sursock. Alexandre Sursock, son of Cyril Sursock, married Princess Mom Rajawongse Charuvan Rangsit of Thailand (by Mom Nalini) on 9 September 1978. Michail (Michael) Sursock is a leading figure in Asia's Private Equity and financial sphere, where he continues to serve as an adviser to numerous companies, having built his name as a leader of several multinational businesses across Europe, America and Asia. Michail has spent time as CEO of KKR Capstone for Asia Pacific, as a Managing Director at Motorola Inc, and as a President with Mars across three continents. Additionally Mr. Sursock is an Advisor and Speaker at the Tuck School of Leadership Dartmouth and a member of its Asia Advisory Board. He is also a member of the Marshall Goldsmith Leadership 100. Robert Sursock, over many decades, established himself as a premier banker in Paris and beyond, having built and grown such institutions as PrimeCorp Finance, Gazprombank Invest Mena and Banque Arabe et Internationale d'Investissement. Cairo's most famous restaurant entrepreneur, Nicha Sursock, the co-owner of world-renowned restaurant and bar \\"L'aubergine\\", is also a member of the prominent Greek Orthodox family, while Cici Tommaseo Sursock was a renowned artist having hosted exhibitions throughout the world, including in Lausanne, Beirut, Cairo, New York, Rome. Isabelle H√©l√®ne Sursock fell in love with Prince , who brought her to Italy, where she was able to integrate successfully into Roman high society at a time when it had to deal with Mussolini. After the end of the monarchy in 1946 Isabelle effectively replaced queen Marie Jos√© as the substitute queen of Italy, hosting regal receptions where royalty and, among the bourgeoisie, only financiers and bankers were allowed. Donna Isabelle, as she then became known, occupied a prime position amongst the √©lite of Roman society throughout her long life up to the 1980s. She was a lady of great intelligence and power who intensely guarded the artistic collection of the family throughout the darkest periods of both world wars. She shielded persecuted Jews and resisted the fascists wherever possible. She and her husband were immensely loyal to the Holy See, so much so that she was given the rare honor of Vatican citizenship. The \\"alternate queen,\\" as she was known in Italy's elite circles, never abandoned her palace (Palazzo Colonna), which she so profoundly loved, and continued to weave her diplomatic skills at the highest level, receiving heads of state and royalty from half the world. Narrowly escaping arrest by the Neofascists, Isabelle dedicated her life to preserving the uppermost interests and image of the family. Sursock Archives The halls of the Sursock Palace contain the historical archives of the Sursock family empire. The archives, which are divided into three categories (public, private, and commercial-accounting), primarily span from the years 1876 to 1978 and record the activities of Alfred, Moussa, Nicolas, Princess Isabelle, Lady Cochrane and other particularly prominent members of this small Greek-Orthodox family. An extensive study on the archives and the family itself can be found in Lorenzo Trombetta's 'The Private Archive of the Sursocks (Sursuqs), A Beirut Family of Christian Notables: An Early Investigation.' Land sales to the Rothschild Family and early Zionist settlement Land Sale Records ;Jezreel Valley The family owned more than 90,000 acres, or 400,000 dunams, (364 km¬≤) in the Jezreel Valley in Palestine, having purchased it from Ottoman authorities in their dealings with the empire.Dr. Seth J. Frantzman, Ruth Kark Bedouin Settlement in Late Ottoman and British Mandatory Palestine: Influence on the Cultural and Environmental Landscape, 1870-1948, p.8. 2011 Evidence of the remarkable concentration of wealth accumulated by the Sursocks, who already owned tens of thousands of acres of the finest land in the region, can be found in records detailing their sustained purchases of numerous new villages every year. In 1872, the Ottoman Government sold Marj ibn Amir to the Sursock family of Beirut. The Zionists began to show interest in buying the Jezreel Valley in 1891, but the Palestine Land Development Company (PLDC), a Zionist land purchasing agency, made its first purchases in 1910. In 1897, Theodore Herzl writes about the Sursock family in his diary, noting the onset of negotiations with the Jewish Colonisation Organization for the purchase of 97 villages in Palestine.The Complete Diaries of Theodor Herzl, ed. Raphael Patai, Herzl Press and Thomas Yoseloff, New York-London, vol.2, p.519. In ancient times Esdraelon was the granary, and regarded as the most fertile tract of Palestine. The Sursocks were absentee landlords in the vast Marj Ibn \`Amer (Jezreel Valley) in Northern Palestine. The Jewish National Fund was founded in 1901 by funding from the Baron to buy and develop land in Ottoman Palestine for Jewish settlement. The PLDC acquired land for the Jewish National Fund (JNF). Official purchasing organizations such as the Palestine Land Development Company focused on consummating the transfer of some 65,000 dunams of land in the Jezreel Valley owned by the Sursocks. On 18 December 1918, the PDLC concluded an agreement with Nagib and Albert Sursock for the purchase of 71,356 dunams in the Jezreel Valley, including Tel Adashim. The Ottomans tried to limit mass land acquisition and immigration, but had their hands tied by European pressure and also corruption and greed of officials and large landowners. The sale of land in Marj ibn Amer is a noted case. Hankin of the KKL transacted the final settlement of purchase in 1921. Hankin originally worked for the PLDC and then became the main land speculator for both agencies. Beirut how you've changed ... or have you? The buyers demanded the existing settlers be relocated and as a result, the Arab tenant farmers were evicted, with some receiving compensation the buyers were not required by law to pay.Hope Simpson Report Because the villagers paid tithes to the Sursock family in Beirut for the right to work the agricultural lands in the villages, they were deemed tenant farmers by the British Mandate authorities in Palestine, and the right of the Sursock family to sell the land to the JNF was upheld by the authorities. Edmond de Rothschild began investing in Palestine at the age of 37, in 1882. In 1923, he founded the Palestine Jewish Colonization Association (PICA), which carried on his work under his son, James Armand de Rothschild (1878-1957). By 1930, PICA had amassed 5,200 hectares in various parts of the country, on which it established 50 settlements that reflected the diverse models that had evolved by this time: villages (such as Pardes Hanna, Binyamina and Givat Ada, all named for members of the Rothschild family), kibbutzim, moshavim and urban localities such as Bnei Brak and Herzliya. PICA continued to assist rural settlements as well as developing or financing economic enterprises of lasting importance in the Israeli economy ‚Äì wineries, the Potash Company, the Electric Company and Nesher Cement, to name a few. By the end of the Mandate (1948), PICA possessed a large proportion of the Jewish-owned land in Palestine. In the next 17 years, the Baron spent $100 million in purchasing lands, building factories, schools and hospitals. In 1912, the PLDC contracted to purchase a large tract in the Jezreel Valley from the Sursock family of Beirut and Alexandria, but was unable to complete the transaction due to World War I. In 1929, under the British Mandate, the Sursocks sold the valley to the Baron Rothschild. The European dynasty of German Jewish origin that established European banking and finance houses from the late eighteenth century had established a fund to buy land in Palestine and encourage the immigration of Jews to Palestine.The Palestine Jewish Colonisation Association ‚Äì PICA- was founded in 1924 by Edmond to administer the settlements in Palestine and took over the role of the Jewish Colonisation Association of 1900. PICA was the largest Jewish landowner in Palestine. Edmond‚Äôs involvement with Jewish settlements began in 1882 when he funded Rishon Le-Zion (‚ÄòThe First in Zion‚Äô) He established Zikhron Yaakov and Mazkeret Batya (named after his parents) and built social and religious institutions there. Edmond also stimulated the economic development by investing in new crops, such as wine, grapefruit and avocado, and industrial enterprises such as silk production. After Edmond‚Äôs death in 1934 his son James de Rothschild (1878-1957) presided over the affairs of PICA until in 1957, the year of his death, he decided to transfer all PICA holdings to national institutions. His determination to continue to support Israeli institutions was carried out after his death by his wife, Dorothy (1895-1988), who founded Yad Hanadiv. When Edmond died in Paris in 1934, he left a legacy which included the reclamation of nearly 500,000 dunams of land and almost 30 settlements. In 1953, the JNF was dissolved and re-organized as Keren Kayemet LeYisrael (JNF-KKL). Urgency for large colonization, quick purchase, and rapid self-sufficiency by means of general agriculture made the Jezreel Valley the focus of land purchasing plans. The Zionist Organization thought the Jezreel Valley to be more desirable than even the coastal region where smaller parcels of land were available for purchase. Buying parcels in the coastal region involved more complicated purchasing negotiations. The coastal region was also the center of orange cultivation, a type of agriculture that would not yield a profit for several years, thus potentially impeding the Labor Zionist idea of self reliant settlement.

Campbell Court Elementary, Carver Elementary, Meadowview Elementary, Sanville Elementary, and Stanleytown Elementary feed into Fieldale-Collinsville Middle School, which feeds into Bassett High School. History Bassett High School opened in 1978, replacing the former John D. Bassett High School, which became a middle school.NPS Form 10-900 Declining enrollment in the 1990s left each of the four Henry County high schools operating at less than 50% capacity. In 2003, the county implemented a controversial reorganization plan which consolidated Fieldale- Collinsville High School and Bassett High School at the Bassett High School site. The school name and mascot remained the same but orange, one of the Fieldale-Collinsville school colors, was added to the Bassett blue and white. Following its closure as a high school, Fieldale-Collinsville became a middle school, serving students in the Bassett High School attendance zone. Demographics Bassett High School's student body is 73% White; 21% Black; and 5% Hispanic. Forty-three percent of Bassett students receive free or reduced lunch. The school serves a geographic area which encompasses the communities of Bassett, Collinsville, Fieldale, Oak Level, Stanleytown and Villa Heights. The current principal is Tiffiny M. Gravely. Academics The school operates on a 4x4 block schedule. The school year is divided into two semesters and six six-week grading periods. Students may earn eight course credits during one school year. Students are also offered summer school programs to boost their GPAs. Bassett High School's program of studies includes ten Advanced Placement (AP) courses, and other career development and technical courses. The school provides opportunities for some of its students to attend the Piedmont Governor's School for Mathematics, Science, and Technology, which is located at 191 Fayette Street, In Martinsville, Virginia. =Accreditation= Bassett High School is fully accredited based on the 2010-2011 results of the Virginia Standards of Learning tests. The school has met federal standards for Adequate Yearly Progress (AYP) as required by the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001.Bassett High School, Virginia Schools  Schoolmatters.com Athletics and extracurricular programs Bassett teams play in the AA Piedmont District of the AA Region IV. The mascot is the Bengal. The Bengal athletic program competes in the Virginia High School League's interscholastic sports. The varsity football team won the AA Region IV championship in 2006.

They are also known as Ilhava, Irava, Izhava and Erava in the south of the region; as Chovas, Chokons and Chogons in Central Travancore; and as Thiyyar, Tiyyas and Theeyas in the Malabar region. Some are also known as Thandan, which has caused administrative difficulties due to the presence of a distinct caste of Thandan in the same region. The Malabar Thiyyar group have claimed a higher ranking in the Hindu caste system than do the others, although from the perspective of the colonial and subsequent administrations they were treated as being of similar rank.Nossiter (1982) p. 30 As well as being agricultural labourers, small cultivators, toddy tappers and liquor businessmen, some Ezhavas were also involved in weaving and some practised Ayurveda. Thiyyar dynasties such as the Mannanar existed in Kerala.Pullapilly (1976) pp. 31‚Äì32 The Chekavar, a warrior section within the Thiyyar community, served the army of the Chera dynasty; there were also renowned Kalaripayattu experts among Chekavars. In the present day, the Ezhavas are classified as an Other Backward Class by the Government of India under its system of positive discrimination. History =Legend= There are myths of origin for the Ezhava. According to some Malayalam folk songs and legend, the Ezhavas were the progeny of four bachelors that the king of Ceylon sent to what is now Kerala at the request of the Chera king Bhaskara Ravi Varma, in the 1st century CE. These men were sent, ostensibly, to set up coconut farming in the region.Pullapilly (1976) pp. 25‚Äì26 Another version of the story says that the king sent eight martial families at the request of a Chera king to quell a civil war that had erupted against him. =Social and religious divergence= It has been suggested that the Ezhavas may share a common heritage with the Nair caste. This theory is based on similarities between numerous of the customs adopted by the two groups, particularly with regard to marking various significant life stages such as childbirth and death, as well as their matrilineal practices and martial history. Oral history, folk songs and other old writings indicate that the Ezhavas were at some point in the past members of the armed forces serving various kings, including the Zamorins of Calicut and the rulers of the Cochin dynasty. Cyriac Pullapilly has said that only a common parentage can explain some of these issues.Pullapilly (1976) pp. 26‚Äì30 A theory has been proposed for the origins of the caste system in the Kerala region based on the actions of the Aryan Jains introducing such distinctions prior to the 8th-century AD. This argues that the Jains needed protection when they arrived in the area and recruited local sympathizers to provide it. These people were then distinguished from others in the local population by their occupation as protectors, with the others all being classed as out-caste. Pullapilly describes that this meant they \\"... were given kshatriya functions, but only shudra status. Thus originated the Nairs.\\" The Ezhavas, not being among the group protecting the Jains, became out-castes. An alternate theory states that the system was introduced by the Nambudiri Brahmins. Although Brahmin influences had existed in the area since at least the 1st century CE, there was a large influx from around the 8th century when they acted as priests, counsellors and ministers to invading Aryan princes. At the time of their arrival the non-aboriginal local population had been converted to Buddhism by missionaries who had come from the north of India and from Ceylon. The Brahmins used their symbiotic relationship with the invading forces to assert their beliefs and position. Buddhist temples and monasteries were either destroyed or taken over for use in Hindu practices, thus undermining the ability of the Buddhists to propagate their beliefs. The Buddhist tradition of the Ezhavas, and the refusal to give it up, pushed them to an outcaste role within the greater Brahminic society. This tradition is still evident as Ezhavas show greater interest in the moral, non-ritualistic, and non-dogmatic aspects of the religion rather than the theological. Past occupations The social anthropologists Filippo and Caroline Osella say that the Ezhavas \\"... consisted in the mid-nineteenth century of a small landowning and titled elite and a large mass of landless and small tenants who were largely illiterate, considered untouchable, and who eked out a living by manual labour and petty trade.\\" A. Aiyappan, another social anthropologist and himself a member of the caste, noted the mythical belief that the Ezhava brought coconut palms to the region when they moved from Ceylon. Their traditional occupation, or avakasam, was tending to and tapping the sap of such palms. This activity is sometimes erroneously referred to as toddy tapping, toddy being a liquor manufactured from the sap. Arrack was another liquor produced from the palms, as was jaggery (an unrefined sugar). In reality, most Ezhavas were agricultural labourers and small-time cultivators, with a substantial number diverging into the production of coir products, such as coconut mats for flooring, from towards the end of the 19th century. The coastal town of Alleppey became the centre of such manufacture and was mostly controlled by Ezhavas, although the lucrative export markets were accessible only through European traders, who monopolised the required equipment. A boom in trade for these manufactured goods after World War I led to a unique situation in twentieth-century Kerala whereby there was a shortage of labour, which attracted still more Ezhavas to the industry from outlying rural areas. The Great Depression impacted in particular on the export trade, causing a reduction in price and in wages even though production increased, with the consequence that during the 1930s many Ezhava families found themselves to be in dire financial circumstances. Some Ezhavas were involved in weaving and ship making. =Martial traditions= Some Thiyyar served in army of local chieftains and local rulers such as of Kadathanad and Kurumbranad of Kerala, who were privileged in the pre-colonial period to have their own private armies. Chekavar A subgroup of the Thiyyas considered themselves to be warriors and became known as the Chekavars. The Vadakkan Pattukal ballads describe Chekavars as forming the militia of local chieftains and kings but the title was also given to experts of Kalari Payattu. =Medicine and traditional toxicology= Some Ezhavas had an extensive knowledge of the medicinal value of plants, passed to them by their ancestors. Known as Vaidyars, these people acted as physicians. Itty Achudan was probably the best known Ezhava physician: he directly influenced the botanical classification in Hortus Malabaricus, published during the 17th century. Achudan's texts were written in the Kolezhuthu script that Ezhava castes used, for they were prevented from learning the more Sanskritised Aryazuthu script which was the preserve of the upper-castes. Some Ezhavas practiced ayurvedic medicine. Culture =Arjuna Nrtam (Mayilpeeli Thookkam)= Arjuna Nrtam (\\"the dance of Arjuna\\") is a ritual art performed by Ezhava men and is prevalent in the Bhagavathy temples of south Kerala, mainly in Kollam, Alappuzha and Kottayam districts. The ritual is also called \\"Mayilpeeli Thookkam\\" because the costume includes a characteristic garment made of mayilppeeli (peacock feathers). This garment is worn around the waist in a similar fashion as the \\"uduthukettu\\" of Kathakali. The various dance movements are similar to kalarippayattu techniques. The performers have their faces painted green and wear distinctive headgears. The all-night performance of the dance is usually presented solo or in pairs. =Makachuttu= Makachuttu art is popular among Ezhavas in Thiruvananthapuram and Chirayinkizhu taluks and in Kilimanoor, Pazhayakunnummal and Thattathumala regions. In this, a group of eight performers, two each, twine around each other like serpents and rise up, battling with sticks. The techniques are repeated several times. Sandalwood paste on the forehead, a red towel round the head, red silk around the waist and bells round the ankles form the costume. This is a combination of snake worship and Kalarippayattu. Krishna Chaitanya, Temple Arts of Kerala: A South Indian Tradition (Abhinav Publications, 1987 ,) =Poorakkali= Poorakkali is a folk dance prevalent among the Ezhavas of Malabar, usually performed in Bhagavathy temples as a ritual offering during the month of Meenam (March‚ÄìApril). Poorakkali requires specially trained and highly experienced dancers, trained in Kalaripayattu. Standing round a traditional lamp, the performers dance in eighteen different stages and rhythms, each phase called a niram. Customs Ezhavas adopted different patterns of behavior in family system across Kerala. Those living in southern Travancore tended to meld the different practices that existed in the other parts of Kerala. The family arrangements of northern Malabar were matrilineal with patrilocal property arrangements, whereas in northern Travancore they were matrilineal but usually matrilocal in their arrangements for property. Southern Malabar saw a patrilineal system but partible property. These arrangements were reformed by legislation, for Malabar in 1925 and for Travancore in 1933. The process of reform was more easily achieved for the Ezhavas than it was for the Nairs, another Hindu caste in Kerala who adopted matrilineal arrangements; the situation for the Nairs was complicated by a traditional matrilocal form of living called taravadu and by their usually much higher degree of property ownership. That said, certainly by the 1880s, the Ezhavas appear increasingly to have tried to adopt Nair practises in a bid to achieve a similar status. Robin Jeffrey notes that their women began to prefer the style of jewellery worn by Nairs to that which was their own tradition. Further, since Nairs cremated their dead, Ezhavas attempted to cremate at least the oldest member of their family, although cost usually meant that the remainder were buried. Other aspirational changes included building houses in the Nair tharavad style and making claims that they had had an equal standing as a military class until the nineteenth century. Spiritual and social movements Narayana Guru Some Thiyyas converted to Islam from around the 9th century, due to the influence of Arab traders. These people, and other Muslim converts in the region, are now known as Mappillas. A sizeable part of the Ezhava community, especially in central Travancore and in the High Ranges, embraced Christianity during the British rule, due to caste- based discrimination. In Kannur, Protestant missions started working in the first half of the 19th century, notably the Basel German Evangelical Mission. Most of their converts were from the Thiyya community. The Congregationalist London Missionary Society and the Anglican Church Mission Society were also prominent in the movement for religious conversion, having established presences in the Travancore region in the early 19th century. The lowly status of the Ezhava meant that, as Thomas Nossiter has commented, they had \\"little to lose and much to gain by the economic and social changes of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries\\". They sought the right to be treated as worthy of an English education and for jobs in government administration to be open to them. An early Ezhava campaigner and their \\"political father\\", according to Ritty Lukose, was Padmanabhan Palpu. In 1896, he organised a petition of 13,176 signatories that was submitted to the Maharajah of the princely state of Travancore, asking for government recognition of the Ezhavas' right to work in public administration and to have access to formal education. Around this time, nearly 93 per cent of the caste members were illiterate. The upper caste Hindus of the state prevailed upon the Maharajah not to concede the request. The outcome not looking to be promising, the Ezhava leadership threatened that they would convert from Hinduism en masse, rather than stay as helots of Hindu society. C. P. Ramaswamy Iyer, realising the imminent danger, prompted the Maharajah to issue the Temple Entry Proclamation, which abolished the ban on lower-caste people from entering Hindu temples in the state. Steven Wilkinson says that the Proclamation was passed because the government was \\"frightened\\" by the Ezhava threat of conversion to Christianity. Eventually, in 1903, a small group of Ezhavas, led by Palpu, established Sree Narayana Dharma Paripalan Yogam (SNDP), the first caste association in the region. This was named after Narayana Guru, who had established an ashram from where he preached his message of \\"one caste, one religion, one god\\" and a Sanskritised version of the Victorian concept of self-help. His influence locally has been compared to that of Swami Vivekananda. One of the initial aims of the SNDP was to campaign for the removal of the restrictions on school entry but even after those legal barriers to education were removed, it was uncommon in practice for Ezhavas to be admitted to government schools. Thus, the campaign shifted to providing schools operated by the community itself. The organisation, attracted support in Travancore but similar bodies in Cochin were less successful. In Malabar, which unlike Cochin and Travancore was under direct British control, the Thiyyas showed little interest in such bodies because they did not suffer the educational and employment discrimination found elsewhere, nor indeed were the disadvantages that they did experience strictly a consequence of caste alone.Nossiter (1982) pp. 30‚Äì32 The Ezhavas were not immune to being manipulated by other people for political purposes. The Vaikom Satyagraha of 1924‚Äì1925 was a failed attempt to use the issue of avarna access to roads around temples in order to revive the fortunes of Congress, orchestrated by T. K. Madhavan, a revolutionary and civil rights activist,Pullapilly (1976) p. 38 and with a famous temple at Vaikom as the focal point. Although it failed in its stated aim of achieving access, the satyagraha (movement) did succeed in voicing a \\"radical rhetoric\\", according to Nossiter. During this movement, a few Akalisan order of armed Sikhscame to Vaikom in support of the demonstrators. After the eventual passing of the Temple Entry Proclamation, some of the Akalis remained. They attracted some Ezhava youth to the concepts of the Sikhism, resulting in Ezhava conversions to that belief. The success of the SNDP in improving the lot of Ezhavas has been questioned. Membership had reached 50,000 by 1928 and 60,000 by 1974, but Nossiter notes that, \\"From the Vaikom satyagraha onwards the SNDP had stirred the ordinary Ezhava without materially improving his position.\\" The division in the 1920s of of properties previously held by substantial landowners saw the majority of Ezhava beneficiaries receive less than one acre each, although 2% of them took at least 40% of the available land. There was subsequently a radicalisation and much political infighting within the leadership as a consequence of the effects of the Great Depression on the coir industry but the general notion of self-help was not easy to achieve in a primarily agricultural environment; the Victorian concept presumed an industrialised economy. The organisation lost members to various other groups, including the Communist movement, and it was not until the 1950s that it reinvented itself as a pressure group and provider of educational opportunities along the lines of the Nair Service Society (NSS), Just as the NSS briefly formed the National Democratic Party in the 1970s in an attempt directly to enter the political arena, so too in 1972 the SNDP formed the Social Revolutionary Party. Position in society They were considered as avarna (outside brahmanical varna system) by the Nambudiri Brahmins who formed the Hindu clergy and ritual ruling elite in late medieval Kerala. Kathleen Gough says that the Thiyyas of Central Travancore were historically the highest-ranking of the \\"higher polluting castes\\", a group whose other constituents included Kanisans and various artisanal castes, and who were all superior in status to the \\"lower polluting castes\\", such as the Pulayars and Paraiyars. The Nairs and, where applicable, the Mapillas ranked socially and ritually higher than the polluting castes. From their study based principally around one village and published in 2000, the Osellas noted that the movements of the late 19th- and 20th centuries brought about a considerable change for the Ezhavas, with access to jobs, education and the right to vote all assisting in creating an identity based on more on class than caste, although the stigmatic label of avarna remained despite gaining the right of access to temples. The Ezhavas are classified as an Other Backward Class by the Government of India under its system of positive discrimination. Dispute between Thiyya and Ezhava Some in the Thiyya community have objected to being treated as Ezhava by the government of Kerala. They have campaigned for the right to record themselves as Thiyya rather than as Ezhava when applying for official posts and other jobs allocated under India's system of positive discrimination. They claim that the stance of the government is contrary to a principle established by the Supreme Court of India relating to a dispute involving communities who were neither Ezhava nor Thiyya. The Thiyya Mahasabha has also opposed the SNDP's use of the Thiyya name at an event. In February 2013, the recently formed Thiyya Mahasabha objected to the SNDP treating Ezhavas and Thiyyas as one group, rather than recognising the Thiyyas in Malabar as being distinct. The SNDP was at that time attempting to increase its relatively weak influence in northern Kerala, where the politics of identity play a lesser role than those of class and the Communist Party of India (Marxist) has historically been a significant organisation.

It opened officially in 1927, but the United States Postal Service had been using the field for a year. After the Portland‚ÄìColumbia Super Airport was completed in the late 1930s, Swan Island Municipal Airport had little use since its runways were too small for newer aircraft and the low altitude made it difficult to land and take-off. It was operational for nearly two decades, but due in part to the advances in aviation, the airport became obsolete soon after its construction. During World War II, a Kaiser shipyard was located at Swan Island. The shipbuilding facilities were acquired by the Port of Portland after the war. History Oakley G. Kelly, the commanding officer at Pearson Airfield in Vancouver, Washington, was one of the first to seriously propose using Swan Island as an airfield. In 1926, the Port of Portland, assisted by the United States Postal Service (USPS), organized a committee to look for a location for a new airport in Portland. The group chose Swan Island which was a peninsula along the Willamette River. Objections over the airport started almost immediately, as postal workers who were using Pearson Airfield claimed Swan Island might flood. A plan was drawn up to raise the elevation of Swan Island to keep floodwater out. W. L. Thompson spearheaded the commission and was the project's chief engineer. James H. Polhemus was the Port of Portland's general manager and chief engineer at the time. The airport photographed in 1935 In a proposal to the Port of Portland, the west channel of the Willamette River next to Swan Island would have to be widened, and a dike built to keep high water out. The project extended its timeline in May 1926, forcing the USPS to keep using Pearson Airfield in Vancouver to deliver mail to the city. Most of the accommodations for the USPS at Swan Island Municipal Airport opened in September 1926, but commercial services were still being readied. The airfield only took-up a fraction of the land on Swan Island. The other areas were cleared and leveled so industrial growth could take place. During its construction, the Port of Portland requested that the Swan Island Municipal Airport be the future site of the Pacific Coast Air Derby, which was approved. Swan Island Municipal Airport was officially dedicated in September 1927 by Charles Lindbergh, who flew the Spirit of St. Louis onto the airstrip. Although the field was not officially complete, most of the facilities like hangars and landing strips were finished. Adjacent from the airport was Rankin Airfield, which was a private strip owned by a North Portland resident. Upon its completion, the airport cost US$557,073 (US$ adjusted for inflation). The official opener for the Swan Island Municipal Airport came on September 27 during the Pacific Coast Air Derby where six army planes performed for 10,000 paid spectators. A gravel runway was installed in 1928, replacing the old dirt one. In 1929, Varney Air Lines started passenger services between Portland and Boise, Idaho and later that year from Portland to Salt Lake City, Utah and Portland to Pasco, Washington. An aircraft at Swan Island Municipal Airport, parked at the terminal The Port of Portland and the Portland City Council held meetings in 1935 to investigate a possible renovation of the Swan Island Municipal Airport. They determined that it would not be cost effective to rebuild the airport to accommodate larger aircraft. By 1936, citizens were petitioning the city council to fund a larger airport at a higher elevation. I. E. Oakes, the Works Progress Administration director for Portland, announced in 1937 that he would look to secure US$627,781 (US$ adjusted for inflation) in funds from the federal government to build a new runway to accommodate large airlines. However, the federal government condemned the site and offered up funds to build a new airport. After the Portland‚ÄìColumbia Super Airport was constructed, the Swan Island Municipal Airport still operated, although in a diminished capacity. Flying students were banned from using the airport in their training programs due to the low altitude. The military removed their facilities from the airport and most commercial liners had moved their services to the new airport. During World War II, Swan Island was the location of a Kaiser shipyard where T2 tankers, Liberty ships, and Victory ships were produced in support of the war effort. After the war, the shipyard became the center for Port of Portland operations.

In 1925, she made her first tango recordings as a soloist with Osvaldo Fresedo's orchestra, for Victor Records. Falc√≥n was a mezzo-soprano, an unusual register at that times for female tango singers, most of whom were sopranos. Falc√≥n reached national and international fame while singing with the orchestra of Francisco Canaro. Between 1930 and 1942 she was at the peak of her artistic life: she recorded more than 200 songs, and became a wealthy artist. Personal life During her years of popularity, Falc√≥n enjoyed luxury items like furs, expensive jewelry and powerful automobiles. She lived in a three story townhouse in the Buenos Aires neighborhood of Palermo. She had a turbulent romantic relationship of ten years with Francisco Canaro, who was a married man at the time. Canaro refused to divorce his wife. Seclusion In 1942 Falc√≥n suddenly withdrew from public life and remained isolated in her house, avoiding contact with the outside world. She occasionally left the house to go to mass dressed entirely in black, her face covered by a net or by sunglasses, wearing a white turban and white gloves. The cause of this withdrawal is a mystery; she never talked about it. Speculation that love disappointments with Canaro could have been an important element was never confirmed. After a while she became a \\"tertiary nun\\" and entered an isolated convent in the hills of C√≥rdoba Province. There she lived as a pauper by her own choice, in a small cell with little furniture and frugal meals, until she was transferred at an advanced age to a retirement home due to failing health. She died in 2002 and is buried in the mausoleum dedicated to famous artists in Chacarita Cemetery in Buenos Aires. Life documentary Filmmakers Lorena Munoz and Sergio Wolf made a documentary about Falc√≥n's life, titled Yo no s√© qu√© me han hecho tus ojos (I Don't Know What Your Eyes Have Done to Me), which was released in 2003. Although she had not allowed her picture to be taken in nearly 60 years and rarely gave interviews, she allowed the filmmakers to film an interview with her shortly before her death.

Within Rome, the church is also known as St. Jesus. It is the \\"national church\\" of the marchigiani, the inhabitants of the Marche region of Italy (the population of each of Italy's regions was counted as a \\"nation\\" before Italian unification). The current protector of this titulus is Cardinal-Deacon Angelo Comastri. The first church at the site dates to the 11th century; while the present building was constructed in the 16th century on designs of the Bolognese Ottaviano Mascherino. The main altarpiece and cupola are painted by Ludovico Rusconi Sassi. In the chapels are works of art by Antoniazzo Romano, Camillo Rusconi, Fran√ßois Duquesnoy, Alessandro Turchi and a Nativity by Pietro da Cortona. The refectory has a series of Mannerist frescoes (1550) by Francesco Salviati (1550), and contains the 15th century tomb of Pope Eugene IV by Isaia da Pisa, transferred here from the Old Saint Peter's Basilica. Parmigianino's Vision of Saint Jerome was commissioned for a chapel in the church, but was later brought away by the donors and is now in the National Gallery, London.

The Russian version of the album was released in 1992, following many lineup changes: Biloshitsky was replaced by Zhirnov, and then by Dmitry Borisenkov. Black Obelisk toured together with Sepultura and Master. 1994's album \\"Ya Ostayus\\" (I Will Stay) was the last album of the classical lineup: Krupnov's alcohol and drugs addiction again triggered the band's crisis. In 1996 Alexeyev leaves to E.S.T., and then Black Obelisk stops its activity. Krupnov tried to reunite the band once again, but died February 27, 1997 in studio from heroin overdose, during the record session. The history of Black Obelisk continued in 1999, when Borisenkov, Yermakov and Svetlov reunited under the old name. Borisenkov became the vocalist and main songwriter. Daniil Zakharenkov became the band's new bass player. In 2000 the album, recording of which was started back in 1996, was completed and released to public under the name \\"Postalbum\\". Black Obelisk is still active, though new lineup led to stylistic changes and less \\"anarchistic\\" lyrics in following albums \\"Pepel\\" (Ashes), \\"Nervi\\" (Nerves) and \\"Zeleny Albom\\" (Green Album), written by Borisenkov. Dmitry also participated in Elven Manuscript metal opera by Epidemia in the role of Deimos the dark lord. In 2009, they released \\"–ß–µ—Ä–Ω–æ–µ –ë–µ–ª–æ–µ\\" (Black & White) internet-single, also putting the songs \\"–ß–µ—Ä–Ω–æ–µ-–ë–µ–ª–æ–µ\\" (Black & White), \\"–í–∞–ª—å—Å\\" (Waltz), \\"–ò—Å—Ö–æ–¥\\" (Exodus), and \\"–ü—Ä–æ—â–∞–π –∏ –ø—Ä–æ—Å—Ç–∏\\" (Farewell & Forgive) for free download on their official website.

Typical examples of resources include network accessible documents, WAIS databases, FTP servers, and Telnet destinations. Locators may apply to resources that are not always or not ever network accessible. Examples of the latter include human beings and physical objects that have no electronic instantiation (that is, objects without an existence completely defined by digital objects such as disk files). A resource locator is a kind of resource identifier. Other kinds of resource identifiers allow names and descriptions to be associated with resources. A resource name is intended to provide a stable handle to refer to a resource long after the resource itself has moved or perhaps gone out of existence. A resource description comprises a body of meta-information to assist resource search and selection. An Internet resource locator is a locator defined by an Internet resource location standard. A resource location standard in conjunction with resource description and resource naming standards specifies a comprehensive infrastructure for network-based information dissemination. Mechanisms for mapping between locators, names, and descriptive identifiers. Network-based information resource providers require a method of describing the location of and access to their resources. Information systems users require a method whereby client software can interpret resource access and location descriptions on their behalf in a relatively transparent way.

Chisholm was born in valley of the Lower South River near Antigonish, Nova Scotia, of parents who had migrated there from Inverness- shire, Scotland. He was educated there and became a teacher, but in 1849 he started out for the California Gold Rush with 23 other prospectors. In California, he took part in the evolution of that state's mining laws, but had little success in the goldfields but also practiced medicine, and is credited with rescuing the lives of many miners (his medical skills were later of use during a cholera epidemic in British Columbia). Staying in California only a few years, he returned to Canada and became involved in the wheat trade in Ontario. Speculating on wheat prices during the Crimean War, Chisholm was left holding thousands of bushels at the time of the declaration of a peace, incurring the loss of a small fortune had the peace come only a few more weeks later. In the wake of this experience, he migrated to British Columbia in 1858 and became involved in many different businesses, settling in Hope, British Columbia. Possessed of \\"herculean strength\\" and standing tall, and reputedly the strongest man in the Colony, he was appointed a constable during the McGowan's War and in 1860 he was elected by the people of Hope to a convention in New Westminster, the purpose of which was to frame and present an appeal to the Imperial Government to introduce proper government for the Mainland Colony, which was then still ruled near-entirely by Governor James Douglas (a Legislative Assembly for the Colony would not be created until 1864, after Douglas' retirement). Chisholm was among the first parties to travel to the Big Bend Gold Rush in 1860, nearly losing his life when a snow bridge gave way as he was crossing McCullough Creek and he was swept away, then rescued, unconscious, by a party of miners half a mile downstream. In 1862 he went to the Cariboo Gold Rush and spent a few years there before moving to the Kootenay district to engage in both lumbering and mining, serving for a time as foreman for the Cherry Creek silver mine. During this period Chisholm was engaged to lead the partyof Major-General Selby Smyth, militia commander of Canada, and his staff through the mountains from Alberta to Hope. In 1874 he moved to New Westminster and became wealthy through investing in the wholesale and retail liquor business and also a flour and feed business of a Mr. Fred Woodcock, and was President of the New Westminster Board of Trade for several years. He also launched a hotel and store at Ladner (then Ladner's Landing), later owned by Thomas NcNeely, and was also a partner in the Delta Canning Company, one of the large canneries then a mainstay of economic life in the province. Other property holdings included land in what is now the Grandview area of Vancouver, and at Hastings (New Brighton), as well as holdings in the centre of the City of New Westminster and also, in partnership with a Mr. Daniel Mills was co-owner of a large farm on Saltspring Island. Chisholm was first elected to office in the 1887 general election, representing the New Westminster riding as a Liberal-Conservative supporting Sir John A. Macdonald, and died in office on April 5, 1890.  References  *Biographical Dictionary of well-known British Columbians, with a historical sketch, J.B.

Early years Macrossan was born on 27 April 1889 at Lutwyche in Queensland. He was the eighth and youngest child of Australian politician John Murtagh Macrossan and Bridget Macrossan (n√©e Queely). He was educated at the Normal School in Brisbane. There he won a scholarship and attended at St. Joseph's Nudgee College. In 1904 whilst studying at St Joseph‚Äôs, he was awarded the T J Byrnes medal for obtaining the highest pass mark in Queensland. In 1906 he again topped the State at the senior level. He also won a silver medal for Greek and was selected as the Rhodes scholar for Queensland in 1907. Macrossan studied at Magdalen College, Oxford. He obtained a Bachelor of Arts with honours in 1910 and obtained a Master of Arts in 1914 from Oxford. The University of Queensland awarded him a Bachelor of Arts Ad Eundem Gradum on 1 June 1911 to mark the occasion of the founding of the University of Queensland, although the Queensland Supreme Court Library notes it as a Masters of Arts. On his return to Queensland, he obtained employment in the Queensland Crown Solicitor‚Äôs Office. He passed the Barristers‚Äô Board admission examination and he was called to the Bar on 27 August 1912. He unsuccessfully stood for election to the Legislative Assembly of Queensland in 1915 for the seat of Cairns, where he stood as a candidate for the Liberal Party. In Brisbane he married Eileen Elizabeth Beirne on 14 December 1921. He purchased Glen Alpine in 1931 in Toowoomba. Glen Alpine had the first domestic swimming pool built in the Toowoomba area. The house and gardens are now heritage classified by the Queensland Government. Macrossan represented ex-premier William McCormack in the Mungana Mines case. McCormack was tried with ex-treasurer Ted Theodore and two others. The case was instituted following a Royal Commission on 4 July 1930 in the purchase of the mines.\\"What Happened when: A Chronology of Australia from 1788\\" Anthony Barker. Allen & Unwin, 2001. , . p233 The royal commission had made a finding that all the accused had acted dishonestly in the purchase of the mine. The conspiracy case commenced in the Supreme Court on 22 July 1931 and resulted in a jury verdict in favour of McCormack and Theodore on 25 August.\\"What Happened when: A Chronology of Australia from 1788\\" Anthony Barker. Allen & Unwin, 2001. , . p236 Macrossan also appeared in the Constitutional case of Peanut Board v. Rockhampton Harbour Board heard in the High Court of Australia. The case concerned whether the Queensland Government could control peanut sales in Queensland through the Peanut Board. Macrossan appeared as junior for the Board. He was unsuccessful in arguing against the marketing law and the law was held to be unconstitutional. Macrossan lectured at the University of Queensland on Pleading and Practice until his appointment to the bench. He also established an endowment to the University for the Macrossan lectures. Judicial appointment Frank Cooper, Ned Hanlon, David Gledson, ??, circa. 1942 Macrossan was appointed as a judge of the Supreme Court on 29 June 1940. He was appointed senior puisne judge five days later in front of more senior judges. Macrossan acted as chief justice on two occasions, before being appointed to the office on 25 April 1946. He became the second son to be appointed to that office following in the steps of his brother Hugh Denis Macrossan. As chief justice in 1947, one of the early cases heard by Macrossan at first instance was a matter concerning the dispute over the purchase of a lottery ticket. The defendants had won ¬£6000 in a \\"Golden Casket\\" Lottery. The plaintiff claimed that the ticket was purchased in a syndicate of three, being himself and the two defendants. The case turned on the credibility of the plaintiff and the jury found in the plaintiff‚Äôs favour. Macrossan awarded ¬£2000 to the plaintiff. The publicity surrounding the case caused lottery agents to come forward and produce new evidence that showed that the plaintiff couldn‚Äôt have entered into a syndicate on the date he stated, as the tickets hadn‚Äôt been printed before that date. An appeal to the High Court seeking to overturn that decision was unsuccessful and Macrossan‚Äôs decision stood.Orr v Holmes (1948) 76 CLR 632; (1948) 22 ALJR 283 In 1954 his wife Eileen died. She is buried in Nudgee Cemetery. In 1955 Macrossan heard an appeal from a decision of the Objectionable Literature Board. The board had classified books bearing titles such as Real Love, Romance Story and Darling Romance as \\"objectionable\\" material. Macrossan described the publications as emphasising \\"the thesis that an acceptable means of achieving this ideal [of marriage] is a casual acquaintance made by a young girl with a man hitherto a complete stranger to her the ardour of whose embraces and kisses provides the assurance of the constancy of his affection\\".(1955) QSR, at p 478 The court found that the materials was \\"what they considered to be a tendency to corrupt members of an age group of females described as unstable adolescents.\\" However, on appeal to the High Court, a majority ruling overturned the decision. Macrossan was a warden of the council of the University of Queensland, president of the Playground (and Recreation) Association of Queensland, president of the Twelfth Night Theatre Company, and also President of the Royal Automobile Club of Queensland. He died on 30 December 1955 in South Brisbane and following a state funeral was buried in Nudgee Cemetery.Macrossan, Neal William (1889‚Äì1955) -- Australian Dictionary of Biography.

(11 December 1821 - 5 January 1893), was a Dutch Passionist priest who served in 19th-century Ireland. He gained a reputation for his compassion for the sick and those in need of guidance. His reputation for healings and miracles was so great at the time that a reference is made to him in the famous novel Ulysses by James Joyce. He has been canonized by the Catholic Church. His feast day is January 5. Life He was born Joannes Andreas Houben on 11 December 1821 in the village of Munstergeleen in the Province of Limburg in the Kingdom of the Netherlands, to Peter Joseph Houben and his wife, Johanna Elizabeth Luyten. He was named after his maternal uncle and godfather, but to the family he was known as Andrew. His father was a miller by trade. As a boy Andrew attended the village primary school. One of 11 children in a poor family, he was a slow learner in his youth.D'arcy CP, Brian, \\"Doing God's Will\\", Herald of Hope: Reflections on the Life and Spirit of St. Charles of Mount Argus, Ovada Books To those outside his family he seemed quiet and extremely shy. A slow learner, for ten years he walked the two miles to a secondary school at nearby town of Sittard.Duffy, Patrick. \\"Saint Charles of St. Andrew of Mount Argus\\", Catholic Ireland When Houben was 19 years old he was enrolled for military service in the First Infantry Regiment of the Netherlands. It is said that on occasion during his time as a soldier there was a disturbance in the town; the army were called out and ordered to fire. Afraid that he might hit someone, Andrew pointed his rifle the wrong way and narrowly missed shooting his superior officer.Spencer C.P., Paul Francis, To Heal the Broken-Hearted: St. Charles of Mount Argus, 1988 On 18 February 1845 his period as a reserve in the army came to an end and he was formally discharged. Passionist Bust of St. Charles in Munstergeleen Feeling called to religious life, in 1845 Houben was admitted to the novitiate of the Passionists, who had recently arrived in Belgium, in the village of Ere, near Tournai. He professed his religious vows the following year and was given the religious habit and the religious name of Charles of St. Andrew. His father died in 1850, just before Charles' ordination as a priest. The family were so poor they could not afford to go to his ordination because of the expenses of the funeral. Even happy days were lonely days. He was sent to serve in England in 1852. He did parochial ministry in the Parish of St. Wilfred and neighboring areas. Serving there, Charles first came in contact with the Irish who were moving to England in the wake of the devastating famine taking place there.\\"Biography of Charles of St. Andrew\\", Zenit, May 29, 2007 In July 1857 Charles was transferred to Ireland to the newly founded monastery of Mount Argus, in Harold's Cross, Dublin. Traditionally Passionists are supposed to conduct missions and retreats and, through preaching, spread devotion to the Passion of Christ. Charles was not a good preacher. He never really mastered the English language, but it was in the confessional and in comforting the sick that he excelled, and he became fond of the Irish people.\\"Short Life of St. Charles\\", Passionists: St. Patrick's Province In community he was cheerful and often was heard humming the Dutch national anthem as he walked around the house. Healer It was Charles' gift of healing the sick which is most clearly remembered. Another member of the Passionist community in Dublin, Sebastian Keens, C.P., told of a 12-year-old boy who had lost the use of his leg and was brought to him. Without delay he called Charles and shortly afterwards found the boy walking up and down in front of the house completely cured. He became so popular with the people that the diocesan authorities, as well as the medical profession, grew suspicious of him. Some medical doctors complained to Cardinal Cullen, the Archbishop of Dublin, that he discouraged people from going to the doctor, a claim later retracted. Unscrupulous persons took holy water blessed by Charles and unbeknownst to him began to sell it throughout Ireland. In order to discourage this practice, Charles was transferred back to England in 1866 and remained there for eight years. Charles returned to Dublin in 1874. A trap in which he was travelling overturned near St Clare‚Äôs Convent at Harold‚Äôs Cross, causing a fracture which never set right. He remained in Dublin until his death that took place at dawn on 5 January 1893.Biography of St. Charles on Vatican Website Veneration right At his funeral, attended by people from all of Ireland, there was definite proof of the popular devotion that had surrounded him throughout his life. The Superior of the monastery wrote to his family: \\"The people have already declared him a saint.\\" The cause for Charles' canonization was introduced on 13 November 1935. After the declaration of a miracle attributed to his intercession, on 16 October 1988, Pope John Paul II beatified the man whom everyone called the Saint of Mount Argus. The miracle that led to his canonization was the healing of Adolf Dormans of Munstergeleen, Charles' birthplace, who was cured of \\"perforated, gangrenous appendicitis with generalized peritonitis that was multi- organically compromising\\" and which cure was \\"not scientifically explainable\\". The theologian consultors and the Ordinary Congregation of Cardinals and Bishops gave their unanimous approval of the claimed supernatural aspect of the said alleged healing. Charles was canonized on 3 June 2007 by Pope Benedict XVI.

The parish is locally called Lydbury and there is no settlement called Lydbury South. It is located at . It is situated in the south west corner of the county, near to the small towns of Clun and Bishop's Castle. The B4385 road runs through the village, as does the Jack Mytton Way. To the west is the village and parish of Colebatch. There is a part-time post office, community shop, school and church here. Also there is a public house called the Powis Arms. The village lies between 155m and 165m above sea level. Whilst the land to the south is flat, to the north it rises steeply. Priors Holt, Priors Holt Hill and Churchmoor are at the northeastern extremities of the parish, the church of which in Lydbury North, St Michael and All Angels, contains a small Catholic chapel. Etymology According to the Institute for Name Studies the name is Old English in derivation and means 'Fortification on the *Hlyde (= noisy stream)', perhaps an early name for the River Kemp. Walcot Hall Walcot Hall Walcot Hall is a Georgian country house to the south of the village. An original Elizabethan manor house was remodelled in 1764 by Sir William Chambers for Clive of India, who had bought the estate from Charles Walcot. It is constructed in two storeys of red brick with a slate roof to an irregular U-shaped floor plan Walcot Pool, a large body of water which is part of the estate, was created by French prisoners of war during the Napoleonic War. From 1929 to the Second World War the estate was a bird sanctuary for the Stevens brothers, Ronald and Noel, sons of Ernest Stevens founder and owner of the 'Judge' hollowware company of Stourbridge. One brother was an authority on the raptors and the other on water fowl. In an article in Country Life (June 1936) their two collections were deemed to be of 'world class'. The British army took over the estate for the duration and the collection was dispersed. The brothers returned after the war and rebuilt the collection. During the Stevens occupation the cluttered original entrance hall was remodelled with much open space gained and a sweeping wooden staircase now illuminated by large roof lights, for the brothers to entertain their numerous guests in grand style. Notable among the royalty who passed through the doors was Emperor Haile Selassie in 1936 who, at that time in exile, lived in Bath, Somerset. Shropshire Archives have a photograph (ref: PH/W/2/17) of the Stevens brothers meeting him and his daughter at Craven Arms railway station. The collection of birds went to Bristol Zoological Gardens in Clifton in 1956 when the Stevens brothers put the property on the market. Since 1957 it has been owned by the Parish family and used for weddings, corporate hospitality and accommodation.

Clinton administration showing the overmantel mirror. The Treaty Room is located on the second floor of the White House, the official residence of the President of the United States. The room is a part of the first family's private apartments and is used as a study by the president. History Before construction of the West Wing of the White House, working offices were located on the east side of the second floor. The Treaty Room has been used as a waiting room, a cabinet room, and the president's office. President Andrew Johnson used the room for his cabinet meetings. Ulysses S. Grant continued this use and acquired a large Renaissance Revival style table to be used by his cabinet. The table remained in the room for many years, and President William McKinley oversaw the signing of the peace treaty with Spain which concluded the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War on it on August 12, 1898. Old engravings, photographs and stereographs show a succession of ornate printed wall and ceiling papers, highly figured axminster carpets, and ornate gas lighting fixtures. During the administration of Theodore Roosevelt this room was greatly simplified as a part of an overall refurbishment of the house directed by Charles Follen McKim. Victorian decoration was removed, and the underlying wood floor was exposed. Low bookcases were constructed, and the room began use as the president's in-residence study. During the administration of Herbert Hoover, the room underwent an extensive redecorating project by First Lady Lou Henry Hoover to restore it to its Monroe era appearance and was used as a parlor or sitting room and was termed the Monroe Room. James Monroe's French Empire center table was moved to the room, and a copy of the desk he signed the Monroe Doctrine upon was placed in the room. Additional efforts were made during the administration of Franklin Delano Roosevelt to furnish the room somewhat as it might have been when the house was built. Following the Truman reconstruction of the White House, the room was furnished by the interior design department of the New York department store B. Altman and Company. Nearly all the furniture was contemporary, generally in a traditional style. The Treaty Room as decorated by St√©phane Boudin during the administration of John F. Kennedy The printed borders reproduce the wallpaper in the room where Lincoln died at the Petersen House. During the administration of John F. Kennedy, Jacqueline Kennedy worked with St√©phane Boudin of the House of Jansen to create a room that would represent a part of the house's Victorian era history. A palette of deep greens, burgundy and gold was adopted. President Grant's table was returned to the room along with an electrified gas chandelier once located in the East Room. The walls recreated a mid-nineteenth century treatment of ornamental frames of decorative paper based on the wallpaper in the room Abraham Lincoln was taken to and died in, in a house opposite Ford's Theater. A large gilded Rococo Revival overmantel mirror, with an American shield, which had once been hung in the Green Room was installed. Theobald Chartran's painting Signing of the Peace Protocol Between Spain and the United States, August 12, 1898 was hung in the room along with copies of several treaties signed at the White House. Drapery was based on a design of Lincoln's era. President Kennedy signed the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty in the room in 1963. Boudin's design survived into the administration of George H. W. Bush who had the room painted a light green and simple printed chintz curtains installed. During the administration of Bill Clinton interior designer Kaki Hockersmith furnished the room in a mix of late American Empire and Victorian. Walls were covered with a simulated leather of a deep claret red and a gilded chandelier with an American eagle, one of several purchased during Theodore Roosevelt's administration for the residence and West Wing, was hung. During the administration of George W. Bush, interior designer Ken Blasingame had the walls painted off-white, replaced the Clinton drapery with simple panels of olive green velvet hung on wooden poles, and replaced the Empire style chandelier with an electrified Victorian crystal gasolier. The Treaty Room has also been home to The Peacemakers, a large oil painting depicting U.S. President Lincoln in the final months of the American Civil War. President Bush addressed the nation from the Treaty Room on October 7, 2001, announcing that the War in Afghanistan had begun. In his memoirs Decision Points, Bush referred to the Treaty Room as \\"one of my favorite places in the White House.\\" President Barack Obama used the Treaty Room as one of his primary working offices.

The Series Commander is a United States Marine Corps officer assigned to a Recruit Training Company who is responsible for the conduct and instruction of Marine recruits and Marine Corps Drill Instructors within one of the two series, lead or follow. Series Commanders are typically of the rank of First Lieutenant (O-2) or Captain (O-3), and they are assisted in their duties by a Series Chief Drill Instructor (MCRD San Diego) or a Series Gunnery Sergeant (MCRD Parris Island). The Series Commander is primarily charged with supervision and safety during recruit training. Before a recruit is allowed to run the Obstacle Course or the Confidence Course, the Series Commander must run the course first and check each obstacle for any unsafe conditions. The Series Commander will then oversee his Drill Instructors as they lead the recruits through the course. The Series Commander also serves as a verifying officer and safety officer during the Rifle Range, A-Line, Basic Warrior Training, and The Crucible. Though Series Commanders do not train recruits in the same way as Drill Instructors do, they do conduct PT, lead conditioning hikes, conduct hygiene and uniform inspections, make on the spot corrections, and teach classes covering Marine Corps policies on Hazing, Fraternization, and Equal Opportunity. Additionally, the Combat Training Pool, Martial Arts Instructors, Academic Instruction Company, and Crucible Training Company are all commanded by former Series Commanders. A Recruit Training Battalion Operations Officer will most likely be a former Series and Company Commander from that Battalion. The role was also created to provide another layer of authority to monitor more closely the individual drill instructors, as a result of the Ribbon Creek incident. Throughout the training cycle, every recruit is interviewed personally by the Series Commander to ensure their drill instructors have acted in accordance with the proper orders and policies. The purpose of these interviews is twofold; first, it allows individual recruits access to a commissioned officer, and second, it allows the Series Commander the opportunity to speak with each recruit in his series individually throughout the course of boot camp. Underlying the policy in the Standard Operating Procedures for Recruit Training against recruit abuse, recruit interviews are also used to ensure recruits are not physically or verbally abused by their drill instructors or any other personnel in the training command. Responsibilities * Ensure the welfare and safety of each recruit in his care. * Provide positive leadership to the Marines assigned to him for duty. * Support by example and authority the letter and spirit of the Standard Operating Procedures for Recruit Training. * Ensure the Drill Instructors train recruits in accordance with the Recruit Training SOP. * Evaluate the effectiveness of the recruit training process and recommend improvements or corrections as necessary. * Maintain the objectivity and integrity of the recruit training process. * Lead by example ensuring strict compliance with core values, Commandant of the Marine Corps' vision for recruit training and the Commander's Intent. * Foster spirit and discipline within the series through positive leadership; ensure that drill instructors are routinely given objective and accurate written performance assessments. * Ensure the safety, health, and welfare of recruits and drill instructors. * Maintain accountability of personnel and equipment within the series. * Responsible for screening all pick-up and drop evaluation folders and recruits.

The Swiss Confederation had just joined the International Court of Justice (ICJ) but was not yet a member of the United Nations and the Council was asked to make recommendations. The Council recommended that Switzerland and any other state that should find itself in this position be allowed to participate in all the elements of the General Assembly pertaining to the ICJ including the nomination of new members, elections, etc. The Council also recommended that those nations would be required to pay dues contributing to the expenses of the Court and that should it fail to do so (unless that nation possessed an excuse deemed worthy by the General Assembly) it should not be allowed to participate in the Assembly in any way until the balance was paid. The President of the Council stated that the resolution was adopted unanimously in the absence of any objection by any of its members.

A cleaner or a cleaning operative is a type of industrial or domestic worker who cleans homes or commercial premises for payment. Cleaning operatives may specialise in cleaning particular things or places, such as window cleaners. Cleaning operatives often work when the people who otherwise occupy the space are not around. They may clean offices at night or houses during the workday. The 2000 film Bread and Roses by British director Ken Loach depicted the struggle of cleaners in Los Angeles, California, for better pay and working conditions and for the right to join a union. In an interview with the BBC in 2001, Loach stated that thousands of cleaners from around 30 countries have since contacted him with tales similar to the one told in the film. Types of cleaning operatives The cleaning industry is quite big as different types of cleaning are required for different objects and different properties. For example, cleaning an office space requires the services of a commercial cleaner whereas cleaning a house requires domestic cleaning services. Depending on the task, even these categories can be subdivided into, for example, end-of-lease cleaning, carpet cleaning, upholstery cleaning, window cleaning, car cleaning services etc. Cleaners specialize in a specific cleaning sector or even a specific task in a cleaning sector, and one cannot expect a window cleaner to be able or willing to clean a carpet. Some types of cleaners are mentioned below. =Apartment/house cleaners= These cleaning operatives are quite easy to find due to their large numbers, and they are usually denoted as maid service providers, janitors, and domestic cleaning operatives. These type of operatives specialize in house cleaning services such as spring cleaning, end-of-lease cleaning etc. Most house cleaning operatives are known to pay good attention to details, but due to their large numbers, there is no guarantee that one will find one who is trustworthy and works effectively. The cost of this type of service depends on the demand for the service and the number of providers. In Australia, one can hire a household cleaner from anywhere between $20 to $30 an hour. In countries like India, China, the Philippines, etc., where the labor rates are quite low, people can afford a full-time maid or domestic cleaner. In UK the minimum cost of deep cleaning is around $30 and the maximum cost is $60.
