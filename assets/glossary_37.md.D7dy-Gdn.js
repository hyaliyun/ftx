History Rock Candy Media (RCM) is a full-service digital marketing and interactive advertising agency based in Austin, Texas. The company was founded in 2009 by Annie Liao Jones, who continues to serve as its chief executive officer (CEO). In addition to advertising and marketing consultation, RCM offers full service communications, marketing strategy, press releases, print and web design, print consultation and vendor sourcing. In 2011, RCM launched an online marketing division to expand its portfolio of services, including custom affiliate marketing, email marketing, online pay per click marketing, search engine optimization, social media marketing, and online mobile app creation. By 2012, RCM's staff included a creative director, two designers, a social media manager, a copywriter, and a developer. That year, the Austin-based content management consultancy DigitHaus named RCM the design agency for its app division, and Sirena Water Wear named RCM its agency of record to promote a line of tailored shorts geared for fishing. The clothing retailer Port Aransas and Austin Wine and Cider also named RCM their agency of record in 2012. RCM designed KnowBuddy, survey software used with social media platforms, in 2013. In 2014, RCM created a video called \\"Workin' at IKEA\\", in which employees worked from inside an IKEA store. The company moved to a single, 1,000-square-foot office space at Balcones Drive and MoPac Expressway in North Austin in 2015 to accommodate its video production department and increased staff of nine employees. The company confirmed Austin Area Birthing Center, Dobie Center, Realty Austin, and TekSavers as clients and projected $600,000 in revenue based on its first quarter performance. In August, the San Antonio-based video production company Geomedia expanded into Austin, sharing office space with RCM. RCM confirmed plans to open an additional office in Los Angeles in 2016. In mid 2017, Jones was named one of Austin Business Journal \\"Profiles in Power\\" nominees. RCM was among the 50 fastest-growing companies based in Austin, as of 2017. In September, the Austin Business Journal featured RCM in their profile on diversity within Austin's technology companies. The publication noted Jones' Taiwanese-American heritage, and reported that of RCM's 39 employees (37 in Austin and 2 in Los Angeles) at the time, \\"about two-thirds are white, a quarter are Hispanic or Latino and the rest are Asian\\". Austin Business Journal also reported that RCM has worked with consumer apps, e-commerce, cybersecurity, and information technology companies, and said the company's revenue grew from $541,186 in 2014 to $1,162,810 in 2016, representing a 115 percent increase. The company's other clients have included Alexander Cole & Associates, ArthroCare, Austin Cancer Centers, Austin Urology Institute, Baldirama Restaurant Group, Bennett Flaherty PLLC, ContactWorks, RVRhino, and SugarPaper Press. =Rock Candy Life= In 2010, RCM launched a sister retail company and lifestyle brand called Rock Candy Life (RCL). RCL began selling a line of environmentally- friendly shower curtains made from PVC-free vinyl. The recyclable, biodegradable curtain began retailing for $25 and was intended to be the first product in a line of bathroom accessories. In April 2013, Austin Business Journal reported that Jones invested $50,000 to launch RCL, which earned $5,500 in 2010 and $40,000 in 2012 (a 627 percent increase). That same month, Upstart Business Journal named Jones one of its five \\"Entrepreneurs of the Week\\" for running RCM and launching RCL. Despite the product's success, RCL was shut down by the end of 2014.

The sub-prefecture boundaries are dotted lines. The green dots indicate the location of the settlement that is the seat of each sub-prefecture. The grey zones are areas of the country not governed by sub-prefectures. Sub-prefectures of Ivory Coast () are the fourth-level administrative subdivisions of the country. There are currently 510 sub- prefectures. They were created in 2011, when the administrative subdivisions of Ivory Coast were reorganised. In Ivory Coast, there are 14 first-level districts (including two autonomous districts) sub-divided into 31 regions, which are sub-divided into 108 departments (), which are further sub-divided into 510 sub-prefectures. The sub-prefectures contain more than 8000 villages nationwide. Where needed, multiple villages have been combined into 197 communes. The two autonomous districts are not divided into regions, but they do contain one or more departments as well as sub-prefectures and communes. Two areas of the country are not subdivided into sub-prefectures. First, the urban portion the Autonomous District of Abidjan‚Äîconstituting Abidjan City proper‚Äîcontains no sub-prefectures, only communes, although the more rural areas of the Autonomous District of Abidjan are divided into sub-prefectures. Second, the portion of the Como√© National Park that is located in Zanzan District is not divided into sub-prefectures.

Constructed in the sixth century BCE, it continued to be used until the Roman Empire collapsed. It is located in front of the Temple of Saturn in the Roman Forum and its remains were uncovered by Rodolfo Lanciani in 1902. Location Italian archaeologist Rodolfo Lanciani discovered the remains of the altar in 1902 near the Arch of Septimius Severus. It was first thought that the remains were of the Vulcanal. The altar stands in front of the Temple of Saturn, next to the Umbilicus urbis Romae, and south of the senaculum of the Roman Forum. History The altar was constructed prior to the Temple of Saturn in the sixth century BCE and remained in use to appease the god Saturn until the collapse of the Roman Empire. It was erected by the Pelasgians in honour of Saturn, the first god of the capitol, which was named Saturnia to honour him. Ancient sources state that the altar of Saturn is situated nearby another altar dedicated to god Dƒ´s Pater and goddess Proserpina; that altar is believed to have hosted the Saturnalia festival. The altar of Saturn is rectangular and measures . It was constructed from blocks of tuff. The Romans had believed that Dƒ´s Pater must be appeased by offering him human heads, and Saturn could be appeased by offering him victims. Despite this, it became practice to appease Dƒ´s Pater with masks with human faces fashioned onto them, and Saturn was appeased with lights of kindling; this is due to a change in the interpretation of ph√¥ta, which can mean either \\"lights\\" or \\"man\\". This change of practice led to the exchange of candles in the festival Saturnalia.Macrobius. Saturnia: Book I (VII). Fifth century.

It is a branch of the Kolowrat family.  Birth of the Dynasty  Albrecht the Elder of Kolowrat, whose ancestors came from the village of Kolovraty, is considered to be the founder of the dynasty. Being a hetman and the court marshal of Anna of Schweidnitz (wife of Charles IV), and an assessor of the provincial and royal feudal court, he entered the historical annals in 1347 when Ro≈æmit√°l castle was sold and he was mentioned as an assessing witness. He married three times and had eight children, six of which were sons who later laid the foundations of the House of Kolowrat. In 1373, Albrecht of Kolowrat established an Augustinian monastery of the Assumption in Roƒçov, where he was later buried.  Branches of the Dynasty  During the 14th and 15th centuries, the Kolowrat family split into eight family branches: * Libstejnsky, * Kornhauzsky, * Zehrovicky, * Bezdruzicky, * Novohradsky, * Mastovsky, * Cernonicky, * and the last surviving, Krakowsky. The Kolowrat are a venerable Czech noble family, originally hailing from Central Bohemia, with a family history reaching all the way back to the 13th century. The Kolowrat family played a significant role in history and politics in Bohemia, and throughout Central Europe. Many Kolowrat family members were patrons of the arts, culture, education, and the economic and building growth of the nation, engaged in its socioeconomic development. Their ranks include holders of inherited imperial and Czech titles and knights of the Order of the Golden Fleece. Many of them were also awarded high military, imperial and papal honors. Members of the family held various important offices, entering the annals of history. These included field marshals, prime ministers, high chancellors, royal governors, governors, ambassadors, archbishops and supporters of the Czech National Revival movement.  The Kolowrat-Krakowsky line  The Kolowrat-Krakowsk√Ωs lineage derives their name from the Krakovec castle situated not far from Rakovn√≠k in Central Bohemia. Albrecht of Kolowrat (1422‚Äì1470) acquired this castle and established the largest branch of the Kolowrats which still continues to this day. One of the most prominent members of this lineage, who was very well liked by the Austrian Empress Maria Theresia and was a holder of the Order of the Golden Fleece, was Count Leopold Vil√©m (1727‚Äì1809). With two wives, Leopold Vil√©m had seventeen children, out of whom the youngest ‚Äì Count Franti≈°ek Xaver (1783‚Äì1855) ‚Äì is the common ancestor of all currently living descendants of the Lords of Kolowrat. His eldest son Leopold (1804‚Äì1884) established the \\"T√Ωn\\" lineage, also known as \\"Leopold's\\", whilst his second son Theodor (1806‚Äì1875) established the \\"Rychnovian\\" lineage, also known as \\"Theodor's\\". Nowadays, the descendants of the Leopold's lineage of the Kolowrat-Krakowsk√Ωs manage the forests around Tachov and Klatovy, as well as own property in Prague. Theodor's descendants, on the other hand, reside not far from Rychnov nad Knƒõ≈ænou and currently use the combined family name Krakowsk√Ω-Liebsteinsk√Ω of Kolowrat. The manor of Rychnov and ƒåern√≠kovice is currently managed by Count Jan Egon, the son of Count Kry≈°tof Jaroslav (1927‚Äì1999), who returned from exile in Austria after the fall of the Iron Curtain in 1989.  Modern history  Leopold Filip Kolowrat-Krakowsky (1852‚Äì1910) became the administrator of the Kolowrat- Krakowsky family property in the second half of the 19th century. He was a member of the Imperial Council and the Czech Assembly, Second Class Knight of the Order of the Iron Crown. Apart from the P≈ôimda estate and the estate in Klatovsko, he also administered the Kolowrat Palace and the New Kolowrat Palace at Na P≈ô√≠kopƒõ 17 in Prague. The successor of Count Leopold Filip and the new owner of the Kolowrat-Krakowsky estate became his oldest son Alexander Kolowrat-Krakowsky (1886‚Äì1927). Alexander, called Sascha, was not only a successful car and motorcycle racing driver but also a very successful film producer, with Sascha-Film company, whose biggest contribution to the world's film industry was the discovery of Marlene Dietrich. As a racing driver he received many awards and became the right hand of V√°clav Klement, owner of Laurin and Klement car factory. In his honour there is an annual gathering of historic cars, together with a tour around P≈ôimda and a visit to the neighbouring towns in Bavaria. When Count Sascha died of cancer in 1927, his brother Jind≈ôich Vil√©m Kolowrat-Krakowsky (1897‚Äì1996) became administrator of the estate. Count Jind≈ôich built one of the most modern buildings of its time, the Functionalist Palace Chicago. He founded the Wooden Houses Kolowrat where he employed 600 permanent workers, and duly administered the family estate until 1943, when the estate was nationalized by the Nazi Germany. Although the estate was given back to him in 1945 by a Decree of President Edvard Bene≈°, in 1948 it was again nationalized, this time by the Communist regime. Count Jind≈ôich, a holder of the War Cross, received during World War II from President Edvard Bene≈°, for whom he served from 1945 to 1948 as ambassador in Ankara, then emigrated with his family to the United States. The property of the Kolowrat-Krakowsky family was nationalized after February 1948, and in 1950, the timber company was dissolved. From 1960, the hunting lodge Diana served as a retirement home. The property was returned to the Kolowrat- Krakowsky family through the restitution process in 1992, and Count Jind≈ôich Kolowrat-Krakowsky returned to Czechoslovakia together with his youngest son, Franti≈°ek Tom√°≈° Kolowrat-Krakowsky (1943‚Äì2004). In 1991, Count Jind≈ôich received the Order of Tom√°≈° Garrigue Masaryk, Second Class, from President V√°clav Havel. In 1993, he rented the Kolowrat Palace to the National Theatre for a symbolic amount of 1 Czech Crown per year. Count Jind≈ôich Vil√©m Kolowrat-Krakowsky died in 1996 at the age of 98, and his son Franti≈°ek Tom√°≈° Kolowrat-Krakowsky became his only heir and successor. Franti≈°ek Tom√°≈° was the only one of Jind≈ôich's children who came back with his father from the United States and who stayed in Czechoslovakia for good. Count Franti≈°ek Tom√°≈° repaired the Hraniƒçky Ponds and the V√°clavsk√Ω Pond, which came to form part of an important sporting event ‚Äì the P≈ôimda Triathlon. He built private wood roads that became part of cycle paths, and which now connect different areas of the Upper Palatine Forest. In an effort to increase tourism and develop the town of P≈ôimda, he bought the ruins of P≈ôimda castle and converted it into the attractive Mountain Hotel Kolowrat. Count Tom√°≈° continued the patronal tradition of his ancestors and participated in the cultural and social development of the region. He also helped people in difficult social situations. In 1997, he bought three new bells for the Roman St. George's Church in P≈ôimda, as the original bells had been destroyed after World War II. He personally donated a considerable amount of money to the Red Cross to help people in need and to remedy damage caused by an extensive flood in 2002. He made regular charity donations and supported people who found themselves in difficult social and health situations. He also supported schools, culture and other important events. In 2001, the Forestry of Franti≈°ek Tom√°≈° Kolowrat- Krakowsky was ranked in the top 100 companies of agricultural production, food industry and forestry. He was recognized by Comenius - the Pan-European Society for Culture, Education and Scientific and Technical Cooperation. Count Franti≈°ek Tom√°≈° Kolowrat-Krakowsky died prematurely in 2004. After his death, Dominika Kolowrat-Krakowska became the new administrator of the family property. Besides Leopold's Kolowrat-Krakowsky branch, there are also descendants of Leopold's younger brother Theodor Kolowrat-Krakowsky (1806‚Äì1875) living in the Czech Republic. Their residence in Rychnovsko is administered by Jan Egon Kolowrat Krakowsky-Libstejnsky, the son of Count Kry≈°tof Jaroslav Kolowrat Krakowsky-Libstejnsky, who, after 1989, returned from exile in Austria.

They are known to hunt and feed on grasshoppers.  Behavior  Prior to laying their eggs the female Prionyx stings a grasshopper causing paralysis. She will then bury the grasshopper in a shaded hole and lay an egg on the body. When the egg develops it feeds on the grasshopper until it has matured enough to seek its own food. Name Origin The name Prionyx comes from the Greek words \\"Prion\\" (Saw) and \\"Onyx/Onychus\\" (Claw), which refers to the saw-like endings on the creature's legs.

Playing with Dynamite is a 1939 American drama film directed by Noel M. Smith, written by Earle Snell and Charles Belden, and starring Jane Wyman, Allen Jenkins, and Tom Kennedy. It was released on August 12, 1939. It is the final film in a series of nine Torchy Blane movies by Warner Bros. The first film, Smart Blonde, was released in 1937. Plot Torchy Blane (Jane Wyman) is covering a bank robbery, one of a series committed by Denver Eddie. Returning to her newspaper, Torchy is stopped by a policeman for speeding. Because she doesn't have her driver's license with her, he takes her to court. While in court, Torchy encounters Jackie Mcguire (Sheila Bromley), who is the girlfriend of notorious bank robber Denver Eddie and is sentenced to jail for shoplifting. After Torchy's boyfriend, Lt. Steve McBride (Allen Jenkins), identifies her, Torchy is released. However, Torchy asks Steve to put her back in jail after realizing that Jackie is Denver Eddie's girlfriend. Torchy gets herself thrown into jail so that she can befriend Jackie and use her to get a lead on Eddie. Torchy has no luck with her plan until she helps subdue another prisoner who tries to stab Jackie. Jackie suggests that she and Torchy escape from jail. Steve agrees to cooperate with Torchy's plan when she explains that the reward money for Eddie's capture will enable them to get married. With the help and collusion of Steve and the police, she escapes with Jackie to San Francisco, where Jackie is meeting her boyfriend. The two escapees are followed by Steve and his assistant, Gahagan (Tom Kennedy). Steve hopes to capture Denver Eddie to collect the $5,000 reward as a down payment for a house for him and Torchy. He decides not to notify the local police of Eddie's expected arrival, but his actions are so suspicious that the police think he and Gahagan are criminals. Jim Simmons (Edgar Dearing), a San Francisco policeman, follows them, but Steve succeeds in convincing him that Gahagan is a wrestler and that he is his manager. Meanwhile, Torchy has arranged to signal Steve when Eddie arrives by hanging her stockings on the fire escape. Gahagan sees Jackie hang her stockings out to dry and they burst into the room, only to find that Eddie has not arrived yet. Torchy quickly makes up a story to explain their presence. When Eddie finally arrives, one of his men recognizes Steve as a policeman but pretends that Steve is another criminal. Steve, not knowing that they recognize him, invites Eddie to join him in robbing the wrestling stadium. Eddie agrees to the plan but arranges for his men to kidnap Steve on the way there. At the wrestling arena, another reporter recognizes Torchy and reveals her identity. After getting rid of Eddie's men, Steve rushes to the arena where Gahagan, posing as a wrestler named Harry the Horse, gets thrown out of the ring just in time to land on Eddie, who is trying to escape. Steve and Gahagan are credited with the arrest, and Torchy and Steve now have the money to marry. Cast *Jane Wyman as Torchy Blane *Allen Jenkins as Lt.

Born in the province of Siena, the young Sabatini was an early member of the Communist Party of Italy, and militarily resisted the initial rise of Fascism in the ranks of the Arditi del Popolo. Having worked in Rome's Snia tram factory, Sabatini joined the Scintilla group in 1940, in the attempt to re-create the Communist Party after its long repression under Benito Mussolini's rule. Joining the dissident MCd'I/Bandiera Rossa upon its creation in August 1943, Sabatini advocated an strategy for the partisan struggle, and criticised the moderation of official Communist Party leaders: in the tramworker's view 'Lenin turned war into revolution. Stalin, Togliatti and [the Rome PCI‚Äôs Mario] Alicata send militants to fight the war'. He quickly became a popular commander of the MCd'I's 'Second Zone', which included his home district of Torpignattara, organising numerous armed actions against Occupation forces as well as distributing food among the population. Arrested on 23 January 1944, Sabatini was imprisoned at the Via Tasso SS prison and subsequently Regina Coeli. Twice put on trial, he was sentenced to death on 14 April 1944 and executed on 3 May, less than five weeks before the Anglo-Americans liberated Rome. Sabatini's final words are on display at the Fosse Ardeatine's 'Monument to the Martyrs', though he did not in fact die in the Nazi massacre at these caves to the south of Rome. A thin strip of paper at the memorial presents his last plea to future generations, 'Don't forget why we died, don't exploit our death'. This statement came to prominence in Italian media in 2008, as 'post- Fascist' mayor of Rome Gianni Alemanno visited the Monument in an effort to burnish his democratic credentials, in what was widely characterised as a cynical attempt to use Resistance commemorations for political gain. A biography of Sabatini appears on the ANPI veterans' association website. In 1979 he was posthumously awarded a Silver Medal of the Resistance, and in 2015 a square near the site of his arrest was named in his honour.

Born in Transylvania (then Kingdom of Hungary), she became an orphan when her parents and brother were murdered by the Romanian marauders led by Ioan Axente Sever and Simion Prodan who killed approximately 1000 predominantly Hungarian civilians in Nagyenyed on 8-9 January, 1849. She fled with the remains of the Hungarian army to the Ottoman Empire, to Vidin. Here she disappeared as child only to be seen in 1859 by Samuel Baker who rescued her. While Baker was visiting the Duke of Atholl on his shooting estate in Scotland, he befriended Maharaja Duleep Singh and in 1858‚Äì1859, the two partnered an extensive hunting trip in central Europe and the Balkans, via Frankfurt, Berlin, Vienna and Budapest. On the last part of the voyage, Baker and the Maharajah hired a wooden boat in Budapest, which was eventually abandoned on the frozen Danube. The two continued into Vidin where, to amuse the Maharajah, Baker went to the Vidin slave market. There, Baker fell in love with a white slave girl, Florence, destined for the Ottoman Pasha of Vidin. He was outbid by the Pasha but bribed the girl's attendants and they ran away in a carriage together and eventually she became his lover and wife and accompanied him everywhere he journeyed. They are reported to have married, most probably in Bucharest, before going to Dubrushka, but Sir Samuel certainly promised that they would go through another ceremony on their return to England ‚Äì where they had a family wedding in 1865. Together they went in search of the source of the River Nile and found Lake Albert. They journeyed to Samuel Baker's home in England where they were married and she became Lady Baker. She later returned to Africa with her husband to try and put down the slave trade. They both retired and died in Devon. Early life Some sources say that Florence Barbara Maria von Sass was born in Nagyenyed (today Aiud, Romania) in 1841. The story handed down in the Baker family is that she was the daughter of a Sz√©kely officer from a Hungarian noble family, who had estates in Transylvania, called von Sas (a branch of the von Sass family) and whilst she was young, during the Hungarian Revolution of 1848 \\"her father and brothers had been killed before her eyes\\". As an adolescent, she spoke Hungarian, German, Romanian and Turkish. She may have been fourteen when she was being sold as a slave in Vidin, a town and fortified port on the River Danube in what was then the Ottoman Empire and is now in Bulgaria, in January 1859.Dorothy Middleton, 'Baker, Florence Barbara Maria, Lady Baker (1841‚Äì1916)', Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 accessed 5 Sept 2015 According to certain accounts, she was destined to be owned by the Pasha of Vidin but she had been spotted by Samuel Baker.Science historian chronicles true story of Lady Florence Baker, Penn State University, 3 February 2004, Retrieved 4 September 2015 He and Maharaja Duleep Singh were both on a hunting trip. Samuel Baker bribed the guards and Florence was allowed to escape into his ownership. Africa Florence and Samuel White Baker as illustrated in a book of 1890Stanley and the White Heroes in Africa (etc.) (H. B. Scammel, 1890) Samuel Baker took her to Africa where he was leading an expedition to find the source of the River Nile. They travelled up the Nile to Gondokoro in present-day South Sudan where Florence saved the expedition. There was a dispute between her husband's inflexibility and the staff's disloyalty. Florence was able to intercede and find some common agreement. Gondokoro was a base for ivory and slaves, and the point where boats could go no further and where they would need to travel to the source on foot. There they met Speke and Grant who told them of their explorations. They suggested that they investigate another branch of the Nile. When Speke and Grant both later wrote down accounts of their voyages neither of them mentioned that Baker had Florence with him. This was in line with an agreement they made with Samuel Baker. Florence and Baker discovered Murchison Falls and Lake Albert in what is now Uganda.Thomas Paul Ofcansky, 'Baker, Sir Samuel White (1821‚Äì1893)', Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, Jan 2008 accessed 4 Sept 2015 Arriving in England, they lived at Hedenham Hall in Norfolk. They were married on 4 November 1865 at St James's Church, Piccadilly and when Samuel Baker was knighted she became Lady Baker. The details of how they met was meant to be kept secret but the story circulated and this resulted in Queen Victoria deciding to exclude Baker from court. In 1869 Samuel was invited by Isma'il Pasha, the Turkish Viceroy of Egypt, to return to Africa to help eliminate or reduce the trade in slaves around Gondokoro. Samuel was made Governor General of the Equatorial Nile.Sir Samuel White Baker, Newton Abbot museum, Retrieved 11 September 2015 Accepting the invitation, they returned to Africa where they attempted to gain the upper hand. Florence served as the medic and when they were defeated at Bunyoro she was there carrying rifles and brandy in addition to two umbrellas and a pistol. Later life Florence, Lady Baker c. 1875 In 1873 she and her husband started living at their house, Sandford Orleigh, at Newton Abbot in Devon. General Gordon arrived in February 1883 and requested that Samuel assist him in evacuating people from the besieged Khartoum during the Mahdist War in Egypt.Journey up the Nile to go from a slave girl to an English lady, TES, 30 October 2004, Retrieved 11 September 2015 Florence would be required on such a journey. However, Florence would not go back to Africa and her husband would not travel without her. Sir Samuel Baker died in 1893. Florence Baker died in Devon more than twenty years later, but they were buried together.

The dorsal telencephalon becomes the cerebral cortex, and contains the Tbr2-labeled cells. CP, cortical plate; LV, lateral ventricle; MGE, medial ganglionic eminence In vertebrates, the ventricular zone (VZ) is a transient embryonic layer of tissue containing neural stem cells, principally radial glial cells, of the central nervous system (CNS). The VZ is so named because it lines the ventricular system, which contains cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The embryonic ventricular system contains growth factors and other nutrients needed for the proper function of neural stem cells. Neurogenesis, or the generation of neurons, occurs in the VZ during embryonic and fetal development as a function of the Notch pathway, and the newborn neurons must migrate substantial distances to their final destination in the developing brain or spinal cord where they will establish neural circuits. A secondary proliferative zone, the subventricular zone (SVZ), lies adjacent to the VZ. In the embryonic cerebral cortex, the SVZ contains intermediate neuronal progenitors that continue to divide into post-mitotic neurons. Through the process of neurogenesis, the parent neural stem cell pool is depleted and the VZ disappears. The balance between the rates of stem cell proliferation and neurogenesis changes during development, and species from mouse to human show large differences in the number of cell cycles, cell cycle length, and other parameters, which is thought to give rise to the large diversity in brain size and structure. Epigenetic DNA modifications appear to have a central role in regulating gene expression during differentiation of neural stem cells. One type of epigenetic modification occurring in the VZ is the formation of DNA 5-Methylcytosine from cytosine by DNA methyltransferasesWang Z, Tang B, He Y, Jin P. DNA methylation dynamics in neurogenesis. Epigenomics. 2016 Mar;8(3):401-14. . Epub 2016 Mar 7. Review. PMID:26950681.

He attended Palm Beach High Junior College, in Lake Worth Florida, (now Palm Beach State College), graduating in 1966. Bozeman played on the varsity baseball team at Palm Beach Junior College where he had the distinction of scoring the first run in the new team‚Äôs history.  Career  In 1970, Bozeman entered the doctoral program in political science at Ohio State University, focusing on public policy studies. He graduated in 1973 and, that same year, began as an Assistant Professor of Political Science at Georgia Institute of Technology. During that period, he began specializing in Science and Technology Policy and in 1974, as part of the Intergovernmental Personnel Act, took a position as an analyst in the National Science Foundation‚Äôs Division of Information Science and Technology. After returning briefly to Georgia Tech, Bozeman took a job at the University of Missouri-Columbia, where he was appointed in the Department of Political Science, as well as the new Department of Public Administration. In 1977, Bozeman began a long stay (1977-1993) at Syracuse University‚Äôs Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs. While at Syracuse, Bozeman was the Director of the Doctoral Program (1979-1986) and was the founding director of the Center for Technology and Information Policy. He moved in 1993 to be the first full-time director of the new School of Public Policy at Georgia Tech and was later appointed as Regent‚Äôs Professor, the first social scientist to become a Regent‚Äôs Professor at Georgia Tech. In 2006, Bozeman moved to University of Georgia where he became the first holder of the Department of Public Administration and Policy‚Äôs Ander Crenshaw Chair in Public Policy. In 2013, Bozeman moved to Arizona State University where he is Arizona Centennial Professor of Technology Policy and Public Management and Director of the Center for Organization Research and Design.

Biography He was born to a Rovigo peasant family soon before Italy entered World War I. Chilanti moved to Rome as a teenager to study agronomy and from 1934 took up employment as a writer for the farming union‚Äôs in-house journal. He was soon drawn to the Fascist Left by Giuseppe Bottai and Edmondo Rossoni who were syndicalists who viewed Fascism as a social revolution against capitalism. Chilanti wrote an October 1939 article in Benito Mussolini's Gerarchia welcoming the Hitler-Stalin pact as heralding the future collaboration of the Soviet and Fascist r√©gimes. During the war Chilanti became increasingly disillusioned with his government's failure to live up to its purported anti-capitalist objectives. While seeking to advance such radical policies he formed a group around the newspaper Ventuno Domani, whose collaborators included novelist Vasco Pratolini. This 'anarcho-Fascist' circle drew the attentions of philo-Nazi American poet Ezra Pound. Chilanti and his ally, Vittorio Ambrosini, mounted one of the most militant of all Left-Fascist projects when they attempted to eliminate the foreign minister Galeazzo Ciano, whom the plotters saw as a conservative brake on the regime. Chilanti was quickly arrested and sent into internal exile [confino]. Chilanti then adopted communist politics from his Croatian cellmates. During the Italian Resistance Chilanti was co-editor of the dissident-communist newspaper Bandiera Rossa, organ of the Movimento Comunista d'Italia, an idiosyncratic force that Chilanti labelled 'the party of Stalin who fought for Bordiga'. After liberation Chilanti joined the Italian Communist Party. He later grew disillusioned and signed up to the extra-parliamentary Avanguardia Operaia. As a result of throat cancer Chilanti was unable to speak in his final years.

Collected garbage at Attero, Wijster, the Netherlands. Litter dumped in a wetland area in the United States, among water lilies and marsh plants. Garbage, trash, rubbish, or refuse is waste material that is discarded by humans, usually due to a perceived lack of utility. The term generally does not encompass bodily waste products, purely liquid or gaseous wastes, nor toxic waste products. Garbage is commonly sorted and classified into kinds of material suitable for specific kinds of disposal.Susan Strasser, Waste and Want: A Social History of Trash (2014), p. 6-7. Terminology The word garbage originally meant chicken giblets and other entrails, as can be seen in the 15th century Boke of Kokery, which has a recipe for Garbage. What constitutes garbage is highly subjective, with some individuals or societies tending to discard things that others find useful or restorable.Susan Strasser, Waste and Want: A Social History of Trash (2014), p. 3-4. The words garbage, refuse, rubbish, trash, and waste are generally treated as interchangeable when used to describe \\"substances or objects which the holder discards or intends or is required to discard\\".J. M. Baptista, The Regulation of Water and Waste Services (2014), p. 1: \\"Solid waste, also written as municipal or urban waste, commonly known as trash, garbage, refuse or rubbish, is defined as any substances or objects which the holder discards or intends or is required to discard\\".William Viney, Waste: A Philosophy of Things (2014), p. 1: \\"The conventional way of thinking about the creation of waste, rubbish, trash, garbage, or whichever words we like to employ to denote things without use, is that the concept like the thing is created, produced through the order or disorder we construe, manufacture or identify in the world\\". Some of these terms have historic distinctions that are no longer present. In the 1880s, material to be disposed of was divided into four general categories: ashes (derived from the burning of coal or wood), garbage, rubbish, and street-sweepings.James Ciment, Social Issues in America: An Encyclopedia (2015), p. 1844-45. This scheme of categorization reduced the terms to more specific concepts: The distinction between terms used to describe wet and dry discarded material \\"was important in the days when cities slopped garbage to pigs, and needed to have the wet material separated from the dry\\", but has since dissipated.William L. Rathje, Cullen Murphy, Rubbish!: The Archaeology of Garbage (2001), p. 9. Treatment In urban areas, garbage of all kinds is collected and treated as municipal solid waste; garbage that is discarded in ways that cause it to end up in the environment, rather than in facilities designed to receive garbage, is considered litter. Litter is a form of garbage, and municipal solid waste that is improperly disposed of, and which therefore enters the environment, is treated as litter.Carl A. Zimring, William L. Rathje, eds., Encyclopedia of Consumption and Waste: The Social Science of Garbage (2012), p. 657. Notably, however, only a small fraction of garbage that is generated becomes litter, with the vast majority being disposed of in ways intended to secure it from entering the environment.William L. Rathje, Cullen Murphy, Rubbish!: The Archaeology of Garbage (2001), p. 9. History Man has been creating garbage throughout history, beginning with bone fragments left over from using animal parts and stone fragments discarded from toolmaking.Simon Davis, \\"By their garbage shall they be known\\", New Scientist (November 17, 1983), p. 506-515. The degree to which groups of early humans began engaging in agriculture can be estimated by examining the type and quality of animal bones in their garbage. Garbage from prehistoric or pre-civilization humans was often collected into mounds called middens, which might contain things such as \\"a mix of discarded food, charcoal, shell tools, and broken pottery\\".

The name is from the Latin (angarius- mounted courier) after the tendency to ride weevils. Prior to 2011, the species was referred to as C. sp. 2, C. sp. 3, and C. sp. PS1010. Its genome was sequenced at the California Institute of Technology in 2010. This species is gonochoristic. It has distinct morphology and behavior compared to C. elegans; notably, C. angaria males exhibit a spiral mating behavior. Its divergence from C. elegans is similar to the distance between humans and fish. C. castelli is its closest relative, and the two species can produce F1 hybrids. C. angaria was isolated in Trinidad and Florida, found in association with palm and sugarcane weevils, Rhynchophorus palmarum and Metamasius hemipterus. Dauer larvae wave and are transported by adult weevils. The association is probably phoretic, although C. angaria can develop on dead weevils.

The new company was turned into a Kommanditselskab structure and in October 1874 the Jydsk Handels- og Landbrugsbank A/S company was formed with Christian Ludvig Kier as president until 1876 when it became a subsidiary of the Copenhagen Business Bank, under its own name for many years, effectively functioning as a branch. From 1921 NIels Jensen became director of the branch and later the assistant director of Copenhagen Business Bank in 1934 and the vice-president in 1948. In 1944 the branch was moved to R√•dhuspladsen and in 1990 the Copenhagen Business Bank, Danske Bank and Provinsbanken merged to form Danske Bank. The logo of the Copenhagen Business Bank was in use until the year of 2000 but the name and logo of Jydsk Handels- og Landbrugsbank was decommissioned.  Architecture  Jydsk Handels- og Landbrugsbank was situated on Lille Torv in Aarhus, in a building drawn by architect Sophus Frederik K√ºhnel, constructed in 1899‚Äì1900 and listed in 1996 by the Danish Heritage Agency. The building is mainly inspired by Italian renaissance architecture with elements of the national romantic style. The building is in 3 floors and sits on an inwardly leaning base of quarried granite ashlar topped with a bright profile strip. The outer walls of the ground floor is also granite ashlar but in different colors while red bricks are used on the upper floors and the low roof. The ashlar and brick sections are broken by a cornice and the brick section is topped with a heavy corbel cornice. The windows are framed in sandstone with twin arches above and rope ornaments on the sills below. The roof is half-hipped and topped with glazed tile. The interior features a marble stairwell with wrought iron railing and patterned masonry. The building remains close to original condition with the only major change being a new the window towards Vestergade being changed to a door when a shop moved in, in 2008, and ground floor windows having been replaced.

The site was discovered in 2007, during work to widen the Tbilisi-Senaki-Leselidze highway. Research is being done by students and faculty from Tbilisi State University. In 2015, a supposed script was discovered on the altar of a fertility goddess's temple, predating those previously known in the area by at least a thousand years. Layout Grakliani Hill. The site contains a temple to a fertility goddess from the seventh century BCE, a pit-type burial cemetery from the early Bronze Age, and the remains of a building from around 450-350 BCE; the building consists of three rooms with three storage rooms. The site had been occupied between the Chalcolithic and the Late Hellenistic periods. Discoveries The excavation of layers yielded artifacts including children's toys, weapons, icons, and pharmacological devices. Within the first two months of digging, archaeologists had excavated over 35,000 pieces from hundreds of graves and ruins of settlements that date back to the eighth century BCE. Several golden and bronze discs from the sixth century were discovered. These findings attest that this society possessed the technology of gilding and engraving. Among the most significant artifacts may be a fourth century BCE printing device. These were extremely rare seals used to stamp judicial documents; supposedly they originated from Uruk in Mesopotamia. Another notable find is that of a large and decorated ritual oven, an unprecedented find in archaeology. =Script= A previously unknown script was discovered just below a temple's collapsed altar to a fertility goddess from the seventh century BCE. These inscriptions differ from those at other temples at Grakliani, which show animals, people, or decorative elements. The script bears no resemblance to any alphabet currently known, although its letters are conjectured to be related to ancient Greek and Aramaic. The inscription appears to be the oldest native alphabet to be discovered in the whole Caucasus region, a thousand years older than any indigenous writing previously discovered in the region. In comparison, the earliest Armenian and Georgian scripts date from the fifth century AD, just after the respective cultures converted to Christianity. By September 2015, an area of 31 by 3 inches of the inscription had been excavated. According to Vakhtang Licheli, head of the Institute of Archaeology of the State University, \\"The writings on the two altars of the temple are really well preserved. On the one altar several letters are carved in clay while the second altar‚Äôs pedestal is wholly covered with writings.\\" The finding was made by unpaid students. After the revelation stipends became available and the government doubled the site's research budget. Significance to Georgia According to Licheli, who headed the archaeological expedition, the collective findings affirm the 3000-year-old existence of a Georgian statehood. The Ministry of Culture plans to turn the site into an open-air museum by the end of 2015.

The second tropical cyclone and second hurricane of the season, the storm developed from a tropical wave near Tobago on August 7\\\\. Steadily intensifying as it moved northwestward, the system passed through the southern Windward Islands. Upon entering the Caribbean Sea early on August 8, the tropical depression strengthened into a tropical storm. On August 9, the storm strengthened to the equivalent of a Category 1 hurricane. The next day, the hurricane peaked with winds of 90 mph (150 km/h). After striking the Tiburon Peninsula of Haiti, the cyclone began weakening and fell to tropical storm intensity on August 12\\\\. By midday on the following day, the storm made landfall near Cienfuegos, Cuba. Upon emerging into the Straits of Florida, the storm began to re-strengthen. Early on August 13, it struck Big Pine Key, Florida, as a strong tropical storm. Weakening slowly while moving north-northwestward, the system made another landfall near St. George Island. After moving inland, the tropical storm slowly deteriorated and dissipated over West Virginia on August 17\\\\. In Haiti, the storm completely wiped out livestock and many crops, particularly coffee, cocoa, and sugar. Several villages were also destroyed, rendering approximately 10,000 people homeless. Damage reached $1 million and there were at least 200 deaths. The only impact in Cuba was downed banana trees. In Florida, the storm left minor wind damage along the coast. A Seaboard Air Line Railroad station was destroyed in Boca Grande, while signs, trees, and telephone poles were knocked down in Sarasota. Several streets in St. Petersburg were closed due to flooding or debris. Between Cedar Key and the Florida Panhandle, several vessels capsized. Water washed up along the side of roads and in wooded areas. The storm contributed to flooding onset by the previous hurricane, with rainfall peaking at in Caesars Head, South Carolina. The worst impact from flooding occurred in North Carolina, where several houses were destroyed. Six people were killed in the state, of which four due to flooding. Property damage in the state totaled over $1 million. Overall, the storm caused at least $2 million in damage and 210 fatalities. Meteorological history A westward-moving tropical wave developed into a tropical depression while situated near Tobago on August 7. Initially, the storm was considered a \\"disturbance of slight to moderate intensity\\". Moving northwestward, the system passed through the Windward Islands just south of Carriacou and Petite Martinique. Upon entering the Caribbean Sea early on August 8, a ship reported winds of . As a result, HURDAT indicts that the depression became a tropical storm at 00:00 UTC. On August 9, the storm strengthened into a Category 1 hurricane on the modern-day Saffir‚ÄìSimpson hurricane wind scale, while located about 155 mi (250 km) south of San Pedro de Macor√≠s, Dominican Republic. At 12:00 UTC on August 10, the cyclone attained its peak intensity as strong Category 1 hurricane with maximum sustained winds with winds of 90 mph (150 km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of . Early on August 9, the storm made landfall in the Tiburon Peninsula of Haiti, based on \\"belated reports [indicating] that a very small but destructive disturbance passed over extreme southwest Haiti\\". The quickly re-emerged into the Caribbean Sea later that day. A small cyclone, the hurricane passed between Cuba and Jamaica and weakened to a tropical storm early on August 12\\\\. By midday, the storm made landfall near Cienfuegos, Cuba, with winds of 60 mph (95 km/h). Several telegraphic reports indicated that \\"the center [of the storm] was not definitely traceable for the next 24 to 36 hours\\", but other reports noted that the center passed over then-Oriente Province. Hours later, the system reached the Straits of Florida and immediately began to re-intensify. Early on August 13, it struck Big Pine Key, Florida, as a strong tropical storm with winds of 70 mph (110 km/h). Thereafter, the storm moved north-northwestward over the Gulf of Mexico. At 14:00 UTC on August 14, it made landfall near St. George Island, Florida, with winds of 50 mph (85 km/h). After moving inland, the tropical storm slowly deteriorated, falling to tropical depression intensity over east-central Alabama on August 15. Thereafter, the depression moved north-northeastward and dissipated over West Virginia on August 17. Impact =Greater Antilles= As the storm approached Hispaniola, warnings were sent to vessels offshore Haiti and Jamaica. In Haiti, the storm brought torrential rainfall for over 20 hours. Many villages were completely destroyed, leaving over 10,000 people homeless. The city of Saint-Louis-du-Sud was almost completely wiped out, with only two buildings retaining their roofs. Additionally, approximately 80% of buildings in Grand-Boucan and Petit Trou were flattened. Overall, most municipalities were flooded with of water. At least 200 deaths were recorded, including 26 in Mirago√¢ne and 12 at a single dwellings in Belle-Riviere. In the most devastated areas, flooding also killed all farm animals and entire coffee, cocoa, and sugar crops were wiped out. An estimated three to six months was required to regrow the lost agriculture. Along the coast, rough seas capsized or washed ashore many small crafts. The storm was described as the worst in Haiti since the 1886 Indianola hurricane. The storm destroyed most of the unpaved, vehicular trails in its path. Overall, the damage to roadways, communications, and public services was estimated at $1 million. After the storm, approximately 100,000 people were facing starvation. Then-Haitian president Louis Borno reported that the government had inefficient resources for recovery and asked citizens to assist with repairing infrastructure and providing food and shelter to others. The Government of Haiti, in turn, appropriated $200,000 for relief. Eleven storages with relief supplies were established throughout the country. The approximately 10,000 people left homeless were temporarily houses in larger, undamaged buildings. Within a few months after the storm, 299 homes were rebuilt or repaired, costing almost $37,000. The vehicular paths destroyed by the hurricane were eventually replaced by -wide paved gravel roads. In September, the American Red Cross donated $10,000 to the Haitian Red Cross. In Cuba, the storm brought gusty winds and excessive rainfall, but impact was primarily limited to fallen banana trees in an area then known as Oriente Province. =United States= Rainfall totals associated with the hurricane in the United States Hurricane warnings were hoisted in portions of the Florida Keys early on August 13\\\\. However, the highest observed wind speed was only . Between Cedar Key and the Florida Panhandle, some residents took refuge at churches and schools. In the mainland of Florida, winds resulted in generally minor damage along the west coast. In Boca Grande, a Seaboard Air Line Railroad station was destroyed. Plate glass was damaged and signs, trees, and telephone poles were knocked down in Sarasota. Rough seas began smashing a revenue cutter service ship docked at the Coast Guard station in St. Petersburg against the wharves; bumpers were placed between the ship and pilings to further damage. Several streets were closed due to flooding or debris. One street closed after roof tiles started falling from a theater. At one intersection, several cars were stranded due to of water covering the road. Although some coastal areas experienced rough seas, others reported their lowest tides in years, especially Pass-a-Grille and Tampa, with almost all of the water blown out of Boca Ciega Bay, which is located adjacent to the former. Several vessels, mostly small fishing crafts, capsized. Water washed up along the side of roads and in wooded areas, while many trees were toppled. The storm also contributed to ongoing flooding in the Southeastern United States onset by the previous hurricane. In Georgia, hydroelectric dams in Quitman were overtopped by creeks and rivers. One highway was completely submerged and four bridges were swept away. A railroad passenger train was abandoned due to water rising above the tracks. The Ocmulgee River at Macon crested at . Additionally, the Withlacoochee River was expect to reach its highest level in years. Overall, crops, highways, and railroads across the southern portion of the state were severely damaged. Milledgeville was left without water due to flooding. The Oconee River was expected to reach in height at the city's river gauge. A bridge across the Oconee was swept away as was approximately of railroad tracks. About 200 families in Augusta evacuated due to the rising Savannah River. In South Carolina, rainfall peaked at in Caesars Head, which is the highest precipitation total associated with the storm. The city of Spartanburg prepared for its worst flood since 1916. Throughout Upstate South Carolina, highways, railroads, and crops were flooded. In Bath, a \\"freakish\\" tornado destroyed at least 50 homes and injured one person. Additionally, a wind storm in Newberry County severely damaged \\"scores\\" of dwellings. Two deaths occurred in South Carolina. In North Carolina, rainfall caused the Catawba, French Broad, Swannanoa, and Yadkin rivers to overflow their banks. Many nearby homes and structures were swept away. Families along the South Pacolet River near Tryon were evacuated. Additionally, two shelters were set up in Asheville, one at a Salvation Army post and another at the municipal auditorium, where hundreds of cots were set- up. A mudslide near Asheville moved across a railroad track, blocking the route to locomotive traffic. Several feet of water covered highways near Marshall, leaving many roads impassable. Extensive crop losses also occurred in western North Carolina, with agricultural losses reaching $250,000 in Burke County alone. Six people were killed in the state, of which four due to flooding and two others from a tornado in Ashley Heights. Property damage totaled over $1 million. Rainfall from both the previous hurricane and this storm brought flooding to Virginia. Major flooding was reported along the Roanoke River from Brookneal to Roanoke. At the former, the river crested at above flood stage. In Altavista, crops were ruined and 11 buildings were flooded. Route 17 north of Fincastle was inundated, blocking traffic between Clifton Forge and Covington. Two deaths occurred in Virginia, one from drowning and another from fright while crossing the Roanoke River.

Ames first published The Dom Project with Carina Press with another author, Heloise Belleau in 2013. The main character was a tall, \\"tattooed Asian bad-boy Dom.\\" Ames's first solo book, The Submission Gift, released in 2014, was reviewed by Publishers Weekly, which called it a \\"nuanced look at polyamory and BDSM.\\" In the story, a husband hires a rent boy as a \\"gift\\" to his wife. He does this because he has just recovered from a bad car accident and can't provide a full sex life for his wife any longer. Her second solo publication, The Companion Contract, released in 2015, was also favorably reviewed by Publishers Weekly. This book is about a woman who works as a pornography actress, but wants to move onto another career and another place in her life. Ames always makes a point to include safe sex practices in her writing whether this includes using condoms or partners being regularly screened for sexually transmitted infections (STI). When Ames first started writing romance novels, she wanted to create multicultural stories. She says that \\"Characters aren't as real to me if I don't understand where they come from.\\" Ames also stresses how treating multiculturalism in erotica must be rooted in a sense of personhood, rather than \\"fetishizing\\" or objectifying the person for their differences. Personal life Ames's father was a Japanese citizen, and her mother was raised in the United States: each had different expectations on how to raise their daughter. Ames has characterized them as \\"anarcho-hippies\\". Growing up, Ames felt that she was often fetishized by men who viewed Asian women as sex objects. During her early twenties, she worked in a strip club in order to make money, though she doesn't \\"talk about it much after because of the stigma\\". Ames is married and has children.

There are two recognized species, T. kauaeroa and T. lophocephalus. Description Tokarahia differs from other eomysticetids in possessing elongate, dorsoventrally tapering zygomatic processes that are medially bowed, with a concave lateral margin, an elongate diamond-shaped posterior bullar facet lacking longitudinal striations, and a transverse crest on the dorsal surface of the periotic, between the posterodorsal angle and the posterior internal acoustic meatus. It is similar to Tohoraata raekohao in having numerous foramina in the supraorbital process of the frontal, an ovalshaped incisural Ô¨Çange closely appressed to the anteroventral part of the pars cochlearis, a prominent dorsal tubercle between the stylomastoid fossa and apertures for the cochlear and vestibular aqueducts, a triangular anterior process in medial view with a posteriorly placed anterodorsal angle, a concave anterodorsal margin between the anteroventral and anterodorsal angles, an internal acoustic meatus that is anteriorly transversely pinched, a posterodorsal angle that is more acute and approximately 90¬∞ or smaller, and lacking a posterior bullar facet that is ‚Äòfolded‚Äô into two facets by a hingeline, and additionally lacking longitudinal striations on the posterior bullar facet. However, it differs from Tohoraata in the structure of the earbone. The two species of Tokarahia are distinguished by the structure of the earbone as well as the degree of cranial telescoping.Robert W. Boessenecker and R. Ewan Fordyce (2015). \\"A new genus and species of eomysticetid (Cetacea: Mysticeti) and a reinterpretation of ‚ÄòMauicetus‚Äô lophocephalus Marples, 1956: Transitional baleen whales from the upper Oligocene of New Zealand\\".

Taxonomy The type species, Tokarahia kauaeroa, is known from the holotype specimen OU 22235, which was found in the lower Maerewhenua Member of the Otekaike Limestone in New Zealand. The second species, T. lophocephalus, is known from the holotype OM GL 412 and referred specimen OM GL 443, both from the Kokoamu Greensand. It was originally described as a new species of Mauicetus, M. lophocephalus, before its eomysticetid affinities became clear.Marples BJ. 1956. Cetotheres (Cetacea) from the Oligocene of New Zealand. Proceedings of the Zoological Society of London 126: 565‚Äì580. Paleobiology Based on the enlarged temporal fossae and enlarged mandibular canal, Tokarahia was probably incapable of lunge- feeding, although it remains unclear whether it could skim-feed or filter prey in the benthic zone.

She made three full voyages for the EIC before the French privateer Robert Surcouf captured her in 1796 while she was on her fourth voyage. The British Royal Navy recaptured her in 1798 and the EIC chartered her for three more voyages to Britain. Her subsequent fate is unknown. Career The EIC took Triton up as for six voyages a regular ship.Select (1814), p.81. She completed three and was captured on her fourth. =First voyage (1788-89)= Under the command of Captain William Agnew, Triton sailed from The Downs on 5 April 1788, bound for Madras and Bengal. She reached Madras on 14 July and arrived at Diamond Harbour on 23 July. She left Bengal on 30 December, reached St Helena on 7 March, before arriving at The Downs on 14 May.British Library: Triton (3). Of her 118 passengers, not less than 98 had been soldiers in India. They had served out their contracts and were returning to England at the EIC's expense, together with their wives and children. Most of these men were now entitled to a lifetime pension from the EIC.Edinburgh Evening Courant, 18 May 1789, p.4. =Second voyage (1790-91)= Captain Agnew again left The Downs on 5 January 1790, this time bound for Madras and China. Triton reached Madras on 9 July, and arrived at Whampoa on 30 August. Homeward bound, she crossed the Second Bar on 2 February 1791, reached the Cape on 9 April and St Helena on 28 April, arriving at The Downs on 28 June. =Third voyage (1793-94)= Capt Philip Burnyeat sailed Triton from Torbay on 13 January 1793, bound for Madras, Bengal and China. She reached Madras on 21 May, leaving on 6 July. Trtion was at Pondicherry on 15 July, together with Warley, and , maintaining a blockade of the port, together with .Universal Magazine, January 1794, p. 60. Triton had sailed from Fort Saint George (Madras) as escort to Admiral Lord Cornwallis, then Governor General of India, who was traveling to Pondicherry in a small captured French vessel. Triton also escorted him back, returning to Madras on 30 July. (Pondicherry fell to the Army on 23 August.) She reached Kedgeree on 8 August, and then on 8 September was at Madras again. She reached Penang on 4 October and Malacca on 19 October, before arriving at Whampoa on 15 December. She crossed the Second Bar on 14 March 1794, reached St Helena on 18 June, left on 1 July, and arrived at The Downs on 17 September. =Fourth voyage and capture (1795-96)= Engraving of the battle, by Ambroise Louis Garneray. Captain Burnyeat left Portsmouth on 9 July 1795, bound for Madras and Bengal. Because she was travelling in wartime, Burnyeat had arranged for a letter of marque, as was customary for EIC ships, which was issued to him on 1 May 1795.\\"Register of Letters of Marque against France 1793-1815\\", p.90. - accessed 11 June 2011. This authorized him to engage in offensive action against the French, not just defensive. The French captured Triton at Balasore Roads on 29 January 1796. The privateer Robert Surcouf had had a successful cruise in the Indian Ocean capturing several vessels, including the pilot boat Cartier, which he renamed Hasard. He transferred his remaining men from his ship √âmilie to Hasard and on 28 January, sighting Triton at anchor, decided to attack. He recognised only too late the overwhelming superiority of his opponent.Levot (1866), p.494. Surcouf, feeling unable to flee, decided to board her with his 26 men,Rouvier, p.252. After haranguing his men, he approached under a British flag,Rouvier, p.253 before hoisting French colours at the very last moment and launching a violent assault.Cunat, p.395 In the ensuing 45-minute battle, Triton suffered 5 wounded and 10 killed,Hennequin, p.380. including Burnyeat and the first officer, Picket; Surcouf transferred his prisoners to Diana, another vessel that he had captured, and which he released to her captain against a 30,000 rupee ransom.Granier, p.218. Newspaper accounts stated that a boatswain had persuaded 20 members of Tritons deck crew to decline to fight.A Peoples' History 1793 ‚Äì 1844 from the newspapers ‚Äì accessed 17 July 2018. Surcouf returned to √éle de France (Mauritius) with his prizes,Rouvier, p.254. arriving on 10 March 1796. However, √âmilie had been sailing without a letter of marque, so although the Prize court declared the prizes legal, it seized them and sold them for the benefit of the State. The EIC put the value of the cargo it lost at ¬£3,030.Reports from the Select Committee of the House of Commons appointed to into the present state of the affairs of the East India Company, together with the minutes of evidence, an appendix of documents, and a general index, (1830), Vol. 2, p.976. Recapture and subsequent career Triton returned quickly to British ownership as a country ship, i.e., sailing in the coastal trade. She was reportedly purchased at Mauritius by an American and entered Calcutta under American colours a few months after her capture.Analytical Review (1799), Vol. 28, p.434. Apparently the American sold her to Calcutta owners. The EIC chartered her to serve as a transport, one of about 15, in a planned attack on Manila.Select (1814), p.654. The EIC chartered her from 25 May 1797 to 25 March 1798 at sicca rupees 10,000 pr month. However, the British Government cancelled the invasion following a peace treaty with Spain and the EIC released the vessels it had engaged. Triton arrived at Madras on 24 June 1798. Later, the EIC chartered her as an extra ship for three voyages, for which records exist for the second and third: =First voyage (1798‚Äì99)= Triton, under the command of Captain David Dunlop, arrived in England on 28 September 1799 from Madras.Hardy (1800), p.224-5. Outfitting Triton for her return voyage cost ¬£9,920 9s 2d, and was billed on 6 March 1800. =Second voyage (1800-1801)= Captain David Dunlop left Madras on 10 October 1800, bound for London. Triton reached St Helena on 12 December, and Spithead on 22 February 1801. She was at The Downs on 1 March, and London on 5 March.British Library: Triton (4). There she delivered a cargo of rice. Outfitting Triton for her return voyage cost ¬£7,474 9s 3d, and was billed on 15 July. =Third voyage (1802)= Captain Nicholas Anstis left Calcutta on 26 February 1802. Triton left Kedgeree on 17 April, and reached St Helena on 9 July. she arrived at The Downs on 13 September. Outfitting Triton for her return voyage cost ¬£1,926 9s 2d, and was billed on 1 November.Select (1814), pp.613-4. On 12 January 1803 Triton, Captain Anstiss, arrived at Bahia requiring repairs. The authorities put many administrative and pecuniary obstacles in his way and he was not able to effect his repairs and leave until 6 February. While Triton was at Bahia, the captain and crew of the whaler brig arrived there; she had been wrecked a few days earlier south of Bahia.Lindley (1808), pp.125-133. Triton appears in the 1804 volume of the Register of Shipping with N. Ansties, master, Scott & Co., owners, and trade London‚ÄìIndia.

It is approximately long and flows through Newton Township in Lackawanna County and Falls Township in Wyoming County. The watershed of the creek has an area of . The creek is a perennial stream and is not designated as an impaired waterbody. Major geographical features in its watershed include the Buttermilk Falls in its lower reaches, as well as Fords Lake and Lake Winola. A number of bridges have been constructed over Buttermilk Creek. There is also some development in the watershed. In the early 1900s, the major industries in the watershed were agriculture and a summer resort. The creek's drainage basin is designated as a Coldwater Fishery and a Migratory Fishery. Hemlock trees inhabit its vicinity. Buttermilk Creek has two named tributaries: Falls Creek and Beaver Creek. Course Buttermilk Creek looking downstream at Buttermilk Falls Buttermilk Creek begins in Fords Lake in Newton Township, Lackawanna County. It flows south for a few tenths of a mile before turning west for a few miles. In this reach, the creek enters a valley, passes through two ponds or small lakes, and passes by Griffin Hill. It then enters Falls Township, Wyoming County, where it eventually turns northwest for a few tenths of a mile, crossing Pennsylvania Route 307. The creek then gradually turns west and then southwest for more than a mile, remaining in its valley and flowing alongside Pennsylvania Route 307. It then receives Beaver Creek, its first named tributary, from the right, and turns south. After a few tenths of a mile, it turns west and receives the tributary Falls Creek from the left. The creek then turns south-southwest for more than a mile and its valley broadens. It then turns south-southeast for a few tenths of a mile before turning south- southwest for a few tenths of a mile. At this point, the creek turns west. After a few tenths of a mile, it passes Buttermilk Falls and reaches its confluence with the Susquehanna River. Buttermilk Creek joins the Susquehanna River upriver of its mouth. =Tributaries= Buttermilk Creek has two named tributaries: Falls Creek and Beaver Creek. Falls Creek joins Buttermilk Creek upstream of its mouth and its watershed has an area of . Beaver Creek joins Buttermilk Creek upstream of its mouth and drains an area of . Hydrology and climate Buttermilk Creek is not designated as an impaired waterbody. Along with Gardner Creek, it is one of only two perennial streams in the Ransom quadrangle. In the early 1900s, the average annual rate of precipitation in the watershed of Buttermilk Creek was . Geography and geology The elevation near the mouth of Buttermilk Creek is above sea level. The elevation of the creek's source is between above sea level. The topography of the watershed of Buttermilk Creek was described as \\"rough and hilly\\" in the Water Resources Inventory Report in 1921. The creek's valley is surrounded by steep hills that have been rounded by glaciation. The creek's channel is sinuous and flows through rock formations consisting of sandstone. In the distant past, accumulating piles of glacial drift caused Buttermilk Creek to alter its course and flow over a series of cliffs as a waterfall. The total height of the cliffs is and they consist of sandstone of the Catskill Formation. The falls, which are known as Buttermilk Falls, are a series of low waterfalls that are an \\"excellent example of the type\\" and \\"the most outstanding example of this kind of waterfall system in Pennsylvania\\". Each individual waterfall ranges in height from . The falls are located upstream of the creek's mouth. Buttermilk Creek flows through a narrow defile in its lower reaches. In some reaches, the creek flows through bottom lands and swamps in glacial drift. Above the Buttermilk Falls, Buttermilk Creek flows over glacial drift. The creek is a relatively small stream with headwaters in a mountain lake. The surficial geology along most of Buttermilk Creek consists of alluvium. However, in the creek's upper reaches, Wisconinan Till makes up all the surficial geology along it. In the lower and middle reaches, there are also small patches of Wisconsinan Outwash, which contains stratified sand and gravel, and Wisconsinan Ice-Contact Stratified Drift, which contains stratified sand and gravel, as well as some boulders. Bedrock also occurs in the surficial geology near the creek's mouth. Additionally, there are a few patches of alluvial fan, peat bogs and other wetlands, lakes, and sandstone and shale pits in the watershed. Watershed The watershed of Buttermilk Creek has an area of . The creek is entirely within the United States Geological Survey quadrangle of Ransom. Its watershed is mainly in southwestern Lackawanna County and southeastern Wyoming County. Geary Enterprises has permission to withdraw no more than 99,000 gallons of water per day from Buttermilk Creek. This company is a sand and gravel company that uses the water for drilling gas wells. There are a number of lakes in the watershed of Buttermilk Creek. Major ones include Fords Lake on Buttermilk Creek itself and Lake Winola, which has an area of approximately , on one of its tributaries. A reservoir on the creek upstream of its mouth was proposed in the 1970s. It could have ultimately provided 109,000 recreation days per year. History Buttermilk Creek was entered into the Geographic Names Information System on August 2, 1979. Its identifier in the Geographic Names Information System is 1198508. In the mid-1800s, the watershed of Buttermilk Creek was mostly wild and sparsely populated. However, there was a small village at the creek's mouth, with some flour mills and a factory. The area in the vicinity of Buttermilk Falls is now developed, with a village known as Falls being located at the creek's mouth. In the early 1900s, the main industries in the watershed of Buttermilk Creek included agriculture and a summer resort. Major settlements in the watershed at this time included Mill City, Falls, and Lake Winola. Their populations were 415, 155, and 60, respectively. A steel stringer/multi-beam or girder bridge carrying T362/Creek Flats Road over Buttermilk Creek was built in 1916 in Falls and was repaired in 1982. This bridge is long. A concrete slab bridge carrying State Route 2027 over the creek was built in 1958 in Falls Township, Wyoming County and is long. A wood stringer/multi-beam or girder bridge carrying T373 over the creek was built in 1978 in Falls Township, Wyoming County and is long. A prestressed box beam or girders bridge carrying State Route 2015 was constructed across the creek in 1990 in Falls Township, Wyoming County and is long. A bridge over the creek in Falls Township was damaged during flooding in 2006. In 2007, Quality Engineering Solutions came to be in charge of a bridge restoration project funded by the Federal Emergency Management Agency for that bridge. Biology The drainage basin of Buttermilk Creek is designated as a Coldwater Fishery and a Migratory Fishery. Hemlock trees occur along the creek in its lower reaches.

He was military commander and Governor of Jamaica from 1702 to 1710. He returned to England in 1711 and later purchased Gaynes Hall near Great Staughton in Cambridgeshire, where he died on 26 March 1729. Life Gaynes Hall, post restoration; purchased by Thomas in 1717 Thomas Handasyd was born about 1645 in Elsdon, Northumberland, to Colonel Roger Handasyd and his wife Margaret. He was the third of four children, three of whom lived to a great age; Gerrard (ca 1640-1735), Ann (ca 1644-?) and Roger (1653-1734). In 1686, he married Anna Morel (died 1704) and they had five surviving children; Roger Handasyd (1689-1763), Thomas (1692-1729), William (1693-1745), who all served in the military, as well as Clifford (1695-1772) and Anne (1697-1777). After he returned from Jamaica, he purchased Gaynes Hall near Great Staughton, where he died on 26 March 1729 and buried in the parish church of St Andrews. Career The 1638-1651 Wars of the Three Kingdoms created strong resistance in Scotland and England to a permanent military; this meant those who wanted to pursue a military career often did so in foreign armies. When the Third Anglo-Dutch War began in 1672, the Duke of Buckingham was authorised to recruit a regiment for service against the Dutch. Thomas' cousin James was a lieutenant in this unit and it is probable Thomas served with him. St. John's, Newfoundland; while serving here in 1697-1698, Handasyd lost 214 of 300 men to disease and starvation When England and the Netherlands made peace in the January 1674 Treaty of Westminster, these recruits enrolled in the Anglo-Scots Brigade, a mercenary unit in Dutch service. The first confirmed record of Thomas' service is his commission as captain in 1688 but he is referred to in 1698 as having '24 years service;' this makes it likely he saw action during the 1672-1678 Franco-Dutch War. His movements can be traced by the birth of his first two children in the Dutch port of Heusden between 1687 to 1689, while the others were born in Ireland between 1692 to 1694. The Brigade accompanied William III to England in the November 1688 Glorious Revolution; Thomas served in the 1689-1691 Williamite War in Ireland, including the Battle of the Boyne. After the 1691 Treaty of Limerick, he was among those transferred to Flanders during the Nine Years War. In March 1694, he was appointed Major in a new regiment raised by Colonel John Gibson, a former colleague in the Dutch Brigade. Godfrey, Handasyd, Thomas West Indies; as Governor of Jamaica, Handasyd controlled an important commercial and strategic possession In June 1696, a French naval force captured the British town of St. John's, Newfoundland; this was strategically important due to its proximity to the cod fishing areas of the Grand Banks. Gibson was given command of an expedition to retake it, which included Thomas; when they arrived in early 1697, the French had already evacuated the town but destroyed it first. Due to shortage of provisions, the majority of the force went back to Europe, leaving 300 men under Handasyd and the engineer Michael Richards to rebuild the town. By the time Handasyd returned to England in 1698, 214 of his men had died of malnutrition or disease, testimony to the harsh conditions. Godfrey, Handasyd, Thomas Peter Beckford, President Jamaican Assembly; Handasyd resigned as Governor after his death in 1710 After the September 1697 Treaty of Ryswick ended the war, Parliament was determined to reduce costs; Gibson's Regiment was disbanded and by 1699, the English military was less than 7,000 men. When the War of the Spanish Succession began in 1701, Thomas became Lieutenant-Colonel in the 22nd Foot, which was posted to Jamaica, a notoriously unhealthy location. Its Colonel William Selwyn died soon after arriving in April 1702 and Thomas took over as Colonel. As the senior military officer, Thomas also became Governor, an important position due to Jamaica's hugely profitable sugar plantations. It was also used as a resupply point for the Royal Navy; in March 1703, an English squadron under John Graydon was sent to attack the French town of Placentia, in Newfoundland. His ships arrived in Jamaica short of men and in poor condition; Handasyd made strenuous efforts to resupply him but the local merchants later complained about the impressment of local seamen. His wife Anna died in September 1704 and was buried in St. Jago de la Vega or Spanish Town Cathedral. Like his predecessor, Sir William Beeston, Thomas had a difficult relationship with the planter-dominated Jamaican Assembly. This came to a head in 1710, when he tried to dissolve the Assembly and in the ensuing commotion, its President Peter Beckford died after allegedly falling down the stairs. Thomas now requested he be relieved and was replaced as Governor by Lord Archibald Hamilton, while his son Roger became Colonel of the regiment. He was promoted Major-General and returned to England in early 1711; he purchased the estate of Gaynes Hall near Great Staughton, Cambridgeshire, where he died on 26 March 1729 and was buried in the parish church of St Andrews, where his memorial still exists.

Career His father and family background is unknown. Mojs owned landholdings mostly in Somogy and Tolna counties in addition to estates along the river Drava. He had a brother Nicholas, who functioned as isp√°n of Vas County either in 1208 and 1213, and also appeared in diplomas as \\"Nicholas de D√°r√≥\\", thus he was ancestor of the D√°r√≥i noble family. Mojs I married Venys from the kindred Monoszl√≥, a daughter of Macarius II Monoszl√≥. They had three children: Alexander, the Bearer of the sword in 1233; Mojs II, who had held several important dignities since the 1250s and an unidentified daughter, who married Nana B√°r-Kal√°n, the son of Pousa B√°r-Kal√°n. Through Alexander, Mojs I was also a forefather of the Gereci and H√°bi families.Engel: Geneal√≥gia (Mojs kinship 1.) Mojs was first mentioned by contemporary sources, when he served as isp√°n of Vas County in 1209, presumably replacing his brother in that position. He participated in the Fifth Crusade under the command of Andrew II between 1217 and 1218. Mojs belonged to the entourage of Duke B√©la, who had long opposed his father's \\"useless and superfluous perpetual grants\\". Such, as a member of the internal opposition, Mojs did not hold any royal dignities for the upcoming two decades, after 1209. In 1228, Duke B√©la, who gained prominence due to the advancing support of the lords, was able to overshadow King Andrew's most faithful confidant Denis, son of Ampud, who lost his influence and replaced by Mojs as Palatine. Beside that he also governed Bihar County between 1229 and 1231. As none of his charters preserved, there is no record of any judgments and other activity, while Mojs held the dignity. Around May 1231, Denis regained the confidence of the King and was appointed Palatine again, succeeding Mojs, who, according to a non-authentic charter, still held the office in 1232, mistakenly. He was present among the King's companion in the forests of Bereg on 20 August 1233, where Andrew II vowed that he would not employ Jews and Muslims to administrate royal revenues, and would pay 10,000 marks as compensation for usurped Church revenues. A false diploma issued in October 1244 suggests that Mojs served as Judge royal in that year. It is presumable that Mojs died before 1235, when his patron B√©la IV ascended the Hungarian throne.

She started the Halla Pai Huhm dance studio, and after her death the Halla Pai Huhm Foundation's Dance Collection was started from her collection of documents, photographs, and recordings.  Biography  = Early life and education = Born in Busan, Pai Huhm moved to Japan with four siblings when she was five and was raised by her father's niece, Pai Ku-ja. Pai was a dancer who taught Huhm the foundations of modern, Japanese, and Korean dance, and passed the name \\"Pai\\" to her. Huhm then studied ballet and modern dance in Europe while studying for a Bachelor's degree at Jitsen University. When World War II broke out, she returned to Korea. She studied Korean dance with Han Sung-jin and other masters, and continued her studies even after she immigrated to Hawaii in 1949. Huhm would regularly travel back to Korea as part of her job at a travel agency, and used this time to further her studies. = Honolulu = Huhm moved to Hawaii in 1949 to follow her husband, a Korean-American soldier. Huhm first appeared in Honolulu's theater scene during a production of Teahouse of the Autumn Moon at the Honolulu Community Theatre in 1954. She started teaching Korean dance informally in 1950, but by 1960 she had established a dance studio. She struggled to keep it open due to lack of financial support. This can be attributed to a belief at the time that only kisaeng dance. The studio's early struggles could also be attributed to local Koreans view that Huhm was \\"too Japanese\\" because she spoke fluent Japanese and got along well with members of the Japanese community. She kept the studio afloat using funds from her job at a travel agency. In 1959, she began teaching Korean dance at the University of Hawaii at Manoa. She stopped teaching at the University in the 1970s, but maintained close ties with their Korean Studies Center. In 1983 she taught Korean dance at the Chongju University of Education. Huhm taught dance not only to preserve Korean dance in Hawaii, but also to pass on the traditions and values of her culture. Some of her most well-known collaborations were with Chun Hyung Kim, a dancer specializing in Korean court dances; and Ji San Lee, a shaman. = Legacy = The Halla Pai Huhm Korean Dance Studio is \\"the only continuous source of Korean dance and music in the United States\\". Huhm was the first recipient of the Outstanding Korean in Hawaii award. She also received a cultural medal from the South Korean government in 1980.

The signatories were, for Russia, Ivan Zakharov, consul- general of Ili, and Ivan Fedorovich Babkov, colonel of the Separate Siberian Corps of the General Staff, and, for China, Ming I, general of Uliastai; Hsi Lin, amban of Tarbagatai; and Bolgosu, Tarbagatai brigade commander. By this agreement, Russia gained about 350,000 square miles of territory at the expense of Chinese Xinjiang, and Lake Balkhash went from lying on the border to being entirely surrounded by Russia. It is sometimes numbered among the \\"unequal treaties\\". Most of this land transfer was rural and related to water rights. The city of Almaty is the most prominent urban center to have been built on this formerly Qing land. Nearby Bishkek, sacked four years earlier, appears not to have ever been officially under Qing suzerainty, but perhaps loosely associated. A Russian and Chinese border commission assembled at T'a-ch'eng (also known as Tarbagatai or Chuguchak) in China on 13 May 1861 in order to map the western border in accordance with Article III of the Treaty of Peking of 1860. The actual surveying did not begin until 11 July 1862. Both countries sought to influence the survey by the threat of military force and by alliances with local tribes, but the Russian delegation was under orders to insist on a border determined by topography and not by the boundaries between local ethnic groups. According to Babkov, \\"The deployment of our forces on the border clearly demonstrated to the Chinese that we had the means to uphold our demands with an armed hand whenever we wished. [This deployment] on our side of the Chinese pickets, under no circumstances can be considered a violation of international law or of friendly relations: all forces are deployed on the lands of the Kirghiz, who are Russian subjects, and ... are under strict orders never to cross the permanent Chinese picket line.\\" Negotiations were burdened by disagreements in interpreting Article II of the Treaty of Peking. The Chinese argued that it could not be taken as the basis for negotiations since the Chinese delegate who negotiated it was ignorant of central Asian conditions. The article also failed to distinguish between the different Chinese picket lines. The Chinese delegation argued that the outermost picket line was intended, while the Russians insisted that only the innermost picket line of permanent control could count. Both claimed the inhabitants between the two picket lines as their own subjects. The Russians rejected all Chinese maps as unscientific. The first round of negotiations ended in failure in September 1862. In the summer of 1863 the Russians sent out an independent survey team, which resulted in skirmishes between Russian and Chinese troops. The objective of Russian policy in settling its border with China in 1858‚Äì64 was to establish control over a region and negotiate recognition of its sovereignty after the fact. The intensification of the Dungan Revolt that broke out in the spring of 1862 drew China's attention away from the border and toward internal security in Xinjiang. When the Chinese finally signed a protocol delimiting the border in Russia's favour, the delegates warned the Russians that the rebels were approaching Tarbagatai. The rebel leader, Yaqub Beg, initially refused to recognise the new border and recruited Kirghiz from the Russian side. As a result of the rebellion, the border markers, which were to be set up in 1865, were not put in place until 1869. Further border protocols were signed at Khovd in 1869 and at Tarbagatai in 1870. __NOTOC__ See also * Treaty of Kulja (1851), a previous trade treaty for the same area Notes Sources External links *Text of the Treaty of Tarbagatai Tarbagatai Category:China‚ÄìRussia treaties Tarbagatai Tarbagatai ","title":"Treaty of Tarbagatai"},{"id":"47724263","text":"Bill Green (12 October 1914 ‚Äì 2 December 1981) was an Australian rules footballer who played with Essendon in the Victorian Football League (VFL).

The tree is over 2,000 years old and stands 40 feet (12 m) from the former site of The Senator, a 3,500-year-old Pond Cypress that burned down on January 16, 2012. With the Senator's demise, Big Tree Park has taken greater notice of its last remaining giant and has taken steps to ensure its preservation. Dimensions Historical marker at the base of the tree. At the time of its last recorded measurement in 2015, the tree stood 82 feet tall with a trunk circumference of 394 inches and a crown spread of 34 feet. Its dimensions do not grant it status as a Florida Champion tree of its species, but it is listed among numerous challengers. Age No specific aging statistics for the tree are available. However based on its size, numerous forestry sources--including the county's historical marker for the tree-- estimate that the tree is at least 2,000 years old. Name For years, the large tree standing nearby The Senator was simply called \\"The Companion.\\" However, in 2005, Geneva Elementary School held a contest to find a more suitable name for the tree. Two fifth graders submitted the name \\"Lady Liberty,\\" winning the contest. One of the tree's branches stands at an angle which, if viewed correctly, \\"sort of looks like the uplifted arm of the Statute of Liberty.\\" Preservation Lady Liberty has only been directly viewable since 2005, when the tree was officially renamed. At that point, the county extended the boardwalk to provide access to the tree and also erected a protective fence surrounding it. Since the destruction of The Senator, the tree has assumed the spotlight at Big Tree Park as Seminole county seeks to both maintain the park's popularity and to ensure the preservation of its last remaining giant. The park remained closed for several months immediately after the fire during which time both Lady Liberty and The Senator's former location were surrounded by new, taller and stronger fences. In 2015, a group of arborists petitioned the county to take cuttings from the tree, treating them with steroids to initiate root growth, with the goal of creating a successful clone of the tree.

In 2007 the annual 250 mile race at the track was repurposed to raise money and garner support for the IWK Health Centre in Halifax, Nova Scotia. It has since become one of the premier Pro Stock races in North America, attracting national attention, as well as some of the sports top drivers, including NASCAR Champions Brad Keselowski and Matt Crafton, V8 Supercars Champion Marcos Ambrose, and Daytona 500 winner Joey Logano. Prior to the 2015 IWK 250 the event has raised over $250,000 for the IWK. History =Early history= The first 250 was an unsanctioned race that took place in 1977 under track promoters Jerry Lawrence and Ron King, the event would be the first 250 lap race in all of Atlantic Canada. Ontario's Billy Watson picked up the win in that first event. From 1979‚Äì1981 the race was won by Don Biederman, who is best known as being the first Canadian driver to run a full season in the NASCAR Grand National Series. The 1981 race was the last event that was not sanctioned by a touring series. The race then took a five-year hiatus from before returning in 1986 under MASCAR sanctioning, with Greg Sewart winning the first race back. John Chisholm sold the track to Eric Vandaalen in 1989. The 1991 and 1992 editions of the 250, then known as the Riverside 250, were sanctioned by the American Canadian Tour. Both these events were run by another Canadian racing legend, Junior Hanley. 1993 saw the return of MASCAR sanctioning, with Greg Sewart taking his second win overall in the event. MASCAR sanctioning would continue for the remainder of the 1999 races. Scott Fraser dominated the event during this time, winning five consecutive races from 1994‚Äì1998. Following the 1999 running of the 250 the track had fallen into such disrepair that the event was indefinitely cancelled until 2006 when track owner Eric Vandaalen suddenly died and John Chisholm repurchased the track from Vandaalen's estate and completely rebuilt it. =2007 IWK 250= The 2007 IWK 250 was the first event to be run in support of the IWK Health Centre and with that track promoters wanted to have a big name driver headline the event. NASCAR Hall of Fame inductee Bill Elliott was tapped to be that driver. According to track staff, Riverside paid an extra premium on April 27, 2007 to guarantee his inclusion in the race and heavily promoted his involvement in the race with all the promotional material revolving around Elliott, right down to the design on the tickets. However, just ten days before the race Elliott informed Riverside that he would not be attending via written notice, saying he would be \\"too busy\\" to attend, and adding \\"There is no way I am going to Nova Scotia to race that weekend. Now stop bugging me.\\" This decision by Elliott received a tremendous amount of criticism from fans and media, as it was seen as Elliott bailing on a charity race, with some going as far as encouraging fans to contact Elliott directly to voice their displeasure. This led to Elliott releasing a formal statement via Motorsports Management International; Regan Smith on the backstretch during practice for the 2007 IWK 250 The track eventually secured both Regan Smith and Ricky Craven as Elliott's replacement. This would be the last time that Riverside would promote their celebrity driver so heavily in race promotional activities. Ricky Craven was involved in an early crash with teammate Donald Chisholm, and left the track during the half way break to get a head start home. The event was dominated by veteran racing father and son Mike & Ben Rowe who held off a hard charging Regan Smith to finish 1-2 respectively. This would mark the only time the podium was dominated by American born drivers, with the Rowe family hailing from Maine, and Smith coming from New York. The next year the race was sanctioned by the Maritime Pro Stock Tour in an attempt to get fans more excited about the local drivers. =2008 IWK 250= The 2008 IWK 250 featured the return of Regan Smith, who finished third the previous year, along with Dale Earnhardt Inc. teammate Aric Almirola as the tracks celebrity drivers. Smith became the first and to date only driver who has competed in NASCAR's national touring series to claim victory in the event, while Almirola finished 7th. Shawn Turple and Mike MacKenzie joined Smith on the podium. =2013 IWK 250= The 2013 running of the IWK 250 attracted their biggest named driver yet when it was announced that defending NASCAR Sprint Cup Series Champion Brad Keselowski made the trip to Nova Scotia to partake in the event. Keselowski brought with him Brad Keselowski Racing development driver Austin Theriault to join him at the event. Before the race, track owner and philanthropist John Chisholm donated $1 million to support the development of a new state-of-the-art Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) at the IWK. Hometown favourite Donald Chisholm had the fastest time in time trials with a time of 14.399 seconds, while Jonathan Hicken won the Dash for Cash, putting him on the pole. Brad Keselowski led 152 laps in the race giving him the Linde Most Laps Led award. Keselowski looked primed to pick up the win until Shawn Tucker laid the bump-and-run with 25 laps remaining, allowing Chisholm to get by as well. That's the way the podium spots stayed until the end, with Kent Vincent finishing fourth and Theriault finishing 5th to round out the top five. =2014 IWK 250= The 2014 IWK 250 was dedicated to John Chisholm, who died just a couple of weeks before the event. It was announced in June that defending NASCAR Camping World Truck Series Champion Matt Crafton would be entering the event. Donald Chisholm dominated the race, leading 218 of 250 laps, before John Flemming stole the win, beating Chisholm on a restart with three laps to go. Flemming would become the first driver to win two 250's in the IWK era. =2015 IWK 250= From left to right: IWK 250 3rd Place Trophy, John W. Chisholm Memorial Cup, IWK 250 Trophy Presented by Steve Lewis Auto Body, IWK 250 2nd Place Trophy Prior to the 2015 IWK 250 Riverside unveiled the John W. Chisholm Memorial Cup. Past 250 winners such as John Flemming, Rollie MacDonald, Frank Fraser, Wayne Smith and Kent Vincent, along with the Chisholm Family attended the unveiling. Once against Matt Crafton would be returning to Riverside in a second attempt at the 250, he would be joined by American short track ace Jeff Fultz, who was in Rollie MacDonald's #13. The race was a controversial one with multiple drivers running up front being black flagged for avoidable contact and jumping the start. Donald Chisholm looked like the favourite, recovering from an early spin to take the lead, Fultz took him out on a restart following a rain delay. Kent Vincent improbably went on to win his second IWK 250 in a thrilling late race battle with rookie D.J. Casey, also receiving the John W. Chisholm Memorial Cup for the first time post race. Vincent's win was overshadowed however by a post- race confrontation between Fultz and Chisholm's teammate George Koszkulics. Koszkulics followed Fultz around the track for multiple laps and down pit road after the race. The two came to a stop behind the technical inspection shed, where Koszkulics forcibly removed Fultz from his car and landed multiple punches before track security was called to break the pair up.

He also teaches journalism at the Universities of Fribourg, Neuch√¢tel and Z√ºrich.  Early life and education  Stephan Klapproth's mother is journalist, his father a German language teacher. Born and raised in Luzern, he has two sisters and two brothers. He studied political science, economics and contemporary history with complementary studies in jurisprudence, and graduated in political science at the Universit√© de Gen√®ve in 1981. He worked as research and teaching assistant at his alma mater on the research area decision-making processes in the Swiss domestic politics in 1982/83.  Radio and television  One year later, he started working as reporter and editor for the Radio Gen√®ve Information, and for the Swiss Radio International in Bern where he moderated the popular information magazine Echo der Zeit from 1986 to 1992, in the beginning as correspondent, among others during the revolutions in Slovakia and Romania in 1989, later as chief editor of Echo der Zeit. Starting in 1993 Stephan Klapproth became the anchorman of the evening news show 10vor10 of the Swiss national television Schweizer Fernsehen SRF. On occasion of special broadcasts he travelled many countries, among others Klapproth hosted the live special broadcast of 10vor10 on occasion of the 9-11 terror attacks, and the US presidential elections in 1992 and 2012. While moderating 10vor10, in 2002 he participated also some episodes of Sternstunde Philosophie and Reporter for Schweizer Fernsehen SRF. From 2002 to 2004 Klapproth was also host of the entertainment show QUIZ today, a quiz on current political events, but the audience rating statistics were low, therefore the show was cancelled by the Swiss television channel SRF 1. In 2005 Klapproth was awarded with the Swiss TV Award as the most popular television presenter. The prize money of CHF 20,000, he stated to donate to the charity Goutte d'eau which is fighting against child trafficking and prostitution in Asia, those exemplary orphanages have impressed me on a visit to Cambodia. For 21 years Stephan Klapproth commonly was called Mr. 10vor10, and he left the daily crew on 4 September 2015, moderating in all about 2000 shows. He still moderates 10vor10 specials, and the cultural program Sternstunde Philosophie since January 2015.  Mr. 10vor10  10vor10, a current affairs show on German-speaking Swiss public television channel SRF 1, started on 20 August 1990, and Stefan Klapproth joined the moderation team in 1993. His decision to leave the 10vor10 team, Klapproth explained to the SRF officials: I was for the radio in revolutionary Bucharest, flew for television in an experimental aircraft through Africa, hosted by the first five hours as the world on 11 September 2001 did not know what happend [sic]...I would have never dreamed when I was immersed at the university with passion in the political philosophy...  Journalism and teachings  Klapproth teaches television and radio journalism at the Universities of Fribourg, Neuch√¢tel and Z√ºrich. He is also active as a lecturer and conducts economic symposiums and political discussions. Since high school and during his studies, Stephan Klapproth also writes as a freelance journalist for various newspapers.  Personal life  Stephan Klapproth silently married in 2008. He loves canoeing and is an accomplished private pilot, but lacking time to fly.  Awards  * 2005 Swiss TV Award as most popular television presenter.

The distribution was first introduced by Panayiotis Theodossiou in 1998. The distribution has since been used in different applications. There are different parameterizations for the skewed generalized t distribution. Definition =Probability density function= f_{SGT}(x; \\\\mu, \\\\sigma, \\\\lambda, p, q) = \\\\frac{p}{2 v \\\\sigma q^{1/p} B(\\\\frac{1}{p},q) \\\\left(\\\\frac{ x-\\\\mu + m ^p}{q (v \\\\sigma)^p (\\\\lambda sign(x-\\\\mu + m)+1)^p}+1\\\\right)^{\\\\frac{1}{p}+q}} where B is the beta function, \\\\mu is the location parameter, \\\\sigma > 0 is the scale parameter, -1 < \\\\lambda < 1 is the skewness parameter, and p > 0 and q > 0 are the parameters that control the kurtosis. m and v are not parameters, but functions of the other parameters that are used here to scale or shift the distribution appropriately to match the various parameterizations of this distribution. In the original parameterization of the skewed generalized t distribution, :m = \\\\frac{2 v \\\\sigma \\\\lambda q^{\\\\frac{1}{p}} B(\\\\frac{2}{p},q-\\\\frac{1}{p})}{B(\\\\frac{1}{p},q)} and :v = \\\\frac{q^{-\\\\frac{1}{p}}}{\\\\sqrt{ (3 \\\\lambda^2 + 1) \\\\frac{ B ( \\\\frac{3}{p}, q - \\\\frac{2}{p} )}{B (\\\\frac{1}{p}, q )} -4 \\\\lambda^2 \\\\frac{B ( \\\\frac{2}{p}, q - \\\\frac{1}{p} )^2}{ B (\\\\frac{1}{p}, q )^2}}}. These values for m and v yield a distribution with mean of \\\\mu if pq > 1 and a variance of \\\\sigma^2 if pq > 2. In order for m to take on this value however, it must be the case that pq > 1. Similarly, for v to equal the above value, pq > 2. The parameterization that yields the simplest functional form of the probability density function sets m = 0 and v = 1. This gives a mean of :\\\\mu+ \\\\frac{2 v \\\\sigma \\\\lambda q^{\\\\frac{1}{p}} B(\\\\frac{2}{p},q-\\\\frac{1}{p})}{B(\\\\frac{1}{p},q)} and a variance of : \\\\sigma^2 q^{\\\\frac{2}{p}} ( (3 \\\\lambda^2 + 1) \\\\frac{ B ( \\\\frac{3}{p}, q - \\\\frac{2}{p} )}{B (\\\\frac{1}{p}, q )} -4 \\\\lambda^2 \\\\frac{B ( \\\\frac{2}{p}, q - \\\\frac{1}{p} )^2}{ B (\\\\frac{1}{p}, q )^2}) The \\\\lambda parameter controls the skewness of the distribution. To see this, let M denote the mode of the distribution, and : \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{M} f_{SGT}(x; \\\\mu, \\\\sigma, \\\\lambda, p, q) dx = \\\\frac{1-\\\\lambda}{2} Since -1 < \\\\lambda < 1, the probability left of the mode, and therefore right of the mode as well, can equal any value in (0,1) depending on the value of \\\\lambda. Thus the skewed generalized t distribution can be highly skewed as well as symmetric. If -1 < \\\\lambda < 0, then the distribution is negatively skewed. If 0 < \\\\lambda < 1, then the distribution is positively skewed. If \\\\lambda = 0, then the distribution is symmetric. Finally, p and q control the kurtosis of the distribution. As p and q get smaller, the kurtosis increases (i.e. becomes more leptokurtic). Large values of p and q yield a distribution that is more platykurtic. =Moments= Let X be a random variable distributed with the skewed generalized t distribution. The h^{th} moment (i.e. E[(X- E(X))^h]), for pq > h, is: \\\\sum_{r=0}^{h} \\\\binom{h}{r} ((1+\\\\lambda)^{r+1}+(-1)^r (1-\\\\lambda)^{r+1} ) ( - \\\\lambda )^{h-r} \\\\frac{ (v \\\\sigma)^h q^{\\\\frac{h}{p}} B(\\\\frac{r+1}{p},q-\\\\frac{r}{p}) B(\\\\frac{2}{p},q-\\\\frac{1}{p} )^{h-r}}{ 2^{r-h+1} B(\\\\frac{1}{p},q)^{h-r+1} } The mean, for pq > 1, is: : \\\\mu + \\\\frac{2 v \\\\sigma \\\\lambda q^{\\\\frac{1}{p}} B(\\\\frac{2}{p},q-\\\\frac{1}{p})}{B(\\\\frac{1}{p},q)} - m The variance (i.e. E[(X- E(X))^2]), for pq > 2, is: : (v \\\\sigma)^2 q^{\\\\frac{2}{p}} ( (3 \\\\lambda^2 + 1) \\\\frac{ B ( \\\\frac{3}{p}, q - \\\\frac{2}{p} )}{B (\\\\frac{1}{p}, q )} -4 \\\\lambda^2 \\\\frac{B ( \\\\frac{2}{p}, q - \\\\frac{1}{p} )^2}{ B (\\\\frac{1}{p}, q )^2}) The skewness (i.e. E[(X- E(X))^3]), for pq > 3, is: : \\\\frac{2 q^{3/p} \\\\lambda (v \\\\sigma) ^3}{B(\\\\frac{1}{p},q)^3} \\\\Bigg( 8 \\\\lambda ^2 B(\\\\frac{2}{p},q-\\\\frac{1}{p})^3-3 (1+3 \\\\lambda ^2) B(\\\\frac{1}{p},q) : \\\\times B(\\\\frac{2}{p},q-\\\\frac{1}{p}) B(\\\\frac{3}{p},q-\\\\frac{2}{p})+2 (1+\\\\lambda ^2) B(\\\\frac{1}{p},q)^2 B(\\\\frac{4}{p},q-\\\\frac{3}{p}) \\\\Bigg) The kurtosis (i.e. E[(X- E(X))^4]), for pq > 4, is: : \\\\frac{q^{4/p} (v \\\\sigma) ^4}{B(\\\\frac{1}{p},q)^4} \\\\Bigg( -48 \\\\lambda ^4 B(\\\\frac{2}{p},q-\\\\frac{1}{p})^4+24 \\\\lambda ^2 (1+3 \\\\lambda ^2) B(\\\\frac{1}{p},q) B(\\\\frac{2}{p},q-\\\\frac{1}{p})^2 : \\\\times B(\\\\frac{3}{p},q-\\\\frac{2}{p})-32 \\\\lambda ^2 (1+\\\\lambda ^2) B(\\\\frac{1}{p},q)^2 B(\\\\frac{2}{p},q-\\\\frac{1}{p}) B(\\\\frac{4}{p},q-\\\\frac{3}{p}) : +(1+10 \\\\lambda ^2+5 \\\\lambda ^4) B(\\\\frac{1}{p},q)^3 B(\\\\frac{5}{p},q-\\\\frac{4}{p})\\\\Bigg) Special Cases Special and limiting cases of the skewed generalized t distribution include the skewed generalized error distribution, the generalized t distribution introduced by McDonald and Newey, the skewed t proposed by Hansen, the skewed Laplace distribution, the generalized error distribution (also known as the generalized normal distribution), a skewed normal distribution, the student t distribution, the skewed Cauchy distribution, the Laplace distribution, the uniform distribution, the normal distribution, and the Cauchy distribution. The graphic below, adapted from Hansen, McDonald, and Newey, shows which parameters should be set to obtain some of the different special values of the skewed generalized t distribution.

Career Born in 1971, McDonnell turned professional in 1991. His first season saw a run to the last 32 at the 1991 UK Championship, where he defeated Geet Sethi, Kieran McAlinden, John Harrop, Francois Ellis, John Spencer and John Campbell before playing South African Silvino Francisco in his last-64 match. Having whitewashed Spencer, the three-time World Champion, 6‚Äì0 in what was one of Spencer's final matches, McDonnell trailed Francisco 1‚Äì5, but overcame him 9‚Äì8. He next faced incumbent World Champion John Parrott but, having held him to 2‚Äì2, lost 4‚Äì9. The following season brought another last-32 finish, this time at the 1992 Dubai Classic; McDonnell beat four opponents, including Colin Roscoe and Peter Francisco, en route to a 3‚Äì5 loss to Gary Wilkinson. A year later, he reached the last 64 at the 1993 UK Championship - against Jimmy White, McDonnell went 0‚Äì6 behind, but after recovering to 5‚Äì6, subsequently lost 6‚Äì9. The next three seasons were poor, and McDonnell fell off the tour in 1997. Forced to re-qualify, his performances in the qualifying events in 1997/1998 were sufficient to achieve this, and McDonnell competed again as a professional for another four years. The highlight of this time was a run to the last 16 at the 2001 Scottish Open - a career-best finish - where he defeated Scott MacKenzie, Craig MacGillivray, Jonathan Birch, Mike Dunn, Terry Murphy and most notably Stephen Lee, but lost 2‚Äì5 to Paul Hunter. After winning only four matches during the 2001/2002 season, McDonnell again dropped off the tour at its conclusion. A semi-final finish in one event in the 2002/2003 season, where he lost to James Leadbetter, was not enough for him to re-qualify, but the following season saw a run to the quarter-final of another, losing 4‚Äì5 to Lee Spick. The latter performance earned McDonnell the chance to compete as an amateur in 2004/2005, and he reached the last 64 at the 2005 UK Championship, losing 2‚Äì9 to Ryan Day, and the 2005 Malta Cup, where Mark Davis beat him 5‚Äì4. Of the 13 tournaments held during 2005/2006, McDonnell entered only six; he lost all six of his matches, the last a 3‚Äì10 defeat to Tom Ford in qualifying for the 2006 World Championship, and finished the season ranked 86th. He was relegated from the tour thereafter, and left the competitive game, aged 34.

He was instrumental in the creation of Matthiessen State Park. Matthiessen was the paternal grandfather of scholar and Harvard professor F.O. Matthiessen. Early life and education Born March 5, 1835 in Altona, Hamburg, Matthiessen went on to attend university at the Freiberg University of Mining and Technology. It was here that he met Edward C. Hegeler, a fellow engineering student studying mining. They immigrated together to the United States of America in 1856. After investigating several sites in the Northeast and Midwest of the country, they decided to set up their smelter on the banks of the Little Vermilion River, in LaSalle, IL. Business success Matthiessen and Hegeler Zinc Works broke ground on Christmas Eve of 1858.Immigrant Entrepreneurship The early years of Matthiessen and Hegeler Zinc Works were difficult, with the Civil War breaking out 2 years after the company's inception. A lack of demand for zinc very nearly ended the company, but troubles proved to be short lived. By 1862, a burgeoning arms industry injected much-needed business, greatly driving up demand for zinc products. Matthiessen would later add rolling mills, coal mines, machine shops, and the forerunner of Westclox to his diverse portfolio. Matthiessen served as the Mayor of LaSalle, IL between 1887 and 1897, elected to five consecutive terms.Enjoy Illinois Philanthropy Matthiessen donated approximately $500,000 to various causes, such as LaSalle-Peru High School and Illinois Valley Community Hospital. Perhaps his best known donation is his former estate and private park known as \\"Deer Park\\". It is today known as Matthiessen State Park.

Moruk was a critic of the policies of the independent government of East Timor, advocating that the government do more to alleviate widespread unemployment and poverty in the country. Moruk was particularly critical of the policies of former President Xanana Gusm√£o, who is also a former guerilla leader, during the Indonesian occupation of East Timor. Moruk was born Paulino Gama in Laga, Portuguese Timor. Moruk's brother is Cornelio Gama, a former FALINTIL commander, former member of the National Parliament, and leader of the National Unity of Timorese Resistance (UNDERTIM) political party since its founding in 2005. Mauk Moruk was a senior commander in the Falintil, the military wing of the Revolutionary Front for an Independent East Timor (FRETILIN) during the war for independence against Indonesia. In 1984, Moruk was one of four Falintil officers who staged an internal coup attempt against the Commander of Falintil, Xanana Gusm√£o. The coup against Gusm√£o failed. In the aftermath of the failed coup, Maruk surrendered to Indonesian authorities and eventually went into exile in the Netherlands. Moruk eventually returned to East Timor from exile in the Netherlands. He founded the Maubere Revolutionary Council (KRM), also called the Revolutionary Council (KR), a paramilitary group. Under Maruk, the KRM sought popular support against the government through grassroots (known as maubere locally) appeals. In March 2015, Moruk's rebel group, the Maubere Revolutionary Council (KRM), began a series of attacks on police. Members of the KRM attacked a police compound using explosives and guns, in one of the March 2015 attacks, injuring four security personnel. The East Timorese government launched a military campaign against the KRM in March, announcing that the joint operation to \\"prevent and suppress criminal actions from illegal groups\\" in a May 2015 statement. According to the government, a number of KRM members had surrendered as a result. Mauk Moruk, the head of the KRM, was killed in a joint police and military operation against the group in the suco (village) of Fatulia on Saturday, August 8, 2015. He died at the age of 60. The government of East Timor released a statement on the operation following Moruk's death, stating, \\"Every effort was made during the operation to avoid this outcome,\\" a government spokesman said in a statement, calling for calm. Regrettably the operation was unable to avoid a confrontation resulting in an exchange of gunfire.\\" Moruk's death raised concerns that there could be an escalation of unrest in East Timor.

He handed part of Opie to his roommate, Lincoln Colcord, and asked him to provide some Maine-themed lyrics for the song. Colcord wrote the lyrics in half an hour and Sprague then rearranged the song slightly to fit the lyrics. The song was presented to the faculty advisor on music affairs, who disapproved of it on the grounds that it was a drinking song and it would be in poor taste for the state university of a state that prohibited the manufacture and sale of liquor to have its students singing such a song. However, Sprague had a chance meeting with University of Maine President George Emory Fellows, who told him that the lyrics were all right. The song was a hit at a concert and became popular with the student body. The lyrics were first published on February 15, 1905 in the University of Maine magazine The Maine Campus. The song was copyrighted on June 23, 1910 by Carl Fisher, who owned the copyright to Opie, under the name \\"Opie\\" ‚Äì The University of Maine Stein Song. Rudy Vall√©e Rudy Vall√©e heard the Maine Stein Song when he attended the University of Maine from 1921 to 1922. In 1929, the National Broadcasting Company acquired the rights to Opie and Vall√©e, the host of the network's Fleischmann's Yeast Hour, recorded the song with a faster tempo and a few word changes. The song topped the charts for two months and was the leading song of 1930. It became the only college song to become a number one hit. In 1953, Vall√©e sang the song before a live television audience of 60 million persons (broadcast live over the NBC and CBS networks) as part of The Ford 50th Anniversary Show. Reception At the time the song became popular, it reference to drinking was said to be a violation of the Volstead Act. Its lyrics were also criticized for being pagan by proposing a toast \\"to the gods\\" and \\"to the fates\\". In 1930, Johnny Johnson and Harry McDaniel wrote I'd Like To Find The Guy Who Wrote The Stein Song, a comedy song about a man who is fed up with constantly hearing The Stein Song on the radio. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, the song came under fire for its promotion of drinking and lyrics that were considered sexist (\\"let every Maine man sing\\" and \\"to the lips and the eyes of the girls who will love us someday\\"). Various individuals began to push for a revision of the lyrics or the adoption of a new school song. Bill Studwell rankedThe Stein Song as the sixth best college fight song in his book College Fight Songs: An Annotated Anthology.

Morse and written by Fred Niblo Jr., Lee Katz and Lawrence Kimble. It was adapted from the 1924 play, Minick, written by Edna Ferber and George S. Kaufman. The film stars Dennis Morgan, Gloria Dickson, Fred Stone, Sonny Bupp, Aldrich Bowker and Charles Halton. The film was released by Warner Bros. on September 23, 1939. Plot Andrew Plummer is a former soldier and boxer happily living in a home for veterans. Joe, having recently gotten a promotion at work, feels guilty that his father is living there and invites him to come live with him and his wife, Trudie. He writes in his letter that he needs his father's help at his job, as he knows his father would consider his living there a bother if it was on a regular invitation. While he enjoys it there with his friends, Andrew leaves under the impression that his son needs him. And as there is a long waiting list at the veterans home, he would be unable to return for years. Once at Joe and Trudie's house, his good-natured but intrusive personality starts to get on the housekeepers' nerves. Over time, his daughter-in-law is worn down by his erratic character. Andrew soon learns that Joe doesn't really need help, and now has a lot of time on his hands. While out on a walk he befriends Tommy, an orphan shoeshine boy who lives with his Uncle Frank. He also meets a group of elderly men in the park, who mention the Hays Home for Aged Gentlemen, where you pay $500 and they take care of you for life. Tommy casually mentions the stack of nearly one thousand dollars in Andrew's chest to his Uncle, who then plans to steal the money. In the meantime, Andrew overhears Trudie talking to Joe about the embarrassment his father has been causing her in front of their friends. He then tells them about his decision to move into the Hays Home. When he goes to get his $500, however, it is missing. He confronts Tommy about it, and he says that he didn't do it. Andrew then gets his new friends from the Hays Home together to go to Uncle Frank and get the money back. In the end, Andrew and Tommy become members of the Hays Home.

In April 2015, Diamond√®re supported the people affected by the Nepal earthquake by donating one day's worth of sales to the victims. Operations The e-commerce company creates custom jewelry. Customers work with design consultants to create a CAD 3D model based on a picture, drawing or an existing design. Once the image is approved, a wax mold is created with 3D printing. The mold goes through a foundry process to cast the jewelry design. The jewelry is then set with the specified gemstones ranging from high quality diamonds to colored stones such as sapphires, rubies, or emeralds. Customers can also change and choose the gemstones and metal directly from the Diamond√®re website. Diamond√®re is certified by the Gemological Institute of America and Solitaire Gemological Laboratories.

He is a senior media reporter at NBC News and MSNBC and the author of Byers Market, a daily newsletter covering the business of media, technology and entertainment. Early life and education Dylan Byers was born to Margaret Carol Lewis and Judson Thomas \\"Tom\\" Byers of Seattle, Washington. Both parents served as deputy mayor of Seattle, with a gap between them: Margaret first (1981‚Äì89), then Tom nine years later (1998‚Äì2002). Margaret was subsequently the director of a network of philanthropists in the Seattle area, and Judson is a founding partner of a public policy consulting firm. Dylan Byers attended Bard College, from which he graduated in 2008. Career Byers has worked as a research assistant to New Yorker writers Philip Gourevitch, George Packer, and Jane Kramer. He began his journalism career as a media and tech reporter for Adweek. He later moved to Politico and launched the \\"On Media\\" blog in November 2011. On Media became known as a \\"scoop heavy blog\\" for media and political news. Byers created and grew the blog, and critics praised it as \\"workaholic media-politics coverage,\\" specific to Byers' niche of the intersection between politics and media. While at Politico, Byers wrote \\"‚ÄúPresident Obama, off the record,\\" an article providing readers a glimpse into an ‚Äòoff the record‚Äô side of US President Barack Obama. For that story, he was a finalist in the 2014 Mirror Awards competition for Best Single Article in Digital Media. In September 2015, fellow media reporter Brian Stelter announced that Byers was joining CNN. In his announcement, Stelter wrote, \\"Byers is a scoop machine ... When I‚Äôve been offline for more than a few hours, the way I see what I‚Äôve missed is by checking his Twitter feed.\\" Byers joined NBC in September 2018. Controversy In 2012, Byers drew scrutiny when he reported in Politico that US President Barack Obama's girlfriend in Dreams from My Father was a composite character, which was already acknowledged by Obama in the book. Politico issued an extensive correction at the top of the original article. Byers was also criticized for \\"Turbulence at The Times,\\" a critical profile about former New York Times executive editor Jill Abramson, which quoted many anonymous staffers who said she was difficult to work with. Several commentators labeled Byers's piece as sexist. Abramson was let go from the New York Times the following year. In 2017, Sean Hannity and Juan Williams challenged portions of a Byers CNN report. Byers reported that three sources stated an on-air dispute between the two lead to Hannity aiming a gun at Williams off air. Byers reported that it was just Hannity \\"showing off\\" but was disturbing to Williams and others present. Fox News investigated and \\"found that no one was put in any danger\\". Hannity later said the gun was not loaded and \\"Never pointed at anybody.\\" Williams said the story was being sensationalized and that he did not feel he had been in harm's way. On November 21, 2017, Byers posted a tweet on his account implying that the recent sexual harassment scandals in media and entertainment were draining those industries of talent. The tweet was later deleted. Personal life Byers is married to Cara Colleen Walsh, a freelance graphic designer who attended New York University and Harvard University. .

Wood campaigned for the protection of fish and other wildlife in the Klamath Basin, a region of Oregon and California drained by the Klamath River, during disputes over water use and the proposed construction of a ski resort in the area. He spearheaded efforts to gain protection for two native Klamath Basin fish species, the Lost River sucker and the shortnose sucker, under the Endangered Species Act. He also campaigned for the protection of the western snowy plover. Wood declined an offer to work at his family's furniture factory in Los Angeles, California. Instead, Wood moved to Oregon in 1976 to teach biology at a high school in Myrtle Creek. In 1981, Wood relocated to Eugene to take a position with the Oregon Natural Resources Council, which changed its name to Oregon Wild in 2005. He worked pro bono for the organization for three years before receiving his first paycheck. Wood published his book, A Walking Guide to Oregon's Ancient Forest, in 1991. The book began a political fight over the use of forests in the Pacific Northwest, which ultimately led to the adoption of the Northwest Forest Plan by the Clinton administration in 1994. The plan provided protection for the northern spotted owl, a species threatened by logging. Wood suffered a heart attack while hiking in Prairie Creek Redwoods State Park in Humboldt County, California, on August 11, 2015. He died en route to the hospital at the age of 65.

The film was based on an actual 15-year-old blind horse, Elmer Gantry, who was co-billed as a star and played himself. Gantry was bought and trained as a show horse by wrangler Eleanor Getzendaner but became blind at the age of 13 following two years of experiencing periodic ophthalmia, after which she patiently trained him to jump.Blind Horse Stars in Film, Movies, of Course! Retrieved 2016-09-26 The film was released by Warner Bros. on October 7, 1939. Plot When his father, a disreputable trainer of thoroughbred horses, is killed in a barn fire, young Danny Lowman is able to save a foal. He gives the new colt to his friend Midge Griner, whose father Colonel Griner owns a stable. Years pass as Danny moves west and grows up. Frustrated in an attempt to become a jockey, Danny is accused of illegally activities similar to his late father's and faces jail until Midge vouches for him, persuading her dad to give Danny a job. He is reunited with the colt, called Gantry Jr., which has been violently abused by trainer Dave Miller. The horse responds to Danny's presence in the saddle and begins winning races, saving the Griner stable, which had fallen on hard times. But its narrow defeat in the Kentucky Derby casts suspicion on Danny's effort. Later realizing that the horse has gone blind, possibly from Miller's harsh treatment, Danny and Midge still enter Gantry Jr. in a Grand National steeplechase race in England, where they are victorious and save the family farm.

It lies at an elevation of 1355 feet and is located in a valley between the Soda Mountains to the east, the Tiefort Mountains to the northwest, Alvord Mountain to the southwest and Cronese Mountains to the south and southeast. History =Early History= Bitter Spring was a water and food source for the Native American peoples that lived in this part of the desert. It became a watering and grazing place between Salt Spring and the Mojave River on the Old Spanish Trail. It passed 38.75 miles south through Silurian Valley, then east through the Avawatz Mountains at Red Pass and beyond the playa of Red Pass Lake, through a gap between the Soda and Tiefort Mountains to Bitter Spring in a wash in the next valley. From Bitter Spring the trail led 18.75 miles southwest climbing Alvord Mountain to cross Impassable Pass to descend Spanish Canyon and cross the plains to the location of Fork of the Road on the north side of the Mojave River where it met the Mohave Trail, that had become another branch of the Old Spanish Trail, often called the Main Branch that later became a wagon road called Government Road or Mojave Road. From 1847, the Old Spanish Trail became a wagon road, later called the Mormon Road pioneered by a party of Mormons led by Jefferson Hunt that first traveled back and forth on it in 1847‚Äì1848. From 1849 it became known by the Forty-Niners as the \\"Southern Route\\", of the California Trail, the winter route of the Forty-niners, Mormons, and other immigrants to California. From 1855 after the route was modified and improvements made by the State of California in Cajon Pass and by the Federal government in Utah Territory, it became the winter trade route and wagon road between Utah Territory and California, it was known as the Los Angeles - Salt Lake Road. In the early 1850s, Solomon Nunes Carvalho while traveling the road, described the water of Bitter Spring as not bitter but with a brackish taste and that the surrounding area had acres of the finest bunch grass. The thorns of mesquite bushes there were used to post notes for following travelers. Their parties were often spaced out between springs to avoid depleting them with overuse as it would cause delay and depletion of the surrounding feed, as a spring refilled itself. Just to the west of the springs was a large hill that was called \\"The Whale\\" (at ) which the road passed around to the north, before turning southwest to Alvord Mountain, Impassable Pass, Spanish Canyon and more desert to the Mojave River.Edward Leo Lyman, Overland Journey from Utah to California: Wagon Travel from the City of Saints to the City of Angels, University of Nevada Press, 2008. =Camp Bitter Springs= Camp Bitter Springs was established near Bitter Spring by the U. S. Army, First Regiment of Dragoons as an intermittent camp for patrols along the Los Angeles - Salt Lake Road in 1859. In April 1860 Major James Henry Carleton was appointed commander of the Bitter Spring Expedition following two incidents. One was the killing of a cattleman in January 1860, on the Mojave River, reportedly by Southern Paiutes.Los Angeles Star, Number 38, 28 January 1860, p.2, col.2 Murder on the Mojave Two months later of two unarmed teamsters were killed at Bitter Spring by Native American men thought to be Paiute who had posed as friends before suddenly turning on them, feathering them with arrows.Los Angeles Star, Number 47, 31 March 1860, p.2, col.2, The Indian Murders. Brevet General Newman S. Clarke, Carlton's superior, commanding the Department of California, in San Francisco, ordered him to \\"proceed to Bitter Springs and chastise the Indians you find in the vicinity.\\" The General specifically instructed Carleton that \\"the punishment must fall on those dwelling nearest to the place of the murder or frequenting the water course in its vicinity.\\" Carlton at the head of Company K, First Regiment of Dragoons left the fort in early April. After arriving and establishing his base at Camp Cady Carlton sent out patrols looking for hostiles. On April 22, on Carlton's orders, the bodies of two Native American men, earlier slain by a detachment of Dragoons on the Mojave River at the Fish Ponds, were taken to Bitter Spring. There at the site of the earlier attack on the cattleman and the teamsters, the bodies were hung from an improvised scaffold. A few days after a May 2 engagement at Old Dad Mountain, the heads cut off of the three natives killed there, were placed on display with those hung on the gibbet at Bitter Creek. On May 28, following reports of the display in the San Francisco press and after General Clarke had read Carlton's dispatch telling of the display of severed heads at Bitter Spring, Clarke ordered Carleton to cease mutilating the dead and remove all evidence of the mutilation from public gaze. The post remained at the spring to guard travelers on the road, until abandoned on July 3, 1860 at the end of Carlton's expedition.William Gorenfeld and John Gorenfeld, Bvt.

She also helped overturn the law in Nevada barring mixed-race marriages.  Biography  Sawada was born in Gardena to Japanese parents who leased land in order to grow their own crops. Her parents leased the land because it was illegal for them to own farmland at the time in California. Sawada started classes at Santa Monica College, but she was forced to stop after her first year. In 1942, she and her family were moved to a Japanese internment camp near Poston, Arizona. She and her family were there for three years, behind barbed-wire fences. The experience affected Sawada, showing her the deep injustices in society. She says that she had felt \\"terribly angry... Everything was turned upside-down.\\" When she was released, Sawada and her parents, moved to Berkeley and she became active in the AFL-CIO, the Berkeley Interracial Committee and the War Relocation Authority. Sawada worked for twelve years with attorney, Charles Garry, who represented political activists. She met her first husband, Harry Bridges, at a fund-raiser for the Mine, Mill and Smelter workers and after falling in love, they decided to get married on Pearl Harbor Day in 1958. However, their application for a marriage license was denied because Nevada law forbade people of different races from getting married. The law in Nevada was written in 1846, and \\"prohibited marriages between whites and Asians,\\" which the couple tried to circumvent by protesting that Sawada, being born in the United States was not a foreigner. She was also asked by the license clerk: \\"Are you black, white, brown, red or yellow?\\" To which Sawada had to answer, \\"Under those categories, I must be yellow.\\" The case was noticed by the national press and lawyers for Bridges and Sawada struck down the Nevada law in four days, allowing the couple to marry in Reno. In 1973, Bridges studied creative writing at San Francisco State University. Her writing was featured in Harper's and Ms. Magazine. In 1988, she was honored by the Pacific Asian American Women Bay Area Coalition with the Asian Woman Warrior award for her community advocacy. In 1990, she read her poem \\"To Be or Not to Be: There is No Such Option\\" at the government ceremony which apologized to Japanese Americans for the internment of Japanese Americans during World War II. The same year, her husband died. Bridges had been friends with Ed Flynn for many years, and at age 72, they got married in 1994. She died in Pescadero, California on February 7, 2003.

Officially known as the Gold Coast Bridge, but locally referred to as the Sundale Bridge due to its proximity to the site of the former Sundale Shopping Centre, the bridge spans the Nerang River linking the suburbs of Southport and Main Beach. Opened initially in 1966, the bridge replaced the Jubilee Bridge, and comprises four separate decks and pier structures built at various stages and for a variety of purposes. Features The dual carriageway portion of the Sundale Bridge at night, 2015 The dual carriageway comprising two mirrored sets of eleven concrete piers together with a concrete deck each that carries vehicular traffic was opened in 1966. The decks carried what was then known as the Pacific Highway and is now known as the Gold Coast Highway. In addition to vehicular traffic, a narrow pedestrian footpath formed part of the dual deck structure. In 2010 a separate set of eleven concrete piers were sited upriver adjacent to the most westerly of the existing two decks. A concrete deck completed the bridge structure and carries the Gold Coast Light Rail line that was officially opened in February 2014. A fourth structure was completed comprising twelve concrete piers that were sited downriver adjacent to the most easterly of the original two decks. A concrete deck completed the bridge structure and carries pedestrians and cyclists as a footbridge, opened in June 2014.

Originally known as the Wyndham Cleveland at Playhouse Square, the structure helped to complete the revitalization of Playhouse Square. It changed brand names in August 2017. Construction The site of the hotel was occupied by the Euclid Point Building (also known more simply as the \\"Point Building\\"), which began construction in 1907 at the intersection of Huron Road and Euclid Avenue (1260 Euclid Avenue). The large property between the Euclid Point Building and the future site of the Halle Building was leased in 1909, and became the Winous Building.; In 1983, the eastern portion of the Point Building was demolished. Huron Road was redirected to turn north through this portion of the Point Building site, connecting it with E. 13th Street. A new mini-park and plaza was created on the old site of the road. In the fall of 1987, local developers proposed demolishing the Point Building and constructing a new luxury hotel on the site to serve the reviving Playhouse Square district to the east of the Halle Building. The original design of the hotel depicted a round tower on the east end, with an asymmetrical spire on the south side. Atop the spire was a powerful light, intended to act like a \\"beacon\\" drawing people to Playhouse Square. The Point Building was torn down in the fall of 1988 to prepare for this construction, Demolition of the structure left the windowless, blank eastern wall of the Halle Building facing Playhouse Square. The $27.6 million ($ in dollars) Wyndham Hotel at Playhouse Square broke ground in July 1993. The city of Cleveland and the state of Ohio both made low-interest loans to the developers. The city also contributed money from a federal Urban Development Action Grant, and provided a 14-year property tax abatement. The total amount of public aid came to $16.5 million ($ in dollars). The initial 1987 design had been somewhat revised to make the structure fit in with the nearby Halle Building. The two architectural firms designing the structure, RTKL Associates and Herman Galvin Gibans Inc., eliminated the spire and reduced the height of the tower to bring the hotel's roof in line with that of the Halle Building. The massing of the hotel, its window design and spacing, and its coloring were all changed to mimic that of the Halle Building. The completed hotel opened on July 7, 1995. The hotel's ballrooms and meeting rooms were named after famous Cleveland theatres, including the surviving Palace Theater, the long-demolished Roxy, and the Hippodrome (torn down in 1981). The hotel is best described as a post-modern metal-tinged structure.http://skyscraperpage.com/cities/?buildingID=21355 Wyndham Cleveland at Playhouse Square Retrieved on 2015-09-04 The building and sidewalk around the hotel also has fiber optic lighting in an effort to increase pedestrian safety and enhance foot traffic in the square.Hoefler, S.P. (2003). Images of America: Downtown Cleveland's architecture. Charleston, S.C.: Arcadia Publishing. =Economic impact= The development of the Wyndham was a major turning point in both the revitalization of Playhouse Square and the mission of the Playhouse Square Foundation. The hotel helped to stabilize and draw visitors to the re-emerging Playhouse Square, and provided an economic anchor for the entertainment district. The hotel also moved the foundation away from its 25-year-old mission of saving theaters and into real estate development. By providing the Playhouse Square Foundation with more than $2 million a year in revenue, the hotel ensured the foundation's financial viability and allowed it to purchase and renovate other nearby properties. In 2015, the Wyndham began a year-long upgrade which included renovation of all its guest rooms, the repainting and recarpeting of its public spaces, and the introduction of new furniture in its public areas, meeting rooms, and ballrooms. Conversion to Crowne Plaza Beginning about 2010, five new hotels opened in downtown Cleveland near the Wyndham at Playhouse Square. The Playhouse Square Foundation considered selling the structure as the Wyndham's contract to manage the hotel came close to its 1997 expiration date. The foundation decided against a sale in favor of a management change. On August 24, 2017, the hotel changed its name to the Crowne Plaza Cleveland at Playhouse Square. As part of the change, the hotel underwent a $6 million ($ in dollars) renovation that included refurbishment of all existing guest rooms. Guest rooms now featured faster Internet service, wi-fi outlets, multiple access to plug-in Internet service in each room, improved working spaces (such as larger desks), and new, large-screen flat screen televisions. The hotel's bar and formal restaurant were merged into a single room featuring a \\"gastropub\\" concept.

In contrast to primary organic aerosols, which are emitted directly from the biosphere, secondary organic aerosols are either formed via homogeneous nucleation through the successive oxidation of gas-phase organic compounds, or through condensation on pre-existing particles. These gas-phase species exert high vapor pressures, meaning they are volatile and stable in the gas-phase. Upon oxidation, the increased polarity, and thus reduced volatility, of the molecules results in a reduction of vapor pressure. After sufficient oxidation, the vapor pressure is sufficiently low that the gas-phase compound partitions into the solid-phase, producing secondary organic matter (the particle phase of secondary organic aerosol). SOAs represent a significant proportion of aerosols contained in the troposphere. A common misconception is that the aerosol refers to the solid phase of the compound, where in reality, by definition, it is the combination of the gas- and solid-phases which constitute the aerosol.

ICEAACH's unique position helps archaeologists from around the globe transcend the cultural, political, and organizational barriers that have traditionally hindered research in East Asian archaeology.  Programs in ICEAACH  With support from Boston University, numerous foundations, and a growing group of dedicated private donors, ICEAACH provides a wide range of important resources and programs, including: * A publicly accessible research library with over 10,000 volumes on East and Southeast Asian archaeology and related fields. * Undergraduate and graduate programs on Asian archaeology in Boston University's Department of Archaeology. * International research programs, ranging from the emergence of agriculture in East Asia, climate change and its impact on hunter-gatherer populations in East Asia, ethnicity and state formation, and the development of bronze metallurgy to archaeological applications of remote sensing, paleoethnobotanical research, the Southeast Asian maritime trade, and heritage management and antiquities legislation. * Archaeological fieldwork across eastern Asia. ICEAACH staff have excavated a 20,000-year-old cave in China with the world's oldest pottery, and are searching for sites on the Yangzi River of the first rice farmers. The ICEAACH is home to a project exploring the roots of the Shang Dynasty on the great flood plain of the Yellow River, and discovering the lost Bronze Age city of Song. ICEAACH students have done fieldwork in Japan, Mongolia, China, Cambodia, Singapore, and Indonesia. * The ARC/Base bibliographic database project: ICEAACH is advancing research across the field through our development of the international, collaborative ARC/Base, a new comprehensive, web-based, multilingual bibliographic database of Asian archaeology. * Scholarly communication and the broad dissemination of research results through publications, conferences, and lectures, including the East Asian Archaeology Forum seminar series. * Visiting Scholar programs: ICEAACH hosts leading researchers and graduate students from across Asia who come to the center for long- and short-term stays. ICEAACH library facilities and the strength of our department in cultural heritage management are major draws, as are collaborations with ICEAACH staff and other Archaeology Department faculty and students. * Public outreach programs serving a wide range of museum educators, K-12 school teachers, members of the media, and other groups to promote education and awareness about East Asia's archaeology and cultural heritage. * Book and Journal Exchange Program: ICEAACH sends thousands of books and journals on Western archaeology and related fields to academic institutions across Asia who do not have the resources to acquire such items themselves. We also receive in exchange research materials that are difficult to find elsewhere outside of Asia.

Born in Washington, D.C. where both graduated from Western High School in 1935, the brothers began collecting and identifying animals and plants they found alongside the Potomac, and soon expanded their interests to birds and hawks, going west in 1934 to begin studying falconry. After the war, during which they were employed as survival trainers, they each married and resumed their work in falconry. During the 1950s they expanded their work to other animals, including many species living in and around Yellowstone, and eventually separated.Cloud Gardens in the Tetons, National Geographic, June 1948. In 1959 their careers merged again, this time to begin a 12-year study of grizzly bears in Yellowstone, as the animals were considered threatened by increased human activity; however a 1971 disagreement with the National Park Service ended their Yellowstone studies; however it continued elsewhere in Montana, including the Scapegoat Wilderness.Studying Grizzly Habitat by Satellite. National Geographic, July 1976. After 1976 their work was mostly confined to field guides and educating the public about environmentalism; however, field ecology continued until Frank's death in 2001 from Parkinson's disease. In 1998, the National Audubon Society named the brothers among the top 100 conservationists of the 20th century. Early life Frank training a pair of great horned owls Frank Cooper Craighead and John Johnson Craighead were born in Washington, D.C. on August 14, 1916. Their father, Frank Craighead Sr., was an environmentalist and founder of the modern environmentalist Craighead family. Their sister, Jean Craighead George, was an author of books with nature and environmental themes for children and young adults. The twin brothers, almost identical to one another, spent much of their time collecting animals and plants along the banks of the Potomac while out of school, but their breakthrough with wildlife came in 1927, when they raised a baby owl at their home. Their interest in hawks and owls grew, and by the early 1930s they regularly visited hawk and owl nests all along the Potomac. Eventually, after high school, they moved to Pennsylvania and attended college there, graduating with science degrees in 1939. John descending from photographing birds At age 20, the brothers wrote their first article for National Geographic Society, published in the July 1937 issue, Adventures with Birds of Prey. They would write a total of 14 articles for the magazine between 1937 and 1976.The Complete National Geographic During the war, R. S. Dharmakumarsinhji, an Indian prince living in Bhavnagar, impressed by the Craigheads' 1937 and 1950 articles, invited them to visit India, where they learned about Indian ways of life, but returned home in 1942, as they missed home and their studies of falconry. They also became deeply opposed to killing animals after participating in Indian hunts during their stay. After coming home again, they continued survival training until 1950, during that year they also received their Ph.Ds in 1949 from the University of Michigan. During this time they practiced much wildlife research in Wyoming and Montana, writing Cloud Gardens in the Tetons in 1948 and Wildlife Adventuring in Jackson Hole in 1956. Later career In 1950, Frank and John were survival consultants to the Strategic Air Command, and in 1951 they organized survival training schools for the Air Force at Mountain Home and McCall, Idaho. From 1953 to 1955 Frank conducted classified defense research. His log home in Moose wasn't winterized, so the family lived in various places around the Jackson Hole valley, including stays on the Murie Ranch, the old Budge house in Wilson, and a house in Jackson. Frank and John went their separate ways in the early 1950s, when John accepted a permanent position with the University of Montana and Frank decided to work outside of Academia. From 1955 to 1957 he managed the Desert Game Range outside Las Vegas, Nevada, for the USFWS. This was the era of nuclear testing and Frank had great concerns about the effects of radiation, but his efforts to measure and document radiation levels on the refuge were not encouraged by the federal government. =Grizzly bears= The Craigheads trap a grizzly bear in Yellowstone, 1961 During 1959, Frank and John's careers merged again. At the request of Yellowstone National Park, they began a 12-year study of grizzly bears. Frank would drive from Pennsylvania, arriving in Yellowstone early in the spring and staying until late in the fall when the bears denned. Esther, Frank's wife waited until the kids were out of school and then drove to Moose for the summer. In late August she would load up the station wagon and drive back to Boiling Springs. By 1966 the long cross-country drives had become too much. Frank added indoor plumbing to his cabin on Antelope Flats, and he and Esther moved to Moose, Wyoming permanently. The brothers became famous in radio tracking and studying the grizzlies and black bears, by satellite, pioneered tranquilization, and studied the negative effects of grizzlies wandering outside the park boundaries. The Craigheads tagged 30 grizzlies in their first year, 37 in their second, and eventually, over 600 bears were transmitted and studied. They were often treed or chased by bears, but no injuries occurred. They went through the tragedy of seeing a bear die after being tagged in 1963, and the fact that many bears died at age 5 or 6 after human encounters persuaded the Craigheads to ask park officials to enforce animal rules more strictly. That sadly ended in 1971 when the Park Service planned to erase human effect on the park by closing the artificial food supplies (dumps) that the grizzlies depended on, which resulted in more aggressive bears being killed after many fatal maulings in the 1970s. The Craigheads were barred from doing any more work in the park by 1971 for speaking against this; however, they continued to do bear research in Montana until the 1980s. Writing the National Wild & Scenic River Act The brothers, especially Frank, were deeply concerned about preserving the West's rivers, and after educating the public about how vital rivers were for water, recreation and fishing they created the Environmental Research Institute, which paved the way for clean water protection and President Johnson signing the National Wild and Scenic Rivers bill of 1965. The Craigheads ended their active research after Frank's log cabin in Moose burned down in 1978. Personal lives John in Missoula, 2008 Frank married Esther Craighead in 1945. Meanwhile, John had married Margaret Smith, a mountain climber and daughter of a Grand Teton National Park ranger. Frank and Esther, and John and Margaret built identical log cabins on their property in Moose, and began families. While Frank was completing his various field studies during the late 1940s and early 1950s, he and Esther had three children - Lance, Charlie, and Jana - all born in Jackson at the old log cabin. Frank's health deteriorated due to Parkinson's disease he had been diagnosed with in 1987, during his second marriage and seven years after Esther died, and he died in 2001 at the age of 85. The Craighead institute has offices in both Bozeman and Moose and is run by Frank's son Lance. John Craighead lived in Missoula, Montana. He turned 100 in August 2016. He died in South Missoula on September 18, 2016 at the age of 100.

History The history of XEYT/XEYTM is the longest of any community radio station in Mexico. The permit was issued to the Centro de Promoci√≥n Social y Cultural, A.C. in 1965, and the station signed on with a power of 250 watts. Ceprososc held the station's permit until 1998. The station was small, with irregular transmissions of two to four hours a day and a narrow coverage area. By the late 1970s, the SCT was threatening to revoke XEYT's permit, which forced the station to seek support for its modernization. In 1980, Radio Teocelo signed an agreement with Fomento Cultural y Educativo, owners of what was then known as XEJN-OC, and underwent a series of significant upgrades in the decade that followed. The station's power was raised to one kilowatt, extending coverage to new areas; the station became known as \\"Radio Cultural Campesina\\"; and XEYT moved to a new studio and transmitter facility. In 1998, Asociaci√≥n Veracruzana de Comunicadores Populares, A.C. (Avercop) was formed to manage the station. It was the only citizen-owned radio station in Mexico from 1966 to 2005, when the Mexican government issued a series of permits to community radio stations.

Life and career  Born in Settignano, Florence into a family of craftsmen, after the primary school at 11 years old Marucelli started working as an apprentice in her uncle's atelier, Chiostri. In 1925 she left Chiostri to work in another Florentine atelier, and in 1932 she was appointed director of Gastaldi tailoring in Genoa. In 1938 Marucelli moved to Milan, where in via Borgospesso she opened her first atelier. During the war she was forced to abandon the atelier and to move in Stresa, guest of her friend and loyal customer Flora d‚ÄôElys. During the war years she conceived a new type of fashion, characterized by hourglass silhouettes, thus anticipating the New Look by Christian Dior. After the war, she came back to Milan and created the \\"Gioved√¨ di Germana Marucelli\\" (i.e. \\"Thursdays by Germana Marucelli\\"), a series of Thursday cultural meetings which involved authors and artists. In 1948 Marucelli collaborated with the painter and set designer Piero Zuffi for a collection inspired by surrealism, and the same year she was appointed production and advertising consultant of the textile company SNIA Viscosa. Thanks to this position she was then able to take over the Ventura atelier in Corso Venezia, where she opened her new atelier and workshop.

It is operated by Aarhus University and functions both as a research and training laboratory for the university Institute for Physics and Astronomy and a museum offering guided tours and lectures. It is named after astronomer Ole R√∏mer, and the buildings were listed in 2006 as a fine example of Danish art nouveau architecture (Danish: Sk√∏nvirke). The facility also includes a residential house, originally and formerly home to the director of the observatory, today used as a guest house for visiting researchers. The observatory facilitates education, public outreach and research as part of an original agreement when it was built. The observatory offers presentations and discussions on a broad array of astronomical topics on selected evenings and when the sky is clear the observatory's two 11-inch Schmidt-Cassegrain telescopes are employed.  History  In September 1908 Victor Nielsen, an astronomer at the Uraniborg observatory, contacted the city council of Aarhus and informed them that the German astronomer Friedrich Kr√ºger from Altenburg in Thuringia would move to Aarhus with his instruments in exchange for a parcel of land. Kr√ºger sent an application on 4 December describing his previous work, publications and instruments and a suggestion for a deal contingent on 3 conditions: * The city of Aarhus had to build the observatory * Kr√ºger would donate all his instruments to the city * The observatory should be in the service of education The city council discussed the matter on 25 February 1909 with a positive outcome and on 3 June it was decided to build the observatory and accept the 3 conditions. It took two years from the initial agreement until the buildings stood finished. Designed by architect Anton Rosen, the Ole R√∏mer Observatory was inaugurated on 15 October 1911. Kr√ºger worked as director until his death on 6 January 1916, followed by Ruben Andersen until he died on 30 April 1955. The observatory was handed over to Aarhus University on 1 September 1956 and on 1 April of the same year, dr. Mogens Rudkj√∏bing became professor of Astronomy at Aarhus University and new director for the observatory. The current telescopes were installed in the 1950s. In 1974, the Institute for Astronomy moved into the university campus in the same building as the Institute for Physics, and in 1990 the departments merged to form the Institute for Physics and Astronomy. Between 1981 and 1994, Kr√ºgers former residence became a museum. The Ole R√∏mer Observatory was listed in January 2006 by the Danish Heritage Agency, almost 100 years after it was completed in 1911. The reasons cited was the uniqueness of the architecture which unites the arts and crafts movement of the time with a functionalist impression and that it was designed by Anton Rosen, a prolific 20th-century Danish architect. = Friedrich Kr√ºger = During the construction phase of the observatory there was a heated debate in newspapers, among others √Örhus Stiftstidende, regarding Friedrich Kr√ºgers intentions. The Second Schleswig War and the loss of Schleswing-Holstein in 1864 was still recent memory so Germans was viewed with suspicion. Kr√ºgers heritage was an issue until his death in 1916. Kr√ºger was frequently accused of being a spy which became more of an issue after his son joined the German army during World War One. Various theories emerged; it was thought the telescopes could be used to observe shipping in the Bay of Aarhus, that there were radio transmitters used to send information to Germany, that the telescopes could be used to send morse code to German war ships and that the foundation under the telescopes were actually meant for cannons. The police and military took the rumours seriously enough to surveil and search the observatory, but it was subsequently concluded that Kr√ºger was not a spy. The tense atmosphere took a heavy toll on Kr√ºger.  Buildings  Directors residence under renovation. The Ole R√∏mer Observatory consists of the observatory building and the anxillary directors residence including a small outbuilding, all designed by Anton Rosen. Construction began in 1909 and was completed in 1911. The observatory is placed on a small hill close to Aarhus Racecourse and the Marselisborg Palace in H√∏jbjerg in the south-eastern outskirts of Aarhus city. At the time of construction, it was undisturbed by the lights from the city, making observations a bit easier than nowadays. The observatory building consists of a central house with a hall, office, workshop and classroom and two rotating cupolas for telescopes adjoining its sides. The hall is equipped with Greek inspired columns and decorative details in the form of reliefs and carpentry. The entire building is oriented according to the four corners of the world, with the movable zink clad observing cupolas north and east of the central room. The basement holds a darkroom and timing equipment. The outside architecture displays the arts and crafts style with a base of fieldstone in two sizes, low plastered walls and a tiled mansard-like roof. The large directors residence, situated north of the observatory itself, has an irregular appearance, featuring a front dormer, both hipped and half- hipped roofs, side dormers oriel and porch. The building is plastered and has a characteristic tiled roof. The original overall room structure has been preserved, although some changes was made, when it was turned into a guest house in 2012. There are four apartments in all, named after the astronomers Aristotle, Brahe, Kopernikus and Kepler.  Telescopes  The cupolas previously held a 40 cm. and a 50 cm. Cassegrain telescope but in 2004 they were replaced with two 28 cm Celestron Schmidt-Cassegrain telescopes. In 2013 the 50 cm. telescope was renovated and put back into use.

In 1990, XEPH became rock-formatted \\"Radio Alicia\\", and from 1992 to 1995, it became \\"X-Press Radio 590\\" with an English-language news and music format, similar to Radio VIP. 1995 saw the creation of Sabrosita, which moved to XHSON-FM 100.9 in 1999 to make way for a return of La Pantera to 590. In 2002, La Pantera was replaced again, this time with a sports radio format as Estadio 590; the next year, Estadio 590 gave way to romantic music- formatted Tuya 590. In 2004, with the creation of the current Beat 100.9 dance music format, Sabrosita returned to 590 AM.

Considered an \\"Industry Legend\\", Gejeian was the organizer of the Autorama, one of the largest custom car shows in North America, held annually in Fresno, California. Life and career Michael \\"Blackie\\" Gejeian, an Armenian by descent, was born on June 24, 1926http://www.fresnobee.com/news/local/article85904087.html in Easton, California, near Fresno, to a family of Armenian Genocide survivors. His family, including his extended family, were farmers who lived together in one farm ranch. Gejeian later recalled: > Seventeen of us lived in that one farm house. And you've never seen such > happy people. My dad played the violin. One uncle the clarinet. Another > uncle the tambourine. At nights they would play, and my mother and aunts > would dance in a circle, the old Armenian dances, holding hands. Gejeian then started to drive his dads car at the age of 12 around the ranch. After Gejeian graduated high school, he enlisted in the United States Navy and participated in World War II. Returning from the war, Gejeian desired to build the fastest hot rod in Fresno. His first car was built in 1945 and became the fastest in Fresno. Painted in black, he called this first car \\"Blackie\\", which would ultimately earn him his nickname. However, this car would ultimately crash in a race in 1948. Gejeian rebuilt the roadster as a show car and renamed it \\"Shish Kebob\\". The car's undercarriage was the first to be entirely chrome-plated. He also started the tradition of placing a mirror beneath the car when showcased. The car earned the title \\"Best of Show\\" at Gene Winfield's show. In 1955, it was named World's Most Beautiful Roadster by the Oakland Grand National Roadster Show. George Barris (left) with Mike \\"Blackie\\" Gejeian at the 64th Grand National Roadster Show in Los Angeles Blackie Gejeian, along with George Barris, Richard Peters, then built the Ala Kart. The chassis work was done Peters and Gejeian at their Fresno, California shop, while the body and styling was by Barris. The Ala Kart won more than 200 trophies and became America's most beautiful roadster twice in 1958 and again in 1959. The name was derived from George Barris, an auto customizer, opening a menu and Blackie seeing the phrase Ala Carte on the top of it.Blackie Gejeian, interview by Jim Aust, 7 October 2008.

Siderokastron is first mentioned in the 13th century. Some scholars have identified it with a place on Mount Knemis (Buchon), Delphi or Arachova (Gregorovius), or Heraclea Trachis (Neroutsos), but based on the description in the Chronicle of the Morea, it is most likely to be identified with the ruined fortified settlement on a rocky plateau found on an eastern outlier of Mount Oeta, on the banks of the upper course of the Asopos River near the modern villages of Pavliani and Koumaritsi. This identification was made by G. Kolias in 1933. Its name (\\"Iron Castle\\" in Greek) possibly derives from the nearby pass of Sideroporta, which gave it a certain strategic importance, as it controlled the mountain roads from the Asopos to the Boeotic Cephissus, and to Dyo Vouna. It is one of the castles popularly known as \\"Kastro tis Orias\\". Today it is known as \\"Kouvelos\\" (ŒöŒøœçŒ≤ŒµŒªŒøœÇ). It is first mentioned in 1275 as one of the castles ceded by the ruler of Thessaly, John I Doukas, to the Duchy of Athens, as the dowry of his daughter Helena Angelina Komnene. Sometime between 1318 and 1327, it was conquered by the Catalan Company, which had taken over the Duchy of Athens. Except for an (uncertain) brief occupation by Albanian raiders in 1367, it remained in the hands of various Catalan families at least up to 1382, and possibly until the Ottoman conquest of the County of Salona in 1392. After that it lost its importance as a border fortress and was abandoned. Today the site is abandoned and accessible only on foot from Pavliani. Until World War II, large portions of the fortifications survived, but today only a few remnants of two defensive walls, running in north-south direction, survive.

Mirgadirov studied journalism at Azerbaijan State University and graduated from there. After graduation he worked in the publishing house \\"Azerneshr.\\" Rauf Mirgadirov was part of the newspaper \\"Azadlig\\" (Freedom) in its initial years. In December 1989, he was in Jalilabad region during clashes between internal forces and the local population. Since 1991, he engaged in journalism and worked in the newspaper \\"Ayna-Zerkalo\\" (\\"Ayna\\" being the Azerbaijani version of the newspaper). The state of emergency Rauf Mirgadirov and a group of other journalists produced newspaper \\"Bizim Yol\\" (Our way). Thereafter, since the mid-1990s, Mirgadirov worked at the \\"Shargh\\" news agency. He was then deputy editor of the magazine \\"Monitor\\" and edited the opposition newspaper \\"Azerbaijan Democr√°tica\\". He also became the chief editor of \\"Millet\\" newspaper. Since the beginning of the 2000s, Rauf Mirgadirov worked in the newspaper \\"Zerkalo\\". Since 2010 he lived in Turkey with his family working as correspondent. Rauf Mirgadirov has participated in various international conferences on the issues and settlement of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. A believer in \\"citizen diplomacy\\" between the two countries, Mirgadirov visited Armenia several times. While in Armenia, Mirgadirov, a member of Institute for Peace and Democracy (IPD), held meetings with Armenian NGOs. In 2005, Mirgadirov was awarded the title \\"Honored Journalist of Azerbaijan\\" by Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev. In 2008, Rauf Mirgadirov was awarded the \\"Free Press of Eastern Europe\\" international prize of Gerd Bucerius in 2008 for achievements in the development of independent media. Arrest, trial and sentence Since 2010 Rauf Mirgadirov lived in Turkey with his family working as correspondent for Zerkalo and Ayna. However, in April 2014, he was deported from Turkey to Azerbaijan where he was arrested upon arrival at the airport. Mirgadirov was arrested on charges of spying for Armenia. The deportation of Mirgadirov to Azerbaijan was made immediately after Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan's visit to Baku. This sequence of events made Mirgadirov's lawyer assume that the deportation was due to an arrangement between Azerbaijan and Turkey. Since the arrest, Mirgadirov remained in pretrial custody. His initial detention period was three months but this has been extended several times. The charges stem from Mirgadirov's visits to Armenia between 2008 and 2009, where he allegedly transferred information to Armenian intelligence about Azerbaijan's political and military status which include \\"photos and schemes to be used against Azerbaijan.\\" Mirgadirov's lawyer claims the allegations are groundless and that it is impossible for Mirgadirov that have such information in his possession. Leyla Yunus, another human rights activist arrested on similar charges, considered Mirgadirov's arrest as a start to a \\"full, unofficial ban on contacts with Armenia.\\" Yunus also questioned the timing of the arrest and states: \\"If the Ministry of National Security, as alleged, had suspected Mirgadirov of espionage back in 2008‚Äì2009, why did it keep quiet until now?\\" A spokeswoman for the Human Rights Watch stated that \\"The context and timing of Mirgadirov's arrest suggest that the case against him is politically motivated and intended to punish him for his outspoken views and to send a chilling message to others that dissent will not be tolerated.\\" Throughout the trial, Mirgadirov maintained his innocence. On 28 December 2015, he was found guilty of spying and sentenced to six years of prison. The ruling was upheld by the Court of Appeal on 17 March 2016, but Mirgadirov was released on suspended sentence. He vowed to seek the overruling of the sentence in order to clear his name and be reunited with his family. Mirgadirov also complained about failing health. At the same time, he denied being mistreated while in custody or being forced to testify against other political prisoners, noting that it would be \\"unfair\\" of him to accuse the authorities of putting pressure on him. He stressed his intention to continue his journalism activity in the future.Rauf Mirgadirov: \\"Secret Services Fell for That\\".

Amnesty International states that Mirgadirov has been \\"arrested on what appear to be trumped-up charges of spying for Armenia.\\" Reporters Without Borders spokesman Johann Bihr said \\"The grave charges brought against Mirqadirov are totally absurd and fool no one.

First proposed in 2012 by Surrey mayor Dianne Watts, construction on the project was planned to start in 2019 with an opening date set for 2024. At the inauguration of the new Surrey City Council on November 5, 2018, and after a change of municipal leadership, the newly installed council unanimously voted to \\"indefinitely suspend\\" the project in favour of an extension of the SkyTrain Expo Line to Langley Centre. Timeline This project‚Äîamong others, including the extension of the Millennium Line west to Arbutus‚Äîwas included as one of the initiatives in need of funding that was proposed to be raised by the imposition of a regional sales tax which was put forward for voter approval in a 2015 plebiscite. The electorate voted against the tax increase to fund regional projects and provide a long term sustainable funding model; however, Surrey Mayor Linda Hepner said, after the sales tax was voted down, that the city still planned to build the light rail project as it was the main component in her election campaign. The Surrey‚ÄìNewton‚ÄìGuildford Line was expected to be in service by 2024 while the Surrey‚ÄìLangley Line on the Fraser Highway would be completed at a later date. A report outlining the economic benefits of the project was produced by a consulting firm in May 2015. In 2017, the federal government budget included funding contributions to this project. Prior to the provincial election in 2017, the BC Liberals confirmed they would match the federal contribution if they were re-elected. On March 16, 2018, the provincial government approved the construction of this project. Construction was slated to begin in 2019 and is expected to be completed by 2024. The LRT line will run from Guildford through Surrey Central and terminate in Newton with 11 new stops. On September 4, 2018, during a visit to Surrey, Prime Minister of Canada Justin Trudeau reiterated the Federal government's financial commitment to helping to build the route. On November 5, 2018, during newly elected Mayor Doug McCallum's first council meeting, the council voted unanimously to cancel the LRT line in favour of extending the existing SkyTrain line to Langley. The plan was supported by the regional Mayors' Council on November 15. LRT network =Surrey‚ÄìNewton‚ÄìGuildford Line= Phase 1 of the Surrey LRT was the Surrey‚ÄìNewton‚ÄìGuildford Line which was to replace the 96 B-Line express bus service once completed and will connect Surrey City Centre with Newton Town Centre via King George Boulevard and Guildford Town Centre via 104 Avenue. Proposed stops * 152 Street Guildford Town Centre: serves the Guildford Mall and connects to the existing transit exchange * 148 Street * 144 Street * 140 Street * City Parkway: connects to the SkyTrain at Surrey Central station, Simon Fraser University, the planned Kwantlen Polytechnic University, Central City Shopping Centre and Surrey City Hall * King George: connects to the SkyTrain at King George station and the King George Hub development complex * 96 Avenue: serves Surrey Memorial Hospital, the wider hospital district and the Canada Revenue site * 88 Avenue: serves Bear Creek Park and the Surrey Arts Centre * 80 Avenue * 76 Avenue * 72 Avenue: serves Newton Town Centre, connecting to a new planned transit exchange and higher-density developments Proposed expansion A Surrey‚ÄìLangley Line was proposed as a future phase after the completion of the Surrey‚ÄìNewton‚ÄìGuildford Line and was expected to travel on Fraser Highway and connecting Surrey City Centre, Fleetwood Town Centre and Langley with expected travel time of 24.5 minutes. Reaction The Surrey LRT project had been criticized by some local residents, and an advocacy group, who have raised concerns suggesting a lack of travel time improvement, large annual operating deficits, vulnerability to accidents and a lower comparative business case benefits documented in the dated 2012 TransLink joint analysis. Kevin Desmond, CEO of TransLink, has indicated that SkyTrain along the second phase of the project (Fraser Highway Line) is also a possibility instead of LRT; however, the Mayor of Surrey claimed that a SkyTrain solution along Fraser Highway would cost $950 million more than LRT. In July 2018, a poll sponsored by municipal party Safe Surrey Coalition, headed by Doug McCallum‚Äîthen a mayoral candidate in the 2018 Surrey municipal election who was campaigning against LRT‚Äîindicated 85% of Surrey residents were opposed to the LRT project.

Plot A young girl, Bird, is dropped of by a man to visit two graves. She witnesses and photographs a hitman (Laurence Fishburne) killing people at a burial. When the man, Roger, comes looking for her, the hitman kills him and turns to her (noticing her camera), but she flees into the woods. Bird comes to the house of a man named Carter (Thomas Jane), who vows to protect her. The hitman enters the house and shoots Carter, who shoots him. Carter is stuck upstairs and the hitman downstairs. Carter sends the girl for some light bulbs, which he breaks and throws down the stairs. Bird tells Carter what happened in the cemetery and that she has a picture of the hitman; Carter directs her to hide the film in the toilet tank. The hitman finds a picture of Carter in military uniform with his wife and son and goads him over their leaving him. A sheriff's deputy happens upon the abandoned cars at the cemetery. In the house, Carter has a flashback about his son, who accidentally died when he fell on a piece of farming equipment Carter neglected to clean up. The hitman finds and reads a letter Carter had written his wife, taking blame for the death of their son. He antagonizes Carter whom he realizes was contemplating suicide. While Bird and Carter talk about his family, the hitman fires his gun, which the deputy hears. The light in the house starts to fade and Carter realizes he needs to get Bird out as he cannot protect them both in the dark. The deputy arrives while Carter is trying to get Bird out through a window. The hitman shoots the deputy through the door, scaring Bird, who goes back upstairs. The hitman hides the deputy's car and starts to head back to the house; Carter confronts him and tells him to leave. The hitman tries to goad him to shoot, guessing he only has the one shot. Carter relents because the hitman has taken the deputy's gun. Inside, he tries to barter with Carter for the deputy's life. After breaking his fingers, he kills the deputy. After a period of silence, Carter tells Bird to hide and starts down the stairs. He hears creaking above him and finds the hitman's boots. Realizing he has snuck onto the roof, Carter follows him back in through a window. Surprised, the hitman steps onto the broken bulbs and falls down the stairs. They resume their standoff. The hitman considers burning the house down but reconsiders his plan when he remembers he has Carter's cell phone. As night falls, both men are injured and tired. A vehicle arrives and Carter sees that the hitman has called his wife, Mara, claiming he was worried about Carter. He once again barters for the girl. Carter gives Bird the shotgun, instructing her to aim down the stairs and shoot if she sees the hitman. Angry that Carter came instead of the girl, the hitman shoots Carter in the knee. As they argue, Bird descends the stairs to protect Carter. The lights flicker, distracting the hitman. Carter rushes him and stabs him repeatedly but is shot himself as the lights go out. Mara runs outside and calls 911. Bird approaches the hitman, who is dying. He tells her to shoot him but the trigger simply clicks; the round is a dud. Amused at his bad luck, the hitman refuses to kill Bird since he is already dead. She runs to Carter assuming the worst, but he lives. Mara returns and the three embrace. Cast *Laurence Fishburne as the Hitman *Thomas Jane as Carter Greene *Ella Ballentine as Isabelle (Bird) *Jim Watson as Officer Jerry Baker *Joanna Douglas as Mara Greene *John Tench as Roger - Driver *Laura de Carteret - Widow *Ted Atherton as Priest *J. J. Dimichele - Sam Greene - Son *Craig Porritt - Dispatcher Themes The major theme in this movie is the titular \\"standoff\\" between good and evil. This is evidenced by several obvious plot devices. The villain is a professional hitman, an indisputably evil profession, while the hero is a veteran, a stereotypically noble profession. The unnamed hitman murders several individuals without any discernible or explained motivation, making him inherently evil, while Carter is determined to do the \\"right thing\\" by protecting Bird despite having nothing to gain by it, making him inherently good. The hitman wears only heavy, black clothes while Carter wears a lightweight white t-shirt. Their positioning also establishes their paradigm: the hitman sits downstairs in the darkness while Carter remains upstairs in the light, implying that Carter has both the physical and moral high ground. More subtly, the hitman lies frequently and is usually poorly lit (shadows on his face, red lighting) while Carter is honest about the fate of his family and is almost always cast in bright light showing his face.

His parents, Orlando and Susana (n√©e, Smith), are both immigrants from Cuba. They own and operate a learning center for children. Music career Rawsrvnt first came to national prominence in 2006 with his In Rare Form album. The project leaned heavy on hip hop-influenced covers and interpretations of popular praise songs and established the artist as a leader in the burgeoning worship space of the rap market. UK-based website Cross Rhythms called the effort \\"the best ever fusion of hip hop and worship ministry\\" and noted that it was \\"the benchmark for all future rappers seeking to get beyond dissing demons and the evangelism-by-numbers content of much holy hip hop.\\" As In Rare Form continued to empower church leaders to incorporate more hip hop styles into their Sunday morning services, one of Christian music's largest annual tours, Winter Jam Tour Spectacular, hired Rawsrvnt to craft a theme song for their 2009 traveling showcase. According to Rapzilla.com, Winter Jam was the fourth ranked tour on Pollstar's 2008 First Quarter Ticket Sales Chart topping Hannah Montana/Miley Cyrus, The Police, and Foo Fighters. The song was used for the next three years, and opened the door for additional hip hop artists like Lecrae to be featured on the tour. In 2011, Rawsrvnt's No Ordinary Love album found its way on to the entry list for Best Gospel Album of the 54th Grammy Awards. The project featured the Top 40 Billboard hit \\"On Fire.\\" Later that year he was invited to be a featured player on The Story Tour alongside some of Christian music's biggest names like Steven Curtis Chapman, Michael Tait, Newsboys, and Natalie Grant. The partnership lasted through 2013 and provided an opportunity for the artist to perform as part of The Story Tour medley segment on the nationally televised 43rd Annual GMA Dove Awards. Expanding his sound in 2012, Rawsrvnt created a hybrid EP with Jamaican reggae star St. Matthew titled Soul Deep. The project carried the momentum of one of its key tracks, \\"The Almighty,\\" and won the 2012 En Sound Music Award for Best Gospel Reggae Song. Since then his music has impacted people's lives in a variety of ways. From the personal (a Netherlands couple danced down the wedding aisle to Rawsrvnt's \\"I Gotta Feeling/Take It All\\" mashup) to the public (the same song was used by DJ Promote to warm up crowds on platinum-selling artist Chris Tomlin's \\"Burning Lights\\" tour), it seems there's always a will and a way for Rawsrvnt's art to connect with people in every walk of life. Popular culture In 2010, Rawsrvnt was cast on Donald J. Trump Presents The Ultimate Merger reality television dating show. The invitation to participate as a potential suitor for Omarosa Manigault came after the show's producers contacted Rapzilla.com looking for eligible bachelors with a unique look and story. In response to criticism about his motivation for participating in the show, Rawsrvnt told the Houston Chronicle \\"Honestly, Christians have a hard time with this. I thought it would be cool to show what a real one looks like and how he approaches dating,\\" Puyol said. He was eliminated in the third episode after having a one-on-one conversation with Omarosa in which he declared \\"I'm in love with Jesus, off top.\\" Sports connections Because many of Rawsrvnt's songs are known for their high-energy vibe backed by positive and motivational lyrics, his music is often sought-ought by sports organizations to be used in conjunction with their promotions, telecasts, and competitions. Highlights include performances at Miami Heat superstar Dwyane Wade's birthday brunch, NASCAR driver Michael McDowell (racing driver) selecting \\"On Fire\\" for his track introduction, the Miami Dolphins using \\"Game Changer\\" as the theme for their weekly coaches show, and ESPN licensing \\"There Go That Man\\" for their 2017 NBA Finals and 2017 NBA Draft coverage. Personal life Puyol married Chrissy Alvarez on July 19, 2014. They have two daughters. In July 2018, Puyol revealed that, although there were attempts made alongside church mentors and counselors, the couple ultimately could not reconcile their relationship and marital divorce proceedings were underway. The couple divorced on March 18, 2020.

The most common analog forms for old newspapers are paper and microfilm. Digitized images of newspaper pages are typically (though not always) analyzed with OCR software in order to produce text files of the newspaper content. Newspaper digitization is a special case of digitization in general. Newspapers preserve a rich record of the past, and since the advent of digital media, many institutions across the world have begun to digitize them and make the digital files publicly available. However, over 90% of newspapers remained unscanned in 2015. Digitized newspapers may be made available for free or for a fee. Several lists (noted below) try to catalog digitized newspapers worldwide. Successful newspaper scanning is a complex activity. Although scanning from paper is possible, microfilm scanning is cheaper and good microfilm has been called ‚Äúthe single most critical factor in the success of newspaper digitization.‚Äù The OCR analysis of scanned pages presents a number of technical challenges and the text of old newspapers is often difficult to read, which introduces errors and complicates searching. Attaching metadata to images to make them more easily findable is another important step. Finally, search interfaces must be developed. A number of companies specialize in newspaper scanning and some produce software specially designed for the process. The cost of storing printed newspapers and the relatively low demand for originals after microfilming and scanning means that printed newspapers, once microfilmed or scanned, have often been thrown out. Some people feel that this is a loss for researchers, or simply that there is a poignancy when the paper reading experience disappears. Author Nicholson Baker went so far as to create a paper newspaper archive, which he called the American Newspaper Repository, in order to preserve paper newspapers that would otherwise be discarded. More recent newspapers may have been \\"born digital,\\" meaning that they were printed from computer files rather than by letterpress or phototypesetting. They can be archived by storing the publisher's digital files of each page image rather than scanning the pages.

He has written plays and poetry, played numerous roles on stage and in several films, directed about 50 stage productions and designed and built stage sets for most of them. Biography H√∂r√∞ur is the son of the couple Torfi Benediktsson and Anna Kristinsd√≥ttir. He is the second oldest of six siblings. Trained as an actor at the drama school of the National Theatre of Iceland in the spring of 1970, he also worked as a director from 1971. With his first album, which he recorded in the summer of 1970 (H√∂r√∞ur Torfason syngur eigin l√∂g, 'H√∂r√∞ur Torfason sings his own songs'), he had a tremendous impact on Icelandic music and many took him as a model. H√∂r√∞ur has often been referred to as the '√ûj√≥√∞leikh√∫s landsbygg√∞arinnar' ('National Theatre of the Countryside') because for decades he traveled around the country at least once every year with concerts. He has worked independently since 1973, which is to say that his music and other labour has not used the grant money of rich people or companies. H√∂r√∞ur has put out 23 albums. Already a national figure, in 1975 he was the first person in Iceland to publicly come out of the closet, which made him a human-rights activist. He was the inspiration and main founder of Samt√∂kin '78. He was later also the founder, thinker, developer and spokesman for the organisation Raddir f√≥lksins ('people's voices') in 2008 following the 2008 Icelandic financial crisis. He also conducted influential demonstrations at the Ministry of Education in the summer of 2008 over the case of Poul Ramses. As a thinker in the Kitchenware Revolution and a human-rights campaigner, he has travelled widely around the world and lectured about his methods. In autumn 2008, his biography Tab√∫ (Taboo), written by √Üvar √ñrn J√≥sepsson, was published. In October 2018, his book Bylting (Revolution) was published.

They speak a variety of the Gamo-Gofa-Dawro language. Gofa The term Gofa is originated from ‚ÄòGosha‚Äôs mother Goffe and the heroic king ‚ÄòGoba‚Äô (meaning brave, strong warrior) while he was ruling Gofa region. According to the elders, there were three historical perspectives regarding the naming of the Gofa nationality. One perspective is associated with the patterns of settlement of the nationality, that is, from the ancient time the name Gofa was given to the people settled in the mountainous lands. Therefore, the name is backed by the customer's traditions of the nationality since long ago. The second perspective is that the name Gofa is derived from one of the powerful and warrior leader of the nationality, Kawo Gooba. According to the view, the original name of Gofa was Gooba but later gradually the name changed into Gofa. There is also the third claim from elders that the name Gofa is the original name of the people in the first homeland Gibe, which, is derived from the line of the ancestral line of descent. This claim is further supported by the genealogical structure of the nationality Gofa. The Gofa People As it widely believed by the elders, the Gofa nationality has two ancestral fore fathers which are derived into two ancestral lines. The two ancestral clans are called Maala and Dogala. These two clans further subdivided into various groupings which are called qommo. Some of group/qommo under Maala includes Goshana, Ayka, Maka, Kalata, borodamaala, Golomala, Buyla, Gaamo-maala, sili- maala, Lontso-maala, and others. There are a group/qommo under Dogala are zutuma, worze, gawuraro, ayfarso, amari, Gudarti, Muquriti, Sachi, Sawa, Ganji, etc. The Gofa call father Aawa and their mother Ayye. Daughters are called as macho and sons are Ade nayta. Male siblings call as Esha and female sibling as Micho. The Gofa kinship system in general follows the bifurcate collateral type; father's brother and mother's brother are differentiated Aayo, Aawa and from each other by the term Aawa Isha and awesho (Awta) respectively. Likewise, mother's sister and father's sisters are differentiated from each other by the term Aaye micho and Aawa micho respectively. Father's father is called as Aawa Aawa and father's mother as Aawa Aaye, while mother's father is Aaye Aawa and mother's mother takes the name Aaye Aaye. History of Gofa People There are two perspectives about the origin of the Gofa people. The first perspective is that there are some clans (qomos) just native to soil and call themselves ‚ÄúBita Tusi‚Äô literally meaning ‚Äúemerged out of the land itself‚Äô. These clans include Goshana, Kalata, Gamo Maala, Hirara, Maka etc. The other perspective states that there are also clans /Qommos from the neighboring areas and settled in the area. This movement extended up to Bubula in the upper Gibe River. These clans include Galo-Malla, Walayta Malla, Boroda-Malla, Ayka, Fastigara, Enigara etc. From the above two perspectives one can conclude that, however, different clan explain their origins in various ways, however, both groups settled in the area for a long period of time and identified themes as Gofa. According to the second perspective the first homeland of Gofa was Bubula and Gibe in the upper valley of River Omo. It is said that at certain time in the past, from this original land the people moved towards southern part following part following the Omo River basin. Immediately after they moved southward following the Omo River, they found their first settlement at Wurki, in today's north western part of Demba Gofa. There are several reasons cited as the cause for their south ward movements. One of the pushing factors is unsuitable natural environment in the previous settlements. Besides, the Search for suitable natural environment: pasture and fertile land can be sited as the pulling factors towards their current settlements. There are also various groups who come to the Gofa area from the surrounding ethnic groups. Informants mentions Shasha, kolta, Zulu kalacha, Waysara, Woide Dargintha, Woide Yallo, Layma and Tsanga Darara as the second settlements places of the Gofa. In most case, the southward movement of the people was made under the leadership of their respective Kawo the independent leaders of different Gofa chiefdoms/kingdoms. Following the mountainous chain under the leadership of their kawo until Kencho Gerera. Kencho Gerera is now located in Geze Gofa woreda between Berza and Kencho Kebeles. The southward movement of the Gofa was not peaceful. This was mainly because the most fertile favorable land chosen by the Gofa nationality to settle was not empty; there were settlers in the land. So, the contradicting interest necessitates some sort of conflicts between the one that opted to occupy the land and the previous settlers of the land. As most of the elders agree, others occupied the current Gofa ‚Äì land. When the expanding Gofa nationality tried to occupy the land confrontation occurred. The other attempted to resist the expansion of the Gofa. However, since the expanding Gofa nationality were led by a unified commands of the kawo (literally king), they have the advantage to take most of the land. It is argued that there were continuous conflicts and disputes that resulted the eviction of the others. On the conflict events between the expanding Gofa and the resisting inhabitants, two brothers of Buraqa led the movement of Gofa. The one who become the successor of his father become one of the powerful kawo called kawo Gaamo Buraqa.

It contains a single species, Abyssomedon williamsi, which represents oldest known nyctiphrureptid species and the first to be discovered in North America. Discovery Abyssomedon is known solely from the holotype BMRP 2008 33a, a partial skeleton housed at the Burpee Museum of Natural History at Rockford, Illinois. The specimen consists of a semi-articulated partial skull and disarticulated but associated postcranial remains. BMRP 2008 33a was discovered in 2008 in a claystone and conglomerate nodule found at Oklahoma Museum of Natural History (OMNH) Locality V51. This site, known as Richards Spur, is located just west of U.S. Highways 62 & 281, 10.5 miles south of Apache and 6 miles north of Fort Sill, of Comanche County, Oklahoma. The fossils of Richards Spur are found in Early Permian fissure fills in Ordovician limestone. Abyssomedon was first described and named by Mark J. MacDougall and Robert R. Reisz in 2014 and the type species is Abyssomedon williamsi. The generic name is derived from Greek Abyssos, meaning \\"deep pit\\", and -medon, meaning \\"guardian\\", in reference to the cave system at Richards Spur. The specific name williamsi honor the collector of the holotype Mr. Scott Williams, a paleontologist at the Burpee Museum. Classification The following cladogram is simplified after the phylogenetic analysis of MacDougall and Reisz (2014) and shows the placement of Abyssomedon within Parareptilia. Relationships within bolded clades are not shown.  Paleoecology  The Richards Spur locality preserves a system of Early Permian sediments and fossils trapped in a cave eroded out of Ordovician Arbuckle Limestone. The Permian sediments of Richards Spur may be equivalent to the Garber Formation (also known as the Wellington Formation) elsewhere in Oklahoma, or the Arroyo Formation of Texas. Richards Spur presents a rich Early Permian vertebrate paleofauna, including species of Lepospondyli, seymouriamorphs, basal synapsids, basal eureptiles and many species of parareptiles apart from Abyssomedon, including the basal Microleter mckinzieorum, the bolosaurid Bolosaurus grandis, and the lanthanosuchoids such as Colobomycter pholeter, Delorhynchus priscus, Delorhynchus cifellii, and Feeserpeton oklahomensis. A speleotherm was used to Uranium-Lead date the deposits to 289 ¬± 0.86 million years ago, corresponding to the Artinskian stage. However, the deposits were likely deposited over several million years, as evidenced by wider speleotherm sampling.

It is one of the notable histo-cultural and architectural buildings in the historic centre of Angra, part of the UNESCO-classified heritage site. History The main manorhouse of Rem√©dios, along the southeast facade The elaborate chapel of Our Lady of Remedies Built in the 16th century by Pero Anes do Canto, then nominated the first Provisionor-of-Arms in 1527, and which remained in the hands of his descendants until the 19th century. In addition to being a personal residence, it was the centre for the Provisioner-of-the-Armada, a body responsible for supporting the caravels and carracks that transited the Atlantic during the Age of Discovery. It is situated in the hilltop of Corpo Santo, permitting rapid access to the Porto de Pipas and Angra customshouse, with visibility of the bay of Angra. His son, Ant√≥nio Pires do Canto, who succeeded him in the post, erected the chapel around 1540. His grandson, Manuel do Canto e Castro (son of Pedro do Canto e Castro) promoted the first great alteration to the historical group, resulting in the great manorhouse that is today known as the Manor of Rem√©dios. By the end of the century, his grandson (Manuel do Canto de Castro Pacheco) determined to rebuild the chapel, resulting in its current size and retaining the image of Nossa Senhora dos Rem√©dios. In the 18th century, the grandson of Manuel do Canto e Castro, Francisco Vicente do Canto e Castro Pacheco (1725-1809), initiated extensive work to conserve and restore the group. It was at that time the sculpted coat-of-arms of the family was erected on the manor. At the time of his death his property included valuable furniture, silver, porcelain or textiles. At the end of the 19th century, following the death of Maria Lu√≠sa do Canto in 1890 and lacking any direct descendants, the group was seeded to Francisco do Canto e Castro, who sold the buildings in the beginning of the 20th century to the Irmandade de Nossa Senhora do Livramento, in order install the orphanage of Beato Jo√£o Baptista Machado. This institution functioned in the buildings until the 1980 earthquake, when the buildings were damaged (including the Chapel of Rem√©dios, which almost completely destroyed). By agreement with the Irmandade, the Regional Government of the Azores obtained the property, initiating a program to restore and re-purpose the buildings. This included the construction of a wing to serve as the regional administrative service centre for health and social services, then run by the Secretaria Regional dos Assuntos Sociais (Regional Secretariate for Social Affairs), inaugurate in 1996. Work to the chapel was concluded in 1999. The manor of Rem√©dios and chapel annex were classified as a Property of Public Interest (dispatch 14/78, 14 March 1980, listed in the official journal of the Azores) and included in the historic classification for the city of Angra. Architecture The ornate coat-of-arms of the Canto e Castro family, still retained on the structures. The building experienced several remodelling projects and extensive alterations associated with the 1980 Azores earthquake, which resulted in major damage, in particular to the chapel annex. Over the main doorway of the manorhouse are the coat-of- arms for the Canto e Castro family, the principal descendants and property- owners until the late 20th century.

Origins  The Ravana Rajputs are descendants of Rajput men and their concubines, and were not originally accepted by the Rajput community as Rajputs. They were regarded as the children of the Rajput princes' from concubines and were admitted into Rajput households as slaves. They served the royal Rajput families as guards, soldiers and household servants. In order to raise their status, these people organized themselves into a caste, and styled themselves as \\"Ravana Rajputs\\". The British Indian census authorities, however, rejected their claim to the Rajput status.  Present status  Historically, the Ravana Rajputs have faced caste-based discrimination. The upper-caste Rajputs regard them as inferior, especially for matrimony. Nevertheless, the Ravana Rajputs place themselves highest in the rural caste hierarchy. According to a 2013 Business Standard report, the Ravana Rajputs form around 7% of the Rajasthan state's population. They have been granted the Other Backward Class status for affirmative action. In July 2017, the Ravana Rajput community staged a protest against the alleged fake encounter killing of gangster Anandpal Singh, who belonged to their community and was considered a hero in his village.

He governed the Duchy of Styria on behalf of claimants Duke B√©la and Duke Stephen from 1254 until his death. Origin and family relations Coat of arms of the gens Gutkeled Stephen was born into the Gutkeled kindred, a widely extended clan of German origin, which came from the Duchy of Swabia to the Kingdom of Hungary during the reign of Peter in the mid-11th century, according to Simon of K√©za's Gesta Hunnorum et Hungarorum. Stephen's father was a certain comes Dragun from the clan's S√°rv√°rmonostor branch. Powerful barons Nicholas I and Apaj Gutkeled were Dragun's cousins however all of their ancestors can not be identified thus there is inability to connect the S√°rv√°rmonostor branch to the other branches of the clan. Stephen was the only known son of Dragun. He is considered as forefather and first member of the Maj√°d branch. He had four sons from his unidentified wife: Nicholas II, Joachim, Stephen II and Paul. All of them held important positions, e.g. Judge royal, Master of the treasury, Judge royal and Ban of Severin, respectively. Through his youngest son Paul, Stephen was also an ancestor of the Maj√°di, Butkai, Keszeg de Butka, M√°rki, M√°lcai, Csat√°ri, R√°skai, Fejes de R√°ska and Vidfi de R√°ska noble families.Engel: Geneal√≥gia (Genus Gutkeled 5. S√°rv√°rmonostor branch) Joachim, his second son was one of the most infamous early oligarchs during the chaotic reign of Ladislaus IV in the 1270s. He even kidnapped the young Ladislaus and established a dominion in Slavonia, excluding the royal power. Following his death in 1277, his province was divided between the K≈ëszegis and Baboniƒái, thus the Maj√°d branch declined while other branches of the Gutkeled clan (for instance Rakamaz branch, where the prestigious B√°thory family originated) has become increasingly important. Career in Hungary Stephen started his political career at the ducal court of Andrew, Prince of Halych, the youngest son of King Andrew II, where he served between 1231 and 1234. When the young prince died without child in 1234, Stephen left the Principality of Halych. Following the death of King Andrew II in the next year, he became a loyal supporter of B√©la IV, who ascended the Hungarian throne in 1235. When the Mongols raided Hungary in 1241, Stephen had participated in the Battle of Mohi where the Hungarian royal army suffered a catastrophic defeat against Batu Khan's troops. He was able to flee from the battlefield and later joined the companion of the escaping B√©la IV who fled to Dalmatia after a short and unfortune bypass in the Duchy of Austria. After the death of William of Saint Omer, the King's distant relative, Stephen was appointed Master of the horse around August 1242. He held the dignity until at least October 1244, but there is a non-authentic charter which suggests he served in that capacity until 1245. Beside that Stephen also functioned as isp√°n/≈æupan of Vrbas (or Orb√°sz) County from 1243 to 1244/5, otherwise he is the first known noble, who held that isp√°nate in Lower Slavonia. From 1245 to 1246, he served as Judge royal and isp√°n of Nyitra County. In 1246, he was elected Palatine of Hungary by B√©la IV, replacing Denis T√ºrje. He functioned in that position until 1247 or 1248. During that time, in 1246, he also governed Somogy County. Three charters preserved that Stephen judged in Bela, Sz√°nt√≥ (Zala County) and Baksa (Baranya County) over litigation cases. From the 1230s, the monarchs occasionally entrusted the palatines, along with other barons of the realm, with specific tasks. For instance, Stephen Gutkeled and isp√°n Cs√°k Hah√≥t ordered to destroy mills built without permission on the river R√°ba on B√©la IV's orders. Governor of Slavonia and Styria In 1248, Stephen became Ban of Slavonia, a position which he held for an 11-year term, until his death. He adopted the title of dux in 1254. His proper title was \\"Ban and Duke of Slavonia\\", according to a royal charter issued in 1254. Following the Mongol invasion, the province of Slavonia and Croatia had an important function of border defense, as a result the royal title of Duke of Slavonia was transformed into the hands of powerful secular barons, like Denis T√ºrje and Stephen Gutkeled, while the King's son, Duke Stephen was still a minor. In Slavonia, Stephen acted as B√©la's viceroy, according to a royal charter in 1248. Nevertheless, Ban Stephen was embroiled in conflict with several Dalmatian towns during his decade of rule, for instance, his son Ban Nicholas Gutkeled commemorated an event, when his father unlawfully usurped lands from the town of Trogir. Stephen resided in Zagreb and governed the region from his palace there, where he also had an own ducal court. He built up a vassal system in Slavonia, royal servants and familiaris were among his household. In 1256, Benedict, the Canon of Zagreb represented Stephen in the mintage and chamber at Pakrac. Styria from Pettau Castle between 1254 and 1259 Stephen built several castles (including Jablanac) along the borders as part of B√©la's radical reforms introduced after the Mongol invasion. He also resettled with hospes migrants the town of Kri≈æevci and donated privileges to the newly inhabited settlement. Stephen was the first secular landowner in Hungary, who founded a settlement, when he settled down the inhabitants of the Rab Island to along the walls of the Jablanac Castle. B√©la IV, in accordance with a treaty in Pressburg (today Bratislava in Slovakia), acquired the Duchy of Styria from his rival Ottokar II of Bohemia on 1 May 1254 after a series of wars. Stephen Gutkeled was installed Captain of Styria () in that year, while also maintained the dignity of Ban and Duke of Slavonia. He governed the occupied province from Pettau Castle (today Ptuj, Slovenia) on behalf of B√©la, who adopted the title Duke of Styria, contesting Ottokar's claims. During his reign, Stephen supported the local church and the nobility in Lower Styria, but some of the nobility from Upper Styria also joined to his league by the end of 1256. However, Stephen was unable to consolidate the Hungarian rule in Styria due to the Bohemians' counter-propaganda and activity. The Styrian noblemen rose up in rebellion against Stephen Gutkeled and routed him in early 1258. Stephen Gutkeled unsuccessfully besieged his former seat, Pettau in the first half of the year, defended by Seifried von Mahrenberg, who defeated the Hungarian troops. Ban Stephen could barely escape from the battlefield, when he swam across the Danube along with his horse. He had to flee Styria, however B√©la and his son, Stephen jointly invaded Styria with mostly Cuman auxiliary troops, restored his suzerainty and B√©la appointed his oldest son, Stephen as the new Duke of Styria. Their campaign was also connected to the war of succession between Philip of Carinthia and Ulrich of Seckau for the Archbishopric of Salzburg. Duke Stephen and his captain, Stephen Gutkeled launched a plundering raid in Carinthia in the spring of 1259, in retaliation of Duke Ulrich III of Carinthia's (brother of Archbishop Philip) support of the Styrian rebels. Following the death of Gutkeled, his position remained vacant and shortly thereafter the province lost for the Hungarians, when the Styrian lords sought assistance from Ottokar and vanquished the Hungarian army in the Battle of Kressenbrunn on 12 June 1260. Stephen Gutkeled was also notable for the first Ban, who minted his own marten-adorned silver denarius in whole Slavonia, the so-called banovac or banski denar. The first coins were issued in 1255 by the Pakrac Chamber, according to a 1256 royal charter of B√©la IV. Stephen's coins marked Styrian influence, as historian B√°lint H√≥man writes in his high-impact work in 1916. Later the mintage's seat moved from Pakrac to Zagreb by 1260. His banovac was considered a high quality currency and when the minting of golden coins began under Charles I of Hungary in 1323, Gutkeled's coins served as an example and base for the new florins. The self-coiange of the Ban of Slavonia (and Croatia) have persisted until the 1350s.

It is a rhizomatous perennial, from the Caucasus mountains in Azerbaijan. It has green or greyish grass-like leaves, a short slender stem and 1‚Äì2 flowers that come in shades of purple, violet, purple-blue, or blue. It is closely related to Iris pumila. It is rarely cultivated as an ornamental plant in temperate regions. Description It is a dwarf, bearded species which is closely related to Iris pumila L. It has a thick and short rhizome. They are bigger than Iris pumila, and fibrous. It has green, or greyish leaves, which are sword-shaped, with pointed ends. They are grass-like, and form tufts of plants. They can grow up to between long, and between 0.4 and 1 cm wide. They are longer than Iris pumila. It has a slender stem, that can grow up to between tall. It has a very, very small pedicel, similar to Iris pumila. The stem has green, glaucous, (scarious) membranous, spathes (leaves of the flower bud). The stems hold 1, or 2 terminal (top of stem) flowers, blooming in spring, in April. The large flowers, come in shades of purple, violet, purple-blue, or blue. The flowers are larger than Iris pumila. It has a long, thin perianth tube, which is purple, but with a brown colour at the base. They are longer than the ovary. Like other irises, it has 2 pairs of petals, 3 large sepals (outer petals), known as the 'falls' and 3 inner, smaller petals (or tepals), known as the 'standards'. The narrow, falls oblong or elongated, and reflexed, they can grow up to long. In the centre of the petal, it has a varied coloured beard, in blue, light violet, white tipped with yellow, or yellow. The standards are longer than the falls. They are ovate or oblong shaped, they also have dark purple veining. It has a blue anthers. After the iris has flowered, it produces an ovate, oblong or triangular seed capsule, that is long. =Biochemistry= As most irises are diploid, having two sets of chromosomes, this can be used to identify hybrids and classification of groupings. It has a chromosome count: 2n=32. Taxonomy It is known as Al–µks–µy s√ºs…ôni in Azerbaijan. It is commonly known as 'Alexeenko Iris' in Russia. The Latin specific epithet alexeenkoi refers to a Russian plant collector called 'Fyodor Nikitich Alexeenko' (1882‚Äì1904). Who was born in Pavlograd in Russia, and then studied at the St. Petersburg Forestry Institute. He later in 1897, set out on a 3-year expedition in the Russian Caucasus, where he made significant collections of plants including Iris alexeenkoi. He then went Central Asia in 1901, gathering some 4,000 specimens from the Pamir Mountains, Wakhan Ridge, Shugnan (Afghanistan) and Darvaz. In 1903, he collected over a thousand specimens in Iran. Then in 1904, he was killed while attempting to illegally cross the Swiss-French border at Geneva. On 4 December 1902, a specimen of Iris alexeenkoi was collected from a region closer to the village of Novoivanovka in Azerbaijan, at an altitude of 2800 ft. It was first published and described by Alexander Alfonsovich Grossheim in 'Botanicheskie Materially Gerbariya Botanicheskogo Instituta Imeni V. L. Komarova Akademii Nauk S S S R' (Bot. Mater. Gerb. Bot. Inst. Komarova Akad. Nauk S.S.S.R.) in 1950, Vol.8 on page 6. The journal is sometimes referred to as 'Not. Syst. Herb. Inst. Bot. Acad. Sci., URSS'. It was verified by United States Department of Agriculture and the Agricultural Research Service on 4 April 2003 and then updated on 2 December 2004. It is listed in the Encyclopedia of Life. Iris alexeenkoi is a tentatively accepted name by the RHS. Distribution and habitat It is native to temperate Asia. =Range= It is found in the Caucasus mountains, (also known as the Transcaucasia region,) within Azerbaijan. Including the regions of, Ganja- Gazakh Area, Baku Province, and Shiraki. =Habitat= It grows on the dry plains, meadows, and steppes, of the lower mountain region. They can be found at around an altitude of above sea level. Conservation It is a rare and threatened plant, of Azerbaijan, with Iris camillae, Iris iberica, Iris pumila and Iris schelkownikowii. Cultivation It is hardy to very warm climates, as it does not stand cold. It can be grown in a greenhouse and cold frame. It is best grown in well-drained soils, in sunny positions. It can be grown in garden borders and pots. It is susceptible to viruses, and slug damage. It is extremely rare in cultivation. It is thought that plants found in the US are mislabelled Iris alexeenkoi. A herbarium specimen can be found in the collection of Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh. Toxicity Like many other irises, most parts of the plant are poisonous (rhizome and leaves), and if mistakenly ingested can cause stomach pains and vomiting. Also, handling the plant may cause skin irritation or an allergic reaction.David G Spoerke and Susan C. Smolinske References Sources * Czerepanov, S. K. 1995.

The film stars Hugh Bonneville, Gillian Anderson, Manish Dayal, Huma Qureshi, and Michael Gambon. It was selected to be screened out of competition at the 67th Berlin International Film Festival. The film was released in the United Kingdom on 3 March 2017, while the Hindi dubbed version titled Partition: 1947 was released in India on 18 August 2017, 3 days after its 70th Independence Day. It was released worldwide on 1 September 2017. Viceroy's House is based on Freedom at Midnight by Larry Collins and Dominique Lapierre, and The Shadow of the Great Game: The Untold Story of Partition by Narendra Singh Sarila.Disclaimer at beginning of film Plot Lord Mountbatten (Hugh Bonneville) arrives at Viceroy's House in Delhi in 1947 with his strong-willed wife Edwina (Gillian Anderson) and daughter Pamela. As the final Viceroy of India, he is in charge of overseeing the dissolution of the British Raj and the establishment of an independent Indian nation. Mountbatten attempts to mediate a disagreement between the two major Indian political leaders, Jawaharlal Nehru, who wants India to remain intact as one nation after independence, and Muhammad Ali Jinnah, who wishes to establish the separate Muslim state of Pakistan. Meanwhile, Mountbatten's newly-arrived valet Jeet (Manish Dayal) encounters the beautiful Alia (Huma Qureshi), whom he had fallen in love with previously. Alia continues to spurn Jeet because he is Hindu and she Muslim; she fears that she will disappoint her invalid father Ali (Om Puri). With riots erupting across India, the British decide to accelerate the independence process. Mountbatten is intent upon a one-state solution, but with intensifying violence between Muslims and Hindus he reluctantly accepts the Partition of India. He is given only a couple months to carve out a separate state from the existing territory, with the help of an inexperienced English lawyer, Cyril Radcliffe (Simon Callow). Jeet continues to pursue Alia, until it is revealed that she has been betrothed since childhood to another man. The servants at Viceroy's House are forced to choose between staying in India or going to Pakistan. Mountbatten is enraged to find that his Chief of Staff Lord Ismay (Michael Gambon), has been working covertly to draw the boundaries of Pakistan in order to create a buffer state between the Indian subcontinent and the Soviet Union. He realizes that he has been used as a pawn and the displacement of millions of people will result. Jeet is devastated to learn meanwhile that his entire family has been slaughtered in Punjab. Although Alia rejects her fianc√© when he returns to claim her, she chooses to depart for Pakistan with her father. Days later Jeet reads in the newspaper that the night train she had boarded was attacked and everyone was killed. In anger he brandishes a knife at Mountbatten, before resigning his post. With Delhi overwhelmed with refugees, the Mountbattens decide to stay on in India to assist where they can. While Jeet volunteers to help with the refugees, Alia is brought in badly injured but alive, the lone survivor of the train attack. She recognizes Jeet and shouts for him, and the two are reunited.

On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 76% based on 41 reviews, with an average rating of 6/10. The New York Times praised the film for \\"cramming ample history into a compact running time without sacrificing flow or interest.\\" The Washington Post called it \\"educational, if melodramatic,\\" concluding that \\"the movie accomplishes a difficult task, making sense of a complicated period in history.\\" =Historicity= Manish Dayal, Gillian Anderson, Gurinder Chadha, Hugh Bonneville and Huma Qureshi at the 67th Berlin International Film Festival Chadha described the film as the Upstairs, Downstairs view of the Partition of India. She defended her film against criticisms of historical heterodoxy, saying that she was guided by Narendra Singh Sarila's 2006 book The Shadow of the Great Game: The Untold Story of India's Partition, which was based on secret documents discovered in the British Library. Pakistani poet and writer Fatima Bhutto described the film as 'a servile pantomime of partition'. Chadha in response said that \\"her film about India‚Äôs partition of 1947, far from ignoring the freedom struggle, celebrates it.\\" The Guardian summed up the response to the film by saying that \\"Notices by film reviewers have been muted but reasonably kind\\", while the reaction from historians was \\"damning\\". The newspaper was very critical of the film's climax, criticizing the lack of corroborating research to back up the central claim that Pakistan was created as part of a conspiracy by Winston Churchill and the British government. The film's postscript reads: \\"The partition of India led to the largest mass migration in human history. 14 million people were displaced. One million Hindus, Muslims and Sikhs died. This film is dedicated to all of those who died and to all those who survived partition.\\" References External links Viceroy's House on Bend It Networks Category:2017 films Category:Films directed by Gurinder Chadha Category:Films with screenplays by Gurinder Chadha Category:Films with screenplays by Paul Mayeda Berges Category:British films Category:Indian films Category:British historical drama films Category:English-language Indian films Category:Films set in the British Raj Category:Films set in the partition of India Category:Films set in the Indian independence movement Category:Films shot in Rajasthan Category:Films set in Delhi Category:Drama films based on actual events Category:British Empire war films Category:BBC Films films Category:Path√© films Category:Reliance Entertainment films Category:Films set in 1947 Category:Cultural depictions of Mahatma Gandhi Category:Cultural depictions of Jawaharlal Nehru Category:Cultural depictions of Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma Category:Cultural depictions of Muhammad Ali Jinnah Category:Cultural depictions of Vallabhbhai Patel Category:2010s historical drama films Category:2017 drama films ","title":"Viceroy's House (film)"},{"id":"47727581","text":"Aaron Dean Thomason (born 26 June 1997) is an English cricketer who plays for Sussex County Cricket Club.

He wrote under many pseudonyms, most notably Trijntje Fop and Chronos. Biography Stip studied classical languages at the Rijksuniversiteit Utrecht (National university Utrecht). He was a member of the student society Unitas, where he met Albert Alberts, Leo Vroman, and Anton Koolhaas. In the Second World War, his poem Dieuwertje Diekema was distributed illegally. The poem was a persiflage of the poem M√°ria L√©cina (1932) written by J.W.F. Werumeus Buning. After the war, Stip worked as a copywriter for the Dutch army's press agency and the Dutch government's press agency. From 1951 to 1979, he was an editor at the Polygoon cinema newsreel. In 1950, Stip composed a poem collection, Vijf variaties op een misverstand (\\"Five variations on a misunderstanding\\"), about the misadventures of Pyramus en Thisbe, in the style of five Dutch authors: Speenhoff, Jan Prins, Nijhoff, Gorter, and Vondel. =Trijntje Fop= From 1951 onwards, he wrote under the pen name Trijntje Fop (borrowed from one of the poem-writing classmates of Woutertje Pieterse) animal poems for the Dutch newspaper de Volkskrant. Throughout the years, he wrote many hundreds, that were published in various magazines and bundles. Also, he wrote various materials for Wim Kan. A large collection of poems by Trijntje Fop appeared in 1988 as Het Grote Beestenfeest (\\"The Large Animalparty\\"). The animal poems are of a very consistent pattern. Never any smuggling with the Metre (poetry): every line, without exception, has four stresses. The rhyme scheme is always AABBCC (an epigram or paired rhyme). Just like a limerick, somewhere in the verse, often in the first line, the name of a town is mentioned. Most Trijntje Fop verses contain six lines; occasionally, it will be eight lines, and every now and then an even higher number of lines. Some verses also have two lines only. Sometimes, the last lines contain an old-fashioned formulated pseudo-wise lesson for children. The complete poem works of Kees Stip, including the Trijntje Fop poems, was released in 1993 under the title Lachen in een leeuw (\\"laughing in a lion\\"). This title was borrowed from the poem Op een spreeuw (\\"on a starling\\"). Possibly the most famous Trijntje Fop poem is Op een bok (\\"on a billy goat\\") from the collection Het Grote Beestenfeest. This verse has its own statue, the Siddebuurster bok, in the Dutch town of Siddeburen since 1978, with the poem on its pedestal. Originally, the statue was located on the Oudeweg road, but it was later moved to the corner of Poststraat and Lougpadje.  Kees Stip Prize  In 1985, the literary magazine De tweede ronde (\\"the second round\\") founded the Kees Stip Prijs for light verse.

Born in Albany, on 15 November 1841, Albert was the second son of pastoralist John Hassell who had pioneered the area around Kendenup in the Great Southern region of Western Australia in 1840. The young Albert was educated at a private school in Albany leaving at age 11 to work on the family farm. Working on the property Albert Hassell eventually became manager of another of his father's properties near Jerramungup from 1861 to 1863. He became the first European to overland to Esperance during the time. From 1864 to 1878 Albert and his brother, John Frederick Hassell, ran the family businesses. Hassell ran for parliament and won a by-election representing the seat of Albany in the colony's first part-elective Legislative Council from 1871 to 1874; after the term expired he resigned from the post. Under responsible government he later represented Plantagenet in the Legislative Assembly from 1890 to 1904. During his time he was also elected as the Western Australian representative at the Australasian Constitutional Convention from 1897 to 1898. After an electoral redistribution in 1904 Hassell stood for the seat of Albany and lost the seat; he then resigned from politics. Hassell married Ethel Clifton in June 1878 and had four sons and three daughters. Well known in the racing industry, Hassell bred, owned and successfully raced several horses. He was a foundation member of the Albany Club, a member of the Weld Club, a founder of the Plantagenet Lodge of Freemasons, a long serving member of the Albany Roads Board, a Justice of the Peace and a long time representative for P&O; Shipping in Albany. As pastoralists the family introduced Saxon sheep onto their properties. Hassell improved the flocks and was awarded a grand prix in 1889 at the Paris Universal Exposition for twenty- five fleeces and later won more gold medals for his wool displays in exhibitions in France and Western Australia. Hassell died in 1918 in Melbourne; his body was buried at Memorial Park Cemetery in Albany. In 1887, the Victorian government botanist, Ferdinand von Mueller named Chorilaena Hassellii (now Muiriantha hassellii) in honour of Hassell, who had collected specimens of the plant from the western end of the Stirling Range.

Express) is a daily Superfast Express train on Indian Railways, running between New Delhi and Chennai Central. It is a historic train and is one of the oldest trains starting services in 1929. It originally ran between Peshawar in Pakistan (then capital of the North West Frontier Province) and Mangalore Central in Karnataka (then in the Madras Presidency). History For most of the 19th century, the main railway route from Madras to Calcutta and Delhi was through Bombay. The Madras-Bombay mail train carried through carriages between Madras and Manmad which were detached at Daund. Passengers would then transfer to the Great Indian Peninsular Railway's Calcutta mail at Manmad to proceed to the northern and the eastern parts of the country. The East Coast line between Madras and Calcutta opened in 1900, providing a shorter route for the passengers bound to Calcutta, but the passengers bound to Delhi, Lahore and other major cities in the north, continued to rely on the Madras-Manmad mail service. A record in through train running was set in 1921 by a military train conveying families of a regiment from Peshawar to Cannanore (now Kannur in Kerala). The journey represented a continuous run of over 2500 miles over the North Western Railway (British India), Great Indian Peninsular Railway, Madras and Southern Mahratta Railway and the South Indian Railway. Following this record journey, interest in a shorter through route between Madras and Delhi was rekindled and the Nizam's Guaranteed State Railway hastened the construction of the missing rail link between Kazipet and Balharshah. The link was opened throughout on 15 November 1928 with the commissioning of the Komaram Bheem Road - Balharshah section. This link reduced the distance between Madras and Delhi by over 200 miles. From 1 April 1929 the 'Grand Trunk' express commenced operating as two through carriages running between Peshawar in the North Western Railway (British India) and Mangalore in the South Indian Railway. The two coaches, consisting of a composite First and Second class coach and a composite Third class and Luggage coach, made their way to Madras attached to the South Indian Railway's Mangalore-Madras mail train. Between Madras and Itarsi sectional coaches to Itarsi, Bezwada (now Vijayawada) and Hyderabad were operated. At Itarsi, the two through coaches from Mangalore were attached to the Great Indian Peninsular Railway's Bombay- Delhi service. In the final leg of the journey between Delhi and Peshawar, the two through carriages were attached to the Frontier mail and reached Peshawar traveling through Bathinda, Ferozepore and Lahore. Thus the train covered a distance of 2497 miles in a little over 96 hours. This was not an independent train and the name 'Grand Trunk express' only referred to the 2 through carriages operating between Mangalore and Peshawar. Shortly after the inauguration of the service, from 15 October 1929, the two through carriages operating between Mangalore and Peshawar were restricted to run between Mettupalayam and Delhi. From 1 March 1930, the service was extended to Lahore. As the train consisted of only 2 through coaches, it proved insufficient to meet the traffic requirements. In addition, the train's schedule depended on the schedules of the trains carrying the through carriages, and was thus subject to regular delays. This led to a revision in the operation of the train and the revamped 'Grand Trunk express' commenced operating as a dedicated daily train between Madras and Delhi from 1 September 1930. The rakes used for the train were supplied by the Great Indian Peninsular Railway for the next few years. Until the mid 1960s, the Grand Trunk express completed the 1360 mile journey between Madras and New Delhi in about 50 hours. After the introduction of the Dakshin Express in 1968, the Grand trunk express was moved to a faster schedule. For a few years after the change in schedule, the train operated as a fully air-conditioned service for two days every week and with a mixed consist on the remaining 5 days. In time, the air-conditioned service was discontinued. Today, the train covers the 2183 kilometer journey in 35 hours and 15 minutes, with 40 halts (exclusive of the terminals) at an average speed of 62kmph. From 10 December 2015, the train started terminating at Delhi Sarai Rohilla instead of New Delhi. From 12 May 2018, the terminal was reverted to New Delhi. Schedule and Service The train passes through the states of Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Haryana and Delhi. As per the numbering of the Indian Railways, the train has been assigned the numbers 12615/12616, with 12615 being assigned for the Chennai Central (MAS) - New Delhi (NDLS) run and 12616 for the New Delhi (NDLS) - Chennai Central (MAS) run. The normal composition of the GT is 24 coaches (cars) of the following classes (\\"AC\\" indicates air conditioned coach):1 AC I Class cum AC II tier, 2 AC II tier, 3 AC III tier, 13 III tier Sleeper, 4 General/Unreserved and 1 Pantry car.

Lekkerkerker studied mathematics at Utrecht University during the periods 1940-1943 and 1945-1949 under Jurjen Koksma and Jan Popken. In 1955 he received his doctorate under the guidance of Popken with the thesis On the Zeros of a Class of Dirichlet- Series; in Dutch: Over de nulpunten in een klasse van Dirichletreeksen. After completing his studies in 1949, he started work at the Amsterdam Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (National Research Institute for Mathematics and Computer Science), where he worked under Koksma in the pure mathematics division. In the academic year 1953-1954, he studied in Rome. For 25 years, from 1961 to 1986, he was a professor at the University of Amsterdam, succeeding Nicolaas Govert de Bruijn. He was the director of the Mathematical Institute during the student protests of 1969-1973. He worked on analytic and geometric number theory. He wrote the standard work Geometry of Numbers, first published in 1969. Later he worked on topics in functional analysis. In the 1970s, he turned his attention towards the mathematical treatment of topics in nuclear physics (e.g. neutron transport) and astrophysics (e.g. radiation transport within stars). Afterwards he worked with Rutger Hangelbroek, who did his doctorate under Lekkerkerker in 1973 at the University of Groningen, and Hans Kaper of the Argonne National Laboratory. He also contributed to topics in graph theory and topology. In 1984, although he had not yet reached retirement age, he resigned his professorship over differences in the teaching of mathematical analysis, feeling that his academic freedom was under threat. He did, however, remain active in mathematics: for example, he brought out a second edition of Geometry of Numbers along with Peter Gr√ºber. This field now found new applications in coding theory. He was a co-editor of Mededelingen van het Wiskundig Genootschap (correspondence of the Mathematical Society).

The interior is adorned in Spanish Colonial and pre-Columbian styles. While the facade is made of brick and terra cotta in the Spanish and Mexican style of the Baroque period. The auditorium walls are adorned with statues, parapets and towers, asymmetrically arranged while the ceiling remains unadorned, like a sky above.

Built about 1882, it was one of the small town's first public buildings, a role it continues to serve as it now houses the public library. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1996. Description and History The Norton's Corner School is set on the west side of Elliotsville Road in the rural village center of Willimantic, a small town with a population of about 150. It is set back, with a grassy area and semicircular drive between it and the road. It is a single-story wood frame structure, with a front-facing gabled metal roof and clapboard siding. The front facade has a pair of entrances flanking a central sash window, and the side walls each have three sash windows. The interior has two small entry vestibules, with a large open space occupying most of the building. The walls are finished in bead-board wainscoting and plaster, and the floors are fir. The north and south walls retain original blackboards.Thayer, David; Mitchell, Christi (2015). NRHP nomination for Norton's Corner School; available by request from the Maine SHPO The school was built sometime between 1881, when a town meeting authorized the division of the town into school districts, and 1884, when it voted to acquire the land on which the constructed building stood. It was probably the second school built in the town, as mention is made in the 1881 meeting minutes of another school. That school, the Hart's Corner School, is in poor condition and has been substantially altered. Alterations to this building include a woodshed and privies, which were added in 1916 and 1926, and the building was electrified by 1951. The school was used for educational purposes until 1965, when it was the last of the town's schools to close (the town's students are now sent to schools consolidated with other area communities). In 1976 a local civic group outfitted the building with library shelving, and opened it in the summertime as a public library.

He also wrote crime fiction under the pseudonym Christian Ohlig. Life Born in Bendorf, across the river from Koblenz, Kettenbach grew up in Cologne. On passing his school final exams he began a study course covering Newspaper and Theatre studies, but his studies were cut short in 1953 by his father's death, after which he found himself taking over the running of his father's advertising agency. A succession of jobs, along with broken periods of further study followed. Between 1954 and 1956, and again between 1958 and 1964, he worked as a Literary editor for radio and television plays with the Cologne-based broadcaster, Westdeutscher Rundfunk. From 1956 to 1958 he worked on a voluntary basis for the news editorial department of the mass-circulation K√∂lner Stadt-Anzeiger newspaper. In 1958 he embarked on a more sustained period of study, covering subjects that included Philosophy and East-European History. Eventually, in 1964 or 1965, he received a doctorate from Cologne University. His dissertation concerned Lenin's Theory of Imperialism.

Jackson  Education and early professional life  He received his primary education at the Forest Gate primary school. Smartt then completed a degree in botany from Durham University, graduating in 1952. He was a member of Hatfield College. He subsequently studied at Cambridge University (Christ's College) for a diploma in agricultural science. Afterwards, he went to Northern Rhodesia (now Zambia), where he worked on groundnuts. He completed his PhD in the Department of Genetics at North Carolina State University (NCSU) in 1965. His thesis was on \\"Cross-compatibility relationships between the cultivated peanut Arachis hypogaea L. and other species of the genus Arachis\\".  Professional life  He worked in plant breeding programs in Africa. After returning to England, he was employed by the Department of Botany of Southampton University from 1967 to 1996. Initially, he was a Lecturer in Genetics, while achieving the status of Reader in Biology in 1990. Southampton University honoured Smartt by awarding him a Doctor of Science (DSc) in 1989 for his work on the genetics and evolution of crop plants. Smartt authored two books on grain legumes, edited a major volume on groundnuts, and was invited to co-edit a second edition of the important Evolution of Crop Plants with the late Professor Norman Simmonds.

Architecture and history Saco City Hall is located on the west side of Main Street (Maine State Route 9), at the corner of Cutts Avenue in the city's central business district. It is a two-story brick structure, with a front-facing gable roof and a square tower prominently projecting from its front facade. The building's corners and bays are articulated by brick pilasters. First floor windows are rectangular sash, with stone lintels and sills, while second floor windows are tall and narrow paired windows, with keystoned semicircular arched windows above. The main entrance is in the front of the tower, which rises a full three stories to an ornate wooden belfry, above which is a four-sided cupola in which clock faces have been set. The town of Saco (reincorporated as a city in 1867) experienced rapid growth during the second quarter of the 19th century, doubling in population between 1830 and 1860, fueled by industrial development. This growth prompted the need for a larger space to hold town meetings, which had until then been held either at the old meeting house or congregational church vestry. The present building was constructed in 1855 to a design by Thomas Hill, a local carpenter. Hill oversaw the building's construction, whose masonry work was done by Abraham and Barnabus Cutter.

It was found at Velanideza near Marathon in Attica.Coloured reconstruction in the left Description The Stele of Aristion or the Marathon Stele is a funerary stele in the National Archaeological Museum, Athens (NAMA, inventory number 29) which dates from around 510 BC. The work is among the best sculptures from late Archaic Greece. It is made of Pentelic marble and measures 2.02 m high. The stele was found with its base, which is 0.24 m high. The uppermost portion of the head and helmet is missing. At the top of the base is an inscription, giving the name of the deceased in the genitive: \\"Aristion's\\".Inscriptiones Graecae (IG) I¬≥ 1256; Image of the inscription. Aristion is depicted as a bearded hoplite soldier in profile, facing right. He wears a short, thin chiton under a corselet. This was originally decorated with painted designs: meanders, zig-zags, and a star on his shoulder. The rest of the statue was also extensively decorated with paint‚Äîtraces of red, yellow, and blue paint still survive. Aristion also wears an Attic helmet and greaves. His right arm hangs at his side, his left hand holds a spear. Some details are especially well-worked, like the wavy beard, the hair, and the musculature of the arms, legs and chest. In the empty space under his feet there is a horizontal inscribed band, which names the sculptor of the stele: \\"Work of Aristokles\\". Creation The sculptor Aristokles was known to have his signature on several bases, but his only famous work is Stele of Aristion. His name then appears on an Attica inscription found at Hieraka, Cape, Greece. Although the Stele is currently white, this would not have been the case of the Archaic period of Attica. It was not an uncommon practice to add polychrome as a decorative element of marble stele. The Stele of Aristion was originally decorated with painted designs: meanders, zig-zags, along with a star on his shoulder. There are also remnants of red pigment located on the ground of the relief, on the end of the shoulder strap, and on the drapery. The amour of the soldier would have been a blue tint, and the hair would be that of a dark colour.  Footnotes  Bibliography  Nikolaos Kaltsas: Sculpture in the National Archaeological Museum, Athens.
