These canals are orientated longitudinally and radially in between fusiform rays. They are usually found in late wood: denser wood grown later in the season. Resin is antiseptic and aromatic and prevents the development of fungi and deters insects.  Types  * Normal resin canals exist naturally in the wood of the genera Picea, Larix, Pinus, Pseudotsuga and Shorea. * Traumatic resin canals may be formed in wounded trees that don't have normal resin canals. Wounding occurs from either fire, freezing or mechanical damage. These canals are irregularly shaped compared to normal resin canals.  Characteristics  Resin canal characteristics (such as number, size and density) in pine species can determine its resistance to pests. In one study, biologists were able to categorize 84% of lodgepole pine, and 92% of limber pines, as being either susceptible or resistant to bark beetles based only on their resin canals and growth rate over 20 years.Ferrenberg, S., Kane, J.M. & Mitton, J.B.

Tirit was most probably born and raised during the reign of Tiran. His father died at an unknown date during the reign of Tiran. Sometime during the reign of his paternal grandfather, the Sassanid King Shapur II launched a war on Rome and her allies, firstly by persecuting the Christians that lived in Persia and Mesopotamia.Kurkjian, A History of Armenia, p.103 Shapur II's war by capturing these territories began to dealt a severe blow to Roman prestige in the East.Kurkjian, A History of Armenia, p.103 Eventually the Sassanid King with his army had invaded Armenia, taking the members of the royal family including Tirit as hostagesKurkjian, A History of Armenia, p.103Encyclopaedia Iranica: Armenia and Iran II.

After Shapur II was defeated, he had signed a treaty and Tirit with members of his family were released from prison. As Tiran being depressed and blinded from his experience in captivity, had abdicated his throne and Arsaces II succeeded Tiran as Armenian King in 350. During the reign of Arsaces II, Tirit could have been seen as a potential successor to his uncle. Tirit's paternal cousin Gnel married an Armenian noblewoman called Pharantzem of Siwnik’ (Siunik)Hovannisian, The Armenian People From Ancient to Modern Times, Volume I: The Dynastic Periods: From Antiquity to the Fourteenth Century, p.89 from the Siunia Dynasty. Pharantzem was extremely well known for her beauty and modesty.Faustus of Byzantium, History of the Armenians, Book IV, Chapter 15 Her reputation for her beauty had become renown and widespread to the point that Tirit had become passionately in love with her and desired her to be his wife.Faustus of Byzantium, History of the Armenians, Book IV, Chapter 15 Finding a way to plot against his cousin Gnel, Tirit approached their uncle Arsaces II and said to him: “Gnel wants to rule, and to kill you. All the grandees, the Naxarars and the Azats like Gnel and all the Naxarars of the land prefer his lordship over them than yours. Now they say, ‘look and see what you do, king, so that you can save yourself”.Faustus of Byzantium, History of the Armenians, Book IV, Chapter 15 Believing the words of Tirit, Arsaces II became agitated and did confirm the statements of Tirit.Faustus of Byzantium, History of the Armenians, Book IV, Chapter 15 Arsaces II from then until Gnel's death had a grudge against Gnel which he had frequently tried to persecute and plot treachery against him for a long time.Faustus of Byzantium, History of the Armenians, Book IV, Chapter 15 From that moment Gnel was on the run with his wife from his uncle. Arsaces II did eventually kill Gnel around the time of the festival of Nawasard (which was held in August) as his falsely lured his nephew and his wife into Shahapivan a native camping place of the Arsacids which was below a walled hunting preserve based on a lie that Arsaces II wanted to reconcile with Gnel.Faustus of Byzantium, History of the Armenians, Book IV, Chapter 15 When Gnel was captured by Arsaces II's soldiers he was taken to a nearby hill of the mountain called Lsin where he was executed.Faustus of Byzantium, History of the Armenians, Book IV, Chapter 15 After the death and burial of Gnel, Arsaces II issued an order to mourn the death of his nephew which Arsaces II weep and mourn for Gnel greatly while Pharantzem mourned so much for Gnel she tore off her clothes, was screaming and cried so much.Faustus of Byzantium, History of the Armenians, Book IV, Chapter 15 Now Tirit had successfully got rid of his cousin, he was unable to control his lust for Pharantzem. Tirit had sent his messenger to Pharantzem a note reading: “Do not mourn so much, for I am a better man that he was. I loved you and therefore betrayed him to death, so that I could take you in marriage”.Faustus of Byzantium, History of the Armenians, Book IV, Chapter 15 In her mourning Pharantzem, raised a protest, pulling out her hair and screaming as she mourned that her husband died because of her. When the Armenians in particular Arsaces II heard the cries of Pharantzem, Arsaces II began to realise the plotting of Tirit and the senseless death of Gnel. Arsaces II was stunned in what happened and had regretted in killing Gnel. For a while Arsaces II, didn't do anything to Tirit. Tirit had sent a message to Arsaces II stating, “King, I want you to order that I be allowed to marry Gnel’s wife”.Faustus of Byzantium, History of the Armenians, Book IV, Chapter 15 As Arsaces II heard this he said: “Now I know for sure that what I have heard is accurate. Gnel’s death occurred for his wife”.Faustus of Byzantium, History of the Armenians, Book IV, Chapter 15 Arsaces II planned to kill Tirit in return for Gnel's murder. When Tirit heard this, he was in so much fear for Arsaces II he fled at night. Arsaces II was informed that Tirit had left and ordered his soldiers to find Tirit and kill him.

The company was relaunched as a nonprofit entity, Sally Ride Science at UC San Diego, on October 1, 2015. O’Shaughnessy serves as executive director. Childhood and early career O'Shaughnessy was born in San Andreas, California and attended Troy High School in Fullerton, California, where she was active in tennis. As a junior player, she was coached by Billie Jean King. = Tennis = O’Shaughnessy went on to play on the women's professional tennis circuit from 1971 to 1974. She competed in the U.S. National Championships (now known as the U.S. Open) in 1966, 1970, and 1972. Her entry into the 1966 U.S. National Championships at the age of 14 came about by serendipity. O’Shaughnessy was being coached by Dr. Robert Walter Johnson, a physician who played a key role in the tennis careers of Althea Gibson and Arthur Ashe. Johnson was an official of the American Tennis Association (ATA), an organization that promotes tennis for African Americans but welcomes players of all backgrounds. During the summer of 1966, O’Shaughnessy, who is not African American, competed in ATA tournaments in addition to U.S. Tennis Association junior events. O’Shaughnessy won the ATA national 18-and-under championship and so was automatically entered in the U.S. National Championship draw. O’Shaughnessy also competed in the 1972 Wimbledon Championships. During her tennis career, she was ranked as high as No. 52 in the world in women's singles by the Women's Tennis Association and as high as No. 3 in the U.S. in women's doubles (with Ann Lebedeff) by the USTA. O’Shaughnessy won national hard-court doubles titles in the junior division (with Ann Lebedeff) and in the women's division (with Pam Austin). After retiring from tennis, O’Shaughnessy was the founding publisher of the Women's Tennis Association newsletter for several years before going to college to study biology. Science educator O’Shaughnessy earned B.S. and M.S. degrees in biology from Georgia State University and a Ph.D. in school psychology from the University of California, Riverside. She was assistant professor of school psychology at Georgia State University from 1998 through 2001, and then associate professor of school psychology at San Diego State University from 2002 until 2007. O’Shaughnessy's research on preventive interventions for children with reading difficulties was continuously funded by the U.S. Department of Education starting in graduate school. She retired early to devote her time and energy to Sally Ride Science, and was named associate professor emeritus at San Diego State University. O’Shaughnessy has extensive experience cultivating girls’ and boys’ interest in reading, math, and science. Besides being a former science teacher, she is an award-winning writer of science books for children. O’Shaughnessy has written 12 children's science books, including six with Sally Ride. Ride and O’Shaughnessy's clear and eloquent writing style earned them many accolades, including the American Institute of Physics Children's Science Writing Award in 1995 for their second book, The Third Planet: Exploring the Earth From Space. In October 2015, O’Shaughnessy published a children's biography of Ride, Sally Ride: A Photobiography of America's Pioneering Woman in Space. The book combines reminiscences from Ride's family and friends with dozens of photos, including many never-before-published family and personal photos. As a scientist and educator, O’Shaughnessy became deeply concerned about the underrepresentation of women in science and technical professions. Research shows that young girls like science and have the same aptitude for it as boys, but in adolescence, girls tend to drift away from science, in part because of subtle stereotypes and lack of role models. In 2001, Ride, O’Shaughnessy, and three like-minded friends—Karen Flammer, Terry McEntee, and Alann Lopes—founded Sally Ride Science with the goal of narrowing the gender gap in science. (R/V) Sally Ride. From 2001 to 2015, O’Shaughnessy served as the company's chief creative officer, overseeing all content—books, websites, and teacher training curricula. She guided the creation of the Cool Careers in STEM and Key Concepts in Science programs, which combine professional development for teachers with student books and teacher guides. O’Shaughnessy also served as chief operating officer of Sally Ride Science from 2009 through 2013, chairman of the board of directors from 2013 to 2015, and chief executive officer from 2014 to 2015. Sally Ride Science was acquired by the University of California, San Diego, in October 2015. O’Shaughnessy is executive director of the resulting nonprofit entity, Sally Ride Science at UC San Diego, which will create new educational programs and make use of existing Sally Ride Science programs.

Along with the likes of Tom Mallin, Jennifer Phillips, Peter Tegel, and Elizabeth Troop, he was considered one of the elite writers for the BBC. He was a recipient of the Prix Italia in 1957 for his script for No Going Home. Bradnum was a member of BBC North's Drama Department, and, according to BBC, Bradnum was \\"responsible for some of radio's classier adaptations\\". Early years Bradnum was born in Fulham, though he was brought up in Roehampton. His father was a Battersea power station clerk, and his younger sister required special care, having been paralysed by poliomyelitis. He worked with an architect in the mid-1930s before becoming a council draughtsman. After joining the Army, he served in France (1939), Narvik (1940), Crete (1941), and Saint-Nazaire raid (1942), before transferring into administration with the Special Operations Executive. He reached the rank of acting major. His physical and psychological scars (periods of paranoia; one period of near-breakdown) stayed with him and may be attributed to being tortured by the Nazis. Career A radio producer of drama from 1950 to 1961, he also directed 12 Bernard Shaw plays for the Third Programme and numerous plays by Henrik Ibsen. He played a major role, along with Donald McWhinnie and Desmond Briscoe, in establishing the BBC Radiophonic Workshop and wrote Private Dreams And Public Nightmares (1957) for it, which was the first radiophonic poem, featuring the voices of young actors Frederick Treves, Joan Sanderson and Andrew Sachs. This was considered an \\"early example of the experiments blending sounds and voices\\". In the 1960s, he produced a number of plays for the BBC's anthology drama series Thirty-Minute Theatre, including several Sherlock Holmes works. He continued to work as a part-time script adviser until 1986. Several of his plays, such as In at the Kill and Minerva Alone, were adapted for theatre and performed by the Hampstead Theatre Club onstage in the early 1960s. In at the Kill, a one-act play, is described as a \\"macabre little piece\\" by Theatre World. Another radio play, Goose With Pepper (1972), similarly was dramatised for the theatre by David Ambrose in August 1975. From the early 1970s to the mid-1990s, he produced mainly for Radio 4. His last play, The Terraced House, was written for Radio 4 in 1994. In 2003, BBC Radio 7 rebroadcast his 25-part BBC Radio 4 adaptation of Anthony Powell's A Dance to the Music of Time, which originally ran during the years 1979–82. Bradnum was noted for his plays which were often centred on aristocratic folk or esteemed military personnel of the middle and upper class. However, some of his works differed in theme, such as one of his early plays The Cave and the Grail, which is based on Arthurian legend and set in coastal Norfolk. Keenly aware of his audience, Bradnum knew that northern listeners preferred family plays, northern settings, and adaptations of northern novels, rather than fantasy.

He was Archbishop of Jos from 2000 to 2019, when he became first Archbishop Coadjutor and then Archbishop of Abuja. Biography Kaigama was born in Kona, Taraba, on 31 July 1958. He studied for the priesthood at St. Augustine's Seminary in Jos. He was ordained a priest on 6 June 1981. At the Pontifical Gregorian University, he earned a doctorate in theology in 1991. Pope John Paul II appointed him bishop of the newly established Roman Catholic Diocese of Jalingo on 3 February 1994. He was consecrated as bishop on 23 April 1995. The Bishop of Yola, Patrick Francis Sheehan OSA, was the principal consecrator, with co-consecrators Gregory Obinna Ochiagha, Bishop of Orlu, and Athanasius Atule Usuh, Bishop of Makurdi. On 18 May 2000, Pope John Paul named Kaigama to succeed Gabriel Gonsum Ganaka as Archbishop of Jos. Kaigama was President of the Nigerian Bishops Conference from 2012 to 2018 and President of the Episcopal Conference of West African Catholic Bishops. He is also chairman of the Plateau State-convened \\"Interreligious Committee for Peace\\". Together with the late Emir of Wase, Alhaji Haruna Abdullahi, he has been involved in promoting mutual understanding between Christians and Muslims. After the riots in Jos in January 2010, he calmed the situation and clarified the conflict in the international press. On 25 July 2012, Pope Benedict XVI named Kaigama a member of the Pontifical Council for the Promotion of the New Evangelisation. In 2014, the Catholic Bishops Conference in Nigeria supported legislation to make participation in a same-sex marriage a crime punishable by 14 years imprisonment. It noted the move as a \\"courageous act\\" and a \\"step in the right direction\\". Kaigama argued that the action was \\"in line with the moral and ethical values of the Nigerian and African cultures\\", and blessed President Goodluck Jonathan for not bowing to international pressure: \\"To protect you and your administration against the conspiracy of the developed world to make our country and continent, the dumping ground for the promotion of immoral practices\\". Kaigama condemned foreign aid programs for a disproportionate emphasis on contraception. In 2014, he said: “In the first place, children die in infant mortality, in inter-tribal wars and diseases, but yet you come to say 'decrease your population and we will give you economic help.' We want food, we want education, we want good roads, healthcare. We are being given the wrong things and we are being asked to accept, simply because we are poor.” Pope Francis named him Archbishop Coadjutor of Abuja on 11 March 2019 and he became Archbishop of Abuja when Pope Francis accepted the resignation of his predecessor, John Onaiyekan, on 9 November 2019.

They were formed in 2009 and released their first album From the Mouth of the Cave in 2012. The group currently has 22 members, each of whom goes by a single-name pseudonym. The main songwriters are Deborah Coughlin and her former 586 bandmate, Simon Dempsey. History Gaggle was founded by Deborah Coughlin in 2009. Within months Gaggle received recognition from NME in their \\"The fifty most forward- thinking people in music\\", and were featured in the Evening Standard as leaders in a movement described as \\"Choir Mania\\". The group released their first single I Hear Flies in 2010 on Transgressive Records and won Camden Crawl's Best New Act for the Emerging Talent Awards, sponsored by Gibson. In 2011 they released a limited EP called The Brilliant and the Dark on Record Store Day with a performance at Rough Trade East. This was a reworking of a forgotten 1969 Women's Institute opera found by artists Open Music Archive. Gaggle debuted the new show in 2010 at the Women's Library, then took it to the ICA where the record was recorded live, the B-Side compiled of live samples to be remixed by fans on a copyleft licence. Later in 2011 they took \\"The Brilliant and the Dark\\" back to its original home The Royal Albert Hall, in the Elgar Room. This gained the attention of The Guardian who described it as \\"vivacious, visceral, spectacularly indignant wall of sound\\" in a 4 star review. In 2012 they released their debut album From the Mouth of the Cave: two singles of which, Army of Birds and Power of Money, both received videos, respectively. The cost for second single \\"Power of Money\\" was £3000. The reason for the price was explained thus: > The Power of Generosity, Inventiveness, Courage.

It implies a lack of severe surgical invasion. The older style of open-spine surgery for a relatively small disc problem used to require a 5-6 inch incision and a month in the hospital. MISS techniques utilize more modern technology, advanced imaging techniques and special medical equipment to reduce tissue trauma, bleeding, radiation exposure, infection risk, and decreased hospital stays by minimizing the size of the incision. Modern endoscopic procedures (see below) can be done through a 2 to 5 mm skin opening. By contrast, procedures done with a microscope require skin openings of approximately one inch, or more. MISS can be used to treat a number of spinal conditions such as degenerative disc disease, disc herniation, fractures, tumors, infections, instability, and deformity. It also makes spine surgery possible for patients who were previously considered too high-risk for traditional surgery due to previous medical history or the complexity of the condition. Methods Traditionally, spine surgery has required surgeons to create a 5-6 inch incision down the affected portion of the spine and to pull back the tissue and muscle using retractors in order to reveal the bone. The wound itself takes a long time to heal; the aim of minimally invasive surgery is reduce tissue trauma and the associated bleeding and risk of infection by minimizing the size of the incision. Some minimally invasive spine surgery may be performed by a spinal neurosurgeon or an orthopedic surgeon and a trained medical team. Typically, they will begin the operation by delivering a type of anesthesia that numbs a particular part of the body in conjunction with sedation or simply give a general anesthesia that prevents pain and allows the patient to sleep throughout the surgery. Next, the surgeon may begin taking continuous X-ray images in real time, a process called fluoroscopy, of the affected portion of the spine. This allows them to see what they're operating on, in real-time, throughout the surgery without creating a large incision. At this point, the surgeon may begin performing the operation, by creating an incision in the skin above the affected portion of the spine and then using a device called an obturator to push the underlying tissue apart; the obturator is inside a tube, which is left behind after the obturator is removed, leaving a channel down to the spine. Small operating tools as well as cameras and a light are used through this tube. In other surgeries this is called a trocar; in spine surgery it is called a \\"tubular retractor.\\" The surgeon makes the necessary repairs to the spine, extracting affected disc material out through the tubular retractor and inserting medical devices, such as intervertebral spacers, rods, pedicle screws, facet screws, nucleus replacement devices, and artificial discs, through the retractor. Robot-assisted surgery is another technique that is used occasionally in minimally invasive spine surgery. When the procedure is done the tube is removed, and the wound is stitched, stapled, or glued shut. Specific procedures There are many spinal procedures that make use of minimally invasive techniques. They can involve cutting away tissue (discectomy), fixing adjacent vertebrae to one another (spinal fusion), and replacing bone or other tissue. The name of the procedure often includes the region of the spine that is operated on, including cervical spine, thoracic spine, lumbar spine. These procedures include: *Anterior cervical discectomy *Artificial disc replacement or total disc replacement *Epidural lysis of adhesions, also known as percutaneous adhesiolysis or the Racz procedure *Laminectomy *Laminotomy *OLLIF Oblique lateral lumbar inter body fusion *Percutaneous vertebroplasty, a.k.a. Kyphoplasty *Endoscopic Discectomy Small or ultra-small endoscopic discectomy (called Nano Endoscopic Discectomy or Endoscopic Transforaminal Lumbar Discectomy and Reconfiguration) does not have bone removal, like laminectomy or laminotomy. These procedures do not cause post-laminectomy syndrome (Failed back syndrome).Book Chapter - Decision Making in Spinal Care - Chapter 61; Copyright 2013 by Thieme Risks and benefits Risks include damage to nerves or muscles, a cerebrospinal fluid leak, and typical surgical risks, such as infection or a failure to resolve the condition that prompted the surgery. Claims are made that the larger style of MISS has better outcomes than open surgery with respect to fewer complications and shorter hospital stays, but data supporting those claims is non-conclusive. History Humans have been trying to treat spinal pain for at least 5,000 years. The first evidence of spine surgery appeared in Egyptian mummies buried in 3,000 BC. However, Hippocrates is often credited with being the father of spine surgery due to the extensive amount of writing and proposed treatments he produced on the topic. The first operative spine surgery is credited to Paul of Aegina who lived during the 7th century. However, only within the last 50 years have advances in digital fluoroscopy, image guidance, endoscopy and minimally invasive surgical tools allowed minimally invasive spine surgery to rise to the forefront of spinal procedures.

There are two types of certificate: one demonstrates conformity to the national standards known as GOST, and the other to a particular technical regulation. Certification may take place on either a mandatory or a voluntary basis. The certificate may be obtained: under contract; per consignment; or for serial production of commercial products.  Types  There are two types of Conformity Certificate in Russia: the GOST Certificate of Conformity to National Standards, and the Certificate of Conformity to a Technical Regulation. The explanation of this is that the Technical Regulations began to be developed and enforced only recently, and do not yet fully regulate the certification process in Russia. Until the Technical Regulations replace the GOST Standards, the latter continue to play a part in the certification process on the Russian territory. It should also mentioned proving correspondence to Technical Conditions (TC), but generally this method is used in voluntary certification.  Mandatory and voluntary certification  Manufacturers may obtain the Certificate of Conformity to Technical Regulation in mandatory or voluntary form. In voluntary certification it is the manufacturer who chooses the parameters on which to certificate. That is the reason why voluntary certification is used by large manufacturers and trade representatives for proving the correspondence of their product to the technical requirements, as well as to additional GOST standards which are not used in obligatory certification.  Period of validity  The Certificate of Conformity to Technical Regulation may be given only by an authorized organ in the sphere of certification. The document may be given for the period of 1, 2 or 3 years in the case of series production. If the certificate is given for the party of the products, its term is unlimited. Such type of certification is typical for the parties of foreign products that are delivered into the Russian territory according invoice or a contract.  The schemes of certification  The certificate may be obtained: under contract; per consignment; or for serial production of commercial products.Certificate of Conformity, InterGost = Scheme 1 = Certificate of Conformity to Technical Regulation may be drawn up according to the contract. In this case the certificate must contain the date and details of product tests (the date and the number of the testing protocol). The certificate of this type generally includes the correct name of the Certificate Receiver and the Product Manufacturer, the date and the number of the contract and the scheme of certification. Certificate of Conformity to Technical Regulation is generally drawn up in the case when the import is not limited to a one-time delivery of the products. After drawing up such a document the applicant may import their product for a period of one year. = Scheme 2 = The Certificate of Conformity to Technical Regulation may be drawn up for the party of products. In such case there is no need in drawing up the testing protocol, but the certificate must include the date and the number of invoice. Such kind of certificates is drawn up when importing the test party of some type of product because it is valid only for a limited party of goods. The Correspondence Certificate is provided with the open date. Generally, this kind of certificate is given, for example, for equipment. = Scheme 3 = Certificate of Conformity to Technical Regulation for the serial output of production may be drawn up only after certification tests. It is valid from one to three years. This kind of document may be drawn up by both Russian and foreign manufacturers.  Process for obtaining the Certificate  It is possible to receive the Certificate of Conformity to Technical Regulation after providing the documents package to the certification center. One of the necessary documents required for certification is the test protocol. The document may be given by any laboratory authorized for certification tests after testing the products for correspondence to legislative requirements. Generally certification laboratories check the products for environmental and consumer safety as well as they correspond to the claimed characteristics mentioned in technical documentation to the real characteristics. = Documents needed for the certification process =  Serially manufactured products  * The application for the certification; * Brief description of the product; * The documents proving the property or lending of the manufacturing premises; * The normative-technical documentation for the products (The GOST or TC); * The Statute of the Enterprise; * The TIN certificate of registration in the Taxation Department; * The state registration certificate;  Imported products delivered under contract  * The application for the certification; * The description of the products; * The TIN certificate of registration in the Taxation Department; * The state registration certificate; * The Statute of the Enterprise; * The copy of the contract.

It is located close to State Highway 1, which bypasses the town to the west, between Ashburton and Rakaia on the Canterbury Plains. According to the 2013 census 2,493 people usually live with in the Chertsey District. This is an increase of 288 people, or 13.1 percent, since the 2006 Census.http://archive.stats.govt.nz/Census/2013-census/profile-and-summary- reports/quickstats-about-a- place.aspx?request_value=14917&parent;_id=14909&tabname;=&p;=y&printall;=true  History  = European settlement = In 1872 the first Crown land grant was opened and the following year W.A. Brown took up land in Chertsey. He would name the district Chertsey after the town in England where his wife was born and where he had lived. In 1876 Thomas Wilkinson took up land in the district, and the following year the village was surveyed and officially named Chertsey. A 21-room hotel was built along with a blacksmith and a post office. This was shortly followed by a butcher's shop, two general stores, a bakery and a coal and timber yard. = Oil drilling = The Canterbury Petroleum Prospecting Company started drilling for oil in 1914 and it was ceased in 1921. Oil was found at 420 metres below at Chertsey 1. In September 1921 a drill bit had broken down the well and with the sandy ground surrounding the well they were unable to retrieve it. In the late 1960s J.D. George 1 well was drilled about 10 km south of Chertsey 1, oil seepages were found at 1650 metres but this well was discontinued. = The fire of 1926 = \\"The Big Fire\\" of 1926 had devastating effects on the Chertsey district. The fire was caused by a train starting at the Chertsey township and travelled 20 km to the coast. When it reached Taverners Road several kilometres from its start point the front of the fire was over 3 km wide. One local farmer lost his life while trying to plough a fire break when he was overcome by the speed of the fast moving fire. Many of the districts farms lost a significant amount of livestock. The Minister of Railways at the time was reluctant to acknowledge responsibility, but on the intervention of Prime Minister Gordon Coates payment for about half of the assessed damaged was received. = Post World War II = By the 1960s only the Chertsey general store, Chertsey Hotel and the Agricultural engineering manufacture remained in the community. Following transport advances and with the development of large supermarkets in nearby Ashburton, Chertsey store was forced to close in the 1990s. The Chertsey Tavern closed its doors in 2013 leaving Chertsey's second hand bookstore the only remaining business. With New Zealand's dairy industry boom, Chertsey has seen large population growths, with many farms converting from sheep and mixed farming to dairying.  Education  * Chertsey Primary School - opened in 1876. The school roll has peaked as high as 92. in 2018 the roll has been stable at around 31 children. Three teachers are employed.  Sports  Chertsey Domain has held the majority of Chertsey community sports since the late 1800s. Rugby union was first played in the late 1880s. This continued up until World War 1.

The Newlands School house, opened near Rangiora in 1880, was moved to Fairton in 1901. The school moved to a new location donated by a local business in 1968. Marae Hakatere Marae has occupied the original Fairton School building on State Highway 1 since 1970, two years after the school left the site. It held Waitangi Day events from 1973, and incorporated a hangi into the annual holiday from 1974. The land was officially purchased by the Mid Canterbury Māori Committee in 1975. The marae is named after the nearby Ashburton River. The original school house and wharenui (meeting house) was destroyed by fire in 2003. A new $300,000 wharekai (dining hall) was completed in 2007, the entranceway was widened in 2008, and a new multi-use conference building was completed in 2009. The Ministry of Health granted the marae $10,000 a year from 2009 to 2012 to develop a community marae garden on a half acre of land.

The organization was founded on 5 January 2009 by nationalists in Sarajevo. The movement acts in the entirety of Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina through branches in the cities where they exist. Goals and the program # Bosniaks' Bosnia – only people belonging to European genetic and cultural heritage, Bosniaks included, can be the citizens of Bosnia. # Bosnia must be ruled by Bosniaks – Bosniaks must not be subordinated to other constitutive peoples in Bosnia, and that will be reached by preventing non-Bosniaks of being on ruling positions. # Bosnia must be ruled for the better well-being of Bosniaks – all political decisions must be based on what is the best for Bosniaks. All decisions that will make damage to Bosniaks must not be reached. # Unique purpose – State's organization must be led by one modern policy that goes in benefit of Bosniaks as much as possible. The policy must be built on competence and responsibility, and its homework is to serve the population, not conversely. The system must maintain the motto: improvement, development and welfare of the entire nation. # Total independence of the country – Cooperations in some fields are desirable with other countries, but any contract that would damage the independence of Bosnia even slightly is out of the question. # Safe, secular state – Safety, individual and economic, must be one of the social basis. The state must be secular, so religion must be separated from the state, must be subordinated to the laws, reduce its influence in the public life, and prevent mixing state's authorities with religion. # Freedom of speech and opinions – All questions must be free for discussions, science must be free, restriction of personal integrity through the state's control for persons that are not criminals must not exist. # Natural resources in the hands of Bosniaks – Important natural resources under control of the Bosniaks, so that all profit can go back to the population, and not abroad and to private interests. # National board and social justice – The dividing of classes must be replaced with class community where creativity and productive contribution are respected and no group of society can advance at the expense of the other one. # Strict protection of animals and nature – Bosnia has a valuable and unique nature that must be kept safe and defended. Every way of destruction of the environment, as well as killing of the animals must be strictly prohibited. Food industry and other industries where animals are kept and used must be ethically sustainable. Symbols The logo of the movement resembles the coat of arms of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina with some additions like the sword in the middle of the logo. They refer themselves also sometimes as the \\"National Front\\" which is basically a common used name for the movement. Attitudes # BPNP advocates the establishment of a Bosniak national secular state in accordance with European practice where every nation is entitled to its own state. This right is, after all, confirmed with history of Bosnia and Bosniaks, which is over 1 000 years old. Accordingly, Bosnia is primarily a Bosniak state but it also belongs to all loyal citizens. # Every loyal citizen of Bosnia, regardless of his religious affiliation, is a member of a Bosniak nation. Accordingly, the movement totally rejects connection of Bosniaks with just one religious identity which was proven to be harmful for the national development and dignity. # The symbol of Bosnia is coat of arms with six golden lilies of King Tvrtko I of Bosnia. That is also a symbol of Bosnian resistance to the Serbian aggression in the War of Independence (1992–1995). Any attempt of humiliation or degradation of the sacred emblem is a direct attack on national integrity of Bosnia and on the national pride. # The movement limits its activity inside the borders of Bosnia determined by Treaty of Karlowitz in 1699, and Congress of Berlin in 1878. # The Bosnian language, as the national language, should and must be the only official language in Bosnia. # Most properties in Bosnia should be in the hands of Bosniaks, as it is the only way to secure establishment of an economically strong nation. Bosnia belongs to Bosniaks in every sense: economic and national. Working class, as a base for prosperity, must have dignified life and it must be protected from exploitation. # The name Bosnia \\"and Herzegovina\\" is not acceptable. Herzegovina never was a separate state or it was in the same level with Bosnia. Herzegovina has always been a part of Bosnia and we, as nationalists, are refusing to follow policy of national destruction of Bosnia and Bosniaks. # We are against alliances and unions whose purpose is establishment and protection of the new world order (EU as continental union and NATO as a global army). Bosnia must be a free nation with its own army which is always ready to defend country's sovereignty. That opposes globalisation policy which is being forced by Zionist structures with just one purpose - creation of one world government which will allow the \\"gray eminence\\" to rule the world. # We refuse the praxis of celebrating the official Day of Statehood, November 25, because it originates from the policy of dividing Bosnia into three quasi-ethnic groups (Serbs, Croats and Muslims). Day of Statehood that we promote is 29 August - the date of issuing the Charter of Ban Kulin, that is also the oldest state's document and the oldest written document among Slavic-speaking countries. # Ideologies that are not welcome in Bosnia are: Zionism, Islamism, Communism and Capitalism. The only ideology good for us is Bosnian nationalism because it secures national prosperity and social justice. # A healthy nation can not exist without healthy families. With that in mind our struggle is partly focused on destroying every aspect of society which threatens family values with immoral actions. We are strongly opposed to the media that offer promiscuous behavior like homosexuality to the youth.

Rap music The archetype of the \\"independent woman\\" is particularly emphasized today in the hip- hop genre in which male and female rappers discuss it frequently. Moody, Professor of Journalism at Baylor University described the \\"independent black woman\\" phenomenon in two 2011 articles titled \\"A rhetorical analysis of the meaning of the 'independent woman'\\"Moody, M. \\"A rhetorical analysis of the meaning of the “independent woman'\\". American Communication Journal. Spring 2011. and \\"The meaning of 'Independent Woman' in music\\".Moody, Mia. The meaning of \\"Independent Woman\\" in Music\\". April 2011. The articles indicated that the lyrics and videos of male and female rappers portrayed \\"independent women\\" differently. Using the concept of intersectionality, Moody's rhetorical analysis combined feminist and critical cultural theories to explore the meanings of the 'independent woman' in the lyrics and respective videos of male and female rappers. She concluded that songs by various artists, corresponding music videos, and viewer comments contained four main messages: wealth equals independence, beauty and independence are connected, average men deserve perfect women, and sexual prowess equals independence. Male rappers were more likely to include messages of beautiful, overachieving women paired with average men, while female rappers focus on their own sexual prowess. Other perspectives * Presenting a different viewpoint, Darryl James, a blogger and author of “Bridging The Black Gender Gap,” asserts that the phrase “independent woman” has gone excessively far and its meaning is inconsistent and in many ways “cartoonish, mannish and just plain unattractive.” He adds that in the quest for so-called “independence,” some women have given up substantial portions of their womanhood, which has been detrimental to fostering meaningful relationships in the black community.James, Darrell. \\"Black in LA\\".

The station replaced a previous wooden structure at the same site on the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway line, originally the California Southern Railroad. History The station was built by J.W. Nance, a Perris developer, and was designed by Benjamin Franklin Levet, Sr., son-in-law to Fred T. Perris. The depot served both passenger traffic and the considerable agricultural traffic associated with the farmlands of the Perris Valley. However, passenger traffic declined and ended in 1947. Agriculture declined due to limited water supplies and salinization, and farms were replaced with suburbs. All but one track in the station yard was abandoned in 1975. From 1974 the depot has been used by the Perris Valley Historical and Museum Association as a museum of local history. In the 1990s the depot was proposed as a commuter rail station. Description The red brick depot is in the Queen Anne style, with a conical-roofed turret, round windows and an arched entry. The depot is a one-story structure, generally rectangular in plan, with a raised central mass at right angles to the plan with flanking wings. The central mass features an arched entry on one side and a projecting round bay with a cupola opposite. The brick gables are partly hipped, with prominent \\"PERRIS\\" signs on each. A comb-like finial decorates the ridge of the central roof mass and wings, with \\"SANTA FE\\" signs facing either platform. Present use The Perris Depot is used by the Orange Empire Railway Museum as a terminus for its excursion train line. The depot was renovated in 2007-2008. The building is now home to the Perris Valley Historical Museum. The Perris Multimodal Transit Center was opened in 2010 adjacent to the depot, with bus and Metrolink train service. The Metrolink line extension through Perris was completed in June 2016 and stops at the adjacent Downtown Perris station. The museum continues to operate in the depot. The depot was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1994.

Al-Noor printers and publications, Lahore. He was also one of the 8 members of Special Pakistan conference whose soul purpose was to educate the Muslims living in the villages. He was also a member of the Pakistan Rural Propaganda Committee. This committee played a major role in establishing new branches of Muslim League in the Punjab and was among the leading parties in the rebellion against \\"Khizar Wazarat\\" in Punjab. During his visit to Rohtak, Siddiqi officially started the propaganda. During the same month, Jinnah requested Punjab's Chief Minister Sir Sikandar Hayat and other employees of Muslim League to resign from the Viceroy's National Defense Council for which the Pakistan Rural Propaganda Committee made major arrangements for the rally. This rally continued till the resignation of Sir Sikandar Hayat.

Chemically, it is a derivative of serotonin in which a methyl group resides at its alkyl amine. It is also called Nω-methylserotonin (Nω-methyl-5-hydroxytryptamine) to distinguish it from tryptamine-derived compounds in which a methyl group is bonded to the nitrogen atom of the indole group. N-Methylserotonin is found in plants, animals, and fungi. These include the plants, Actaea racemosa (black cohosh) and Zanthoxylum piperitum, the Green and Golden Bell Frog, Litoria aurea, and Amanita mushrooms. The compound binds to several serotonin receptors, including the 5-HT7 and 5-HT1A receptors, with high affinity (IC50 ≤ 2 nM) and selectivity, and displays agonist activity; besides its direct interaction with the serotonin receptors, N-methylserotonin also acts as a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor. Legal Status =United States= N-Methylserotonin is not scheduled at the federal level in the United States,§1308.11 Schedule I. but could be considered an analog (of bufotenin), in which case, sales or possession intended for human consumption could be prosecuted under the Federal Analog Act.

Little is known about her from official North Korean sources but outside sources have speculated more about her background. She has appeared numerous times in public with her husband. In April 2018, her title was elevated in state media from merely \\"comrade\\" to \\"respected first lady\\", considered a significant honor and the first time the title has been used since 1974. Biography North Korean leader Kim Jong-un and his family have been characterized as \\"secretive\\". Very little information about Ri Sol-ju has appeared in official North Korean sources, but more speculative information has been reported in foreign media.Ri Sol-ju had 'past' 13 February 2014 17:32 =Early life= Very little is known for certain about Ri's origin; some analysts have even said her name \\"almost certainly is a pseudonym\\". Her reported year of birth has ranged between 1985 and 1989. Ri's family is reportedly from the political elite; her mother is the head of a gynecology ward and her father is a professor. She is said to have graduated from Geumsung 2 Middle School in Pyongyang and studied abroad in China majoring in vocal music. She is said to be related to Ri Pyong-chol, a former air force general and close advisor of Kim Jong-un. JoongAng Ilbo and some commentators have identified Ri as a singer in the Unhasu Orchestra that has made several overseas performances. Reportedly, North Korean officials are \\"trying to erase her past as a singer and entertainer by confiscating popular bootleg CDs of her performances\\", such as her singing the song \\"Sobaeksu\\". She is reportedly a graduate student at Kim Il-sung University, pursuing a PhD in science. Ri reportedly visited South Korea in 2005, as a member of the North Korean cheerleading team during the Asian Athletics Championships. She was said to be among 90 cheerleaders who chanted \\"We are one!\\" Ri reportedly told a South Korean teacher while on the trip: \\"We want to take classes from the South's teachers after being reunited as soon as possible.\\" =Marriage= The BBC, quoting an analyst who spoke to The Korea Times of South Korea, reported that Kim's father, Kim Jong-il, had hastily arranged his son's marriage after suffering a stroke in 2008. The two were reportedly married in 2009. Ri possibly gave birth to a child in 2010; sources have reported it is a boy. In December 2012, it was reported that Ri was visibly pregnant, although North Korean officials did not comment. In March 2013, former NBA basketball player Dennis Rodman visited Kim Jong-un in North Korea and on his return told the British tabloid newspaper The Sun that Ri had given birth to a healthy daughter. Rodman told The Guardian in September 2013 that the couple's child, a girl, is named ().\\"Dennis Rodman's slip gives away name of North Korean leader's baby\\" , The Guardian. He said that Jong-un had \\"a beautiful family\\" and was a \\"good dad.\\" =First Lady of North Korea= In 2012, Ri made several public appearances standing next to Kim Jong-un, causing speculation about who she might be. South Korean intelligence officials wrongly identified her as Hyon Song-wol, a former singer for the Pochonbo Electronic Ensemble, a musical group popular in North Korea. However, on 25 July 2012, North Korean state media announced that she was actually Kim's wife, saying she was \\"his wife, Comrade Ri Sol-ju\\". The announcement of the marriage marked a change from Kim's father Kim Jong-il, who had never introduced his wives to the public. In July 2012, at an elite gala concert in North Korea, Ri was stylishly \\"dressed in a trim black suit in the Chanel tradition\\", considered unusual for North Korean women. Along with other recent changes, such as the firing of a hard-line top general, Kim Jong- un's marriage is seen by analysts as \\"a continuation of what is either a policy change, or a propaganda offensive, or both\\". In September 2012, Kenji Fujimoto, the former personal sushi chef of Kim Jong-il, said he met Ri on a recent trip to North Korea. He described her as \\"just so charming... I cannot describe her voice, it's so soft...\\" As a parting gift, Ri gave Fujimoto a Christian Dior handbag, which Ri was earlier reported to have been carrying. From 2012 to 2014, Ri appeared occasionally in the North Korean media, accompanying her husband to events, but subsequently she was rarely seen. She had long periods out of the public view in 2015, 2016, and 2017. South Korean intelligence officials reported that Ri gave birth to a third child of unknown gender in February 2017. In 2018, Ri took on a diplomatic role. In March 2018, she visited China with her husband, meeting China's paramount leader Xi Jinping and his wife Peng Liyuan.China Central Television channel 13, in Shenyang In April 2018, ahead of the April 2018 inter-Korean summit, Ri's title was elevated to \\"respected First Lady\\" (instead of just \\"comrade\\"), the first time since 1974 the title had been used in North Korea, when it was used about Kim Il-sung's second wife, Kim Song-ae. The change in title was inaugurated in a news report read by star anchorwoman Ri Chun-hee, who often makes major announcements. Ri attended the summit, the first wife of a North Korean leader to do so, and met the First Lady of South Korea, Kim Jung-sook, for the first time. The two first ladies were observed as being close to each other during their meetings that year. Ri also helped to host the visit of China's paramount leader Xi Jinping and his wife Peng Liyuan to North Korea in June 2019.

In church law they are established as a Lay Association of the Faithful under the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Boston.  History  = Founding = In 1994, six members of the Franciscan Friars of the Renewal in New York (Pio Mandato, David Engo, Francis Kelly, John Sweeney, Peter Giroux, Patrick Magee) sought to found a new community under the name of Capuchin Recollects in order to pursue an authentic observance of the life and rule of St. Francis. They reached out to the bishop of Fall River, Massachusetts, the Capuchin Franciscan friar Seán Patrick O'Malley, for support. O'Malley agreed to host the new group, and assisted them in writing their rule and constitutions. On April 21, 1995, the six founders professed perpetual vows before Bishop O'Malley and established their friary in New Bedford, Massachusetts. = Later developments = Subsequent houses of the community were opened in Stamford, Vermont (a novitiate); Emmitsburg, Maryland; and Nicaragua. In the early 2000s the community changed its name to the \\"Franciscans of Primitive Observance\\". After O'Malley was appointed to the Archdiocese of Boston in 2003, the FPOs requested to be incardinated in the Archdiocese; with the Archbishop's agreement, the friars relocated to Lawrence, Massachusetts, closing the friary in New Bedford. Between 2010 and 2012 the community relocated to East Boston and then to the Roxbury neighborhood of Boston. The membership of the friars has fluctuated over time, peaking at about fifteen brothers including novices and postulants.  Form of Life  The Franciscans of Primitive Observance live a strict observance of the Rule of St. Francis. Practical aspects of their daily life reflect their spiritual themes: * Poverty: They do not carry money, and rely on the donations of individuals to pay for their needs. FPO brothers called \\"questors\\" seek food door-to-door in the neighborhoods in which they live. * Consecration to the Virgin Mary * Minority (littleness) * Fraternity * Manual labor: In their houses they avoid using modern appliances (televisions, radios, refrigerators, washing machines). * Penance * Fidelity to the Pope and his authoritative teaching * Joy The FPOs live a mixed contemplative and active life, spending considerable time in prayer each day in the chapel, as well as time in the community.  Women's community  Along with the founding of the friars' community out of the Franciscan Friars of the Renewal, six women left the corresponding women's community, the Franciscan Sisters of the Renewal, in 1994, to form the Capuchin Recollect Sisters in New Bedford, Massachusetts. In 1998, they changed their community's name to Capuchin Sisters of Nazareth. After 2003 they moved to Tunkhannock, Pennsylvania in the Diocese of Scranton.

According to art historian Daphne Foskett, author of A Dictionary of British Miniature Painters (1972), Field was \\"one of the best American miniaturists of his time.\\" During Field's time in Nova Scotia at the beginning of the nineteenth century, he was the most professionally trained painter in present-day Canada. He worked in the conventional neo-classic portrait style of Henry Raeburn and Gilbert Stuart. His most famous works are two groups of miniatures of George Washington, commissioned by his wife Martha Washington. (Field's miniatures of both are in the Yale University Art Gallery permanent collection.)  America  He received his early training at the Royal Academy schools, London, in 1790. In 1794 he moved to the United States. He took up residence in the nation's then- capital, Philadelphia, Pa. There he immediately joined a group of artists led by Charles Willson Peale in establishing the Columbianum, or American Academy of the Fine Arts, which was eventually superseded by the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts in 1805. Field spent 14 years in the United States, working as a miniature painter in Baltimore, Philadelphia, Washington, and Boston; during this period he produced miniatures of George and Martha Washington, Thomas Jefferson, and a wide range of people prominent in the social, economic, and political life of American society. According to historian Harry Piers, Field was one of the four most highly sought American miniaturists in his time. Martha Washington herself commissioned Field in 1800 to paint a group of miniature as mementoes for friends and family, to commemorate the revered General and President on the one-year anniversary of his death. Two groups of miniatures of George Washington were produced by Field at Martha's request in late 1800, the first group showing him in civilian dress, the second as general in full uniform.Piers, Harry, Robert Field: Portrait Painter in Oils, Miniature and Water-Colours and Engraver, New York, 1927.  Nova Scotia  When tensions between America and England started to rise in the lead up to the War of 1812, Field remained a loyalist and moved from Boston to Halifax, Nova Scotia (1808).

Jamaica  In 1816 he moved to Jamaica, settling first in Montego Bay and then in Kingston.

An agro-town also lacks the administrative, commercial and industrial functions that are usually common in the centers of such size. This type of agglomeration is particularly present around the Mediterranean Sea, in West Africa, and in the Americas. Structure The population of agro-towns are commonly very poor; most workers do not own the land and are employed seasonally as wage labour. This also explains why these populations are often very fluctuant, with a large immigration during harvest and a significant emigration during the low season or in case of crises. The concentration of the land in the hands of a small elite of often absentee landlords commonly leads to tensions within the towns, leading in the 20th century to a prevalence of the communist vote in many agro-towns in Mediterranean Europe. Large landlords are typically absent and leave the management of their estates to agents who seldom lives in the town but rather in large and prosperous farmhouses in the countryside (known as masia). On the other hand, landless wage labourers often travel large distances to reach the location of their employer. Despite the relative abundance of labour, the surrounding exploitations tend to concentrate in non-labour-intensive cultures due to the supervision issue that arises with large labour forces. Consequently latifundia tend to specialize in capital-intensive cash crops, which often require the edification of large specialized buildings such as windmills or oil presses. The center of Eboli Environmental causes Such a peculiar and somewhat counter-intuitive type of agglomeration has led to a lot of speculation regarding their origin. Among the main theories regarding their emergence, the most common are related to their environment. Agro-towns being prevalent in warm environments, it's been pointed out that they tended to emerge where water was rare and the population had to cluster around a well. Another factor that is commonly mentioned to explain the rise of agro-towns is the higher salubrity of the site of the agglomeration. The prevalence of malaria in wetlands implied that it was healthier to live in higher ground, which may have led to a concentration of the population on some hills. Incidentally, higher ground and concentrated habitat also provide good defensive positions, which may have played a role in regions where marauders and pirates were a threat to isolated farms. Economic causes In some regions agro-towns were close to broader habitats and that consequently environmental causes could not alone explain the emergence of agro-towns; instead there was a historical evolution which led to the concentration of the population into a few urban centers. In this view, small farmers were gradually driven off their land by larger landowners and had to seek refuge in towns, where they became wage labourers for those same large landowners. This process would explain why agro-towns are mostly in regions dominated by latifundia and the high level of tension between the town residents and the landlords. As the most fertile lands are the most likely to attract large investors, agro-towns may be seen as a version of the resource curse, as more productive lands lead to a high level of misery among the population.

Written by Joseph Abbeel, 1805-1815. Joseph Abbeel (1786 in Vrasene – 1866 in Anzegem) was a Belgian soldier who was conscripted to the French Army of Napoleon Bonaparte. In the position of a carabinier he witnessed the French Invasion of Russia in 1812. He is one of the few who survived the devastating horror of the raid on Moscow and the chaotic retreat that followed it. He was wounded at the Battle of Borodino. He saw Moscow burn, followed the retreating French Army, but was captured by Cossacks in the vicinity of Hamburg. It was only in 1815 that he came home. He never married. It is assumed that he became a school teacher. He wrote down his memoirs almost immediately, but never published them. They were rediscovered and edited two centuries later. This, together with Jakob Walter's diary, form the only known records of that campaign kept by common soldiers. Abbeel's story contains some minor historical mistakes, mostly due to his lack of geographical knowledge, but the authenticity of the manuscript is undisputed.

The students of FH Aachen develop the satellite BUS system with the necessary subsystems for power generation, power distribution, data handling and data / power interfaces for the payload. RWTH Aachen students are responsible for the communication hardware on board the satellite.  Objective  The objective of COMPASS-2 is to achieve the following goal: Development and Construction of a universal experimental technology platform as a Triple-CubeSat to consolidate an international standard. To accomplish this goal, the satellite BUS-system will be designed for two universal payloads. The design of the satellite subsystems includes the lessons-learned from the COMPASS-1 system with a higher reliability and efficiency. The idea is to build a universal BUS-system for further space applications and small experiments. Two cubes will carry the payload. The interfaces to the Experiments will be defined in a universal way so that the experiments, which are implemented in the payload cubes, get their own power and data interface. The target orbit is estimated to a low Earth orbit with a medium altitude to have a faster disposal after the mission time.  STR – structure  The structure of COMPASS-2 is based on the requirements of the CubeSat standard. It is the mounting structure for all components of the satellite. The mounting system is the interface for the PCBs of each system, the battery and solar panels as well as for the payload. COMPASS-2 will become a nano satellite with a size of 100mm x 100mm x 340.5mm. The mass may not exceed 4 kg. The structure is made of lightweight aluminum. The universal design of the COMPASS-2 system also allows to design a smaller version of it in a Double-Cube-Sat version. The dimensions of 100mm x 100mm x 227mm allow a maximum mass of 2.66 kg.  EPS – electrical power system  The functions of the power system are to generate and store electric power for usage by the other spacecraft subsystems. The subsystems can have various specific requirements for voltage, frequency, stability, noise limits or others. These characteristics have to be considered on supplying the different subsystems. It is also a part of the power system to set the operating mode to prevent an early end of mission caused by lack of energy. To maintain the long-term reliability of the system, the power system provides protection to other subsystems against malfunction. = Power source / solar cells = As power source, COMPASS-2 has about 30 solar cells on the surface (depending on the final configuration). Three areas will contain eight solar cells and the fourth area will contain six solar cells. The solar cells have an efficiency of 30.5%. Equipped with these solar cells, the satellite will generate an average power output of 5.1 Watt (flying vertically - Nadir) and 3.5 Watt (flying astronomical horizontally) in sun synchronous orbit. = Power storage / batteries = For COMPASS-2 the newest battery technology will be used. Two Nanophosphate High Power Lithium Ion Cells will be providing the satellite with power in night or high power demand phases. The satellite will have an alternating charging system to reduce the charging cycles for each battery. Due to the fact that the batteries are not space-proved, one tasks of the power system team is to test the batteries under space conditions. = Power distribution and control = One of the tasks for EPS is to control and distribute the available power. The system will set the satellite in three different modes: *Nominal Mode *Power Save Mode *Emergency Mode Also it is necessary that the ground station can control the different modes and settings.  COM – communication  The communications system will provide reliable data connection between ground station and the satellite. The main objective is downloading data and uploading commands and firmware. In comparison to COMPASS-1, this mission will have a focus on channel coding and adaptive modulation in order to improve the amount of data transferred during each flyover. This also includes smart software at the ground station for signal processing. On the classic VHF-UHF-Bands we implemented new modulation methods to provide a higher data rate while staying compatible to default ham radio equipment. Besides there will be a S-Band down-link giving a down-link speed of about 500 kbit/s. = Modulation methods = Due to the system design, the modulation signal can be created by the COM micro controller. This gives the chance to do the entire modulation signal processing inside the software. Just one transmitter is needed for all transmission types. The software defines which one is used at which moment. The base band waveforms are calculated inside the software and fed into a digital-analog converter. Here the digital waveforms are converted into voltages. A well-dimensioned anti-aliasing filter is used to create a high-quality modulation signal. Depending on the actual demands and link quality, modulation is adaptively and automatically changed by handshaking with the operating ground station. As an experimental addition, hierarchic modulation is used to allow two or more different data rates at same time. As the COMPASS-2 group is expecting support and help from amateur radio enthusiasts all over the world, the transmission modulation must be compatible to standard amateur radio operators receiving equipment. This means non-coherent receiving with channel width of maximum 6 kHz. Thus, all phase concerning modulations are a no-go. The ground station software will include the possibility for channel equalization, paying attention to the non-linear frequency response of amateur radio receivers. As an experiment hierarchic modulation using FSK will be used to allow different data speeds at the same time using complex channel coding. The higher data rate needs high link quantity to be decoded properly. The lower one is receivable with high noise impact. As is it planned to use a PC system with a sound-card connected to the radios, all signal decoding and processing can be done inside of the PC software. This makes the system flexible and low cost comparing to hardware decoders like Terminal Node Controllers. The CPU power of a standard home PC is enough to do all the encoding calculations. = Frequencies and antenna configuration = Referring to the design of COMPASS-1, the design of COMPASS-2 will be very close to the old one, but with improvements and extensions. We will use just one transmit frequency. Due to the arbitrary modulation system, it's just the onboard software that defines the service. The uplink will be in the 2m amateur radio band (145 MHz - referring to the 2 m band plan) receiving FM modulated data packets and DTMF commands as a backup. The down-link will be on the 70 cm amateur radio band (437 MHz - referring to the 70 cm band plan). On the down-link data frequency we will be able to send packet data, SSTV still picture images, Morse code and maybe some short voice messages. The Morse code transmission is elementary necessary for receiving the status directly after the deployment out of the launch pod, recovering the satellite and long time health measurement of the satellite. Nearly every radio amateur is familiar to Morse code, so it is possible to get telemetry from every part of the world. = Ground station = The satellite will be operated by the ground station at the FH Aachen University of Applied Sciences. The radio station contains an ICOM IC-910H, an IC-821H and two PCs. The IC-910H is used for sending on the 2m band with 100 Watts and receiving packet data in the 70 cm band. The bandwidth is 6 kHz. The antenna set consists of four cross-Yagi antennas with a +20 dB preamplifier for UHF (70 cm receiving) and two cross-Yagi antennas for VHF (2m sending), both right turning polarized, controlled via an Egis Rotor with full horizontal coverage. The azimuth is able to drive 450° and the elevator can rotate up to 90°. For tracking the satellite and for the antenna rotor control the station uses SATPC32, which also adjusts the radios frequency to compensate the Doppler shift. For a correct tracking and Doppler shift correction it is necessary to update the Kepler elements weekly from Celestrak, a free of charge service for tracking satellites in space. The structure of the software will be modular giving the chance to work and improve on the components separately. Key features are: *Special FFT algorithm to detect the AFSK and n-FSK signals *Deinterleaving and adaptive soft decision decoding using up-to-date algorithms *Morse code decoding *Analysing housekeeping data *Measuring of actual bit error rate (BER) to qualify the link condition *Feedback of BER towards the satellite to adapt modulations parameters *Generation of uplink baseband signals as DTMF and 1200 baud data In addition to the ground station in Aachen, many private amateur radio stations joined us as backup stations during the mission operation of COMPASS-1. The COMPASS-2 Team also will encourage the stations to participate loading data and decoding Morse code from COMPASS-2.  CDHS – command and data-handling system  = Main tasks = The CDHS is the main board of the COMPASS-2 Satellite. It is responsible for managing all general and system data. It is also responsible for forwarding commands from the ground station to the subsystems and when requested sending internally generated data back to Earth. = Redundancy = Firmware update: To allow further improvements after the launch of the satellite, it is wise to allow reprogramming the main controllers of the subsystems. Multiple firmware storage modules are implemented in the design. For more security in worst-case scenario, the default firmware, which is stored previously on the satellite, will be recalled and the controllers of the satellite will be programmed as prior to launch. = Data recovery = In case of a total loss of the command an data handling system, routines implemented on the COM system will allow a direct access to the stored data. This will be used to recover the generated data until subsystem loss, allowing access to HK data for failure analysis or even download science data. = Storage media = Out of many storage medium technologies the CDHS picks out the most suitable technology for the application it is intended to be used for: *Flash - CMOS Technology *MRAM - Magnetic RAM *EEPROM - Electronically erasable programmable ROM = System architecture = Controller Area Network - CAN: The satellite provides a CAN bus system for designated data routes. The following are the groups of data an SPI bus is designated to. Serial Bus The communication of commands between the COM and the CDHS system will occur through a serial interface. A second bus will be used for data transfer, allowing the access of both, COM and ADCS, subsystems to the storage media.  ADCS – attitude determination and control system  = Main tasks = The major objective of this subsystem is to obtain an attitude control, which fulfills the requirements of pointing, stability and agility of as many payloads as possible. Due to the size, the weightbudget, the powerbudget and the desire to use of the shelf products the main requirements can just be obtained to a certain level. Parts of the subsystem are and will be manufactured by the team. Due to the fact, that not all of the parts have been finished it is not possible to estimate and simulate the overall performance of this subsystem yet. = Environmental effects on attitude control = To develop an attitude control system it is necessary to be aware of the environmental effects acting on the satellite in a certain orbit. The following environmental effects have to be considered: *Gravity gradient *Solar pressure *Aerodynamic drag *Earth magnetic field These effects interacting with the satellite generate torques. These torques can either be used for passive or active attitude control or be regarded as disturbance torques. The estimation of the maximum acting torques is possible in a conservative analytical way. For more precise estimations and for average values a simulation of the acting torques is necessary. The more precise these values are the better an optimisation of the attitude control system is possible. =Actuators= To realize the generic concept of COMPASS-2 the ADCS team has to develop all actuators, because of the low volume budgets given by the CubeSat standards the actuators have to be miniaturized. The following actuators are developed to get implemented on the COMPASS-2 Triple-CubeSat:  Magnetorquers  COMPASS-2 will use air core coils like the previous COMPASS project as magnetorquers for the active attitude control. The reason for choosing magnetorquers as part of the attitude control system is the reliability and the simple design. Air core coils were chosen, because we are able to optimize and manufacture them ourselves. Ferrite core coils are more efficient regarding space and power consumption, but the optimization, calculation and production is much more complicated. So we decided to keep it as simple and cost efficient as possible and use air core coil magnetorquers as our prime active attitude control actuators. There will be three actuators oriented perpendicular to each other. Through this orientation attitude control is possible regardless how the satellite is oriented to the magnetic field lines. Aerodynamic-drag stabilization A further passive actuating torque will be created by the aerodynamic drag in the low Earth orbit and may lead to a helpful stabilization of the satellite. Aerodynamic drag and the resulting torque cannot be avoided and the team will try to get partial advantage if possible. =Sensor technology=  Digital multi- image sensors (DMIS) Digital multi-image sensors (DMIS) are digital camera–based instruments for detecting the center of the sun and calculating the angle between the sun vector and the camera's view vector on the x and y axis. Additionally, the Earth's horizon and the rotation rate of the satellite can be determined. Therefore, an attitude measurement using the Earth's horizon is possible, too. Furthermore, the sensors are able to store colored images for later transmission to Earth.  3-axis magnetometer  The magnetometer is absolutely necessary for running the magnetorquers. Further they are needed as a reference for calculating the attitude matrix with the help of the Earth’s magnetic field.  Spin-rate sensor (Gyro) The gyros are only for redundancy. These sensors deliver a reference to the calculated tumbling frequency calculated by the DSS and the magnetometer. These sensors determine compared to the DSS and the magnetometer the attitude inertial and not by using a reference. The gyros make use of a micro-electro-mechanical system which determines the actual attitude with the help of the Coriolis force produced by a rotating body.  TCS – thermal-control system  Due to the small amount of dissipating heat and the wide operating temperature range of the (LiFePo4) accumulator (-30 °C till +60 °C), the TCS will be a passive regulated system with the advantage of energy saving while keeping the satellite and its subsystems within the allowable temperature limits. The limits are normally -40 °C till +125 °C for commercial off-the-shelf products, but some parts of the COM-subsystem are more temperature sensitive and should not exceed +85 °C. The problem is here the high energy consumption and the involved high local (on an area of only 9mm²) dissipation. =Resource management= The temperature will not be monitored all the time but at a given period to realize low power consumption. The temperature-information search will be as intelligent as possible. This means, that if the temperature at one point of the CubeSat exceed a certain threshold a few times, the program will automatically collect more information in a shorter period to locate the reason and to ensure better research for future missions. =Main tasks= The energy from the incoming electromagnetic radiation is basically converted into heat. Thus it is the most important base for the thermal budget. Relevant for the TCS is the direct solar radiation, the reflected solar radiation from the Earth/Moon and the infrared radiation of the Earth/Moon. Therefore, it is very important to know the chronological sequence and the orbital parameters because these parameters will all be considered and processed in our thermal analysis. All influences have to be combined with the temperature range of the electrical parts in the spacecraft. Precisely because we are using commercial off-the-shelf-products, it is indispensable to hold the satellite in an \\"Earth-like\\" environment. Therefore, we are using some several insulation techniques like foils, coatings and so on to get the satellite in this marginal temperature range as well as to guarantee a good environment for micro controllers, sensors and the payload. =Methods and techniques= We combine some ways of setting up the temperature: *The first thing is, to put sensors that are sensitive to temperature fluctuations nearby the middle of the CubeSat where the temperature variability is not as high as in the outer regions. This is a very simple way of getting each part in its desired temperature range but mathematically, it is very difficult to calculate. The problem is to get an overview of all parts in use and the information of their electrical energy consumption and in addition the nearby parts and their energy consumption, and above all, the area of the part for radiation and conduction to the board. A close collaboration with the CDHS is very essentially. *The second way is to study the influence of coatings for the thermal control system. For instance, if the spacecraft is painted in white, it will reflect a lot of the radiation and moreover, it is not able to collect the energy from the sun. This implies that it is getting colder in the satellite, perhaps even too cold. Alternatively, a black painted structure might overheat the satellite. The structure of the spacecraft is very small- sized with a small surface that is mostly covered by the solar cells. The effectiveness of this method has to be tested. *The third thing is to use multi layer insulation (MLI). These are foils composed of multiple layers of thin sheets. It is mainly intended to reduce heat loss by thermal radiation. With MLI we have the ability to control the thermal flux. By increasing or decreasing the number of layers as well as the thickness of the separating foil, on the one hand we can choose whether to let more or less energy to the middle cube. On the other hand, MLI also isolates the cube from the space which means that the cube could overheat due to the dissipation from the inner parts. Active heat pipes are able to solve this problem but raise another: a lot more energy consumption and more weight. To find the perfect cooperation we had to do some thermal analysis with Sinda, a thermal analysis program.  Payload  In the following, the requirements for one experiment box are listed. Given these “hard facts”, any payload provider will be able to build its payload without any much communication with the COMPASS-2 Team to adapt the payload to the BUS cube: *dimensions: 88mm x 73.00mm x 88.00mm *maximum mass: 1.000 kg *center of mass: sphere of 20mm diameter around the volumetric center *supply voltage: 3.3V and 5.0V the overall energy needed for each payload can be scheduled between the customers via FH Aachen. data transfer protocol: CAN I2C max data rate: amount of data rate can be scheduled between the customers via the FH Aachen = Testing = Testing must be performed to achieve all launch provider requirements as well as any additional testing requirements deemed necessary to ensure the safety of the CubeSats and the P-POD. All flight hardware will undergo qualification and acceptance testing. The P-PODs will be tested in a similar manner to ensure the safety and feasibility before the CubeSats will be integrated. All CubeSats have to pass the following tests: Vibration test Vibration tests serve the simulation of dynamic mechanical loads. This is tested with oscillations in the frequency response range of 1 to 2000 Hz. *Transients or resonances in the low-frequency response range (1 to 100 Hz) *Random in the high-frequency response range (20 to 2000 Hz) The goals of vibration tests are: *Proof of the durability against the dynamic loads *Verification of the flawless function of each system For the vibration test, the satellite is housed in a test POD which is mounted to a shaker table. The vibration loads are measured immediately by acceleration sensors, which are mounted on several points on the test POD. To improve the measured values, several sensors are monitoring the vibration behavior. All these values are computed to an average value for further analyses. The vibration load tests are performed through the three main axes. Solar-simulation test The solar intensity in low Earth orbit is about 1368 W/m². With the sun simulator, the effects from the high solar radiation flux onto the spacecraft are tested. The sun-simulator is using a xenon lamp to simulate the solar radiation. The spectrum of this lamp is - except of a spectral peak, caused by the properties of xenon - very similar to the natural sunlight. Thermal-vacuum test During this test, the satellite is put into a high-vacuum chamber for several temperature cycles and the thermal behavior of the satellite is tested. All tests will be executed at the FH Aachen.

History Ecovative is developed from a university project of founders Eben Bayer and Gavin McIntyre. In their Inventor's Studio course at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute taught by Burt Swersey, Eben and Gavin developed and then patented a method of growing a mushroom-based insulation, initially called Greensulate before founding Ecovative Design in 2007. In 2007 they were awarded $16,000 from the National Collegiate Inventors and Innovators Alliance. Since 2008, when they were awarded $700,000 first place in the Picnic Green Challenge the company has developed and commercialized production of a protective packaging called EcoCradle that is now used by Dell, Puma SE, and Steelcase. In 2010 they were awarded $180,000 from the National Science Foundation and in 2011 the company received investment from 3M New Ventures, The DOEN Foundation, and Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute allowing them to double their current staff of 25. In spring 2012, Ecovative Design opened a new production facility and announced a partnership with Sealed Air to expand production of the packaging materials. In 2014 their material was used in a brick form in 'Hy-Fi', a tower displayed in New York by the Museum of Modern Art and they started selling 'grow-it- yourself' kits. Mushroom materials A thermal insulation panel ready for installation, 'Mushroom materials' are a novel class of renewable biomaterial grown from fungal mycelium and low-value non-food agricultural materials using a patented process developed by Ecovative Design. After being left to grow in a former in a dark place for about five days during which time the fungal mycelial network binds the mixture, the resulting light robust organic compostable material can be used within many products, including building materials, thermal insulation panels and protective packaging. The process uses an agricultural waste product such as cotton hulls, cleaning the material, heating it up, inoculating it to create growth of the fungal mycelium, growing the material for period of about five days, and finally heating it to make the fungus inert. During growth, the material's shape can be molded into various products including protective packaging, building products, apparel, car bumpers, or surfboards. The environmental footprint of the products is minimized through the use of agricultural waste, reliance on natural and non-controlled growth environments, and home compostable final products. The founders intention is that this technology should replace polystyrene and other petroleum-based products that take many years to decompose, or never do so. =Protective packaging= A renewable and compostable replacement for polystyrene packaging, that is also referred to as 'EcoCradle. =Structural biocomposites= A natural and renewable replacement for engineered wood, formed from compressed mushroom material and requiring no numerical control. Architect David Benjamin of The Living, working with Evovative Design and Arup, built 'Hy-Fi', a temporary external exhibit at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City in 2014. =Thermal insulation= An insulation product is under development. Trials of 'Greensulate', a former product, were conducted at a Vermont school gym in May 2009. The product was later dropped when the company switched focus to the manufacture of protective packaging. =Other uses= Ecovative offer a 'Grow-it-yourself' kit allowing people to create mushroom materials themselves, used to create products including lamp shades. Working with the University of Aachen, Dutch designer Eric Klarenbeek's used 3D printing technology to gown a chair without using plastic, metal or wood. Media Popular Science featured the composite insulation in its 2009 Invention Awards. Season 6, Episode 8 (25:20) of CSI: New York, also featured the insulation as lab technicians tested the materials' flame resistant properties after finding particles on a victim's clothing. Packaging World magazine featured Ecovative on its July 2011 cover, suggesting that the company is poised to \\"be a game changer in various industries.\\" The World Economic Forum also recognized Ecovative as a Technology Pioneer in 2011.

In 1972, Chuck Wagner started Caymus Vineyards with his parents, Charlie and Lorna, with a bold plan and an uncharted future. They were a family of farmers with deep roots in the Napa Valley – in 1857, Chuck's great-great grandfather captained a wagon train to California from Bible Grove, Missouri. Working together for decades, Chuck and his parents established the family's work ethic, appetite for innovation, down-to-earth sensibility, and deep appreciation of the pleasures of good food and wine enjoyed with family and friends. Today, Caymus Cabernet is one of the region's most celebrated wines. Made from grapes farmed in 8 of Napa Valley's 16 appellations, it has a signature style that is dark in color, with rich fruit and ripe tannins – as approachable in youth as it is in maturity. Chuck Wagner continues to make two world-renowned Cabernet Sauvignons – Caymus Napa Valley and Caymus Special Selection. Special Selection Cabernet Sauvignon is the only wine in the world to be honored twice as Wine Spectator magazine's “Wine of the Year” for the 1984 and 1990 vintages. Charlie and Chuck Wagner were elected to Wine Spectator's “Hall of Fame” in 2001, and in 2007, Chuck received the magazine's “Distinguished Service Award,” bestowed on individuals who have made a significant and lasting contribution to the wine business. While Caymus has grown over the years, it remains in many ways a small business – decidedly not corporate and entirely family-run. Two of Chuck's children, Charlie and Jenny Wagner, now work alongside him. They all feel extremely fortunate to be spending their days in pursuit of making extraordinary wine, year after year and generation after generation. In 2018 American singer songwriter Mariah Carey referenced the Caymus brand in her single “GTFO”. Wines Caymus Vineyards produces a Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvginon, as well as its signature wine, Special Selection Cabernet Sauvignon. The family's winemaking style stems from farming techniques developed over decades, such as longer “hang time” for the fruit to create suppleness, richer color and mature tannins. The wines are abundant in textural tannins yet soft as velvet. Caymus Special Selection is the flagship wine of the Wagner family and consists of the very best barrels of the vintage. This wine is not produced in difficult years. Caymus prides itself on producing wines that are as approachable in youth as in maturity. Both of its Cabernets are produced under the winemaking hand of Chuck Wagner. In addition to the two Cabernets, the family makes Caymus-Suisun Grand Durif, along with other wines under the \\"Wagner Family of Wine\\" umbrella. These include Conundrum, Mer Soleil, Emmolo and Red Schooner. History Chuck Wagner and his children are proud to be continuing a true Napa Valley family winemaking legacy that traces back over 150 years and many generations. Chuck's parents, Lorna Belle Glos and Charlie Wagner, were both born to families that helped shape Napa Valley's wine industry in the late 1800s and beyond. Charlie Wagner and Lorna Belle Glos grew up just one mile apart in Rutherford, California. In 1934, they eloped to Reno, Nevada, and in 1941, they purchased 73 acres of land in Rutherford, where they planted fruit orchards. One of their first acts on their new land was also to plant 10 acres of wine grapes. In the 1960s, Charlie and Lorna foresaw a bleak future for the family's prune and walnut business, so they decided to pull out the crops and devote their property entirely to wine grapes - including Pinot Noir, Johannisberg Riesling and a special clone of Cabernet Sauvignon that Charlie had acquired from Stags Leap grower Nathan Fay. The Wagners sold their grapes to multiple wineries in the area and were highly regarded grape growers and home winemakers. In 1972 Chuck and his parents decided to formalize the family's long-standing tradition of winemaking. They saw an opportunity in selling the great quality “home” wines they’d been making from the grapes grown on their property. So they established their own winery and named it “Caymus Vineyards,” after a Mexican land grant owned by George Yount that had once encompassed their land. It was not long before the father-son winemaking team started producing wines that were rich in character and complexity. Their 1973 Cabernet Sauvignon really put them on the map, as it caught the attention of wine critics, earning them recognition and acclaim. In 1975, Chuck and his dad noticed that there were a few barrels that tasted better than the rest, so they decided to separate them from the batch and bottle under a new label called “Special Selection.” Wagner Family of Wine The Wagner Family of Wine is a collection of fine wines of different varieties produced from premier winegrowing regions in California and beyond. Brands include world- renowned Caymus Cabernet Sauvignon, as well as Mer Soleil Chardonnay and Pinot Noir; Emmolo Sauvignon Blanc and Merlot; Conundrum White, Red, Sparkling and Rosé, and Red Schooner. Caymus-Suisun Grand Durif is a recent addition to the family's offerings, produced out of the Suisun Valley, a little-known but exceptional farming region just a 40-minute drive southeast of Napa Valley. The Wagner family's winemaking started with Caymus Vineyards, which was created in 1972 by Chuck Wagner and his parents, Charlie and Lorna Wagner. Two of Chuck's four children, Charlie and Jenny Wagner, are now winemakers in their own right, working alongside him and carrying on the family legacy. Charlie Wagner Charlie Wagner is owner and winemaker for Mer Soleil winery in the Santa Lucia Highlands in Monterey County. Making both Chardonnay and a recently released Pinot Noir under the Mer Soleil label, he is passionate about how these wines reflect the drama and rugged beauty of the California coast. Charlie is also Director of Winemaking for Conundrum and has overseen the launch of three Conundrum wines, which now include a white, red, rosé and sparkling. His latest endeavor is Red Schooner, a Malbec made from grapes grown in the Andes Mountains, shipped chilled to Napa Valley and produced in the supple Caymus style. Named after his grandfather, Charlie Wagner Sr. – co- founder of Caymus Vineyards – Charlie has a long family history in Napa Valley dating back to 1857. Jenny Wagner As owner and winemaker for Emmolo Merlot and Sauvignon Blanc, Jenny has pursued a distinct style for these wines and embraces new techniques in both the vineyard and her winemaking. Emmolo is named for her maternal ancestors, who came to Napa from Sicily in 1923 – their land still provides most of the grapes for Emmolo. On the paternal side, her roots trace back to 1857, when her third great-grandfather captained a wagon train to Napa, beginning a long history of farming and winemaking. In 1972, Jenny's father, Chuck Wagner, founded Caymus Vineyards along with her grandparents. She feels extremely fortunate to be following in her family's footsteps and to have the opportunity to put her own mark on Emmolo wines. Chuck Wagner Chuck Wagner has spent his life in the vineyards of Rutherford, near the center of Napa Valley, steering his family's business from its earliest beginnings to the present day. Through the years, he has lived through many changes and has been recognized for his winemaking and industry leadership – but he still holds onto a deep humility as well as appreciation for great wine, family and the connections between the two. Chuck was just 19 when he joined his parents in 1972 to create Caymus Vineyards, taking them up on their proposal to sell the home wines they had been making from grapes they grew on their property. He and his father, Charlie, worked long days side by side, managing every part of the business. His mother, Lorna, took on many jobs including work on the bottling line. Lunches eaten together each day remain one of Chuck's favorite memories, a tradition he has carried on with his own home-cooked breakfasts for his kids. Both father and son believed in making wines with character, complexity and consistency. They embraced Napa's unique climate and soil, helping to establish the region's singular style and reputation for cabernet sauvignon. One of the family's most exciting moments came in 1989, when Wine Spectator awarded them the “Top Wine of the Year Award” for their 1984 Caymus Special Selection Cabernet Sauvignon. Five years later, the magazine conferred the award again for their 1990 vintage, the only time a wine has received this honor twice. For Chuck, an even greater reward has come as two of his four children are now part of the family business. Today, son Charlie and daughter Jenny work alongside him to produce a broad portfolio of wines. In addition to Caymus, these include Mer Soleil Chardonnays, Emmolo Sauvignon Blanc and Merlot, Red Schooner Malbec, and four Conundrums – a white, red, sparkling and rosé. While everyone has a unique point of view, all three Wagners share common family traits – namely, a passion for hard work and trying out new ideas, as they balance tradition with pushing the boundaries to make even better wines. They also get their hands dirty. Along with the rest of the family, Chuck can still be found in the vineyard and continues to experiment with farming techniques and other aspects of winemaking. He was honored in 2007 to be recognized with Wine Spectator's Distinguished Service Award, presented to individuals who have made significant and long-lasting contributions to the wine industry. Yet despite his business success, Chuck remains a farmer at heart. He still believes that at the end of the day, wine is meant to be shared with family and friends. And he marvels at his good fortune to be living in Napa and working in the wine business.

History The Abu Alkian tribe arrived in Negev at the end of the 19th century. Their name translates to \\"Valley people\\".The Abu Alkian (Abu al-Qi’an) Bedouin tribe background Tribe leaders made an agreement with a local El Huzayil Bedouin tribe and settled Khirbet Zubaleh in Wadi Zubaleh, northwest of where Rahat is situated today. Following the 1948 war and the establishment of the State of Israel, the tribe moved into an enclosed zone northeast of Beersheba. According to Haaretz, the tribe moved to escape a conflict with a neighboring tribe, but according to Adalah, the military governor of the Negev forced the tribe to move. In 1956, the tribe approached the military administration and was transferred to the Wadi Atir area where they received 7,000 dunams of land near the wadi. There, they settled in two villages Umm al-Hiran and Atir. Present day Houra school and a local community center In 2012, the lion's share of the Abu Alkian tribe, about 75% of 4,300 people, lived in the Bedouin town Hura (Houra).

The Bani Attiya tribe of Wadi Araba sought to exploit the lack of state authority and encroached upon the territories of the Negev Bedouin tribes, including the Beersheba plains, without the permission of Salman Ali Azzam al-Huzayl, the Tiyaha chief of the area.

In the early 1920s he became the mayor of Beersheba, his place of residence, and in 1922 became a member of the Legislative Council. The chief of the Nuseirat during this period was Sheikh Aaysh Farhan al-Msaddar, who was later succeeded by Sheikh Freih al-Msaddar in 1940. In 1946 Sheikh Freih al-Msaddar became a major figure within Jamal al- Husayni's Palestine Arab Party in the Beersheba region and the Arab Higher Committee's finance committee. In April 1948 Sheikh Freih al-Msaddar was among the notables who welcomed volunteers from the Muslim Brotherhood coming from Egypt to fight Israeli forces in Palestine. The head of the Sumeiri tribe during the Mandate period was Selim Abdullah al-Sumeiri, who was succeeded Sheikh Juma'h al-Sumeiri, while the head of al-Dawadra was Ahmad Abu Daher.

Although the elevation of the island reaches as much as 8 to 10 feet towards the center, the island perimeter consists largely of tidal flats, shoals and sandbars which are exposed at low tide and submerged during high tide. The narrow island measures approximately 2,100 feet long and 170 feet wide during high tide; length increases to roughly 2,700 feet during low tide, with some portions of the island growing up to 270 feet wide. During high tide, the northern end of the island lies approximately 700 feet from the shoreline. The distance from the mainland decreases to between 100 and 200 feet during low tide as expansive sandbars and tidal flats are exposed. The island is separated from the mainland by exceptionally shallow water during low tide, such that it can easily be accessed on foot.

Over the last several summers, the island has hosted important populations of water birds including the Least Tern, American oystercatcher, Great Egret, Glossy Ibis, Black-crowned night heron and various gull species. Ground nesting birds like terns and oystercatchers nest directly on the island's shore in the sand and rocks. Their nests are especially susceptible to disturbance by predators, domestic cats, domestic dogs, and humans. The long-legged wading birds, such as egrets and ibises, use the island's trees to nest and raise their young. The surrounding waters, mudflats and nearby marshes constitute a tremendous ecosystem for birds like these to find food, shelter and space. Since becoming a National Wildlife Refuge, Menunketesuck Island has been closed to visitors. In addition, dogs, kites and drone flights are strictly prohibited.https://www.zip06.com/Assets/iMag/HarborNews-07062017/ References Westbrook, Connecticut Coastal islands of Connecticut Landforms of Middlesex County, Connecticut ","title":"Menunketesuck Island"},{"id":"36541853","text":"Alon Tal (, born 12 July 1960) is a leading Israeli environmental activist and academic; founder of the Israel Union for Environmental Defense, and the Arava Institute for Environmental Studies; and a co-founder of Ecopeace: Friends of the Earth, Middle East; This is My Earth; the Israel Forum for Demography, Environment and Society; Aytzim: Ecological Judaism; and the Green Movement political party. Tal was appointed chair of the department of Public Policy at Tel Aviv University in 2017. Early life Tal was born on July 12, 1960, and grew up in Raleigh, North Carolina, as Albert Rosenthal. He was active in the Young Judaea youth movement, served on its national executive board, and participated in its Israel program in 1977. After graduating from the University of North Carolina in 1980, he moved to Israel and enlisted in the Israeli army. He changed his name to Alon Tal after making aliyah to Israel and becoming an Israeli citizen. He served in the Nahal paratrooper division and saw action in the 1982 First Lebanon War. After his discharge, Tal attended Hebrew University Law School in Jerusalem. During his time at law school, Tal played saxophone and fiddle in the popular Jerusalem-based rock band, Liquid Plummer. In 1983 he began work as a legal intern in Israel's Environmental Protection Service (part of the Ministry of Interior) and subsequently clerked in the office of Israel's Attorney General, Yitzhak Zamir. In 1986, Tal returned to the U.S. and enrolled in the Harvard School of Public Health, where he studied Environmental Science and Public Policy. His doctoral dissertation, which was funded by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, analyzed state strategies to control agricultural nonpoint source pollution. Environmental career Tal returned to Israel in 1989 and settled at kibbutz Ketura with his wife Robyn. In 1990, he founded the Israel Union for Environmental Defense, one of Israel's leading advocacy groups. In this capacity, he initiated successful legal action to address a range of environmental hazards (for example, illegal sewage discharges and air and water pollution), repeatedly sued the government for inadequate implementation of environmental law, and provided free legal representation to numerous local environmental organizations. In 1995, the organization filed a highly publicized – but ultimately unsuccessful – petition to the Supreme Court to prevent the building of Highway 6.Alon Tal, Pollution in a Promised Land --An Environmental History of Israel, Berkeley, California, University of California Press, 2002, 150-152. In 1996, Tal founded the Arava Institute for Environmental Studies at kibbutz Ketura, an advanced academic program that brings together Israelis, Palestinians, Jordanians and international students. In 1999, he was elected chairman of Life and Environment, the umbrella organization for Israel's environmental groups, which grew from 24 to 80 member groups during his five-year tenure. In 2001, Tal co-founded the Green Zionist Alliance: The Grassroots Campaign for a Sustainable Israel, a New York-based nonprofit that would later become Aytzim: Ecological Judaism. Since then, Tal has served as one of the Green Zionist Alliance's Israeli representatives. Between 2012 and 2015 Tal served on the international board of the Jewish National Fund (JNF), Israel's forestry and land reclamation agency, as an elected representative of the Green Zionist Alliance, in partnership with the Conservative Movement. He was appointed chair of the JNF's subcommittee for sustainability, which in 2005 drafted new policies for the organization's forestry, reservoirs and stream restoration program. In 2006, Tal was appointed chair of the Land Development Committee, which oversees the JNF's forestry and land restoration work. Advocating a new sustainable agenda for the organization, he promoted, expanded funding for sustainable afforestation, bike trails and research. In 2014 he launched an initiative to prioritize JNF financial support for environmental projects in Israel's Arab communities. In 2007, Tal and Mohammad Said Al-Hmaida, former director of the Palestinian Ministry of Environment, prepared a “shadow treaty” for a final settlement between Israel and the Palestinians, which offered an ambitious vision of cooperation and coordinated management. Tal also helped bring together 15 Israeli and 15 Palestinian water experts to consider specific areas of agreement and disagreements in regional water management, which was published in the 2010 book Water Wisdom. Tal won the Charles Bronfman Prize for young humanitarian leadership in 2006, and used the prize money to establish the Tal Fund, which supports grassroots Israeli environmental activism. Tal received Israel's Environment Ministry's lifetime achievement award as a 48-year-old, in honor of Israel's 60th anniversary in 2008. In 2015, he joined Professor Uri Shanas as one of the founders of the \\"This is My Earth - TIME\\" initiative an international effort to purchase biodiversity \\"hot spots\\" as conservation sanctuaries through crowd sourcing. Tal has remained active in a range of environmental advocacy initiatives, including preparation of proposed biodiversity protection legislation and involvement in public interest litigation. He was a plaintiff in the successful, 2014 class action suit following the massive oil spill in Israel's Ein Avrona nature reserve, that sought to cover the damage caused by negligence on the part of the Eilat Ashkelon Pipeline Company.https://www.timesofisrael.com/company-told-to-stop-operating-pipeline- following-massive-oil-spill/ In March, 2018, along with colleagues in academia and attorney Tzvi Levinson, Tal filed another class action against polluting chemical factories located the Rotem planes, based on the massive contamination of the underlying groundwater and the resulting polluting of the pristine Boqeq stream in the Dead Sea region. At the time, it was the highest damages ever sought in an Israeli environmental civil action.https://www.jpost.com/HEALTH-SCIENCE/Academics-file-suit-against- chronic-pollution-of-Negevs-Boqeq-Stream-544339 Academic appointments Tal taught at the Tel Aviv University Law School from 1990 until 2004. In 2005 he joined the faculty of the Desert Research Institutes at Ben Gurion University. His research has focused on water policy, monitoring transboundary stream water quality, assessing the Israeli government's environmental enforcement program, evaluating national environmental education programs, forestry policy, surveying Israel's environmental movement and assessing a range of environmental history and policy issues. He has been a visiting professor or affiliated with numerous universities including the Harvard School of Public Health (1989-1997); University of Otago Law School (1998, 2003, 2008, 2016); Stanford University Center for Conservation Biology (2011, 2013–14); Michigan State University (2015) and Renmin University of China (2015). In 2017, Tal returned to Tel Aviv University to assume the position of Chair of the Department of Public Policy. In 2006, in conjunction with the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification, he initiated a bi-annual international Conference on Drylands, Deserts and Desertification at Ben Gurion University, which brings together some 500 participants from over 60 countries to discuss a range of research findings and issues associated with sustainable land management in drylands. He chaired five consecutive conferences, most recently in 2014. Political career =Green movement= In 2008, Tal was among the founders of the Green Movement, which ran in the 2009 Knesset elections on a joint ticket with Meimad. Tal was the third candidate on the slate. The party received 1% of the popular vote, which fell short of the required 2% threshold. In 2010, Tal was elected chair of the party and began promoting a broad social and environmental agenda. Shortly thereafter, the Green Movement took legal action to prevent the appointment of Yoav Galant as chief of staff of the Israel Defense Forces, due to his seizure of public land next to his home and the filing of a false affidavit to the Supreme Court. The Attorney General eventually accepted the Green Movement's position and Galant's appointment was cancelled. During Tal's tenure, the party also initiated campaigns to save the Samar sand dunes, to prevent the privatization of national parks, to stop the development of highway overpasses in the Jerusalem Forest and to create a “Green New Deal” for Israel's economy. Tal also successfully sponsored an initiative to ensure gender equality in the party, ensuring parallel female and male party co-chairs. In 2010 the Green Movement joined with the Hatnuah party for the January 22, 2013, elections, where Tal was placed as number 13 on the party list and he oversaw the party's environmental platform. Six months after the elections, he stepped down as party chairman to complete his sabbatical at Stanford where he wrote his most recent book: \\"The Land is Full: Addressing Overpopulation in Israel.\\" In 2019, Tal joined Benny Gantz's new \\"Hosen L'Yisrael\\" (Israel Resilience) party and was placed at 25 on the Knesset list; following the merger with Yeish Atid he was ultimately slated at 45. During the election campaign he was involved in drafting the party's green platform and active in the party's outreach to Israel's environmental community. =Advocacy for sustainable population growth in Israel= Tal was one of Israel's first advocates favoring a national policy to reduce population growth as a precondition to a sustainable future. In 2011, a national convention of the Green Party supported a position that in general recognized the importance of the population issue, but chose not to prioritize it immediately. Tal called attention to population growth as early as 2002, in Pollution in the Promised Land, his survey of environmental history in Israel: “The most critical single factor in understanding the downside of Israel’s environmental history is population pressure: with an average increase of one million people a decade, the land soon became very crowded. Israel’s population density is now roughly 270 people per square kilometer. Eventually economics, water resources, noise and the general dysfunction caused by the unbearable density will push Israel into a confrontation with advocates of large families and mass immigration. Environmentalists should not be afraid to speak on behalf of the many natural treasures that will otherwise be decimated by the crowds; flora and fauna are the first to pay for human encroachment on shrinking habitat. Future generations will certainly have reason to resent the deafening silence.”Tal 419-424. In 2015, along with Professor Eyal Rotenberg from the Weizmann Institute he founded the non-profit organization \\"Zafuf\\" - the Israel Forum for Demography, Environment and Society. The advocacy group, for the first time, brings a diverse group of Israel academics, activists and concerned citizens together to consider the implications of Israel's population dynamics and raise awareness among the general public about how to begin the process of demographic stabilization. He has since written widely in the Israeli and the international press about the perils of overpopulation in Israel and the world. =Personal life= Tal presently lives in Maccabim with his wife Robyn Klein Tal and three daughters, is active in his local Masorti synagogue as community gabai, and intermittently plays fiddle and mandolin in the Arava Riders, an Israeli bluegrass band.

Many patrons of the bookstore talked to the Cummings about the need for an alternative to public education, since the Supreme Court had removed Bible reading and prayer from the public schools. When God was taken out of public education, the Cummings and many others saw the need to start a school in Athens that would educate students from a Biblical worldview. This was the reason Athens Christian School was started. \\"But to Minister, My Life and Ministry,\\" by Buhl Cummings.

Mohan Rao wishes to see Ravi married to a girl soon although Ravi is against it. One day, Ravi is informed that one of his friends, Seenu (Satyam Rajesh) has been admitted in the hospital as he tried to commit suicide by drinking nail polish solution. Upon inquiring, Ravi finds out that his friend fell in love with a girl named Shruti (Shruti Haasan). Shruti and her uncle Crazy Mohan (Brahmanandam), have a habit of cheating gullible young men in the name of love - one among whom is Seenu. Ravi decides to teach them a lesson. Ravi enters their life as a gullible youngster after Shruti \\"falls in love with him\\", starts torturing them. Crazy Mohan's plans and attempts to let loose off Ravi always go in vain before him. Crazy Mohan, hatching upon a plan, tells Shruti to ask Ravi to marry her, thinking that Ravi will get cold feet and they would be rid of him. As fate would have it, Ravi, guessing their next move, also comes with a marriage proposal to Shruti. The pair, then, approach Mohan Rao and tell him that Ravi is in love with Shruti and that he proposed to her. They assume that this would enrage Mohan Rao, but Mohan Rao, happy that his son has finally fallen in love and wishes to marry a girl, accepts the proposal heartily. However, Shruti was already engaged to Rohit (Adivi Sesh) by her father (Nassar) sometime in the past. Their entire act of \\"cheating gullible young men\\" was just so that Shruti can have fun spending the last few days before getting married while Crazy Mohan can profit from it. Ravi one day saves Shruti from some goons and finally comes off clean to Shruti as he believes that things have gone too far. He advises her not to play with people's feelings in future. Shruti finds herself falling in love with Ravi and informs Ravi's father Mohan Rao. Mohan Rao leaves the final decision to Shruti's father and guarantees that they would not face any problem in the future from Ravi, if Shruti's Father decides against the Proposal. On the other hand, Rohit's mother (Sana), in a fit of anger after hearing all the events that have transpired, warns Shruti that she would torture her after her marriage. After listening to both of them, Shruti's father, realizes his mistake and fixes Shruti's marriage with Ravi. Rohit's mother gets humiliated by this and calls her brother Poorna (Ashutosh Rana), a dreaded don in Vizag. Poorna, after arriving at the wedding venue with his henchmen, recognises that Ravi & Mohan Rao were his former enemies Shankar and Nanaji. While Ravi is fighting with the goons, Poorna stabs Mohan Rao, kidnaps Shruti and flees away to Vizag. After admitting Mohan Rao into the hospital, Ravi starts narrating his past. In the past in Vizag, Nanaji was a dreaded Don with an established crime empire while Poorna was still trying to establish his own regime. Poorna, in view to destroy Nanaji's empire, takes the help of Shankar, a young upstart, and makes him a partner in crime. Shankar, with his aggressiveness and cleverness, starts destroying the empire of Nanaji. Meanwhile, he falls in love with Dr. Anjali (Anjali), without knowing the fact that she was Nanaji's daughter. As Anjali is a person who believes in non-violence and hates rowdies, Shankar lies to her that he is only a struggling Musician. Anjali, soon reciprocates his love.

As was solidified after the Berlin Wall in 1961 and was the division of Germany prevented the participation of the bishops of the East of the German Bishops' Conference, the pastoral needs led to a separate meeting of the East German bishops, first of the Berlin Ordinarienkonferenz. In the following decades, the increased pressure from the government of the GDR built on the Apostolic See, has its own Bishops' Conference as \\"auctoritas territorialis\\" and on July 10, 1974 submitted to the ambassador of the GDR in Italy to the Holy See a formal proposal to the East German government, to lead talks at foreign minister level. Although the (West) German Bishops' Conference of this approach was regarded as not conducive to it on July 26, 1976 on the erection of the Berlin Conference of Bishops as an independent, not as a national bishops' conference of the German Democratic Republic. Great importance was attached to the wording of the statute of the German Bishops' Conference, being confirmed on September 25, 1976 by the Apostolic See.

Retrieved 2015-5-7. He was born in Amherst, New Hampshire, but spent most of his life residing and working in Erie, Pennsylvania.  Early life  Moses Billings was born in Amherst, New Hampshire, on January 15, 1809. Little is known of his early life. According to a variety of sources, he appeared at some point in his early life in Cincinnati; Orange County, New York; Cleveland; Massachusetts; and in other places in New England. It is likely that during his early life, he learned the skills of a cobbler, for he is listed in the 1831 Cincinnati City Directory as a shoemaker/cobbler. He married Jane Wilkins (daughter of Thomas and Mary Wallace Wilkins, a prominent family in Erie at the time) on October 27, 1835.  Influences  Billings was self-taught, and \\"born with all the instincts of an artist\\". It is not known exactly what his influences were, though a number of potential influences have been suggested. Much of his knowledge of art most likely came from engravings, lithographs, and prints of famous works. It is also likely that Billings was familiar with the work of Samuel F. B. Morse. Upon Morse's return from Europe, he attempted to implement elements of history painting he had learned from his teacher, Benjamin West. When his attempts proved largely unsuccessful, he turned to portrait painting. Morse traveled extensively in Massachusetts and New Hampshire from 1816 to 1820, and lived in Concord, New Hampshire, for a while, a mere from Billings' home in Amherst at the time. James Bowman, another portrait painter, did work in Erie for a brief time starting in 1817. However, given the relatively primitive and flat style of his portraits, and given the brevity of the time he actually spent in Erie, it seems unlikely that Bowman had a significant influence on Billings.  Works  Moses Billings' portrait of former president John Quincy Adams Billings' first work that earned him public notice was a full-length portrait of first U.S. president George Washington. The painting was entitled The Father Of His Country, and was paraded by two ponies in a political procession on September 10, 1840. The local newspaper reported the next day that \\"the great colored portrait of George Washington added color to the parade.\\"Erie Gazette, September 11, 1840 This portrait was painted more to garner attention of the public eye, and it did not necessarily exemplify his style. However, it did help to begin his career as a permanent portrait artist in Erie. To make a living, Billings often had to also accept jobs that were not strictly portraiture, such as sign painting, furniture decorating, and other more craft-oriented tasks. However, unlike James Bowman a few decades earlier, Billings was successfully able to maintain a career as a portrait painter permanently located in Erie (though he did spend a few months at a time in larger cities when his business in Erie began to slow). With the development of the daguerreotype in the 1840s, the role of the portrait painter declined in general, because it was now much easier and much cheaper to have one's likeness presented in a visual format. While many portrait painters lost business in competition with the daguerreotype, Billings instead began to produce daguerreotype prints himself.Kelly, Elizabeth K. \\"Moses Billings, Erie's first photographer.\\" 8 September 1979. It is not known exactly which prints were made by Moses Billings, as daguerreotypes were usually signed, when signed at all, along the side of the plate. Due to the traditional storing methods of daguerreotype plates, even this signature usually quickly became illegible. However, it has been generally noted, or at least hypothesized, that his daguerreotype prints showed a level of talent and artistry above that of amateur daguerreotypists. Though it is not known exactly which prints were his, it is known that he had largely abandoned the process by the 1850s. Even after he stopped making daguerreotypes, he did continue to paint people's portraits on canvas. In February 1846, Billings spent a good deal of time working in Washington, D.C. There, he painted portraits of various figures of political importance, most notably Dolley Madison and John Quincy Adams. The portrait of Adams is noted for its lack of the severity of expression with which Adams is often depicted, capturing what Adams himself called \\"the true portraiture of the heart\\". The Adams portrait is among the works in the permanent collection of Thiel College in Greenville, Pennsylvania. The portrait of Dolley Madison was lost sometime in the late 1920s, and remains missing to this day. While Moses Billings never gained national recognition on a major scale, he had a great deal of success on the local scale as a portrait painter. He continued to paint until around 1880, when his deteriorating health no longer allowed him to do so. When he died in 1884, his work was displayed in Washington, D.C., Cincinnati, Cleveland, and various places in northwestern Pennsylvania.

It is a hollow post windmill of the type called spinnenkop by the Dutch. The mill is listed as a Rijksmonument, number 39810 and it is still in use for draining the Geeuwpolder. It was almost completely renewed at a restoration in 1987, earlier restorations were in 1954 and 1965. History The exact year of construction is uncertain, 1832 or 1841 are mentioned. Though restored earlier, the mill was in a bad state of repair when Stichting De Fryske Mole became owner in 1981. It was scratched from the list of protected monuments and a permit for demolishment had already been given before the national government could be persuaded to at least pay for the yearly maintenance. Money was raised from other public and private parties and by selling postcards to pay for the four year restoration. In 1988 the work was completed and the windmill is currently in regular use to drain the Geeuwpolder. This polder is one of the last remaining summer polders, it is only drained during the summer and allowed to flood in winter. The polder is now a nature reserve owned by Staatsbosbeheer (English: State Forest Management). Description The Geeuwpoldermolen is what the Dutch describe as a spinnenkop (English: spiderhead mill). It is a small hollow post mill winded by a winch. The four common sails have a span of and are carried on a wooden windshaft.

The reef was named after the British tea clipper Fiery Cross, which was wrecked on the reef on 4 March 1860. (A later sister ship was also named Fiery Cross). The reef was surveyed by Lieutenant J. W. Reed of , who in 1867 reported it to be one extensive reef, and found the apparent wrecks of Fiery Cross and Meerschaum. It was named \\"Fiery Cross Reef\\" (十字火礁) or \\"Northwestern Investigator Reef\\" (西北调查礁) by the government of China in 1935. In 1947, it was renamed \\"Yongshu Reef\\" (永暑礁) by the government. At that time, Chinese fishermen called it \\"Tuwu\\" (土戊). The reef was occupied by China (PRC) in 1987 when they were asked to build a UNESCO Marine observation station there, despite immediate opposition from Vietnam leading to armed conflict in March of that year. In 2014, the PRC commenced reclamation activity in the area, and it has been converted into an artificial island of . There were around 200 Chinese troops on the reef in late 2014, though this number was likely to have increased significantly in 2015 with the addition of support personnel for the new airbase, including a runway and associated early warning radar site. According to the Center for Strategic and International Studies, it is \\"the most advanced of China's bases\\" in the South China Sea's disputed areas, with 12 hardened shelters with retractable roofs for mobile missile launchers already completed. It has enough hangars to accommodate 24 combat aircraft and four larger planes Fiery Cross reef has a runway long enough to land a Chinese Xian H-6N bomber; a bomber like this could perform combat operations within of the reclaimed reef. Geographical features On 12 July 2016, the tribunal of the Permanent Court of Arbitration concluded that Fiery Cross Reef contains, within the meaning of Article 121(1) of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), naturally formed areas of land, surrounded by water, which are above water at high tide. However, for purposes of Article 121(3) of UNCLOS, the high-tide features at Fiery Cross Reef are \\"rocks that cannot sustain human habitation or economic life of their own and accordingly shall be entitled to 12 nautical miles of territorial sea measured from its baseline but have no exclusive economic zone or continental shelf\\". p.259 GLOSS sea level monitoring station In 1987, following a United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization/Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission (UNESCO/IOC) meeting in March, it was agreed that the PRC would build weather stations in the South China sea as part of the Global Sea Level Observing System (GLOSS) survey. The scientists from GLOSS agreed that China would install tide gauges on what the PRC considered to be its coasts in the East China Sea and on the \\"Nansha islands\\" in South China Sea. The scientists were unaware of regional political disputes, including Taiwanese territorial claims to, and occupation of, one of the Spratly Islands.\\"South China Sea Treacherous Shoals\\", Far Eastern Economic Review, August 13, 1992: p14-17 In April 1987, the PRC chose Fiery Cross Reef as the site to build a weather station, as the reef was large enough for the purpose, and it was isolated from other disputed islands and reefs. However, this caused further skirmishes with Vietnam when, in January 1988, some Vietnamese ships with construction materials tried to approach the reef in a bid to establish structures there. The weather station was commissioned by UNESCO's Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission (IOC). Construction was commenced in February 1988 and completed in August 1988. Land reclamation Fiery Cross Reef being transformed, May 2015 During 2014, the PRC government began reclamation activities to construct a large artificial island to support an approximately airstrip, a seaport and a military garrison. Although the PRC has a runway on Woody Island in the Paracels, it had been at a disadvantage compared with other claimants of areas of the South China Sea as it was the only claimant that did not have an airfield in the Spratly Islands. As of January 2016, the PRC has reclaimed land on seven reefs and built three runways within the Spratly Islands. The runway on Fiery Cross was completed in January 2016 and is the southernmost of the three (the others being at Mischief and Subi reefs). The PRC test-landed two civilian aircraft there in January 2016, one from China Southern Airlines and the other from Hainan Airlines. The People's Liberation Army Daily reported that a Chinese military jet had made a public landing there in April 2016. It has been asserted that other PRC military aircraft, including jet fighters, have been observed there since April 2016.

History An inscription found on the substructure dates the mill to before 1790, making it one of the oldest still existing drainage mills in Friesland. It was named Doris Mooltsje after the last owner, Doris Hoekstra. In 1934 the windmill was partly dismantled, only the substructure was kept to house a pumping station. A re-allotment project made it superfluous and the remnants of the mill were to be torn down. Stichting Doris Mooltsje was founded in 1992 in an attempt to save and restore the windmill. The restoration project encountered a setback when the provincial government refused to put the mill on the provincial list of monuments, thereby creating difficulties in obtaining the necessary funds. Much work was done by volunteer labour to save costs on hiring a millwright. The mill was officially reopened in 1998.

It replaced the Universal Series in the mid-1970s, and was superseded by the Dash 8 Series in the mid-1980s.  Specifications  All models of the Dash 7 Series are powered by a 12-cylinder or 16-cylinder, turbocharged, GE 7FDL 4-stroke diesel engine carried over from the Universal Series, and have speed-based adhesion control with a multi-channel LED annunciator panel. Dash 7 Series traction motors are powered by direct current.  Construction history  The Dash 7's predecessor, the Universal Series, had been introduced in the 1950s, and with its innovative body structure, it had initially been greeted favourably by the market. However, GM-EMD had then developed the GP30 model to compete with it; GP30 production had commenced in 1961. Over many years, the GP30's reliability had given it a sales advantage, and when EMD introduced its successor, the Dash 2, in 1972, the Universal Series became completely obsolete. The Dash 7 Series was intended to redress the ensuing imbalance between the two competing manufacturers. GE commenced production of the Dash 7 Series in 1976. By the time Dash 7 production ceased in 1985, about 2,800 Dash 7 locomotives had been built - roughly the same number of units as the total production of the Universal Series. By contrast, EMD built more than 8,000 Dash 2 locomotives. Although the Dash 7 Series failed to surpass the Dash 2 in terms of market share, its 4-stroke engine returned better fuel consumption figures than the 2-stroke engine fitted to GM-EMD locomotives after the 1970s oil crisis. The Dash 7 Series was therefore positively received.  Nomenclature  The naming of the Dash 7 Series, and that of its various models, is based upon wheel arrangement and power output. So, for example, \\"B30-7\\" designates a B-B configured Dash 7 Series locomotive.  Four axle models  = Common features = Specifications common to all Dash 7 Series four axle models are as follows: * AAR wheel arrangement: B-B * Prime mover: GE 12-cylinder V-type 7FDL12 or 16-cylinder V-type 7FDL16 four stroke diesel engine = B23-7 = A BNSF B23-7. This model was manufactured between 1977 and 1984 and was fitted with a 12-cylinder 7FDL12 engine. It replaced GE's U23B, and competed with the very successful EMD GP38-2. A total of 537 B23-7s were built for 9 U.S. customers and 2 Mexican customers. Southern Railway's 54 units had Southern's \\"standard\\" high-short-hoods. These engines are frequently rebuilt as a Control Car Remote Control Locomotive (CCRCL), due to their low value on the used locomotive market. * Power output: = BQ23-7 = The BQ23-7 model was a variant of the B23-7 built between 1978 and 1979. It was mechanically identical to the B23-7. The 'Q' in the model designation stood for \\"crew Quarters\\", and referred to the model's enlarged operating cab for accommodating the train crew. Only ten were built, all for the Seaboard Coast Line railroad. They were nicknamed \\"Busses\\" by the operating crews and \\"Aegis Cruisers\\" by some railfans, due to their boxy shape. * Power output: = B30-7 = Southern Pacific B30-7. The B30-7 was of similar length to the B23-7, but was equipped with a more powerful 16-cylinder 7FDL16 engine. It replaced the U30B model. Between December 1977 and May 1982, a total of 279 units of the B30-7 model were produced. These production numbers include the three different B30-7A variants described below. All of the B30-7s were built for U.S. customers. * Power output: = B30-7A = Burlington Northern B30-7A. This model was a variant of the B30-7 fitted with a 12-cylinder 7FDL12 engine generating the same power output as the B30-7. Three different versions of the B30-7A variant were produced. B30-7As were built only for the Missouri Pacific Railroad and are externally identical to the 16 cylinder B30-7. Cabless B30-7As were built only for the Burlington Northern Railroad. B30-7A1s were built only for the Southern Railway. * Power output: = B36-7 = CSX B36-7. The B36-7 model was manufactured between 1980 and 1985, and was fitted with a 16-cylinder 7FDL16 engine. The model was designed as a successor to the U36B. A total of 222 B36-7's were built for North American railroads, and a further eight units were delivered to a Columbian coal mining operation. The largest customer for the model was Seaboard System, which became part of CSX Transportation in 1986. Seaboard System took delivery of 120 B36-7s; the model's second biggest customer, Conrail, acquired 60 units. * Power output:  Six axle models  = Common features = Specifications common to all Dash 7 Series six axle models are as follows: * AAR wheel arrangement: C-C * Prime mover: GE 12-cylinder V-type 7FDL12 or 16-cylinder V-type 7FDL16 four stroke diesel engine = C30-7 = A C30-7 in Brazil. The C30-7 model was manufactured between 1976 and 1986 and was fitted with a 16-cylinder 7FDL engine. It replaced the U30C model. A total of 1,137 C30-7s were built, all of them for North American railroads. These production numbers include the 50 C30-7A variants described below. Approximately half of the C30-7s have since been exported to Brazil after being sold by their original owners. * Power output: = C30-7A = A C36-7i in Estonia. This model was a variant of the C30-7 fitted with a 12-cylinder 7FDL12 engine generating the same power output as the B30-7. The smaller engine used less fuel than the 16-cylinder version. A total of 50 C30-7As were built in mid-1984, and delivered to Conrail. They are externally similar to the C30-7, except that they have six tall hood doors per side (in place of eight) and moved front grilles on long hood, also only 4 steps. In 2003, nineteen C30-7As were rebuilt and exported to Estonia as C30-7Ais. * Power output: = C36-7 = Union Pacific C36-7. The C36-7 model was manufactured between 1978 and 1989, and was fitted with a 16-cylinder 7FDL16 engine. Most were made in the United States, but GE do Brasil built 15 C36-7s for Ferrocarriles Nacionales de México. A total of 599 units of the model were built; 422 of them were exported to the People's Republic of China, which designated it ND5. The largest North American customer for the C36-7 was Missouri Pacific Railroad, which took delivery of 60 units. In 1982, Missouri Pacific merged with Union Pacific; in 2003, all but two of the MP/UP C36-7s were exported to Estonia. * Power output: See also *List of GE locomotives  References  = Notes = = Bibliography =    External links  * GE Transportation Systems.

The Western media described the fighting as the worst in Tajikistan since 2010 or the 1992–1997 civil war.  Background  On 21 July 2012, Major-General Abdullo Nazarov, head of the Tajik intelligence agency's branch in Gorno-Badakhshan, was fatally stabbed in Ishkashim after being dragged out of his car. The Tajik government accused the forces of Tolib Ayombekov, a former warlord, of responsibility. Ayombekov had been a warlord during the Tajik Civil War between the United Tajik Opposition and the government as led by President Emomali Rakhmon. He was given a government post in a subsequent peace deal. However, Ayombekov and other warlords were gradually driven out as Rakhmon again centralised power. Rakhmon's government had also accused Ayombekov of tobacco smuggling. Ayombekov denied any responsibility for Nazarov's death, stating that the general had been killed in a simple bar fight after he fell and struck his head on a rock.  Clashes  After the government announced that \\"Ayombekov and his accomplices have declined to face justice,\\" phone and internet communications were cut off to the Gorno-Badakhshan capital of Khorog. Tajikistan's most popular news website was also shut down and the personnel of international aid groups were evacuated. Roadblocks were erected on roads leading into the area. Tajik military forces then moved into the province after which \\"heavy fighting\\" ensued on 24 July with militants loyal to Ayombekov in the streets of Khorog. Ayombekov estimated in an interview that 800 Tajik soldiers had been deployed to the area. Residents reported seeing armored vehicles and helicopter gunships. State-owned television reported that 23 soldiers had been wounded, but no soldiers or civilians had been killed. Initial casualty reports varied. BBC News reported at least 12 soldiers and 30 militants had been killed, but also spoke with a hospital source who reported more than 100 military personnel and 100 civilians dead. The Associated Press cited an unnamed government source as stating that at least twenty soldiers had been killed, while the chief military prosecutor, Khairullo Saidov, suffered a foot injury. Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty reported that snipers had killed at least six civilians, including children. Al Jazeera reported 12 dead soldiers and 30 dead rebels, as well as more than 20 wounded soldiers. President Rakhmon ordered a halt to operations the following day, stating that rebel commanders had agreed to make \\"concessions,\\" and called on all Gorno-Badakhshan militant groups to disarm. Reuters reported that Defence Minister Sherali Khairulloyev had traveled to the area to offer amnesty to all militant leaders who surrendered.

It is a hollow post windmill of the type called \\"spinnenkop\\" by the Dutch built on top of a brick shed. The mill is listed as a Rijksmonument, number 388083 and is in working order. History The mill was designed by architect Luitje Wiersema and built by the first owner and operator Eiko Jan Feunekes in 1938 to saw lumber from his oak plantation. After Feunekes death in 1940 ownership of the mill changed several times and by 1985 the mill was in such a bad state of repair that it was under threat of dismantlement. It was saved from this fate by obtaining monument status in 1990. The new owners A. Dost and O. Schaver managed to restore the mill in 1997 using government subsidies. Description The mill of Wedderveen is what the Dutch describe as a \\"spinnenkop\\" (English: spiderhead mill). It is a small hollow post mill winded by a fantail. It is one of only two windmills in the Netherlands using this winding system, the other being De Sterrenberg. The Patent sails have a span of and are carried on a steel windshaft. The brake wheel on the windshaft drives the wallower at the top of the upright shaft in the body (called head on a spinnenkop), which passed through the main post into the substructure. Here the crown wheel drives a shaft with pulleys and a flat belt. The mill is built on top of a brick storage shed. It formerly powered a horizontal saw located outside. Currently the mill poweres a bandsaw housed in the shed. Public access The mill is open to the public on appointment.

It is owned by the City of Rolla (in adjacent Phelps County) and located 11 nautical miles (13 mi, 20 km) north of its central business district. The airport is one nautical mile (2 km) northwest of Vichy, Missouri. It is included in the National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2011–2015, which categorized it as a general aviation facility.  History  The airport was originally built by the United States Army Air Forces in 1942 as a sub-base for Sedalia Army Airfield during World War II. It was designated as Vichy Army Airfield, and was used by I Troop Carrier Command for training. The Third Air Force 76th Reconnaissance Group operated L-1 Vigilant and L-4 Grasshopper light observation aircraft from the airfield in the spring of 1943 in support of Army training at Fort Leonard Wood. The airfield was vacated by the Air Force in March 1946; however it was re-activated by the United States Navy which used it as an Outlying Field (OLF) for Naval Air Station St. Louis. When the Navy ended its use, it was deeded to the city of Rolla in 1957 and became Rolla National Airport. In August 1959, the USAF Air Defense Command established site \\"P-70C (later Z-70C)\\" at the airport. It was an Air Defense Radar Gap-Filler Annex, equipped with a Bendix AN/FPS-18 Radar medium-range search Radar , assigned to the 798th Radar Squadron, Belleville AFS, Illinois. The station was inactivated in late 1968. Both building and radar tower (but now without radome) are still extant. The radome was removed in November 2011.  Facilities and aircraft  Rolla National Airport covers an area of 1,370 acres (554 ha) at an elevation of 1,148 feet (350 m) above mean sea level. It has two runways, designated 4/22 and 13/31, each with an asphalt surface measuring 5,500 by 100 feet (1,676 x 30 m). For the 12-month period ending March 31, 2010, the airport had 10,570 aircraft operations, an average of 28 per day: 95% general aviation, 3% air taxi, and 2% military. At that time there were 68 aircraft based at this airport: 85% single-engine and 15% multi-engine.

It is a hollow post windmill of the type called spinnenkop by the Dutch. The mill is in working order and used to drain the reed beds during winter to improve accessibility for reed cutters. History The predecessor of the current mill was the last windmill in the current De Weerribben-Wieden National Park. It was dismantled in 1942. By 1980 a foundation called Vrienden van de Weerribben got the idea of rebuilding this mill. The idea was taken up by Staatsbosbeheer (English: State Forest Management) and by 1982 the construction of the new mill was finished. Description De Wicher is what the Dutch describe as a spinnenkop (English: spiderhead mill). It is a small hollow post mill winded by a winch. The mill has common sails. The wooden stocks has a span of and . The stocks and brake wheel are carried on the windshaft and drive the wallower at the top of the upright shaft in the body (called head on a spinnenkop), which passed through the main post into the substructure. At the bottom of the upright shaft is the crown wheel which drives the wooden Archimedes' screw. The body (called head on a spinnenkop) is weatherboarded while the substructure is thatched and rests on a brick base.

It is an area endowed with rocks and is neighboured in the Northwest by Koboko; to the Northeast by Yumbe; to the East by Omugo subcounty plus to the South by Nyadri (Maracha Town). Other subcounties in Maracha include Yivu, Aiivu, Oleba, Uriama, Omugo and Nyadri. Origins According to Lugbara oral tradition, a man called Ajua is the great-grandfather of Tara parishes. He wanted to see where Ono (River Enyau or Anyau - a tributary of River Nile also met by a river from Tara) ends, which would be its source. So he moved with his cows and found people dancing at a dog funeral in Onduparaka (a few kilometres north of Arua Town). He joined in the dance and was given a wife. She gave birth to Opodria who later birthed Naye, the father of the seven true parishes of Tara. Ajua left Onduparaka on his quest and went to Ovisoni (West of Arua Town). There he also found people dancing and was allowed to join them. He was given another wife. Some say he paid bride price. The woman gave birth to Otu (Lugbara for Umbilical cord), the father of Vurra - after whom a county was named in Arua District. The actual source of the river is in Vurra, not far from the DR Congo border. Otu is the step-brother of Opodria, the grandfather of the other Vur(r)a, a parish in Tara Subcounty which encompasses the villages from East /West Kololo (the Subcounty Headquarters), Pajuru to Odupiri. Vur(r)a's six brothers after whom parishes are named in Tara include Ojapi, Ajulepi, Yidu (Pajama Area), Oliapi (Oliyepi), Aruwe and Rendu. Tara Hills and Rocks Two of the highest mountains in the whole of West Nile can be seen while in Tara, that is Mt. Wati (in Terego County) and Mt. Liru on the Koboko side of Lurujo Road. You can get a customized view when you sit on top of the wide rock in Tara named Komendaku (translated as You don't need to search for a chair!). Adventurers and tourists write their names on the rocks and take small ones as souvenirs plus for research purposes. Red monkeys, rock badgers, porcupines and other interesting animals can be found near some of these rocks. When you stand at the soccer field of Ojapi Primary School, the ranges anticlockwise from Mt. Liru include Kodro, Gala, Kadri, Adrofiya and Njeke (or Njakai). On the south side of Ojapi as you move from Oliapi Primary School to Orani (which also has a rock named after the place), you will see Adada and Luturujo (which translates as The House of/ on a Hill). Despite all these rocks, the farmlands are very productive and agriculture is the predominant economic activity. Crops grown include maize, cassava, ground nut, soya, coffee and beans. Tobacco locally regarded as Assets is grown as a major cash crop. Animals are also reared including cows, goats, sheep, guineafowls, chicken plus pigs. On market days like at Mabira, Ajira, Gili Gili and Odupiri, people sell foodstuffs and other household items as the sun sets. The grasshopper is a staple food and Emblem for Maracha, a Lugbara clan.

Their debut single and album Global Experience were produced by Randy Miller, and released on Island Def Jam Digital Distribution, with the single released in December 2011 and the album in early 2012. History = Founding= World5 was formed as a soft rock and adult contemporary band by five friends who had previously performed together in different groups in the United States and Europe. The members had all settled in different locations and countries, but began writing songs together through Skype in 2011. Founder members are Don Bruner, from San Diego, California, on keyboards and lead vocals. Bruner had previously penned \\"In My Wildest Dreams\\" by Ruckus in 2000, and opened for groups including ZZ Top, Bay City Rollers, and Herman's Hermits. Roland Childs from San Francisco, California on bass, drummer Raimund Breitfeld contributes from Gothenburg, Sweden, Stephan Goessl began playing saxophone in Munich, Germany, and Steffen Goeres contributes guitars and trumpet from Wellington, New Zealand. They were discovered by producer Randy Miller. =First releases= With Miller's patronage, the band began working on an album in 2011. Chiefly using Skype and digital recording facilities, the band began recording their individual parts at home. According to the band, they worked together on Skype to make the process work. Final tracks were sent to Randy Miller in Houston, Texas to be mixed into the album Global Experience. Before the album was released, the single \\"You and I\\" was released to a number of websites and online radio stations, eventually finding rotation on approximately 60 international stations. It has a strong Latin aesthetic, and according to Miller, \\"I knew that 'You and I' was the single as soon as I heard it.\\" It is the only song of the album to have a music video. On January 28, 2012 the track \\"You and I\\" reached #1 on a number of Internet charts. In January 2012, the band won the RGW Gold Award for the year. Global Experience was released on May 1, 2012 on Island Def Jam Digital Distribution. In early May of 2012, the band had songs in the top five at iHeart Radio, and four songs in the top ten for the categories of Adult and Hit. The single \\"Bring Your Heart Home\\" debuted at top five in the Hit category of unsigned artists, and later reached #1 in the adult category. The song \\"Living (Give me a Reason)\\" debuted at #5 on the unsigned adult category, with the song \\"So Sincere\\" close behind. In late May 2012, tracks from the album were included on the album Valleyarm Music Matters Sampler 2012, where it was presented at the music business conference \\"Music Matters\\" in Singapore. In March 2013, the first single recorded with the new members Pat Hunt and Randy Miller, titled \\"Man Of Action\\" was released on Mondotunes distribution.\\"Man Of Action\\" reached the National Airplay Top 200 Chart shortly after its release. The second single release on MondoTunes and titled \\"Maybe There´s a Way\\" followed June 2013.\\"Heartbeat Of The World\\" was released in october 2013 under the label Famous Records Corp. / Fontana. =Style, reception= According to review by Indie Artist Radio, in July 11, 2012, the album has \\"wonderfully structured lyrics, melodically soothing harmonies, and soul grabbing rhythm that bites at the point just beneath the sternum that makes you want to sway uncontrollably into a dance that may just win you a place on Dancing With The Stars,\\" and best fit in the genre Adult Contemporary Rock. It also compared the music of World5 to bands such as Bruce Hornsby and Mike and the Mechanics. According to The Mountain Weekly, \\"A little bit or water and some jet lag didn’t stop the guys from getting together to make soulful rock and roll reminiscent of Bryan Adams or early Genesis....Anyone who likes Jimmy Buffett or island music is surely going to appreciate the harmonies and guitar work.\\" The album received 7/10 stars from the Raffo Review, which said \\"Overall this record is one for those lazy, chilled out Sundays all the way up to a cocktail party.

Founded in the late 1980s by a group of former sportsmen led by the Tsyganov brothers, the group consolidated control over several businesses in the city during the transition to a free market economy, including the famous Uralmash factory (from which the group got its name). The profits earned from racketeering went on to be reinvested in a number of legitimate businesses, expanding the group's reach. During the 1990s, the Uralmash group was involved in a number of gang wars. One was an internal conflict, between the more traditional criminals who obeyed the Thieves Code and the sportsmen, who dominated the organization and eventually came out on top. Another was a violent clash with the Central gang, their main rivals in the city. The number of fatalities was so great that the two gangs had their own cemeteries. Gravestones were often extremely elaborately designed and bore images of the buried, dressed in classical 1990s gangster fashion (tracksuit, leather jacket, etc.). Sometimes gangster's nicknames and/or their particular skills would also be etched on the gravestone (for example, expert in judo).The Telegraph - Russian mafia killings threaten Putin legacy During the 1990s, the Uralmash was also involved in a vigilante group, City Without Drugs, which targeted both drug dealers and users in an attempt to rid the city of the heroin trade. Dealers were beaten and brutalised, often publicly to send a message to others, while addicts were chained to radiators and forced to go cold turkey.NY Times - Russian Vigilantes Fight Drug Dealers This action may have been a part of a public relations campaign to legitimise the group. The Uralmash also organised fashion shows to raise money for the city's children. By the end of the decade, Uralmash's leaders legitimised their business more and more, and eventually became a registered political party, the Social- Political Union Uralmash (abbreviated OPS, an intentional play on the Russian law enforcement term OPS, or Organised Crime Society).Volkov, Vadim. Violent Entrepreneurs (2002), pp. 116-118 Retrieved 27 November 2014.

Its primary mission is to use ion beams (H+to Bi83+) to simulate the cosmic ray radiation fields that are more prominent beyond earth's atmosphere. Overview Jointly managed by the U.S. Department of Energy’s Office of Science and NASA’s Johnson Space Center, the facility employs beams of heavy ions that simulate the cosmic rays found in space. NSRL also features its own beam line dedicated to radiobiology research, as well as specimen-preparation areas. Although Brookhaven Lab researchers and their colleagues used heavy ion beams for radiobiology research at another Brookhaven accelerator from 1995, the NSRL became operational during summer 2003, and over 75 experimenters from some 20 institutions from the U.S. and abroad have took part in radiobiology research in that year. Science Since astronauts are spending more time in outer space, they are receiving more exposure to ionizing radiation, a stream of particles that, when passing through a body, has enough energy to cause the atoms and molecules within that substance to become an ion. By directly or indirectly ionizing and thus damaging the components of living cells, including genetic material called DNA, ionizing radiation may cause changes in cells' ability to carry out repair and reproduction. This may lead to mutations, which, in turn, may result in tumors, cancer, genetic defects in offspring, or death. Although the spacecraft itself somewhat reduces radiation exposure, it does not completely shield astronauts from galactic cosmic rays, which are highly energetic heavy ions, or from solar energetic particles, which primarily are energetic protons. By one NASA estimate, for each year that astronauts spend in deep space, about one-third of their DNA will be hit directly by heavy ions. In increasing knowledge of the effects of cosmic radiation, NSRL studies may expand the understanding of the link between ionizing radiation and aging or neuro-degeneration, as well as cancer. In aiming to limit the damage to healthy tissue by ionization, NSRL research may also lead to improvements in cancer radiation treatments. NSRL researchers employ the unique Electron Beam Ion Source (EBIS) and the Alternating Gradient Synchrotron's Booster Accelerator to deliver heavy ion beams to a variety of biological specimens (tissues, cells, DNA in-solution), electronic equipment, and new materials to be used in space missions. This beam source allows the facility to change the ion that is being accelerated within 5 minutes and has led to a standardized beam delivery format among NSRL biology experimenters called the \\"GCR Simulator\\". This program combines a series of beams, from H+ to Fe26+, of various energies, which mimics the absorbed dose to living issue over a period of time during beyond Earth orbit missions.

It is an active Anglican parish church in the deanery of Windermere, the archdeaconry of Westmorland and Furness, and the diocese of Carlisle. It is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II listed building. History A church was present on the site by 1618, and was repaired in 1678. The south aisle and the tower date possibly from 1793. The church was restored in 1897 by the Lancaster architects Austin and Paley. The restoration included removal of pews, reroofing and reseating the church, and replacing the stone arcade with one in timber. Its estimated cost was £1,000 (equivalent to £ as of ). Architecture The church is constructed in stone rubble with slate roofs. Its plan consists of a nave and a chancel in one range, a south aisle, and a west tower with a vestry to its south. The tower has a west doorway, with a two-light window above it. The paired bell openings are round-headed, and the battlemented parapet has crocketed pinnacles at the corners. There is a clock face on the north side. On the sides of the church are two-light round-headed windows. The east window has three lights. Inside the church is a five-bay oak arcade, and a 19th-century open timber roof. The furniture dates from the 19th century and includes a simple octagonal font, and a timber pulpit decorated with traceried panels. The two-manual pipe organ is located at the east end of the south aisle, and was built by Wilkinson of Kendal in 1870.

This rhizomatous herbaceous perennial comes from various provinces in China. It has grey-green leaves, long hollow stem, and 2 flowers in various blue shades. From dark violet, dark purple, purple-blue, dark blue to light purple. It is cultivated as an ornamental plant in temperate regions. Description Iris delavayi is larger and more vigorous in growth than Iris sibirica. It has stout, creeping rhizomes (about 1 cm in diameter), that create clumps or tufts of plants.British Iris Society (1997) It eventually forms clumps that are about wide. The rhizomes have fibers (the remains of leaves from last season). It has 3–4 (per stem) grey-green leaves, that are sword-shaped or linear (in form), measuring long and 0.6–1.5 cm wide. The leaves are shorter than the flowering stems. It has a hollow, 1–3 branched flowering stem that grows up to between long and 5–7 mm wide. The short branches are close to the tops of the stems. The stem has 2–3 green, with a slight reddish purple tinge, lanceolate (sword-like), spathes (leaves of the flower bud), which measure 7–11 cm long and 1.8–2 cm wide. They also have a papery brown tip. The spathes surround 2 flowers (per stem branch), borne in early summer, between May and August (or June or July in the UK). The flowers come in a range of blue shades. From dark violet, dark purple, purple-blue, dark blue. light purple, to light blue. The flowers are in diameter. Like other irises, it has 2 pairs of petals, 3 large sepals (outer petals), known as the 'falls' and 3 inner, smaller petals (or tepals), known as the 'standards'. The drooping falls are obovate, measuring 7 cm long and 3 cm wide, with white or yellow signal patch or mottled pattern on the blade (wide section). The smaller standards are held at an oblique angle, measuring 5.5 cm long and oblanceolate (in from). It has perianth tube of 1.6–1.8 cm long, a pedicel (flower stalk stem) of between 3–6 cm long and pale purple style branches, measuring 5 cm long and 1.6 cm wide. It has a 3–6 cm long pedicel, 1.8–2 cm long and 7 mm wide, ovary and milky yellow anthers. Between August and October (after the iris has flowered), it produces a seed capsule, which are ellipsoid/cylindric in form and measures 5–6.5 cm long and 1.5–2.5 cm wide. Inside are semi-orbicular, flat, (disc like) reddish brown seeds, with are about 6 mm in diameter. =Biochemistry= In 2011, the iris has been studied to work out its iridal properities from specimens collected in the north-western Yunnan Province of China, eight iridal-type triterpenoids were isolated, three of which were new. Both 2(7)Z- and 2(7)E-iridals were isolated in about equal amounts from the sample collected at Laojunshan, while only 2(7)Z-iridals were isolated from samples collected in Shangrila area, indicating the presence of chemical diversity in the species. As most irises are diploid, having two sets of chromosomes. This can be used to identify hybrids and classification of groupings.} It has a chromosome count of 2n=40. discovered by Simonet in 1932. This places it within the sub-group of the series, called the Sino-siberians. Taxonomy Iris delvayi is pronounced EYE-ris del-uh-VAY-ee. It is written as 长葶鸢尾 in Chinese script and known as chang ting yuan wei in China. It has the common name of Delavayi iris or long scape iris or Chinese Stream Iris (in Australia)Nick Romanowski The Latin specific epithet delavayi refers to the 19th century French missionary Père Jean Marie Delavay. It was originally found in the marshes in the Yunnan province of China. Seeds of the iris were then sent by Abbé Delavay to the Jardin des Plantes, Paris in 1889. Plants were then raised by Micheli, who then first published and described the iris in Revue Horticole (résumé de tout ce qui parait d'intéressant en jardinage, of Paris) Vol. 67, page 938, in 1895. It was also published in 'Jardin du Crest' page 189.Richard Lynch On 1 June 1899, Sir Joseph Dalton Hooker wrote about the iris in Curtis's Botanical Magazine, Tab. 7661, accompanied with a colour illustration. Based on flowers raised from seed given to Kew Gardens by Micheli, noting the fact the iris was similar in form to Iris laevigata Fisch & Mey. The authors of the 'Flora of China' have speculated that the early found specimens of Iris laevigata Fisch. Found in the high elevations of Yunnan should be referred to Iris delavayi. It was verified by United States Department of Agriculture and the Agricultural Research Service on 10 March 1997, and then updated on 24 March 2006. This plant has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit. Distribution and habitat clump of Iris delavayi plants Iris delavayi is native to south western China. =Range= It is found in the Chinese provinces of Guizhou, Sichuan (formerly known as 'Sze-chuen'), Xizang and Yunnan. It can also be found in Bhutan. =Habitat= It can be found growing in swampy places, mountain marshes, forest margins, damp places along ditches and streams, and wet mountain meadows. At altitudes of between above sea level. It can spread in ideal conditions to create large colonies. Cultivation Iris delavayi It is cultivated as an ornamental plant in temperate regions. The Sino-siberian irises all generally have similar cultivation requirements with minor alterations. They are not as hardy as the other group of Siberian irises. They also don't like very hot conditions either. Preferring the northern parts of America and United States to the over warm southern America. They are considered easy to cultivate (providing the conditions are good) in America. Iris delavayi will tolerate temperatures of up to −15 degrees C. But may survive lower if protected or well mulched in winter. It is hardy to USDA Zone 5-8, and Zone H2 (which means Hardy to −15 to −20 °C (5 to −4 °F), in Europe.James Cullen, Sabina G. Knees, H. Suzanne Cubey (Editors) They prefer soils with a ph level of 5.5 to 7 (acidic to neutral). They can be grown in any good garden soil that is preferably moist but not waterlogged. They do not like free-draining soils (or sandy soils), unless plenty of well-rotted organic matter is added before planting and applied as a mulch each spring. They are also tolerant of windy conditions. They prefer positions in full sun, but may tolerate partial shade. They produce less flowers in shaded positions. They can be mulched with peat or garden compost in spring. They can also be fed in spring with a general fertiliser but it is not essential. They can be divided after flowering (in early summer) or autumn (in the UK) if the clumps become too big and congested. Also propagation is best carried out by division of the rhizomes. They should then be replanted s) apart and deep, into weed free conditions. New plants can be planted in spring or autumn, but the ground needs to be prepared before planting. New plants need to be well watered during the first season. New plants also take at least 2 years to become established. They can also be propagated by seed. Once the pods are dry on the plant, break them open to collect seeds. Then direct sow outdoors in fall (or Autumn), or winter sow in vented containers, in a cold frame or unheated greenhouse. They can be used within in gardens, at waterside locations beside pools or streams. It can also be used within a bog garden and flowers after Iris sibirica, so extending the flowering season of the garden. =Hybrids and cultivars= Iris delavayi can be crossed with Iris wilsonii which gives its yellow base colour (veined with bluish purple) to the flowers and it can also cross with other members of the sibirica subsection. Known Iris delavayi selections include: 'Delavayi Pallida', 'Didcot', 'Thibet'. Iris delavayi crosses also include; 'Berliner Riesen', 'Black Pirate', 'Delfor', 'Diamond Jubilee', 'Diomed', 'Far Voyager', 'Fifinella', 'Lightly Touched', 'Normal', 'Ormonde', 'Persimmon'. A known cultivar is Iris delavayi 'Didcote'. Toxicity Like many other irises, most parts of the plant are poisonous (rhizome and leaves), if mistakenly ingested can cause stomach pains and vomiting. Also handling the plant may cause a skin irritation or an allergic reaction. Culture An illustration of Iris delavayi has been used as a postage stamp in Cambodia. References Sources *Aldén, B., S.

It currently contains the complete list of Medal of Honor recipients for actions since the September 11, 2001 attacks. Created in response to the U.S. Supreme Court striking down the Stolen Valor Act of 2005, the website is designed to deter people from falsely claiming to have been awarded military decorations for valor. It was launched on 25 July 2012 and initially contains only a small number of entries, but eventually The Pentagon hopes to expand it to become much more comprehensive.  Background  On 28 June 2012, as the United States Supreme Court struck down the Stolen Valor Act of 2005, an act which installed criminal penalties on persons making false claims about being awarded valor awards for service in the United States military. In the ruling, the members of the court wrote they saw the act as a violation of the First Amendment of the United States Constitution. Several U.S. lawmakers, including members of the Senate Armed Services Committee, sought to reinstall penalties for lying about awards, and officials at The Pentagon began an internal review of alternatives, namely creating a website to track all awards. The U.S. military does not have a single database of valor awards on its own, as such awards are typically managed locally within units, where the records and documents are kept. Privately run databases such as the \\"Military Times Hall of Valor\\" exist with documents of decorations of 100,000 servicemembers, and some military organizations do keep comprehensive data on the numbers of awards received, notably the U.S. Army Human Resources Command, though it does not identify the names of individual recipients. In its decision to strike down the Stolen Valor Act, the Supreme Court suggested such a database be created. For several years prior to the announcement, U.S. military officials had ruled out an online database of valor awards as impractical. A 2009 Pentagon review noted such a database would not be viable, in part because of the 1973 National Archives fire which destroyed documentation of many servicemembers' decorations, as well as privacy concerns, which would limit the use of certain information on such a site, such as date of birth and Social Security numbers of each recipient. Officials said this information would be necessary for full confirmation of the awards. In its decision to strike down the Stolen Valor Act, the Supreme Court suggested such a database be created. As recently as 5 July 2012, military officials continued to maintain that such a database would be impractical, but five days later on July 10, officials announced they were considering the idea. On 23 July 2012, President Barack Obama announced the database would be created within a few days, hosted at valor.defense.gov, in an effort to reduce the number of fraudulent award claims. White House officials said this website would not affect congressional efforts to introduce new legislation to replace the Stolen Valor Act, only that it would make it easier for people to verify award recipients online, but that it was a direct response to the Stolen Valor Act being struck down. The website launched on 25 July 2012.  Contents and scope  On the day of its launch, the site contained only 10 entries; the 10 U.S. who had been awarded the Medal of Honor for actions since the September 11, 2001 attacks, and included only each recipient's name, rank, and the campaign in which they received the decoration. The Department of Defense has stated it intends to expand the database to eventually include all recipients of the Distinguished Service Cross, Navy Cross and Air Force Cross since 11 September 2001. They also hope to include recipients of the Silver Star Medal as well. Staffers are considering compiling information for awards presented before 11 September 2001, but have said a 1973 fire at a records center in St. Louis that destroyed millions of servicemembers' files would make such efforts difficult. They also noted awards prior to that time often have far less documentation, making them more difficult to independently verify.

A special edition of the album was also released which contained bonus material, including acoustic performances, guitar tutorials and two music videos, alongside the album tracks. Two of the tracks on the album, \\"No Way Out\\" and \\"A Man Left Behind\\", had previously been released on the EP, The Life They Lead. Background Following the release of their first mini-album They All Have Two Faces, the band wanted to act quickly and get a full album out within a year. After touring in support of their first album they got together in September 2009 to start recording their next album. However things didn't go as planned and it would be almost a further three years before the album would be released. During the intermediate period, Fei Comodo released an EP, The Life They Lead, which included two tracks, \\"No Way Out\\" and \\"A Man Left Behind\\", which would later feature on Behind The Bright Lights. During this time the band members starting pursuing other musical ventures, and by the time \\"Behind The Bright Lights\\" was ready for release, the band announced their separation due to no longer being the same people they were when they recorded the music. PledgeMusic Project On 17 February 2012 Fei Comodo announced that they were intending to release a special edition of Behind The Bright Lights and were running a project using PledgeMusic, a crowd funding website, in order to do so. By receiving pre-orders of the album through the site, the band were able to generate the required capital to produce the special edition - an example of fan-funded music. Fans were also able to purchase a variety of other exclusive content through the site, such as signed set lists, guitar lessons and private acoustic performances by the band. As an extra incentive, the band posted studio updates and released certain material early to fans who pre-ordered the album. Behind The Bright Lights was released two weeks before the official release date, via download, to fans who had 'pledged' on the album. Supporting tour The band went out during the summer of 2012 to play a series of final shows after the release of Behind The Bright Lights, with support coming from I Divide, Evarose and Paige.

The station transmits from the WLKN tower in Newton and covers the Manitowoc/Two Rivers market, along with eastern Sheboygan County, including Sheboygan. The station is owned by Mark Seehafer through Seehafer Broadcasting Corporation, which is the station's licensee. The station's allocation has been proposed by the FCC since 1996, going through three owners who failed to build the facilities before previous owner Mark Heller's purchase of the license in 2013. The station began broadcasting via program test authority on the evening of December 7, 2013 at 10pm, broadcasting until December 9 at midnight, using a limited hour loop of easy listening music with some Christmas music mixed in due to music licensing concerns, along with weather and sports updates and small talk from Heller, and pre-recorded station identifications done by WGN's Orion Samuelson and Max Armstrong. Also part of the PTA were several jingles from the original WEMP in Milwaukee during their prime in the 1960s; the WEMP call letters were coincidentally made available when the last holder in New York City re-called their station in mid-2012 during a transition period to a new format and eventual new owners. The PTA happened nine days ahead of the expiration of the station's construction permit after the station's original plan to build a new tower in Newton was rejected by the town board. The test was performed using the studio facilities of Cleveland's WLKN (98.1), along with their antenna and transmitter just west of Newton. WLKN went off the air to allow the PTA to go forward, and also streamed the PTA in full using their website. The test ended with the signal re-tuned to 98.1 and WLKN's programming resuming as scheduled. WEMP began permanent service a year later on December 7, 2014, broadcasting from the WLKN tower with its current format, and remained commercial free during a testing period. The station was simulcast on their sister station New Holstein-licensed WLAK (1530), which operates as a daytime-only signal. WEMP utilized the basement studio of WLKN, along with sharing their post office box for correspondence their first few months on the air. In February 2015, limited commercial advertising began, along with the addition of top-of-the-hour newscasts from ABC News Radio and half-hour weather updates. The station was sold by Heller to Seehafer Broadcasting in June 2015 and moved their operations to the WOMT facility in Manitowoc, with no major changes to the format or commercial scheduling. The WLAK simulcast was dropped shortly thereafter with the end of common ownership. WLKN would itself move to Manitowoc two years later with Seehafer's purchase of the Cub Radio stations and consolidation of Seehafer's five area stations into one facility.

Holmes (born March 21, 1956) is an American politician and attorney who has been serving as Seattle City Attorney since 2010. He was elected in November 2009, defeating incumbent Tom Carr by a comfortable margin. After winning a second term uncontested in 2013, he defeated challenger Scott Lindsay in 2017 with nearly 75% of the vote. Prior to his election, Holmes served as an original member of the Seattle Police Department's Office of Professional Accountability Review Board (OPARB), a citizen review board which reviews police policy and procedures and maintains civilian oversight of the police department. He served as chair of OPARB between 2003 and 2008, during which time he advocated for public release of police records and OPARB reports. Early life and education Holmes was born in Richmond, Virginia, and grew up in Buckingham County. He earned a Bachelor of Arts from Yale College, majoring in American studies with a concentration in energy and environmental sciences. After graduating in 1978, Holmes went to work at the Natural Resources Defense Council in Washington D.C. In 1984, he earned his law degree from the University of Virginia School of Law. He remained in private bankruptcy practice in Ohio and Seattle for over 25 years. 2009 campaign In March 2009, Holmes announced that he would challenge incumbent City Attorney Tom Carr, largely because of disagreements over the handling public disclosure for OPARB and police records, as well as the proper role of the City Attorney. Carr stated that he represented city government and provided \\"neutral legal advice,\\" whereas Holmes stated that he would act as an advocate for the people of Seattle. Holmes promised not to prosecute marijuana possession, in line with a 2003 voter-approved initiative making it the lowest priority for law enforcement. Carr maintained that prosecution of possession \\"in conjunction with other crimes\\" was within his authority as City Attorney. Eventually, Holmes received endorsements from both The Seattle Times and The Stranger. Holmes won the election by a 26-point margin, and ran unopposed in 2013. In office In the winter of 2010-2011, opponents of the Alaskan Way Viaduct replacement tunnel collected signatures to place both an initiative and a referendum opposing the project on the ballot. The proposed initiative, I-101, sought to void the contracts made between the City of Seattle and the State of Washington, while the referendum sought to approve or reject the contracts once they had been finalized by the City Council. In March, Holmes filed a motion with the King County Superior Court seeking a declaratory judgment against the proposed referendum, on the grounds that referenda are typically used to seek citizen review of legislation, not administrative contracts. The court allowed one of the eight sections of the referendum to go to ballot, where construction of the tunnel was eventually approved by voters. Holmes also sued to prevent Initiative 101 from making the same ballot, arguing that a city initiative could not prevent the state from constructing a state highway. The court agreed, and Initiative 101 was struck from the August ballot. Shortly after taking office, Holmes directed prosecutors to seek 364-day maximum sentences for misdemeanor crimes. By reducing sentences a single day, Holmes sought to avoid automatic deportations and treat citizens the same as non-citizens. A year later, the Washington State Legislature changed the maximum sentence for misdemeanor crimes to 364 days, in part at Holmes' urging. Legal residents convicted of felonies, as well as misdemeanor domestic violence, still face deportation under the law. =Marijuana policy= Holmes addressing the crowd from the main stage of the 2012 Seattle Hempfest In the months after Holmes was elected, arrests for possession of marijuana increased significantly, but none of these cases were prosecuted. He authored an editorial in the Seattle Times calling for legalization, and thereafter sponsored Washington Initiative 502 to legalize, tax and regulate marijuana for adult recreational use. As one of its earliest sponsors, Holmes edited drafts of the initiative and secured the support of John McKay, a former United States Attorney. Holmes frequently provided his legal opinion in local press, radio, and television broadcasts, and took part in public debates as an advocate of legalization where he framed the issue as a method of confronting racially disproportionate drug enforcement. On Election Day, Initiative 502 passed by ten points. In an August 2013 Department of Justice memo, the Obama Administration stated its intent to watch state legalization efforts unfold without intervention. Holmes's involvement in I-502 led to what the state's Public Disclosure Commission characterized as inadvertent, minor violations of state law, due to his failure to consistently keep his advocacy completely separate from the marijuana policy aspects of his city work. =Police reforms= In 2011, the Seattle Police Department was investigated by the Department of Justice, which found that officers had engaged in a pattern or practice of excessive use of force. The Justice Department alleged that one in every five uses of force by an officer violated the Constitution's protections against illegal search and seizure, and further noted concerns about discriminatory policing. In two separate letters addressed to Holmes, Justice Department attorney Jonathan Smith accused City officials of negotiating in poor faith after several documents related to the investigation were leaked by the City. Shortly after this, Holmes sent the mayor's office a strongly worded letter urging him and the City's negotiating team to cooperate with the Justice Department, and warning that the July 31 negotiating deadline set by the Department was likely the last chance for the City to avoid a federal lawsuit. Following a series of last-minute negotiations, the City and Justice Department arrived at a workable compromise on July 26; a settlement agreement announced the next day included substantial reforms of police practices. Holmes and the mayor sparred over Merrick Bobb’s eventual appointment as federal monitor and approval of the monitor’s first monitoring plan. At the March 12, 2013 status conference, U.S. District Ct Judge James Robart approved Mr. Bobb’s proposed monitoring plan, effectively ending the public feud between Holmes and the mayor. In the ensuing 2013 campaign, Holmes endorsed the incumbent mayor’s opponent, Ed Murray. Murray won the election, along with Holmes, who ran unopposed. Mayor Murray, the candidate endorsed by Holmes, pledged to embrace federal reforms and appointed Kathleen O'Toole to be Seattle’s Chief of Police.

Education and early work Humphrey received her M.A. at Goddard College, Boston in 1972 and her M.F.A. at York University, Toronto in 1978. In the 1980s she became known for works made with wax, plaster, wood, and wire armatures. These abstract sculptures alluded to and were directly informed by bodily processes and the human form, “the body’s operating systems, its electrical and mechanical structures.” Susan Krane. Nene Humphrey: Matrix. catalog essay Her emphasis on material specificity drew comparisons to postminimal sculptors like Eva Hesse. Patricia Rosoff. Nene Humphrey: Carnal Knowledge. Sculpture Magazine, Dec. 2004. Like Hesse's anti-forms, Humphrey's sculptures referenced minimalism’s formal severity and also examined it critically. Close observation of these works revealed textures by turns soft and ragged, an effect of eroding the surface and “literally scarring or wounding the form.” Susan Krane. Nene Humphrey: Matrix. catalog essay As Art in America observed of the work in 1992, “Sterile from a distance, their tactile and organic qualities become evident as one approaches… Paradoxically, this crudeness softens the work’s appearance.” Amy Jinkner-Lloyd. Nene Humphrey at Sandler Hudson. Art in America. Dec. 1992. Her work Breathing Wall for Vesalius (1985–86) was made after a back injury left her incapacitated, resulting in drawing studies and a series of sculptural structures with spine- like columns. Spoons and A Wild Patience In the mid 1990s Humphrey made a series of works in collaboration with the artist's mother, a homemaker from whose “unheroic” house-bound labor Humphrey previously “had felt disconnected.”Susan Krane. Nene Humphrey: A Wild Patience. catalog essay Accepting an offer of help in her studio during one of her mother's visits, Humphrey was made aware of the relationship between her practice and her training under her mother during childhood. Humphrey's Spoon series developed out of an interest in domestic handcraft, and the connection between imprints left by the body and its reciprocal marks in acts such as sewing, scouring, sweeping and braiding. Later compared to Janine Antoni’s silver spoon casts (Umbilical edition, 2000) , the resulting Mother’s Spoon casts (1996) were meditations on the nature of the related gestures of stirring and feeding alongside their sculptural counterparts. Loculus Humphrey’s Loculus series (1999–2001) continued the artist’s interest in meditative repetition. The Loculus works involved masses of hand-stitched red discs, affixed to the wall or standing structures by trails of thread. As Ariella Budick noted in Newsday Magazine in 2000, the works had a biological appearance “like an enlargement of clustered cells. (The title refers to the cavities in a plant ovary.)”Ariella Budick. Woman to Woman.Newsday Magazine. April 23, 2000. These clusters drew comparisons both to the biologic imagery of blood clots and spermazoa, and more figuratively to strategic maps and prom corsages. Works from Humphrey's Loculus series were shown at Kiang Gallery in Atlanta, Dorsky Gallery in New York, the Islip Art Museum in Islip, NY, and were included in Site and Insight at MoMA PS1 in 2003. Plain Sense of Things and Circling the Center Following the death of her husband, Humphrey embarked upon a multidisciplinary project reflecting on the psychological process of mourning, and its physiological index in the mourner's brain. In collaboration with scientists at the New York University LeDoux neuroscience laboratory, where she has been an artist in residence since 2005, Humphrey worked to create visualizations from recorded data of brain activity in the amygdala, the part of the brain where emotions reside. Drawings extrapolated from these images served as the framework for a series of two-dimensional, installation, video and sound works. Its first iteration debuted at Lesley Heller Gallery under the title The Plain Sense of Things. Of the multiple levels of content the exhibition confronted, New York Times critic Holland Cotter wrote, “Order and chaos do battle here; the territory charted is both global… and microscopic.” In a later installation titled Circling the Center at Savannah College of Art and Design, the drawings were shown alongside a performance overseen by Humphrey and featuring SCAD students, faculty and alumni. “Inspired by Victorian mourning braiding, a 19th century tradition in which loved ones would weave the deceased’s hair into a cherished memento,” performers amassed wire braids which were added to a central structure each day, “to create a multimedia experience devoted to the persistence of memory.” Roberto C. Lange contributed a score incorporating chants the weavers used to mark their process, Humphrey's recordings of the brain waves of mice in distress, and ambient sound. Such multimedia collaborations characterize Humphrey's recent work and place the artist in what Cristina Albu referred to as \\"[...] the role of hidden orchestrator of a drama that transcends individual tragedy.\\"Cristina Albu. Modeling the Psyche: Nene Humphrey's Multisensory Enactment of Empathic Entanglement. Afterimage the Journal of Media Arts and Cultural Criticism, Vol. 44, No. 6. In its most multimedia encompassing incarnation to date, Circling the Center was staged in the round at 3LD Art & Technology Center in New York. A live cello player playing Lange's score and four performers braiding and chanting in four-part harmonies moved through a set of braiding tables and sloping scrims upon which videos were projected. Though all elements adhered to a close choreography, the piece played with time in such a way that Carey Dunne described: \\"What makes the performance so spellbinding is that, like grief itself, it doesn’t quite feel over even when it’s supposed to be. It sparks an eerie sense that, like something out of a fable, this woman’s process is never-ending.\\"Carey Dunne. A Performance Where Victorian Mourning Braiding Meets Neuroscience. Hyperallergic.

Sakala Janula samme or All peoples strike is the biggest protest of all. The strike lasted for over six weeks mainly affecting public services and local economy. On a call given by JAC, road blockades on national highways throughout Telangana, rail blockade and the strike of auto rikshaw union were organised on 24 and 25 September causing disruption in transport services. As the All People's strike entered the 30th day on 14 October 2011, Medak's MP Vijayashanti criticised the Congress high command for the delay in making the decision on Telangana and said Congress wants the issue to prolong until 2014. She further said the strike should continue until the formation of Telanana state. After 42 days, on 24 October, government employees unions called off the strike. Kodandaram said that the strike had impacted the overall thinking of the Centre towards creation of separate State and the movement will continue with other protest activities. Sakala Janula Samme On 12 September 2011, a day before Sakala Janula Samme(All people's strike), TRS organised a public meeting in Karimnagar which was attended by over a million people including TJAC leaders, BJP and New Democracy party leaders. Starting 13 September, as part of 'strike by all section of people' supporting Telangana statehood, government employees throughout Telangana stayed out of work, lawyers boycotted courts and 60,000 coal miners of Singareni Collieries(SCCL Ltd.) also joined the strike. On 14 & 15 September, nearly 450 movie Theaters in Telangana were closed at the call given by Telangana film chamber. Starting 16 September, government teachers joined the strike. Private school managements declared one day holiday in support of the strike. On 19 September, state road transport corporation employees and state electricity board employees in Telangana joined the indefinite strike. On a call given by JAC, road blockades on national highways throughout Telangana, rail blockade and the strike of auto rikshaw union were organised on 24 and 25 September causing disruption in transport services. Virtually all sections of people joined this strike. On 30 September, as the strike entered the 18th day, even while Congress central leadership met several Telangana congress leaders, JAC called a bundh in Hyderabad city. On 2 October, JAC leaders, employee unions leaders and TRS leaders including KCR met Prime minister to explain the situation in Telangna due to the strike and asked to expedite the decision on the statehood demand. The strike has resulted in an unprecedented power crisis in the state with only 223 MU of power generated against the demand of 275MU impacting both the industry and agriculture. On 9 October, some workers of the Youth Congress agitated and threw chairs at each other at the Gandhi Bhavan in Hyderabad demanding postponement of a membership drive till an official announcement on Telangana. They also demanded that a separate Telangana Youth Congress be formed for the youth from Telangana. On 10 October, Telangana activists attacked a private college in Hyderabad and threw stones at the windows of a college in Kukatpally, where majority residents are migrants from Andhra region, badly damaging the window panes. Worried parents of some children protested outside the college demanding that schools and colleges be excluded from the strikes and conflicts as the students have missed classes for a month already. The majority of colleges and schools remained shut in the twin cities of Hyderabad and Secunderabad. After being criticised by both the Congress high command as well as the Centre over how he has been handling the issue, CM N Kiran Kumar Reddy said that the government would adopt a zero-tolerance system and will initiate stern action against anyone trying to create any law and order problem or cause any inconvenience to the people. He cautioned them saying that the stir is spoiling the prospects of the youth. After 22 days of strike, the APSRTC resumed plying buses after one of the unions suspended the strike. Telangana union leaders condemned the decision and said that a union leader belonging to Andhra-Seema region had no right to withdraw the strike. This led to split in the union and Telangana union leaders floated a separate body and decided to continue the strike. Due to this, only few buses returned to service. On 13 October, the parents of most school-going children warned the TJAC that to call of the strike for the schools and colleges by 15 October after which they will chalk out their course of action. Eight Congress MPs from Telangana, who resigned in July demanding a separate state of Telangana, insisted the speaker to accept their resignations on 12 October. They also demanded that the Group-II exams, screening test for thousands of state government jobs, be postponed until the strike is over. As the All People's strike entered the 30th day on 14 October 2011, Medak's MP Vijayashanti criticised the Congress high command for the delay in making the decision on Telangana and said Congress wants the issue to prolong until 2014. She further said the strike should continue until the formation of Telanana state. On that day, the government of Andhra Pradesh decided to hold talks with the Employees Joint Action Committee and initiate action against uniformed personnel who participated in the strike KT Rama Rao alleged that the CM of Andhra Pradesh was bribing the T Congress MLAs to lure them out of the agitation. This was strongly refuted by the Congress leaders who demanded an apology from KTR and challenged him to reveal the names of MLAs who took bribe. On the 1st day of Rail blockade on 15 October 110 trains were cancelled and 68 trains were diverted. The railways operated 12 trains and Hyderabad metro trails with full police protection. Telangana protestors tried to have sit in on rail platforms or on railway tracks at various places. Police arrested thousands of protesters including 8 MPs and 4 MLAs. On same day, employee unions of road transport corporation called off the strike. On 16 October, JAC gave a call for Telangana Bundh(general strike) for next day to protest police action during the agitation and the rail blockade. They then cancelled the 3rd day of rail blockade. Teachers union also said they will attend the schools in the interest of students but they will not sign the attendance registers and will not take the salaries. Some teachers donated the salary they got for the strike period. They felt that teachers have become scapegoats at the hands of their state leaders who have a personal agenda and called off the strike as part of this. Normal life was again affected as the public transport facilities, especially busses which were properly resumed after the 28-day- long strike were again off the roads. Schools, colleges and offices were again shut for 17 October, as the agitation continued. On the same day, Coal miners called off their strike. On 17 October, Pocharam Srinivas Reddy, who resigned from assembly and from TDP to join TRS, was re-elected to assembly. He got about 68% of polled votes while his opponent from congress got 27% votes. TDP did not field a candidate. After his victory in Banswada bypoll, which was far lesser margin than he anticipated, he warned Andhra settlers in the region with dire consequences for not voting for him. He had hoped for one lakh majority in the byelection in view of the ongoing high voltage Telangana movement. He accused Andhra settlers of ignoring the Telangana sentiment and voting for his opponent. This hurt the feelings of settlers in the region. =Efforts to end strike= With the agitation for statehood to Telangana intensifying, the congress has decided to speed up all the discussions and quickly solve the problem. On 30 September 2011 Ghulam Nabi Azad, Congress party's AP state in-charge, submitted to Congress president an internal party report about Telangana issue after holding consultations with leaders from Telangana, Rayalaseema and coastal Andhra regions for over two months. On 8 October, Azad said that the key leaders of the Congress and the centre have met nine leaders from Andhra Pradesh including the chief minister and are working on finding a solution to the issue as soon as possible. PM Manmohan Singh indicated that resolving the Telangana statehood issue might \\"take some time.\\" Maintaining that there has not been any \\"inaction\\" by the government over the crisis, the Prime Minister said that \\"given the complications involved in settlement, it will take some time.\\" Dr Singh said that the government \\"is engaged in widespread dialogue and discussions with all the stakeholders and hopes to reach a win-win situation for all concerned through the process.\\" After 42 days, on 24 October, government employees unions called off the strike. Kodandaram said that the strike had impacted the overall thinking of the Centre towards creation of separate State and the movement will continue with other protest activities. =Criticism of the Strike= Madiga Reservation Porata Samiti (MRPS) president criticised that KCR, TJAC Chairman Kodandaram, Harish Rao and others were encouraging the students to take active part in the ongoing agitation for Telangana, and alleged that they were not allowing their own children to take part in the stir. While demanding that the Telangana leaders disclose the details of where their children were pursuing studies, he said that children from oppressed sections of the society, were being deprived of the opportunity to pursue studies, under the influence of the T-stir, while the children from the T-leaders were being sent abroad or other areas, to pursue studies without any disturbance. This opinion was also voiced by Samaikyandhra protagonists who pointed out that while farmers, school children, parents and general public were facing untold misery due to the strike, the life of rich people like KCR continues to be luxurious as they ply in high-end cars and their children study in top corporate schools, which remain open despite the crippling strike. On 22 October, activists of the Prajasanghala (People's organisations) JAC protested in front of Prof. Kodandram's house alleging that the TJAC changed its stand on Sakala Janula Samme and on a separate Telangana after Kodandaram and KCR's visit to New Delhi. They alleged the TJAC had entered into a pact with the Centre and is deliberately diluting the movement. On 11 October, a case was filed against KCR, under IPC section 153, for delivering instigating speeches and creating rift between people from different regions in the state. FIR said that he had tried to instigate people to attack Telangana representatives for not resigning for the cause of Telangana. Later that day, Police have also added the two leaders Swami Goud and Vithal of the Telangana Joint Action Committee after they demanded that the Police of Hyderabad city would also join the struggle for a separate state. The Samaikyandhra Joint Action Committee reported that KCR was behaving rudely while he was in Telangana region and wise when he was Delhi, at the Union government. They also demanded that the government should seize the properties of KCR as to recover from the losses caused by the All people's strike. Many Telangana activists headed by Telangana Praja Front leader Gaddar are contemplating to form a new party to take the Telangana movement forward. Dr Sangam Prithviraj, leader of the Telangana Students Joint Action Committee, who supports Gaddar in forming the new political force, also blamed KCR for the movement fizzling out. \\"KCR kept the students out of the agitation this time and this was an intentional ploy to ensure that the new state is not formed,\\" he said. =Losses due to the strike= *While the striking employees of RTC got their wages and bonuses for the strike period, the corporation has been hit by financial crisis. APSRTC already with a Rs. 310 crore loss in the financial year suffered another Rs. 200 crore loss due to the \\"Sakala Janula Samme\\". *On 19 October, Singareni staff from 3 districts who were striking for 35 days resumed their work after the management agreed to adjust leave against strike period with wages. The strike resulted in a loss of Rs. 600 crore for the Singareni Collieries Co Ltd. An additional Rs. 120 crores was lost towards payment of wages to employees for the strike period. *A generation loss of 546.2 Million Unit (MU) and 294.9 MU respectively in Ramagundam and Simhadri Thermal Power Stations situated in Andhra Pradesh was reported by NTPC due to shortage of coal. Andhra Pradesh Power Generation Corporation Ltd. (APGENCO) also reported a generation loss of 28 MU in their Kakatiya thermal power station during the same period. *The state government also lost around Rs. 250 crore due to power purchases from other states. It also affected the production of long steel in India. *The water board suffered Rs. 5 crore loss during the strike. *The South Central railway lost Rs. 12.63 crores till 24 September due to the rail roko programmes. *The Assocham estimated tangible losses in excess of Rs. 10,000 crores in only 15 days of the strike. *A revenue loss of Rs. 50 crore every day to the government due to strike by excise employees. *Manufacturers of active pharmaceutical ingredients that go into medication have lost Rs. 500 crore till 26 September because of the strike. *Northern Power Distribution Company Ltd's (NPDCL) revenues amounting to Rs 320 crores were held up In response to a lawsuit that seeks a direction that a new state shouldn't be carved out from the parent territory, the Supreme Court of India took strong exception to the prolonged agitation during which normal life gets affected, courts become paralysed and colossal damage is done to public property. It sought responses from the AP government and TRS. Aftermath On 29 October 2011, three Congress party MLAs belonging to Telangana region resigned and joined TRS in protest as they were disappointed with Congress leadership's delay in Telangana state formation. With fears of Maoists infiltrating the Telangana movement, the CM of Andhra Pradesh was provided with bullet proof podium for his speech on AP formation day on 1 November 2011. On 1 November, Congress MLA Komatireddy Venkat Reddy started an indefinite hunger strike until the central government announced a roadmap for Telangana state. 5 days later, the fast was broken when police arrested him under Section 309 of IPC (attempt to commit suicide) and shifted him to NIMS, Hyderabad where he was kept under intravenous fluids. He ended his fast on 9 November. The 97-year- old Freedom fighter Konda Laxman Bapuji also launched his week-long satyagraha at Jantar Mantar in New Delhi, demanding statehood to the region. On 7 November 2011 Actress Shriya Saran was attacked by a mob claiming to be TRS activists during a shoot in Hyderabad. They threatened her to say 'Jai Telangana' by shouting out cuss words. The actress later tweeted, > How can they break my car, throw stones, stop shoot and threaten me to say > Jai Telangana. That too in broad day light, Police staring at all of this. > What about freedom and safety? Thank god the stone didn't hit me. Both the > windows of my car are broken. I am disgusted, I'm born in India. I deserve > my freedom and safety is my right (sic). TRS activists also attacked Parakala Prabhakar when in a Television interview he said that there was no Telangana sentiment among people and whatever Prof. Jayashankar claimed about injustice meted out to Telangana was false propaganda and he was ready to prove his point given a chance. On 10 November 2011 Andhra Pradesh State Director General of Police said there is no active involvement of Maoists in the Telangana movement. After the proposal by UP Chief Minister Mayawati to split Uttar Pradesh into four states, the BJP, which is a strong advocate of smaller states, demanded formation of the second State Reorganisation Commission (SRC) for restructuring and splitting big states into smaller ones. Minister of State for Home Affairs, Jitendra Singh informed in the Rajya Sabha that the government of India will move to create a new state only when there is a consensus in the parent state that one part be separated to form a new state. In December 2011, TRS Politburo member C Sudhakar was sentenced to one year in jail under the provisions of National Security Act. He was arrested during the Sakala Janula Samme on the charges that he hurled stones on RTC buses and prevented Andhra region buses from plying in Telangana. On 19 January 2012, BJP led by State party president Kishan Reddy started the 22-day Telangana 'Poru Yatra', a journey of 3500 km in Telangana, to touch 986 villages and 88 assembly constituencies stressing the need for Telangana stance. Though the tour was successful in reiterating the party's pro-Telangana stance, it could not garner as much support as hoped because of the indifferent attitude of the TRS & TJAC. In fact the failure of the TRS in declaring its support to Kishan Reddy's yatra has resulted in growing differences between the two parties.http://dailypioneer.com/nation/42239-only-bjp-can-fulfill-the-dream- of-telangana.html See also *Samaikyandhra Movement *Vishalandhra Movement *Telangana Movement References External links * Telangana Talks – Voice your opinion for Separation * Telanaga movement article in US Library of Congress * Official history of AP on AP government website * Video (30 minutes): Still Seeking Justice – A documentary on Telangana * Some research papers by Telangana proponents * State reorganisation committee reports at Wikisource * How SKC Report tried to suppress truth and deceive Telangana – Published by Telangana Development Forum 2011 in India Protests in India Telangana movement 2011 protests Manmohan Singh administration Telangana Rashtra Samithi ","title":"Late 2011 Telangana protests"},{"id":"36543018","text":"P.

Commonly known as the dune brittlestem, this agaric primarily grows on sand dunes near marram grass, feeding saprotrophically on the decaying roots. The season of growth is generally May to November. P. ammophila is variable in appearance, changing colour and shape during its lifespan. Initially bell-shaped and tan or pale brown, the cap gradually flattens and darkens, becoming dark brown with a depressed shape as it ages. Taxonomy Psathyrella ammophila was first described in 1868 by Michel Charles Durieu de Maisonneuve and Joseph-Henri Léveillé in one of Durieu de Maisonneuve's publications on the flora and fauna of Algeria, Exploration scientifique de l'Algérie: Sciences naturelles, botanique. They gave it the scientific name Agaricus ammophilus. The species was identified and described a further five times under different names, until 1960, when the botanist P.D. Orton gave the definitive classification in the journal Transactions of the British Mycological Society (now Fungal Biology). The genus name Psathyrella is a diminutive form of Psathyra, derived from the Greek word meaning \\"friable\\", psathuros (ψαθυρος). This name, like the common name brittlestem for many of the Psathyrella species, is related to the fragile nature of the cap and stem. The specific epithet ammophila originates from the Greek words ammos (ἄμμος), meaning sand, and phillia (ϕιλος), meaning lover, a reference to the mushroom's sand dune habitat. Description Typically small- to medium-sized, P. ammophila is found growing singly or in small clumps near marram grass. The cap is a light clay-brown or tan when younger and about in diameter. Although the cap is generally smooth, it possesses microscopically tiny hairs and is often coated with sand particles. The tissue is not hygrophanous and therefore does not change colour with moisture loss and absorption, but the mushrooms do darken to a dark brown as they age. Cap shape begins as campanulate or convex, gradually flattening and possibly becoming depressed in shape. The gills of P. ammophila are crowded and attached to the stem usually broadly (adnate) but occasionally narrowly (adnexed). At a very young age they may be a pallid brown, but for most of the lifespan are dark brown, sometimes turning black. The stipe/stem is light grey to pale brown and centrally attached to the cap. The surface is smooth, sometimes with small vertical ridges. It is deeply rooted in the substrate for feeding on the roots of marram grass and for stability in its sand dune habitat. Above ground, its height is typically tall and its diameter is slender, about . There is no ring. The basidia bear four spores. The spores are dark brown and smooth, ellipsoid in shape, and 10 to 11 µm × 6 to 7 µm. There is a large germ pore on each spore. Flesh of the cap and stem is pale, thin, and brittle. Neither the taste nor the odour of the mushroom is distinctive, and it is considered inedible, though not particularly noted as being toxic. Conocybe dunensis is a similar species that is mainly differentiated from P. ammophila by the rust colour of its gills. Distribution and habitat Psathyrella ammophila has a wide but sparse distribution throughout the European continent and in limited coastal locations outside Europe, with records of collection in Algeria, New Zealand, and Canada. It can sometimes be found near the shoreline, inside the littoral zone, but is most often encountered in more stable and established sand dunes and dune slacks inland. The presence of marram grass nearby is a key aspect of its habitat, as it has a symbiotic (specifically, commensal) relationship with the plants, using their decaying roots as food. The mushrooms grow singly or in clumps and are, to some degree, sympatric with the fly Delia albula. The fungivorous larvae of the fly develops in P. ammophila parasitically, though will also attack other fungi.

It features full motion video sequences and actual underwater footage, the first game to do so.http://www.interactivemovies.org/design/officialtext.php?code=sacredmirrorofkofun Plot The game is set in 1999 (three years into the future) on the Antares, a futuristic nautical research lab which sails off from Honolulu. The player character is Chris Young, a former racecar driver and Gulf War pilot, who was hired by Cousteau because of his interest in marine technology, to pilot the Antares and find the ideal location to launch the Poseidon research lab. Early in the game, the player receive a videophone message from Steve Grant of the \\"Worldwide Heritage Foundation\\". Archeologist John Braddy was after a sacred Japanese mirror of the Kofun period which belonged to a Japanese warlord Ishuta who led the Yamato armies to fend off invaders from the Kinai plains. The mirror was given to him as a talisman by his wife, Maiko. It was said that its reflection helped him defeat his enemies and afterwards his victory was engraved on the mirror. After his death, it was buried in his kofun (tomb). Fifty years after World War II, an ancient document came to light which established the mirror's historicity. Grant had failed to find the mirror but Braddy found Ishuta's lost tomb. The player has to navigate the Antares to the wrecks and reefs of the West Pacific and the Palau Archipelago, explore islands, gather clues and combine them using the database of EDWARD to unfold more clues. The educational portion of the game includes scuba diving with the aid of the Angel Shark diver propulsion vehicle, taking photographs of the sea fauna and then cataloguing them to EDWARD. The player is additionally tasked to locate Braddy. =Characters= There are several characters the player can interact with, mainly from the ship's intercom. *Jean-Michel Cousteau - In the game, Cousteau was given the responsibility by the \\"International Scientific Committee\\" to produce several programs in order to evaluate the health of planet Earth. *Steve Grant (Nat Benchley) - The head of the \\"International Scientific Committee\\" and board member of the influential \\"Worldwide Heritage Foundation\\". With Cousteau he studies the global environmental trends and their effects on the coral reefs. He is also interested in finding Ishuta's mirror and after he failed, he sent Braddy after it. *EDWARD (Jon Radulovic) - An Artificial Intelligence created by Dr. Paul Sinus, who runs the Antares and also the interface of its mainframe. EDWARD stands for the words Encyclopedia- Database-WorldNet-Album-Reports-Disconnect. EDWARD also contains Jean-Michel Cousteau's Encyclopedia of the Sea built into, with information on underwater ecology, fauna, the geography and history of Micronesia, and the actual Japanese ships that sunk in the Chuuk Lagoon, including tonnage, dimensions and blueprints. *Luciana Capucci (Faby Schneider) - An Italian specialist in underwater biology. She is on board the Antares to help the player locate the ideal spot for the Poseidon. *Paul Sinus (John Gallagher) - A scientist introduced by Cousteau to the team, the inventor of the Poseidon, the Antares, the Angel Shark and EDWARD. His main duty is to keep the high tech equipment aboard the ship working *Ann Fong (Valentine Zhou) - A Chinese historian, expert in ancient Japanese legends. She is the last to join the crew early in the game, as soon as the fate of Braddy is known. *John Braddy (Ian Marshall) - The scientist who looked for the Sacred Mirror and was lost. Gameplay The interface of the game is that of a typical first person point-and-click puzzle adventure game. The player explores environments depicted through a large series of computer generated stills, using mouse clicks for movement or to manipulate objects within reach. Environments include the CGI sections and corridors of the Antares or natural environment exploration on the islands, generated by actual photographs. ;Antares :On the Antares the player can visit several locations and stations, including his cabin, the bridge, where he can plot course to new destinations to the automap, access EDWARD, or talk to the crew through the communications station. Movement is done by clicking on the environment or directly on the desired destination on the ship's layout. At the hangar it's possible to perform a dive with an Angel Shark, or the Inflatable boat to access an island. ;Dives :When the player dives, the screen changes into the control of an Angel Shark. The dive is actually a full motion video; similar to a rail shooter, the player has to pay attention and click on hotspots in order to take photographs. Although these sequences have no interactivity, at some points the player has the opportunity to select a branch of the route. Whenever the oxygen tank reserve nears the end, the player can return to the ship and repeat the dive from the latest branch point. :According to the location and the objectives, the photographs taken are either of sea fauna (for the studies of Dr. Capucci) or of the Japanese shipwrecks, gathering clues about the Mirror. ;Exploration :At several points of the adventure, the player disembarks on the islands of Eten, Peleliu and Anguar. The player explores the environment (the backgrounds are scanned photographs), takes photographs of clues (the available film is limited to 18) and solves some inventory-based puzzles in order to advance further. The photographs are taken to EDWARD for further analysis. ;EDWARD :Much of the game action takes place on EDWARD. The mainframe contains Cousteau's encyclopedia, stores data and photographs and gives access to the WorldNet. On EDWARD, the player has to sort out the underwater photographs to aid Dr. Capucci's studies. EDWARD also analyses photographs and other data to help determine the fate of the Mirror and the whereabouts of Dr. Braddy. The player also can \\"search\\" the Net by using a combination of several gathered keywords; the results are often text with new clues, new photographs or new keywords. There are also some mind puzzles that must be solved, in order to help EDWARD decipher e.g. some obscure writing and so on. Production The game was produced by Paris-based Future Concepts, a subsidiary of IDP. It was envisioned as the first part of an edutainment multimedia title series under the name The Interactive Adventures of Jean-Michel Cousteau.End credits of the game Cousteau was excited by the possibilities of interactive CD-ROM technology which would not only help his work reach young people, but allow them to participate. Pre-production begun in early 1995, and development and design took place in Paris, simultaneously with filming. The project cost roughly 8 million French francs. The virtual setting of the ship Antares was designed with Cousteau's naval officer as a consultant. According to Cousteau, a ship like the Antares might become reality in the future. =Filming and scripting= In summer, a team consisting of oceanographers, photographers and a scriptwriter, led by Cousteau, transported equipment from Los Angeles to Chuuk Atoll, Micronesia. Production lasted several weeks (one in Chuuk and 2 in Palau) during which they took several photographs and video footage around the island and the ocean; Cousteau and his team performed 4-5 dives a day. A location featured prominently was the Chuuk Lagoon, famous for the more than 100 shipwrecks that sunk during Operation Hailstone of the WWII. The project was marked when one torpedo, whose compressed air container of its propulsion system had rusted away, and exploded while the team were down. The plot was written simultaneously with the brainstorming and the reviewing and selection of the footage. =Marketing= Since the game play was weak by gamers standards special care was given to advertising which encompassed several media and highlight Cousteau's name and participation. Development problems encountered in late testing resulted in release delays, so the game was released in late November, after the hype subsided. Package The game package included a demo CD, a 3.5 inch floppy with Saved Games, an Evaluation Guide, and an overview brochure in the form of a passport. Reception Despite an ambitious project, the game was not well received and passed rather unnoticed, mostly because of its limited or buggy gameplay. There are currently very little reviews on the game.Kevin J. McCann, Computer & Net Player, volume 3, number 10, March, 1997, pg. 83, 60% Sequels The game was envisioned as the first title of The Interactive Adventures of Jean-Michel Cousteau series. Shortly after the production of the game, and according to its success and financial backing, Cousteau considered a new interactive adventure in the freshwater caves of Yucatan and the blue holes of Belize, however such plans did not come to fruition.

Zellar's writing often is accompanied by photographs; he has collaborated several times with photographer Alec Soth. The Coen brothers film A Serious Man, nominated for the 2009 Academy Award for Best Picture, took some inspiration for the visuals based on Zellar's book the Suburban World: The Norling Photos. His book Conductors of the Moving World was named in TIME's \\"Best of 2011: The Photobooks We Loved,\\" and was the recipient of the 2012 Photography for Design Professional Award from D&AD; (British Design & Art Direction).  Biography  = Childhood = Zellar described his childhood as having grown up in \\"a very active and loving family\\" as well as being a fairly \\"social kid\\". At the same time, he notes that much of his work was inspired from his \\"lonely\\" adolescence despite having been in an always \\"crowded house\\". The desire for \\"privacy and solitude\\" brought about his affection for isolation amongst the \\"gravel roads surrounded by fields, and I loved to make that walk and have that feeling, that realization that it wasn't hard at all to disappear in this huge country\\". That realization, and his attention to \\"invisible people on the sidewalks of [Minneapolis]\\", largely influences his books. Jim Walsh summarized, \\"For 20 years, Zellar has made a career out of ferreting out some of the most fascinating characters that Minnesota’s margins has to offer.\\" Zellar attended Banfield Elementary School in Austin, Minnesota. His father was a mechanic who owned a repair shop in Hollandale, Minnesota. Zellar noted that the 1985–86 Hormel strike deeply affected his hometown and ultimately his interests in covering the American Rust Belt. = Writer = Zellar is a Twin Cities journalist and author of several photography books. He has worked as a writer for the City Pages, the Utne Reader, and as literary critic and senior editor for The Rake. He has collaborated with Alec Soth on a number of books and photography projects such as The LBM Dispatches (Little Brown Mushroom). These dispatches include a series on Ohio, upstate New York, Michigan, California, Colorado, and Texas. The work focuses on a wide range of subjects, often characterized as “North American ramblings” ranging from the subject matter of individuals who live \\"off the grid\\" to the \\"Louisiana Goth scene\\". In 2008, Zellar wrote the Suburban World: The Norling Photos for the Minnesota Historical Society with a foreword by Soth. The book was a collection of the \\"complete photo negative and print archive\\" by Irwin Norling, an engineer at Honeywell and freelance photographer for the Bloomington, Minnesota police department. The book served as the visual inspiration for the Coen brothers' feature film, A Serious Man. The film earned a Golden Globe nomination for Michael Stuhlbarg, a place on both the American Film Institute's and National Board of Review of Motion Pictures's Top 10 Film Lists of 2009, and a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Picture. The Coens, Joel Coen and Ethan Coen, \\"wanted to create the era when we grew up\\" and stated, \\"so we relied a lot on our memories,\\" which was set in 1967 in Minnesota, the same era and location as Zellar's book. Soth and Zellar collaborated again on Three Valleys in 2010. This was technically the fourth instalment of the LBM Dispatches located in California and centered on the Silicon Valley, San Joaquin Valley, and Death Valley. John Mahoney of American Photo Magazine noted the contrast in the landscapes as the \\"brave new worlds and pervasive virtuality of Silicon Valley, the Depression-era remnants of agricultural settlements and immigrant communities in the San Joaquin, and the other-worldly boom-and-bust landscapes of Death Valley, where the Manson Family holed up at the tail end of the 1960s.\\" Zellar also collaborated with Soth on the House of Coates that featured photographs by Lester B. Morrison. The story centres on Morrison who, during the record cold US winter of 2010/2011, stayed in hotels along U.S. Route 52. It was speculated by some that Morrison was in fact Soth, though both would later deny this and subsequently confirm they had both met Morrison. In 2011, Zellar's book, Conductors of the Moving World was named in TIME's Best of 2011: The Photobooks We Loved. The book was the recipient of the D&AD; 2012 Photography for Design Professional Award. He has also received awards from the Society of Professional Journalists, the Association of Alternative Newsmedia, and the Minnesota Magazine and Publishing Association. Zellar and Soth's partnership has continued with dispatches to Ohio, Texas, California, Colorado, Michigan, New York, and Georgia as part of The LBM Dispatch series. Zellar is also a noted blogger, having been a professional blog writer for City Pages and The Rake, and having found a popular audience in Ireland and Australia, according to Margaret A. Pribel of the Minnesota Magazine and Publishing Association. = Personal life = Zellar is the brother of musician Martin Zellar, leader of the band Gear Daddies. Brad appears on the cover of the Gear Daddies album Billy's Live Bait as the 'Live Bait' attendant. He is an avid collector of baseball memorabilia. Among his prized collection is a rare \\"1911 first edition of the book “Base Ball” by Albert Spalding\\" and \\"a ball signed by Ted Williams and Mickey Mantle\\". Josh Ostergaard's book, The Devil’s Snake Curve: A Fan’s Notes from Left Field, references some of Zellar's baseball materials. Zellar lived for a time in Austin, Minnesota, but has since moved to the Twin Cities.  Books  *Twin Cities Noir. New York: Akashic, 2006. . Edited by Julie Schaper and Steven Horwitz.

It was released in the US in 1991 and Europe in 1992. Moment of Truth was produced by and mixed by Prince's Paisley Park Records producer David Z., except for \\"Confession Time\\", which was produced by the British producer Steve Brown. Background Nunn recorded Moment of Truth following Berlin's split in 1987. It was recorded at Paisley Park Studios in Chanhassen, while \\"Confession Time\\" was recorded at Ocean Way Recording in Los Angeles. The album was released in the United States in 1991, and Europe and Japan in 1992. The album was not a commercial success, nor was the single \\"Let Me Be the One\\", which was released in January 1992. \\"89 Lines\\" was also released as a promotional single in the US. Following the failed of the album, Nunn went on to gain the rights for the usage of Berlin's name after legal wranglings with the founding member of the group, John Crawford. Nunn recreated Berlin, with a new line-up of musicians, in 1998. In a late 1990s interview with Electrogarden, Nunn explained that she had left Berlin to try new styles of sound and music. However, in a 1996 interview with The Telegraph-Herald, she dismissed the album and described it as \\"transitional\\".https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=U3NaAAAAIBAJ&sjid;=2LsMAAAAIBAJ&pg;=6756,4239602&dq;=terri+nunn+moment+truth&hl;=en Writing The album's songs were written from 1988 to 1991 by various composers, with Nunn receiving writing credit for six of the eleven tracks. Speaking to the Beaver County Times in 1992, Nunn said: \\"When I wrote this album, I'd planned to expose myself a lot more with my writing. All of the musicians I grew up idolizing and loving, that's what I loved about them - David Bowie, Grace Slick, Bonnie Raitt. They exposed themselves and how they were growing through their music. That helped me as a person, as well as listening to the music and getting off on the oral high. It was a communication.\\"https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=aLgiAAAAIBAJ&sjid;=MbUFAAAAIBAJ&pg;=4498,4704756&dq;=terri+nunn+moment+truth&hl;=en While promoting her album on CNBC, Nunn revealed the album was lyrically more personal to Nunn than the Berlin albums. \\"Desire Me\\" is based on sexual desire. Nunn said of the song on CNBC: \\"It came out of two weeks of being extremely horny. There wasn't anybody around at the time, I wasn't in a relationship, and so at least something came out of it.\\" \\"Once Upon a Time\\" is based on the suicide of Nunn's father, while \\"Diane\\" speaks of domestic abuse from husband to wife. In her interview with the Beaver County Times, Nunn spoke of both tracks: \\"The hardest song was the song about Dad. That took me three years, just pulling it out, trying new things. I got to resolve a lot through the process. Wife abuse (\\"Diane\\") is a definite message to a friend. The truth helps write the song and the song helps bring the truth around.\\" The song \\"89 Lines\\" speaks of racism, with Nunn portraying a black male. Release Moment of Truth was released in the US by DGC Records and by Mercury Records in Europe and Japan. In the US, the album was released on cassette and CD, while in Europe the album was only released on CD. In 1991, a special US CD promo sampler was released featuring a total of eight tracks. Four Berlin hit tracks were used: \\"Take My Breath Away\\", \\"No More Words\\", \\"Sex (I'm A...)\\" and \\"The Metro\\", along with four tracks from Moment of Truth: \\"Let Me Be the One\\", \\"89 Lines\\", \\"Who's Gonna Take You Home Tonight\\" and \\"Fly by Night\\". A live version of \\"Confession Time\\" was later released on the 2000 live album Live: Sacred and Profane from Berlin. Promotion Nunn appeared on CNBC to perform \\"Let Me Be the One\\" on November 11, 1991. Reception Upon release, Billboard felt the album was a \\"seriously out-of-date and thinly produced package\\", adding: \\"Playing out homogenized vocal and lyrical moves well mined by Pat Benatar a decade or more ago, Nunn overreaches on such tracks as \\"Desire Me\\" and the title track.\\"Billboard magazine - February 1, 1992 - Album Reviews - page 52 Brenda Herrmann of the Chicago Tribune felt Nunn still had a \\"wonderful voice\\", but that the album's material was weak. She commented: \\"Songs like \\"Let Me Be the One\\" and \\"Who's Gonna Take You Home Tonight\\" are nearly indistinguishable from Heart hits like \\"Alone\\" or \\"Who Will You Run To\\". The \\"Moment of Truth\\" is that Nunn wants to make some bucks - even if it is in adult contemporary radio.\\" The Orlando Sentinel said \\"Singers are always leaving bands to pursue their own musical identities. But Terri Nunn apparently took the singular route of defecting from Berlin to pursue an identity crisis. On her solo debut, Nunn can't make up her mind whether to be the poor man's Johnette Napolitano, Pat Benatar, Ann Wilson or Debbie Harry. Nunn's songwriting is strictly of the generic-confessional variety, and the songs by outside writers are just as formulaic and pedestrian. The host of backing musicians provide a thoroughly unexceptional setting.\\" Trouser Press commented: \\"This dull-as-dirt generic rock pancake fails to establish Nunn as anything but... the former singer of Berlin. In the little world of Moment of Truth — which more than anything sounds like late-'80s Pat Benatar outtakes — it is.\\" Pan-European magazine Music & Media commented: \\"This is powerful stuff from Nunn. Synthladen timeless power-wave reflects shades of the late '70s and early '80s. From the Tubeway Army synthsounds in \\"Confession Time\\" to \\"Once Upon a Time\\" with its Concrete Blonde-meets-Shakespeare's Sister-feel, Nunn finds the right melodic blend of hooks 'n heavies.\\"Music & Media magazine - April 11, 1992 - New Releases: Albums - page 11 Alex Henderson of AllMusic said: \\"With Berlin having hit an artistic high note on 1986's Count Three and Pray, it was most regrettable when the trio broke up. Moment of Truth made the breakup seem all the more regrettable. Nunn delivers a run-of-the-mill pop/rock offering that isn't terrible, but pales in comparison to her inspired performances on Berlin gems. Despite a few decent spots, including the rap/rock protest song \\"89 Lines\\" and the single \\"Let Me Be the One,\\" the album really isn't worth the price of admission.\\"  Track listing  Personnel * Terri Nunn - vocals * Karl Hyde - electric guitar, acoustic guitar, 6-string bass, sitar, backing vocals * Tim Pierce - additional guitar (tracks 2, 5, 7-11) * David Z - additional guitar (tracks 3, 5-6, 8, 10-11), sitar (tracks 2-4, 10), drums (tracks 2, 4, 6, 8-11), additional percussion and drums (tracks 3, 8), distorted bass (track 6), additional background vocals (track 7) * Tim Pierce - acoustic guitar (track 3) * Andrew Flashman - piano, organ, keyboards * Ricky Peterson - additional keyboards (tracks 2-3, 5-7), additional background vocals (track 7), keyboards (track 8) * Kenny Holman - saxophone (track 4) * Jason P.

In a few places iron- plated wooden rails were laid to take a handcart. Heavily used routes sometimes evolved into roads when sledges, rollers or oxen were used, as at Methye Portage. Sometimes railways were built (Champlain and St. Lawrence Railroad). The basic purpose of most canals is to avoid portages.Eric W. Morse,'Fur Trade Canoe Route of Canada /Then and Now',1984 Places where portaging occurred often became temporary and then permanent settlements (such as Hull, Quebec; Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario; New Orleans, Louisiana; and Chicago, Illinois). The importance of free passage through portages found them included in laws and treaties. The Northwest Ordinance says \\"The navigable waters leading into the Mississippi and St. Lawrence, and the carrying places between the same, shall be common highways and forever free, as well to the inhabitants of the said territory as to the citizens of the United States...\\" The Treaty of Greenville between the U.S. and the Indian tribes of the area includes: \\"And the said Indian tribes will allow to the people of the United States a free passage by land and by water, as one and the other shall be found convenient, through their country,...\\" Then four portages are mentioned specifically. Portages are also used in the treaty to set boundaries (\\"The general boundary line between the lands of the United States and the lands of the said Indian tribes, shall begin at the mouth of Cayahoga river, and run thence up the same to the portage...\\"). One historically important fur trade portage is now Grand Portage National Monument. Recreational canoeing routes often include portages between lakes, for example, the Seven Carries route in Adirondack Park. Algonquin Park, Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness and Sylvania Wilderness have famous portage routes. Numerous portages were upgraded to carriageways and railways due to their economic importance. The Niagara Portage had a gravity railway in the 1760s. The passage between the Chicago and Des Plaines Rivers (and so between the Great Lakes and the Mississippi River systems) was through a short swamp portage which seasonally flooded and it is thought that a channel gradually developed unintentionally from the dragging of the boat bottoms.The Chicago Portage - Historical Synopsis , prepared by Wm. E. Rose and Associates, Inc., for the Forest Preserve District of Cook County, June 1975 The 1835 Champlain and St. Lawrence Railroad connected the cities of New York and Montreal without needing to go through the Atlantic. The passage between Lake Superior and Lake Huron was by a portage dragway of greased rails with capstans until a railway was built in 1850 and a canal in 1855. The 5-mile-long Nosbonsing and Nipissing Railway was built just to carry logs between lakes on their way to the sawmill. Allegheny Portage Railroad and Morris Canal both used canal inclined planes to pass loaded boats through portages. Settlements named for being on a portage Sometimes the settlements were named for being on a portage. Some places in the United States and Canada so named are: *Cranberry Portage, Manitoba *Giscome Portage, British Columbia *Grand Portage, Minnesota *Neyaashiinigmiing 27 Indian Reserve, Ontario ( being the Ojibwe word for \\"at\\\\by a portage\\") *Onigum, Minnesota (onigam being the Ojibwe word for \\"portage\\") *Portage, Indiana *Portage, Michigan *Portage, Montana *Portage, Nova Scotia *Portage, Pennsylvania *Portage, Wisconsin *Portage Bay, Washington *Portage County, Ohio *Portage County, Wisconsin *Portage Park, Chicago *Portage-du-Fort, Quebec *Portage la Prairie, Manitoba (portage between the Assiniboine River and Lake Manitoba) *Rat Portage, Ontario *Seton Portage, British Columbia *Bayou Portage, Louisiana Names with portage appear on various other geographical features, including road and lakes, as in Portage Lake. In Hull, Quebec a major street is named promenade du Portage as the city is the head of uninterrupted navigation from Montréal on the Ottawa River and one must portage around the Chaudière Rapids. Marathon portage The area of the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness west of Grand Portage, Minnesota, carries rich history of canoeing and portaging.

The dune fields are scattered over a wide expanse of desert to the south, southwest and southeast of Ciudad Juárez. The dune fields are located in a 2000 km2 area known as the Samalayuca Desert. The Samalayuca Desert and its dune fields are part of the much larger Chihuahua Desert region. The best known portion of the Samalayuca Dune Fields lie in and around the village of Samalayuca. These dune fields are the most noticeable because they lie across the much traveled north–south route between Chihuahua City and El Paso del Norte (Ciudad Juarez-El Paso). This portion of the dunes is also the most dramatic, having high dune profiles shaped by the wind in the lee of Cerro de Samalayuca. The dunes are composed of almost pure quartz (SiO2). They are white or tan in appearance. They are fine and move with the wind. The wind has formed the dunes by carrying sand until it became deposited and concentrated in natural land depressions. The action of the wind continues to constantly reshape the dunes. Some of the dunes near Samalayuca are tall and dramatically shaped and marked by the wind. For centuries the sands of these dune fields were historically significant because they lay across the much traveled north–south route between Chihuahua City and \\"The Pass of the North\\" at the site of the border cities of Ciudad Juárez and El Paso. Before the era of the modern highway and the railroad, travel by foot, horse or oxen across this extended barrier of some 30 kilometers of loose sand was laborious and dangerous, but travelers had the option of a longer (and thus more time-consuming) detour around the east side of the dune fields. Today the dune fields are becoming known for their tourist and recreational potential, and as a habitat for the many unique endemic species of plants and animals living in a rare ecosystem in the Samalayuca desert. The high silica content of the sands has also attracted industrial interest. Name =Historical name= The sand dune area has traditionally been referred to as \\"Los Medanos\\" or simply, the dunes. The name Samalayuca Dune Fields is of more recent origin. The name \\"Los Medanos\\" is more commonly used particularly in historical accounts., see P. 143 where the traveler of 1882 describes \\"Los Medanos\\" and notes the extreme danger from Apaches that wait to attack travelers because \\"they well know the helpless condition of animals\\" struggling through the sands Recently and increasingly the dune fields are referred by Spanish and non Spanish speakers as Medanos de Samalayuca. =Name origin= The field and the desert gets its name from the town of Samalayuca, Chihuahua. There are historic springs in the area, which accounts for the location of the town. The town is adjacent to the dramatic high dunes that lies some 52 km directly south of Ciudad Juárez just east of Mexico Federal Highway 45. These high dunes are formed by the prevailing winds from the northwest dropping sands in the lee of Cerro de Samalayuca (Samalayuca Mountain), which lies close to Samalayuca village. Location The most dramatic portion of the Samalayuca dune fields lie east and west of Mexican Federal Highway 45 and the parallel Mexican Railway in an area 30 to 60 miles south of Juarez. This major north south highway and railroad, between Ciudad Juarez and the city of Chihuahua crosses through this dune area, and low dunes are visible for many kilometers on each side of the highway. The dramatic high dunes that exist close to the village of Samalayuca may be seen in the distance from Federal Highway 45. These dune fields are formed by the prevailing wind from the northwest dropping sand particles in the lee of the Sierra Samalayuca (Samalayuca Mountains). Besides the high dunes appearing in the area of the village of Samalayuca, the dune fields lie in several other areas of the Samalayuca desert to the southwest and southeast of Ciudad Juarez. A lesser known part of the Salamayuca dune field extends to the west from Samalayuca into the area southwest from Ciudad Juárez. This area (lying west of Mexico Federal Highway 45) is larger than the more dramatic high dune area near Samalayuca, and comprise the bulk of the Samalayuca desert area. These dune fields extend to the north where they lie across the (now abandoned) right of way of the defunct Mexico North Western Railway (Compañía del Ferrocarril Nor-Oeste de México) and extend into the Chihuahua municipality of Ascension. Smaller dune fields also extends to the east from the town of Salamayuca, into the municipality of Guadalupe. Chihuahua Trail Samalayuca Sand Dunes The Samalayuca Dune fields lie directly across the main route of the Chihuahua Trail, part of the longer route known as El Camino Real de Tierra Adentro, or the royal road of the interior. The portion of this route known as the Chihuahua Trail went north from Chihuahua City to Sante Fe, in New Mexico. From the time the Spanish colonial city of Sante Fe was founded in 1598 by the Spanish explorer Juan de Oñate there was steady and increasing freight and passenger traffic on this route. The only major river on the trail was the Rio Grande. The trail crossed the river via a ford near the famous pass between the Juarez and Franklin mountain ranges. This ford and pass came to be known simply as \\"the Pass\\" (El Paso) or \\"The Pass of the North\\" (El Paso del Norte), and a town by the same name was first established south of the river, at the site of present-day Ciudad Juarez. A separate community also known as El Paso del Norte, was later established on the north side of the river in 1849 after the Mexican-U.S. War on United States Territory. The original Mexican community of El Paso del Norte south of the river changed its name to Ciudad Juarez in 1865. However, in the segment of the Chihuahua trail from Chihuahua City and El Paso del Norte, where the trail reached a point some 45 miles south of the Pass of the North, the trail encountered a 15-mile stretch of the Samalayuca dune fields. The wind shifted and renewed the deep and finely gained deep sand beds in these dunes. The soft shifting sands made walking through the dune fields tiring and time-consuming for animals or people. Horses, oxen, mules and people could cross this sandy area only with great difficulty. The traditional two-wheeled carts (carreteras) could become bogged down in the sands. =Juan de Oñate and alternative routes= In 1598, Juan de Oñate, a wealthy Zacatecas nobleman, set out northward from the Valle de San Bartolomé to establish a new northern colony, a \\"New\\" Mexico. He pioneered the Chihuahua Trail route. When he reached Los Medanos (the dunes), he attempted to cross but found the difficulty so great that he detoured to the east to go around the area of sand dunes, before trending north again to the area where he founded San Juan, the first capital of New Mexico. Oñate's detour set a precedent, and thereafter an alternative trail led around the sand dunes near Salamaluca. South of the dunes the Chihuahua trail forked at Laguna de Patos (Duck Lake). The detour branched off south of the dunes at Lagunas de Patos and veered northeast for roughly 60 miles, across the southeastern margin of the dune fields till it reached the south bank of the Rio Grande del Norte. This branch then turned and followed the Rio Grande's south bank upstream in a northwest direction about 60 miles to The Pass of the North (El Passo Del Norte), where the two branches of the trail were again joined. After El Paso, the trail proceeded through the pass and on to Santa Fe. At Laguna de Patos, the main branch of the Chihuahua Trail proceeded due north crossing the dune fields to reach El Paso del Norte in about 65 miles. In this distance the trail crossed through the sandy dunes for a distance of 12 to 15 miles, emerging from the sand to cross about 30 miles of desert brush lands to finally reach El Paso del Norte. The detour around the dune fields added some fifty or sixty miles to the direct route through the dune fields. To a horseman traveling at 20 miles a day, this could mean a delay of three days. To a merchant caravan moving at twelve miles a day between Ciudad de Chihuahua and El Paso del North, this could mean a delay in transit of five or more days. =Scarcity of water= When traveling the route that led through the sand dunes near the village of Samalayuca water was critical. The only reliable water sources lay miles to the north and south of the sand dunes near Samalayuca. Water supplies near the dunes were very scarce. To be significantly delayed in the Salamayuca Sand Dunes in a dry year with limited water supplies could be fatal. There were springs that flowed near the present settlement of Samalayuca on the northern edge of this stretch of sand. As stated below these springs were not reliable sources of water for two reasons. These springs near Salamalayuca could be too saline for consumption. Recent surveys confirm that three springs exist in the area of Samalayuca, but the saline content renders two of them unfit for drinking. Water for those currently living in Samalayuca comes from hand dug shallow wells.There are 3 fresh-water springs with ponds on the northeast flank of the sierra, but only the middle one may be used by strangers without fear of sickness. Water for the houses in Samalayuca is taken from hand-dug wells at the homesites and almost all of these wells are less than 15 meters deep. The houses are built of adobe and of stone from the sierra. Travelers in the 1840s reported that the Ojo de Samalayuca (Samalayuca Springs) were seasonal. In the dry season of a dry year, these springs would cease to flow, which would leave no water source on the trail between the areas of El Paso del Norte in the north and the village of Carrizal in the south. =Experiences of travelers in the 1800s= In order to avoid the delay of traveling around the dune fields on the detour, many travelers on the trail between Chihuahua and El Paso del Norte elected to go directly across the dune fields. From the 1600s though the 1800s merchants, explorers, soldiers and the random tourist traveling on the Chihuahua trail found passage through the Samalayuca dunes difficult and dangerous. Throughout this period of three centuries the Apache Indians carried on their off and on guerrilla war with the encroaching Spanish, operating out of the Sierra Madre mountains to the west. They sporadically attacked and sometimes laid waste to hacienda/ranches and small settlements in the area. As part of this conflict the Apaches kept watch over the trail across the dunes, as well as the water holes in and around the dunes fields, in order to rob and kill vulnerable groups of travelers. Even as late as 1882 travelers were \\"warned to avoid this point [Los Medanos] of all others while traveling through Chihuahua\\", and to take the alternative route around the dunes area, though some 60 miles longer, because \\"This place is attended by great danger from the attacks of the Apaches, who well know the helpless condition of animals passing and take the opportunity to attack parties.\\" While animals and persons found footing and traction to be difficult in the loose sands of the dunes, what was most dreaded was the difficulty of hauling loaded wagons or carts through the sand. These vehicles could bog down to their hubs. Some merchants going south from El Paso started out with carts loaded with goods, but would hire a mule train to accompany them. On arrival at the dunes, the goods from the carts would be loaded on the mule train and the emptied carts would then be pulled over the dunes. On the south side of the dunes the carts would be reloaded and proceed. In 1842 a George W. Kendall made a diary as he traveled through the dunes. He was one of a group of political prisoners, who were marched down the Chihuahua trail, guarded by units of the Mexican army. He observed high \\"mountains\\" of loose sand along the trail. He noted that horses would sink in sand to their fetlocks, and walking in the sand exhausted men and animals. The two-wheeled carreteras would bog down in the sand and to pull them through this area required doubling the teams. Kendall also noted a large stone, weighing some 200 pounds directly in the path through the dune fields. Over many years passing gangs of muleteers had superstitiously adopted the custom of lifting the stone and moving it farther along, each gang moving it a few feet at a time towards Mexico City. Their recurrent activity, continuing over many decades were reported to have moved the stone some 14 miles. In 1846 an English soldier of fortune reported the track through the dunes littered with skeletons and dead bodies of oxen, mules and horses. He reported the sand to be knee deep, and constantly shifting. The dunes caused death to animals and humans. \\"On one ridge the upper half of a human skeleton protruded from the sand\\". Traveling by night avoided the punishing desert heat during the summer months, and in 1846 a German scientist Friedrich Adolph Wislizenus described such a night passage through the dunes. Flashes of lightning illuminated ghostly images of slow moving wagons, riders on horseback wrapped in blankets, and travelers on foot walking or sleeping beside the track. Quiet prevailed except for the cries of muleteers and the thunder, The winding passage of the procession through the dunes was marked with multiple pinpoints of light from \\"cigarritos\\". During the Mexican War, Colonel Alexander William Doniphan led a force of about 1000 American soldiers south from El Paso. They had engaged to guard a merchant caravan of about 315 heavy wagons going to Chihuahua City. They elected to go through the Salamayuca Sands, rather than take the detour. After entering the dune fields, the mules pulling the heavy wagon train sank to their knees in the sand, and the wheels of the wagons buried to the hubs. With the merchant's wagons bogged down, men and animals began to suffer serious debility from lack of water. The column had to abandon thousands of pounds of supplies in order to free the wagons from the sands, and men and animals had to join together to push and pull the wagons forward out of the dune area. Once past the dunes, Colonel Doniphan went on south, and still accompanied by the wagon train he defeated a Mexican force at the Battle of the Sacramento River, thereafter capturing Chihuahua City. =The Dunes today= Samalayuca Dunes Today, the original trail (except for the branch which skirted the Samalayuca sand dunes) from Chihuahua, Mexico to El Paso, Texas lies beneath or beside Mexico's Federal Highway 45. Paralleling the highway is a railroad, now used only to haul freight. A traveler on Highway 45 passes over the sandy areas without difficulty. Composition and creation of the dune fields The white to tan sands of the dune fields are almost pure silica. On average, the sand contains 90-95% quartz and 5-10% mixed rock grains. The particle shapes are nodular and spheroid. they were formed by airflow erosion of rocks that created small fragments that were then carried away by the wind, to be deposited in natural land depressions. Another factor assisting in the formation of the dunes is the abrupt changes of temperature that exist in the desert, which assisted in the breaking up of surface rock into sand grains. Endemic species In large dune systems, many species of plants and animals evolve and adapt to the harsh environment, and thus become unique and endemic. The Samalayuca dunes are no exception. They provide the habitat for 248 vegetal and 154 animal species, most of them endemic. The area is therefore biologically unique on a global scale, and is receiving greater attention as a biosphere. Most of the known endemic species in the Samalayuca Dunes are plants and various native bee species. Industrial interest in the dune fields The several million tons of sand in the Salamayuca dunes can be considered as an enormous potential of silica sand since they are 90 to 95 pure silica (SiO2). Silica sand is widely used in what is called \\"the transforamation industry\\", for the making of glass, silicates, paints, glass- ceramics and ceramics. The sand of the Salamayuca dunes has attracted attention from the ceramic/glass industry but the desert sand contains sufficient impurities to pose problems with its use in industry, and a process to increase uniform purity to 97.5% SiO2 would have to be developed. Because the sands start with such a high percentage of silica, such a process is deemed feasible. Tourism interest in the dune fields near Samalayuca The dramatic appearance of the dunes near Samalayuca, visible from Highway 45, has generated tourism interest in the dunes. This includes adventure tourism. Tourists hike in the dunes, ride over them in various vehicles, and slide down the dunes on sand boards. Government protection On June 5 of 2009, the Mexican federal government created a protected area of 63,182 hectares (631.82 km2, or 156,126.12 acres) in Samalayuca dune fields. Movie setting The Samalayuca Dunes were used to film many of the exterior shots in the 1984 movie Dune. The dunes were also used as a location for another 1984 film, Conan The Destroyer.

When a reinforced concrete member is put in tension, after cracking, the member elongates by widening of cracks and by formation of new cracks. Figure 1 Formation of internal cracks Ignoring the small elastic strain in the concrete between the cracks, we can relate the crack width to the strain of the member by: :{w}_{m}= \\\\epsilon_{cf}s_m Spacing of Primary cracks Primary cracks (Figure 1) form when the tensile stress at the outer surface of the concrete reaches the tensile strength of concrete. When a primary crack forms, the concrete in the vicinity of the crack is relieved of any tension, resulting in a stress free zone near the crack. CEB-FIP code expressions for crack spacing and crack widths In the CEB-FIP Code the following expression is used to account for the average crack spacing: :s_m = 2(c + \\\\frac{s}{10}) + k_1k_2\\\\frac{d_b}{\\\\rho_{ef}} where :c = clear concrete cover :s = maximum spacing between longitudinal reinforcing bars (shall not be taken greater than 15d_b) :d_b = bar diameter :\\\\rho_{ef} = A_s/A_{ce f} :A_s = area of steel considered to be effectively bonded to the concrete :A_{ce f} = area of effective embedment zone of the concrete where the reinforcing bars can influence the crack widths. The effective embedment zone is the area of concrete around the reinforcing bar at the distance of 7.5 bar diameter :k_1 = coefficient that characterizes bond properties of bars ::k_1 = 0.4 for deformed bars ::k_1 = 0.8 for plain bars k_2 = coefficient to account for strain gradient ::k_2 = 0.25(\\\\epsilon_1+\\\\epsilon_2)/2\\\\epsilon_1 (e1 and e2 = the largest and the smallest tensile strains in the effective embedment zone) Crack spacing of inclined cracks According to the Modified Compression Field Theory (MCFT), the spacing of inclined cracks in reinforced concrete will depend upon the crack control characteristics of both the longitudinal and the transverse reinforcement. It is suggested that the spacing is taken as: :{s}_{m\\\\theta}=1/(\\\\frac{sin\\\\theta}{s_{mx}} + \\\\frac{cos \\\\theta}{s_{mv}}) Where s_{mx} is the average crack spacings that would result if the member was subjected to longitudinal tension while s_{mv} is the average crack spacing that would result if the member was subjected to a transverse tension. These crack spacings can be estimated from the CEB-FIP Code crack spacing expression above. Crack spacing in shear areas The above CEB expression was intended to calculate crack spacings on the surface of the member. Crack spacings become larger as the distance from the reinforcement increases. For this case, it is suggested to use the maximum distance from the reinforcement, instead of cover distance c (Collins & Mitchell). Thus, for the uniform tensile straining the above CEB expression is modified to: :s_{mx} = 2(c_x + \\\\frac{s_x}{10}) + 0.25k_1\\\\frac{d_{bx}}{\\\\rho_{x}} :s_{mv} = 2(c_v + \\\\frac{s}{10}) + 0.25k_1\\\\frac{d_{bv}}{\\\\rho_{v}} The above equations are suggested for better approximation of crack spacings in the shear area of the beam.

Integrating a contemporary burgeoning field of research on infant cognitive and social development in the first two years of life with his own laboratory's studies at the University of Chicago, Kaye offered an \\"apprenticeship\\" theory. Seen as an empirical turning point in the investigation of processes in early human development, the book's reviews welcomed its reliance on close (second by second) process studies of a large sample of infants and mothers (50) recorded longitudinally (birth to 30 months). It was republished in England, Japan, (1993) Spain, Italy, and Argentina. Since the argument placed social relations at the root of mental development, it amounted to an extension of Lev Vygotsky’s theory and of his objections to Jean Piaget, down to the first year of life. (Their debate dealt with the preschool years. ) However, the cited evidence from research by many authors in the 1970s also refined the argument Vygotsky had made. Previous writers seem to have assumed, like Piaget, that communication is a felicitous by-product of a symbol-using mind. (If they doubted it, no one had created empirical paradigms to study the processes involved.) Like Vygotsky, Kaye held the contrary: that communication is the origin of mind. His decade-long research program addressed the question: How does communication itself develop in an organism that still lacks a mind? His answer is the \\"apprenticeship\\" theory of infancy: Development of the human mind and language depends as much upon preadapted (through evolution) adult behavior and universal human interaction patterns as it does upon the infant's brain. \\"The kinds of exchanges with adults that facilitate sensorimotor and later linguistic development require little from the infant at first except regularities in behavior and expressive reactions that parents tend to interpret as if they were meaningful gestures.\\" References 1982 non-fiction books Child development University of Chicago Press books Psychology books ","title":"The Mental and Social Life of Babies"},{"id":"36543748","text":"Brompton and Rhiston was a civil parish in Shropshire, England.

He is the son of the author Pär Rådström and theater director Anne Marie Rådström. Poetry Rådström made his debut as a poet in 1975 and made a major breakthrough in 1979 with the poetry collection Poems about the life of Sandro della Quercia, a lyrical biography of a fictional Renaissance artist. In the following decade, he consolidated his position as one of his generation's leading poets. As librettist he has worked with Thomas Jennefelt, Sport & Leisure, and the four-hour opera Book of Life, based on the Bible, with music by Sven-David Sandström, who managed to finished the composing just weeks before he died in the summer of 2019. Screenwriting As a screenwriter, he has also collaborated with Osten in the feature films Bröderna Mozart, and Talk! It's So Dark. In addition to working with Osten he has written the screenplay for Jan Troells Golden Globe-nominated film Everlasting Moments. As a playwright In 1984 came his first full length play, Hitler's Childhood, which premiered on Young Klara directed by Suzanne Osten and played in a number of sets around the world. As a playwright, he has also done a number of major staging of literary works: Dante's Divine Comedy, 2004, the mastodont project The Bible, 2012, Don Quijote, 2013, and The Master and Margarita, 2014, after Mikhail Bulgakov's novel. His play for children The Earless Singer, 1997, based on a Japanese folk tale recorded by Lafcadio Hearn, has also become an opera with music by Gunnar Edander. With the full evening play On the way to the sea, 1998, Rådström returned to the theater and has since written a series of plays. Quartet, 1999, is a chamber play for four actors and a string quartet built around Dmitri Shostakovich's eighth string quartet and has been staged at, among others, Kungl. Dramatic Theater in Stockholm and De Konglige in Copenhagen. Rådström's play freely built on three censored chapters in Dostoevsky's novel The Evil Spirits, Long Silence. Suddenly Dark, 2002, won first prize in the Wilhelm Hansen Foundation's Nordic Drama Competition. Monsters, 2005, a play about the murder of two-year-old James Bulger by two 10-year-olds in Liverpool in 1993, has attracted international attention and has been played, among others venues, in the Netherlands and several times in England. In Walking Through a Mountain, 2007, Rådström describes in dramatic collage the mechanisms of depression and in the collaboration between four Danish theaters and the music group Middle East Peace Orchestra, \\"The Other Dreams\\", 2009, the Israel-Palestine conflict. Novels Among Rådström's novels are The Moon doesn't know from 1976 and Medan tiden tänker på annat from 1992. Awards At the 29th Guldbagge Awards Rådström was nominated for the award for Best Screenplay for the film Speak Up! It's So Dark. He was awarded the Dobloug Prize in 2008. Other activities Between 2012 and 2017, Rådström was a professor of narrative for stage, film and media at Stockholm Dramatic University. Since 2019 he has been professor of creative writing at Linnaeus University. In October 2018, Niklas Rådström abstained from membership of the Swedish Academy.

Spanning an area of , it is the second-largest park in the city after Altona Volkspark. The Stadtpark is regarded as the \\"green heart\\" of Hamburg, despite being located some 3km from the city centre. Opened in 1914, Hamburg Stadtpark is an important example of German landscape design and the transformation from an urban garden to an urban park.  History  Like many cities during the Age of Industrialization, Hamburg grew substantially in the later decades of the 19th century and many former open spaces had been built over. In order to counterbalance this development, in 1901 the Senate of Hamburg and Hamburg Parliament agreed to purchase the so-called Sierich Grove (Sierichsches Gehölz), and to develop an urban park. In 1908 a public design competition was hosted, however, no consensus could be reached. In January 1909, head engineer Fritz Sperber presented two designs – based on the results of the competition – on behalf of the senate, one landscaped and painterly, the other geometric. In June 1909, Fritz Schumacher was made director of the city's Department of Planning and Building Inspection, and in January 1910 he and Fritz Sperber presented a design to the Parliament which was subsequently approved. The park was opened four years later, though it would be another 14 years before it was finally completed. After 1918, the gardening and landscaping work was principally carried out by Otto Linne, the first horticultural director of Hamburg. During the bombing of Hamburg in World War II, a couple of buildings within the park were destroyed, and not rebuilt after the war. Need for additional office space in the 1960s led to the development of City Nord, a decentralized commercial district located to the north-east of Hamburg Stadtpark.  Overview  Map of Hamburg Stadtpark Lake and great meadow from afar The park's most famous landmark is the Hamburg Planetarium, a former water tower. At night, the tower is illuminated in various colours. The 64-metre-tall brick tower was designed by Oskar Menzel and built in 1914. Since 1930 it has housed Germany's largest planetarium. The tower is located in the western half of the park and can be reached via a 500-metre-long avenue on its eastern side. This avenue leads onto the Great Meadow (Festwiese), which borders onto the artificial Stadtpark Lake (Stadtparksee). Midway, the park is crossed by a street. Most of the park's western half and the park's edges are made up of wild woods. Around the edge of the park there are also a number of sporting grounds and sporting halls, an outdoor lido and an athletics stadium. Dozens of playgrounds and sport facilities are spread throughout the park. The home stadium of Hamburg Rugby Club is at Saarlandstraße in the north-east of the park. In the very north-eastern corner lies the Freilichtbühne, an open air stage for music concerts. The lake is connected to Hamburg's extensive network of waterways via the Goldbekkanal. Alster ferries run services between the Stadtpark and Jungfernstieg in the inner city. Every year in September, a vintage car race takes place at Hamburg Stadtpark (Stadtpark-Revival).

It follows six young dancers preparing for the Youth America Grand Prix in New York City, an annual competition for dancers ages 9–19 to earn a place at an elite ballet company or school. Directed by Bess Kargman, it features Michaela DePrince, Aran Bell, Gaya Bommer-Yemini, Miko Fogarty, Jules Fogarty, Joan Sebastian Zamora and Rebecca Houseknecht as they intensively train and prepare for what could be the turning point of their lives. The title 'First Position' is taken from one of the five standard positions of the feet in classical ballet. Kargman was a first-time director who had studied dance herself. \\"I ended up quitting my job to make this film, my first film, and I thought maybe by choosing a topic that was quite dear to me and that I had lived for a number of years growing up—maybe I’d be able to do this story justice.\\"https://web.archive.org/web/20170312035637/http://www.beliefnet.com/columnists/moviemom/2012/05/interview- director-bess-kargman-of-the-ballet-documentary-first-position.html The film features renowned dancers and choreographers from all over the world including Nadine Bommer, Denys Ganio, Élisabeth Platel, Raymond Lukens, and Youth America Grand Prix's founder Larissa Saveliev. Reception The film garnered critical acclaim, receiving a rating of 93% on the website Rotten Tomatoes. Manohla Dargis of The New York Times praised the film as creating \\"pocket portraits of children whose dedication to their art is by turns inspiring, daunting and, at times, a little frightening.\\" Frank Scheck of The Hollywood Reporter wrote that First Position \\"overcomes its predictable elements thanks to the inherent visual drama of watching children strain their bodies to the limit in obsessive pursuit of their goals.\\" The film was the first runner-up for Best Documentary at the Toronto International Film Festival where it premiered, winning the Jury Prize at the San Francisco Doc Fest, and audience awards for Best Documentary at the Dallas International Film Festival and at the Portland International Film Festival, where Bess Kargman also won Best New Director.

Now ruined, it lies near to the town of Cumpas, founded in 1643 by the Jesuit missionary Egidio Monteffio. The name of Sonora seems to have first been given to the principal valley or to the San Juan Bautista mining district, and later was used for the whole province. Rich mineral deposits were discovered at San Juan Bautista in 1657. The Presidio de las Fronteras de Sonora was created in 1690, an armed force with no permanent base, but operating at first out of the San Juan Bautista mining camp. In 1693 Domingo Jironza Petriz de Cruzate, former governor of New Mexico, was made captain for life of the Presidio of Fronteras and alcalde mayor of Sonora, holding office until 1701. In 1702 Don Juan Francisco de Bustamante y Velasco was appointed alcaldía mayor of San Juan Bautista. As of 1724 San Juan Bautista was within the province of Nueva Vizcaya, and was administered by the Alcalde mayor de Sonora y minas de San Juan Bautista. In 1722, San Juan Bautista was the scene of meetings where the leading citizens and civil authorities of the provinces of Sinaloa and Sonora Ostimuri drew up proposals to radically overhaul the system of government, then dominated by the Jesuits missions. They proposed a secular organization with mission lands divided between Indians and settlers, and with Indians given the freedom to work where they wanted. The meetings were convened by Rafael Pacheco Cevallos and captain Gregorio Álvarez Tuñón y Quirós. Two deputies were chosen to represent the communities, a miner and a merchant. A description of Sonora in 1767 said the mine had been abandoned, with its shafts flooded, due to the hostility of the Apaches. Today the land is used for pasturage. Due to its historical significance, the site has been registered with the National Institute of Anthropology and History, and is protected by the 1972 Federal law for archaeological, historical and artistic zones and monuments.

Permutatude identifies information and communication technologies (ICTs) as a medium for exponentially expanding human massing events and their meaning, and as a forum for collective actions, increasing the potential for rapid change to social systems. Theory Formulated in the mid-1980s, permutatude theory hypothesizes that massing events have the potential to become as expansive as the technology of a particular historical moment allows. People having similar values, beliefs, and needs around the world could bond mentally and emotionally with collective actions of real crowds, rapidly growing the size of the massing event and forming new dynamics of power. These changes, creating an exponential structure of massing events occur according to the proportion of ICTs per capita, per country or culture. The theory is based on Nalls' remote observations of crowds, the study of crowd theory, and her artistic practice creating works that foment chemical bonding in crowds. Nalls has found that humans have innate mechanisms that are activated in situations of threat and feel relief in groups of the like-minded, capable of mediating the threat. Permutatude theory posits that crowds are composed of participants who bond with each other through the senses, particularly through physiological chemosensory mechanisms via the sense of smell. Based partly on this bonding, crowds themselves take on characteristics, often revealed through particular shapes and patterns, and the specific way they move or flow. Images of crowds, their patterns, and their individual participants are transmitted through ICTs and are recognized by viewers, who in turn may respond empathetically, though not necessarily consciously, to both the crowd as a whole and to individuals in the crowd. Nalls has hypothesized that this expansive bonding through image technology is potentially explained by mirror neurons, which manage empathy responses between individuals, however less is known about empathetic responses to crowds. According to permutatude theory, permutations in attitudes, values and beliefs can now rapidly evolve on a global scale in relationship to the proportion of ICTs. Permutatude thus explains one part of a natural but complex biological evolutionary process towards globalization as a survival mechanism. The explorations look at how the brain translates the physical stimulus of crowds or images of crowds that occurs in chemosensory, somatosensory, auditory and visual systems. Etymology Permutatude is a portmanteau of permute and attitude, though it also calls to mind other words such as mute (as in being silent) and mutation (as in an act or modification in form and/or structure). The first published definition for permutatude occurs in the 1992 catalog from Nalls' solo exhibition, Permutatude, at Phillippe Staib Gallery in New York City: A world capable of being changed; a transformation or rapid evolution of attitude of individuals on a large scale allowing a reordering to take place; revolt by the once silent masses against constituted authority; majority will; a sudden necessary modification in the global community ‘permitting’ rapid change to take place; exercise of authority by the masses, the natural instincts of democracy.Nalls, G. (1992). Permutatude: Adjust to the great evolutionary forces of change. New York: Philippe Staib Gallery. (Written in 1990). The text below presages later scientific studies and insights into the biological and neurological bases of human empathy. Permutatude is a stage of humankind’s global functional adaptation. This giant step in human development is taking place in as many varied ways, with as many permutations as there are countries, cultures and people. Nothing less than the whole juvenile human condition is in transformation. Image technologies are mirroring the multitudes, creating intellectual and biological sympathy, anticipating a new world community, burying old political orders and creating new ones. Our technology, intentionally and unintentionally, consciously and unconsciously, has speeded up an evolutionary process. We transmit and bond with ritual action globally. We are doing this instinctively. Individuals clustering by like-mindedness, united in strategy to meet basic human needs are shifting the scope of concern to a global context by their images, our images, on the airwaves. In the anatomy of moving masses we are individuals in search of a world community. The meaning for this change is buried within each of us.Nalls, G. (1992). Permutatude: Adjust to the great evolutionary forces of change or die in the upheavals. New York: Philippe Staib Gallery. (Written in 1990). The idea of permutatude began with the Revolutions of 1989, when people around the world watched in real time as millions flooded the streets of Poland, Hungary, East Germany, Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria and Romania and witnessed the events surrounding the fall of communism in those countries. Similar events also informed the theory: the Tiananmen Square protests, where millions more gathered; the German reunification in 1990, dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, and the global protests at the beginning of the First Gulf War as well as the “Operation: Welcome Home” celebrations, and counter- protests, in New York City at the war’s end. As the democratic yearning described in Permutaude continued to unfold, the Arab Spring upheavals spread, driven by social media, despite the distinct political and cultural history of each country. The movement first emerged under the name The Jasmine Revolution, a term which Nalls suggests pays homage to the cohesion of the revolutionaries and their felt group chemistry. Nalls' research has found that there are intrinsic links between geographic locations, environmental smells, and human behavior around the world.Nalls, G. (2007). The importance of natural olfactory stimulation on the perception of well-being and happiness. Abstract in the Proceedings of the New York Academy of Sciences Conference on ‘Linking Affect to Action: Critical Contributions of the Orbitofrontal Cortex,’ 11–17 March, p. 27. Related works The film, Permutatude Study/Permutatude Text, documents two massing events, the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, and Operation Welcome Home event in New York City at the end of the first Gulf War. The video combines Permutatude Text, a dynamic visual of Permutatude writings with massing footage. The works were first exhibited at the Phillippe Staib Gallery in New York in 1992 as separate visuals in one installation, however they were later combined into one projection. In 1999, Nalls' exhibited 1,495,852,024 at Steffany Martz Gallery, New York, NY. The installation featured a series of triptychs, named after those countries that identified a species of jasmine as their most culturally relevant scent in Nalls' World Sensorium research. Each triptych included a selected large-scale photojournalistic image of a crowd; a photographic image of jasmine shrubs taken by the artist, and an engraved bottle containing a jasmine oil composition. The images of crowds were researched for their unique qualities in showing large-visual-field human portraiture and the different socio- dynamics of massing events. In the 2012 exhibition, The Smell of a Critical Moment, a work involving the participation of Occupy Wall Street protestors, she continued her explorations of the multimodal communication systems involved in the underlying chemosensory information exchanged in crowds and then through an immersive installation.

Babbage is the leading lobbyist of Babbage Cofounder, a firm specializing in government relations and innovative business strategies for public decisions. He was elected Kentucky State Auditor and Kentucky Secretary of State. Babbage Cofounder represents clients and causes on a broad range of public decisions. The company's successes on the state level include landmark legislation in health care, especially diabetes and chronic health concerns, as well as issues relating to community colleges, manufacturing, energy, bourbon and distilled beverages, financial services, health insurance, technology and biotechnology, aviation, transportation and the Kentucky state budget. On the federal level Babbage lobbied for the passage of the PNTR trade modernization with China and the $10.1 billion feature for agriculture in the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. Both successes have had local as well as global impact. Babbage served as Kentucky State Auditor (1988-1992) and Kentucky Secretary of State (1992-1996). Early life Robert Alexander Babbage is the son of Robert and Judith Johnson Babbage and grandson of Kentucky Governor Keen Johnson (1939-1943). He has one brother, Dr. Keen J. Babbage, an educator, administrator and author of numerous books on innovative approaches to teaching and school management. He is a native of Lexington, Kentucky and graduate of Henry Clay High School. As a student of public elementary and secondary schools in Lexington, Babbage was active in leadership roles in student council and various youth organizations. After graduating from Eastern Kentucky University, where he was the student representative to the Board of Regents, Babbage was assistant to the mayor of Lexington, Kentucky (1975-1976) and administrative assistant to Kentucky Governor Julian Carroll (1976-1979). Shortly thereafter he launched a successful career in financial management and insurance. From 1984 to 1986 he was assistant to University of Kentucky President Otis Singletary. While working for the university, he led the fund raising effort to establish the Gluck Equine Research Center, working as its foundation director with major worldwide figures in Kentucky's storied horse industry. Babbage combined his professional work with an active interest in community service working with his wife Laura Schulte Babbage on a number of projects. The Babbages are co- recipients of the Brotherhood/Sisterhood Award given by the National Conference of Christians and Jews, Bluegrass Chapter, for their work in promoting racial and religious understanding. Bob was instrumental in bringing the Hugh O'Brian Youth Leadership Conference to Kentucky and creating the Lexington Dream Factory, each program recognized for ongoing excellence. Babbage teamed with Kentucky Chamber of Commerce president and chief executive officer Dave Adkisson to grow Leadership Kentucky into a highly successful and often copied program. Babbage is also a co-founder of the successful Lexington Forum and is recognized for helping originate the Louisville Forum. Education Babbage earned his BA from Eastern Kentucky University in 1973 majoring in journalism and political science. He was elected student member of the University Board of Regents and was later selected as editor of The Eastern Progress, the college newspaper. He holds an MA from the University of Kentucky Patterson School of Diplomacy and International Commerce and an MA from Lexington Theological Seminary. In 1988 he completed the Senior Executive Program at Harvard University. He received an honorary Doctorate in Public Administration from Campbellsville University in 1993. Politics Babbage was first elected to public office in 1981 as Council Member At-Large to the Lexington-Fayette Urban County Government. At that time, he was the youngest person ever elected to an at-large seat on the Council. As a member of the Council from 1981 to 1987, Babbage was instrumental in developing Lexington's first-ever 911 emergency communications system. He also served as Budget Chairman and started Lexington's Senior Interns Program. In 1987, Babbage successfully ran for Kentucky State Auditor serving from 1988 to 1992. Prevented from seeking a second term by state law which at that time prohibited constitutional officers from succeeding themselves, he subsequently sought the office of Kentucky Secretary of State serving from 1992 to 1996. During his tenure as auditor, Kentucky voters amended the state constitution to remove the restriction on lotteries which led to the establishment of the Kentucky Lottery Commission. Babbage established guidelines and procedures for routine audits of the Lottery. In 2014 the Kentucky Lottery had total sales of $858.8 million and provided $276.1 million in revenue to the state budget. Also as State Auditor, Babbage ensured that all audits of county governments were at current-year-status, many having been far behind. Twice during his tenure as State Auditor, he was awarded the Governor's Affirmative Action Achievement Award for successfully recruiting minorities in state government. As Secretary of State Babbage championed a \\"motor-voter law\\" that simplified the process for registering voters and maintaining registrations, was active in starting limited liability corporations for Kentucky business and conducted the nation's first online vote count in real time. He also proposed One-Stop business licensing through the Corporations Filing Office of the Office of Secretary of State, an innovation considered to be years ahead of its time and now a reality in Kentucky. He managed the Election Day Task Force with the state attorney general and the FBI. Babbage and the attorney general named a task force on vote fraud reform that proposed legislation that was successfully passed and implemented. He also founded and chaired Democracy, Inc., a voter registration and education foundation. Babbage contested and lost a close primary race for Governor of Kentucky in 1995. Babbage's signature campaign proposal to establish a pool of funds to provide college tuition scholarships to all high school students graduating with above average grades and attending Kentucky colleges was later implemented by the state. Following the election, he was named state chair of the Kentucky Democratic Party by Governor Paul E. Patton. Babbage was the working chair in 2000 of the bi-partisan committee to pass a constitutional amendment for annual sessions of the Kentucky General Assembly. The committee was chaired by the Republican Senate President and Democrat Speaker of the House. After previously failing three times over Kentucky's history, the amendment to establish a short session of the legislature in odd-numbered years passed 52.33% to 47.67%. Business and professional Following tenures as Kentucky State Auditor and Kentucky Secretary of State, Babbage was vice president of the U.S. Corrections Corporation and a senior fellow at the Council of State Governments during the mid-1990s. During that time, President Bill Clinton appointed him to the Coordinating Council on Juvenile Justice chaired by Attorney General Janet Reno and later by Attorney General John Ashcroft. U. S. Secretary of State Colin Powell later named him to the Advisory Committee for Cultural Diplomacy. In 1995 he re-branded InterSouth, Inc., formed in 1994, as Babbage Cofounder. Babbage Cofounder Babbage is the leading lobbyist of Babbage Cofounder, a government relations and corporate strategies development firm. This firm assists companies wanting to improve results in lobbying as well as communications and relationship management. \\"Cofounder\\" in the firm name is derived from the various civic initiatives in which Babbage has been involved, milestones achieved in government under his leadership, and as an innovator and advocate for clients and causes toward the advancement of their goals. Babbage Cofounder helps companies and associations improve results in all aspects of lobbying, communications, business strategy, government relationship management and issues advocacy. The company concentrates on executive, agency, legislative, appropriations and public contract decisions in broad areas of concern including finance, education, manufacturing, energy, insurance, technology, transportation and health care and chronic diseases, especially issues relating to diabetes and solutions on impacting the diabetes epidemic. Babbage initiated the idea of organizing a visit by Kentucky leaders to Washington, D.C. for meetings with the state's Congressional delegation and others in the nation's capital. Kentucky's \\"Washington Fly-In\\" has become a highly successful annual event. Through branding strategies, public sector positioning and alliance building, Babbage Cofounder helps companies, associations and critical causes to persuade elected and appointed leaders to take strong stands and make good decisions for sensible, positive outcomes. Babbage has been recognized as a \\"top Frankfort lobbyist\\" for the past ten years based on public records by numerous sources including the Lexington Herald-Leader, the Louisville Courier-Journal, Kentucky Roll Call, Kentucky Gazette, Business First of Louisville and The Huffington Post. He is consistently ranked in Kentucky's \\"Top Ten Lobbyists\\" and has been named one of the state's \\"20 Most Influential\\" non-elected leaders by the Kentucky Gazette.

The trailhead sign displays a map of Quebec Run Wild Area and its trails. Begin by taking Miller Trail on the east side of the parking lot (on the left as you face the sign and gate across Quebec Road), and follow the blue blazes. After , you can tell you are hiking along a ridge between two stream valleys. As the trail descends, it becomes narrower and steeper. On the floodplain of Mill Run, a number of trails intersect. Here, turn right onto Mill Run Trail, which goes along the bank of the stream. Shortly, you pass some downed trees all lying in the same direction. Look carefully for a blue \\"T\\" on a tree at a trail intersection (unless the sign has been replaced by the time of your visit). Turn right onto Rankin Trail, which crosses Quebec Run twice and proceeds to Quebec Road. Cross the road and make a sharp jog to the right; watch the blazes carefully. Rankin Trail follows the hillside again until it joins an old logging road. Turn left onto the logging road, and continue past some large boulders to a sign for Hess Trail to the left. Continue on Rankin Trail; then turn at the second sign for Hess Trail, which leads uphill to your right (north). This section of Hess Trail begins with a strenuous climb out of the valley, then proceeds northeast across the top of the ridge. The trail dips down to cross a tributary of Mill Run, and from this point it is a short walk back to the parking lot.

On 10 April 2014, U.S. Senators Ben Cardin (D-Md.) and Roger Wicker (R-Miss.) announced Ambassador Killion's joint appointment as the Senate Staff Director for the U.S. Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe (U.S. Helsinki Commission). Early life and education Killion was born 1966 in Danbury, Connecticut. He received his undergraduate degree from Wesleyan University in Middletown, Connecticut.David T. Killion/Permanent Representative/UNESCO, United States Department of State. Retrieved 15 August 2012. After earning his M.A. and C.Phil. degrees in political science from the University of California, Los Angeles, Killion worked as a congressional legislative staffer.  Career  From 1996 to 2001, Killion worked as a Senior Legislative Management Officer in the U.S. Department of State Bureau of Legislative Affairs, under the Clinton administration. His areas of responsibility managing congressional relations included Human Rights, Democracy, War Crimes, Women’s Issues, Oceans, and Environment and Science. From 2001 until 2009, he served as Senior Professional Staff Member for the U.S. House Committee on Foreign Affairs. Killion was the Committee’s expert on State Department Operations, International Organizations, and International Education. In this role, he worked on the Global Anti-Semitism Review Act of 2004, which was enacted and created a Department of State Special Envoy to Combat anti-Semitism. Killion also helped draft H.R. 1469, the Senator Paul Simon Study Abroad Foundation Act, which was designed to increase the number of American college students studying abroad. In 2009, in recognition of this work, NAFSA, the Association of International Educators awarded Killion its Congressional Staff Champion Award “for his commitment to advancing international education.” =U.S. Ambassador to UNESCO= Under President Reagan, the U.S. in 1984 withdrew from UNESCO and did not rejoin UNESCO until twenty years later. During his service as Senior Professional Staff Member for the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Foreign Affairs, David Killion worked to ease passage of legislation to allow the re-entry of the U.S. into UNESCO. On June 25, 2009, President Obama appointed Killion U.S. Permanent Representative to UNESCO. Killion was sworn into office on August 12, 2009. Soon after arriving in Paris in 2009, Killion was widely credited for his energetic role in preventing the Director-Generalship of UNESCO from going to the controversial artist and Mubarak-era Egyptian Cultural Minister Farouk Hosni. Replying to anti-UNESCO American critics who have urged that the U.S. should again withdraw from participation in UNESCO, Killion has argued that, \\"there are critical American interests at stake [at UNESCO]: moral, cultural, national security, even economic interests. We think this is a strategic piece of real estate in the international system. It can get us to places we couldn’t get to otherwise.” He has insisted on UNESCO's value in promoting freedom of expression and science diplomacy, advancing girls' education,http://blogs.state.gov/index.php/site/entry/unesco_new_chapter_literacy and defending Internet freedom.http://blogs.state.gov/index.php/site/by_author/dtkillion/ The U.S. role in UNESCO has become complicated following the withdrawal of U.S. funding to UNESCO as a consequence of UNESCO's admission of Palestine (by a vote of 107-14, with 52 abstentions) as a member of UNESCO, on October 31, 2011. Killion delivered a statement on behalf of the United States expressing \\"regret\\" and calling the UNESCO decision \\"premature\\"; nevertheless, Ambassador Killion pledged that the United States would \\"continue our efforts to find ways to support and strengthen the important work of this vital organization.\\" Killion has been an enthusiastic supporter of UNESCO's work in anti-homophobic bullying and Open Educational Resources. Responding to the release of a UNESCO report on homophobic bullying worldwide, he called UNESCO \\"an essential partner for the United States in the struggle to ensure respect and equality for LGBT persons everywhere.\\" Killion has also championed the potential of Open Educational Resources to transform global education, and, in June 2012, he led the U.S. delegation to the UNESCO-sponsored World Open Educational Resources Congress. Killion successfully recruited prominent Americans such as Forest Whitaker and Herbie Hancock to be UNESCO Goodwill Ambassadors and has worked to support their work in peace building\\"The International Institute for Peace at Rutgers University, Co-founded by Forest Whitaker, Partners with UNESCO to Combat Urban Violence.\\" U.S. Mission to UNESCO.

July 4, 2013. In July 2012, Killion issued a statement expressing U.S. opposition to UNESCO's decision to award the UNESCO-Equatorial Guinea International Prize for Research in the Life Sciences, which was controversially endowed by Equatorial Guinea. UNESCO's Director-General, Irina Bokova, joined Ambassador Killion in opposing the award; the U.S. considers Equatorial Guinea under President Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo to be a dictatorship with an egregious record of human rights violations. Killion is credited with brokering, in cooperation with Russia and Israel, a breakthrough agreement on cultural heritage in the Middle East in April 2013. Killion called the deal between Israel and the Palestinians “a critical step forward toward depoliticizing UNESCO, and signals a major shift toward a more constructive approach to cultural heritage issues.” Killion’s ongoing efforts to defend Israel from attack at UNESCO earned him praise from B'nai B'rith, which described Killion’s tenure as being “marked by a series of very important accomplishments” and called him “an extraordinary diplomat and public servant—a man not only of commitment, but of skill and, no less important, of principle.”http://www.bnaibrith.org/5/post/2013/10/bnai-brith- salutes-us-ambassador-to-unesco-following-final-address-to-bodys-executive- board.html When the United States was automatically stripped of its voting rights at UNESCO in November 2013, two years after cutting funding to the organization, Killion noted that the United States had been involved in UNESCO since it was founded in 1945 and promised that it would remain involved. On April 10, 2014, U.S. Senators Ben Cardin and Roger Wicker announced Ambassador Killion's joint appointment as the Senate Staff Director for the U.S. Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe (U.S. Helsinki Commission). In 2014, after his service as U.S. Ambassador to UNESCO, Killion returned to work as a legislative professional, receiving a joint appointment as the Senate Staff Director for the U.S. Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe (U.S. Helsinki Commission).

History Paddock Wood was founded in 1995 as a mail order brewing supply business providing grain, yeast and other brewing supplies to the homebrewing market. In 2000 the business expanded to include brewing kits made in house to which customers would add yeast and complete the fermentation process at home. In 2004 Paddock Wood Brewing Co entered into negotiations with the provincial regulatory body, the Saskatchewan Liquor and Gaming Authority, in an attempt to change a standing policy that restricted the licensing of microbreweries to premises where the beer was also consumed. In the same year the province changed the regulation allowing Paddock Wood Brewing Co to transition from a supplies business to a licensed microbrewery. Production and distribution During 2011 Paddock Wood produced approximately 3,000 hectolitres of beer, equivalent to 500,000 bottles, an increase of 2650 hectolitres over 2007. CEO Steve Cavan has stated that the brewery attempts to adhere as closely to the German purity law for beer production as possible; Paddock Wood does not use rice, corn or added chemicals.

In this role, he had supervisory responsibility over several dozen lawyers in the Administrative Law Division and worked on a wide variety of regulatory and transactional matters involving the wireless, wireline, cable, Internet, media, and satellite industries. In 2010, Pai was one of 55 individuals nationwide chosen for the 2011 Marshall Memorial Fellowship, a leadership development initiative of the German Marshall Fund of the United States. Pai returned to the private sector in April 2011, working in the Washington, D.C., office of law firm Jenner & Block where he was a partner in the Communications Practice. In 2011, Pai was then nominated for a Republican Party position on the Federal Communications Commission by President Barack Obama at the recommendation of Minority leader Mitch McConnell. He was confirmed unanimously by the United States Senate on May 7, 2012, and was sworn in on May 14, 2012, for a term that concluded on June 30, 2016. Then Pai was designated chairman of the FCC by President Donald Trump in January 2017 for a five-year term. He was confirmed by the U.S. Senate for the additional five-year term on October 2, 2017. In 2019, he was named forty- seventh among the 100 Most Influential People in Healthcare by Modern Healthcare.  Policy positions  Pai has been an advocate for less regulation during his tenure on the FCC. He is seen as a closer ally to broadcasters than to other members of the FCC. In testimony before the U.S. House of Representatives Energy and Commerce Committee's Subcommittee on Communications and Technology on July 10, 2012, he warned about the dangers of regulatory uncertainty and the need for the FCC to keep pace with the dynamic communications sector. Pai also asserted that by reforming the way the commission works, the agency can facilitate the provision of new and better services at lower prices for American consumers. Pai gave his first major speech since taking office on July 18, 2012, at Carnegie Mellon University. He discussed how the FCC can help promote economic growth and enhance job creation in the information and communications technology field by adhering to three basic principles: (1) the FCC should be as nimble as the industry it oversees; (2) the FCC should prioritize the removal of regulatory barriers to infrastructure investment; and (3) the FCC should accelerate its efforts to allocate additional spectrum for mobile broadband. Pai called for a reinvigoration of Section 7 of the Communications Act, which gives the commission a one-year deadline to review proposals for new technologies and services. He introduced the idea of creating an IP Transition Task Force to expedite the country's transition to all-IP networks. He urged the commission to settle the nine-year-old contributions reform proceeding for the Universal Service Fund by the end of the year. Finally, he advocated for completing the rules for the AWS-4 spectrum band by September 2012 and conducting the broadcast spectrum incentive auctions by June 30, 2014. Pai wrote an op-ed for the Wall Street Journal in 2014 criticizing a proposed FCC study of the news- gathering practices of media organizations. In another 2014 letter, Pai criticized Netflix, writing that their Open Connect caching tools effectively secure fast lanes for its traffic. In October 2014, Pai wrote an op-ed in the Washington Post criticizing a government-funded research project named \\"Truthy\\" at Indiana University which was studying the spread of \\"false and misleading ideas, hate speech and subversive propaganda\\" online. Pai questioned the value of the project, writing, \\"should taxpayer money be used to monitor your speech and evaluate your 'partisanship?'\\" Truthy researchers defended the project, writing, \\"we do not monitor individual people. The tweets we analyze are public and accessible by anyone.\\" Indiana University issued a press release which said \\"the Truthy project is a basic computing research project designed to provide analytical insight into the ways in which information is spread across social media networks such as Twitter.\\" U.S. House Science Committee Chairman Lamar Smith sent a letter to the National Science Foundation announcing a review of the grant. In 2017, Pai removed from circulation a proposal introduced by Tom Wheeler which would have required cable providers to make their programming available on third-party devices. = Net neutrality in the United States = In a hearing on net neutrality in 2014, Pai said that he was committed to a free and open internet and that it was not the FCC's role to determine net neutrality. He testified that \\"a dispute this fundamental is not for us, five unelected individuals, to decide. Instead, it should be resolved by the people's elected representatives, those who choose the direction of government, and those whom the American people can hold accountable for that choice.\\" Later, Pai voted against the FCC's 2015 Open Internet Order, classifying internet service under Title II of the Communications Act of 1934, which bars certain providers from \\"mak[ing] any unjust or unreasonable discrimination in charges, practices, classifications, regulations, facilities, or services.\\"47 United States Code Section 202 He said in December 2016 that he believed Title II net neutrality's \\"days were numbered,\\" and was described by the New York Times as a stickler for strict application of telecommunications law and limits on the FCC's authority. In a speech two weeks before the FCC's scheduled December 2017 vote on net neutrality, Pai was critical of celebrities including Cher, Mark Ruffalo, and Alyssa Milano for boosting opposition to the planned repeal. In response to criticism from Ruffalo, Pai said \\"Getting rid of government authority over the Internet is the exact opposite of authoritarianism. Government control is the defining feature of authoritarians, including the one in North Korea.\\" Pai said Twitter and other tech companies were hypocritical for arguing for a free and open internet while, according to Pai, such companies \\"routinely block or discriminate against content they don't like.\\" The day before the FCC's scheduled vote on net neutrality, Pai appeared in a video entitled \\"Ajit Pai Wants The Internet To Know You Can Still Harlem Shake After Net Neutrality\\". The controversial video showed him dancing to the \\"Harlem Shake\\" and buying products online, including a toy lightsaber. In the video, Pai is shown dancing next to Martina Markota, a proponent of the Pizzagate conspiracy theory and a staff member at the Daily Caller, the media outlet that produced the video. In response to the video, Star Wars actor Mark Hamill said Pai was \\"unworthy\\" of holding the Jedi weapon, as \\"a Jedi acts selflessly for the common man.\\" Baauer, the creator of the song featured in the video, has threatened to take legal action against Pai alongside his record label for Pai's use of the song in his video. As chairman, he also closed an investigation into zero-rating practices by wireless providers T-Mobile, AT&T;, and Verizon. On May 18, 2017, the Federal Communications Commission took the first formal step toward dismantling the net neutrality rules, and on December 14, 2017, voted to reverse Title II regulations after a contentious public comment period. In February 2018, the National Rifle Association (NRA) awarded Pai with the Charlton Heston Courage Under Fire Award for repealing net neutrality rules despite facing heavy public criticism. As part of the award, a handmade Kentucky long gun was gifted to Pai. This gift caused former White House ethics attorney Walter Shaub to question if Pai, a federal employee, had violated ethics rules by accepting gifts from lobbyists such as the NRA. When the US Senate voted by 52–47 \\"to put the Federal Communications Commission's net-neutrality rules back in place\\" in May 2018, Pai was said to be \\"upset\\", stating having no net neutrality rules \\"will help promote digital opportunity\\" while making \\"high-speed Internet access available to every single American.\\" Regarding \\"Democrats' effort to reinstate heavy-handed government regulation of the Internet\\", Ajit Pai conceded it would fail in the House. = Prison inmate telephone calling costs = Pai argued against adoption of the FCC 2013 analysis and proposed rulemaking regarding the high cost of inmate telephone calls, referred to as Inmate Calling Service (ICS) by the FCC. He submitted his written dissent in which he argued that the nature of the exclusive single carrier contract between private ICS providers and prison administrators meant inmates cannot \\"count on market competition to keep prices for inmate calling services just and reasonable.\\" (ICS has become a $1.2 billion telecommunications industry and the two largest providers in the United States were private equity-backed companies). Prior to the FCC's imposition of rate caps on interstate prison and jail phone calls in February 2014, the largest ICS provider Global Tel-Link (GTL) – which has been profitably bought and sold by private equity firms such as American Securities and Veritas Capital – charged some of the highest rates in the US – up to $17.30 for a 15-minute call. The 2013 FCC analysis, described how, in some cases, long-distance calls are charged six times the rate on the outside. Acting Chairwoman Clyburn concurred with her order and both Jessica Rosenworcel and Pai dissented and issued statements. Pai opposed the FCC imposition of \\"safe harbor\\" of 12 cents with a cap of 21 cents on private ICS providers like GTL and CenturyLink Public Communications, arguing instead for a \\"simple proposal to cap interstate rates, with one rate for jails and a lower rate for prisons\\" that are cost-based to protect providers and ensure \\"some return on investment.\\" Pai also argued that the FCC was not well- equipped to micromanage rates at each and every prison. In 2015, Pai opposed rate caps on intrastate inmate calls over which courts have ruled the FCC has no jurisdiction, notwithstanding rates as high as $14 per minute. He raised concerns about the increased use of contraband cell phones in prisons. In November 2016, the ICS providers won a halt on the regulation rules. Pai criticized Democrats for appealing. Shortly after his January 23 confirmation as chairman, Pai withdrew support for the FCC case involving GTL and CenturyLink set for February 6, 2017, which had called for establishing FCC jurisdiction over rates set by states. In June 2017, the US Court of Appeals struck down a large part of the FCC's ICS order. = Lifeline program = In 2016, Pai called for an investigation of potential fraud among beneficiaries of the agency's Lifeline subsidy for telecommunication services, contending that \\"apparent duplicates\\" who had signed up for the program improperly received $476 million annually. He rescinded permissions for nine new broadband providers selected by the previous FCC to participate in the program (along with more than 900 others) after becoming agency chairman, stating the new providers had not followed FCC guidelines requiring them to coordinate with the National Tribal Telecommunications Association in order to participate in the Lifeline program. Pai argued the rules had been improperly circumvented by the previous Democratic chairman, former lobbyist Tom Wheeler. =Sinclair Broadcast Group= In November 2017, two Democratic members of the U.S. House of Representatives, John Conyers (Mich.) and David Cicilline (R.I.), asked David L. Hunt, the inspector general of the FCC, to investigate whether Pai's legislative actions regarding the relaxation of broadcast ownership rules were biased in favor of Sinclair Broadcast Group, a large owner of broadcast television stations that, since the formation of its now- defunct News Central format in 2003, produces conservative news and commentary segments that the group requires its stations to insert into certain local newscasts. The FCC, under Pai, undertook a number of actions that the legislators believe would benefit Sinclair – which has lobbied for such changes for several years – including rolling back certain broadcast television station ownership limitations (including allowing exceptions to duopoly rules that forbid common ownership of two television stations in the same market if both are among the four highest-rated or if such a combination would dilute independent media voices, reinstating a 1985 discount quota on UHF stations repealed two years earlier by Wheeler and his Democratic-led majority, a requirement dating to the FCC's inception for broadcast outlets to maintain office operations within the community of their primary local coverage areas, and removing ownership attribution rules applying to joint sales and shared services agreements). A spokeswoman for Pai said \\"the request appears to be part of many Democrats' attempt to target one particular company because of its perceived political views... Any claim that Chairman Pai is modifying the rules now to benefit one particular company is completely baseless.\\" = L-band 5G networking = On April 16, 2020, Pai asked the other FCC commissioners to approve an application to \\"deploy a low-power terrestrial nationwide network in the L-Band that would primarily support 5G and Internet of Things services\\", in spite of a report issued by the DoD raising concerns about the potential impact it could have on the operational capabilities of the US military, specifically with regard to GPS coverage. = Section 230 = On October 15, 2020, Pai released an official statement pledging that he would clarify Section 230, a portion of the Communications Decency Act that provides immunity for website publishers of third-party content. President Donald Trump had previously threatened to punish Facebook and Twitter for alleged anti- conservative bias after the companies blocked a series of New York Post stories about the Hunter Biden email controversy. Under Section 230, social media companies are granted Second Amendment rights, but are legally distinct from press publications.  Personal life  In 2010, Pai married Janine Van Lancker, an allergist, at the Willard InterContinental Washington hotel. They have two children and live in Arlington, Virginia. In 2017, Pai publicly complained that net neutrality protesters had targeted his family. Messages directed at his children were put up near his suburban Virginia home saying that \\"They will come to know the truth. Dad murdered Democracy in cold blood\\" and \\"How will they ever look you in the eye again?\\". No group took responsibility for the provocative signs, though the advocacy organization Popular Resistance left flyers on Pai's neighbors' doors that included his picture, age, and weight as part of a campaign they called \\"Ajit-ation\\".

Agent Wells has been a recurring guest-character of the series playing the major antagonist of Season 2 and appearing alongside Agents Myka Bering and Pete Lattimer. Portrayed as having a genius-level intellect and a methodical nature, she is an inventor and author and a former agent of Warehouses 12 and 13. Character background In the season 3 episode \\"Stand\\", it is revealed that Wells joins Warehouse 12 in the year 1889. It is depicted in \\"Stand\\" and \\"Vendetta\\" that Helena begins her work as an agent from that time and continues up until sometime after 1899. As an Agent of Warehouse 12 it is made clear that she dislikes the use of conventional firearms. When she brings the matter to her mentor and boss Chaturanga, he gives her a gun that stuns the victim with electricity. She likely used it as a base model for the Tesla (the primary firearm used by Agents of Warehouse 13) that she created with Nikola Tesla in 1893. After the loss of her daughter Christina, who was killed in a robbery while vacationing with cousins in Paris, Helena becomes obsessed with finding a way to turn back time and save her. This leads to the invention of the \\"H.G. Wells' Time Machine\\". Helena's time machine in Warehouse 13 differs from the machine described in the novel The Time Machine by H.G. Wells in that the device she presents is not a vehicle. Instead, it transports consciousness to a directed target across time. After several failed attempts to save her daughter's life Helena eventually realizes she is unable to change events from the past, and after murdering the men who killed her daughter, she continues to behave recklessly until she eventually inadvertently causes the death of a fellow agent. This event shocks her into the realization that she has become a danger, and she chooses to be bronzed to prevent any further damage. Bronzing is a form of punishment the Warehouse utilizes after conventional imprisonment has failed or is not an option. The subject is cast in bronze in a special machine, and thereafter remains conscious, but in a state that resembles cryogenic sleep where the aging process is stopped. She remains bronzed until set free by Leena on the order of James MacPherson in the season finale of season 1.  Character arc Awakened from bronzing in the season 1 finale by Leena, Wells is taken away from the Warehouse by MacPherson. She later kills him during the Season 2 premiere episode \\"Time Will Tell\\". Throughout Season 2 Helena attempts to be reinstated at the Warehouse as an agent and enlists the aid of Myka Bering as an advocate for her cause. She is eventually reinstated in \\"Vendetta\\", but in \\"Buried\\" it is clear the ulterior motive for being reinstated is to destroy the world by inducing an extinction event through use of a stolen artifact. Planning to trigger a massive earthquake with the Minoan Trident in Yellowstone, she later fails to follow through when Myka Bering convinces her to stop by forcing her to have to shoot Myka if she wishes to carry out her plan. She voluntarily gives herself up for arrest following the confrontation and is taken away. During her incarceration in Season 3, Helena has no corporeal body, and is instead a holographic image. Her consciousness is projected by an artifact allowing her to converse while preventing any physical interaction. While in this state she persuades Myka to return to work at the Warehouse in the premiere \\"The New Guy\\", and is not seen again until she is brought in for consultation on a case she unsuccessfully worked in 1893 as shown in \\"3...2...1....\\" In the finale episodes of Season 3, \\"Emily Lake\\" and \\"Stand\\", the main antagonist for the season, Walter Sykes, pursues finding Helena's physical form as well as her consciousness in order to reconstitute them. Myka Bering and Pete Lattimer find Helena's physical body in the personage of Ms. Emily Hannah Lake – a high school literature teacher living in Cheyenne, Wyoming. They later discover Helena's consciousness was separated from her physical body by using the Janus Coin artifact. They are unable to save her from being abducted by Marcus Diamond and their under-cover Warehouse agent Steve Jinks who deliver her to Sykes. Sykes reintegrates Helena's body and mind before taking her to China where he forces her to help him open a portal directly into Warehouse 13. She complies only to save Myka Bering's life after an unsuccessful attempt to save Tyler Struhl. Shortly afterward, Helena chooses to sacrifice her life in order to save the lives of her fellow agents from an explosion that obliterates the warehouse. In the Season 4 premiere Artie Nielsen uses an artifact to turn back time 24 hours, and successfully finds a way to defuse the bomb that would destroy the Warehouse. Since he is successful in saving the Warehouse, Helena's death, her tragic hero's redemptive act of self-sacrifice, never happened. Artie later successfully advocates on Helena's behalf to keep her from being re- incarcerated. Helena becomes aware of this alternate timeline in \\"Second Chance\\", after she deduces, in the previous episode (\\"Endless Wonder\\"), that Artie used a time travel artifact to save the Warehouse. Also in this episode, Mrs. Frederic tells her to take the astrolabe and hide it where no one can find it. In the season 4 episode, \\"Instinct\\", Helena is shown working as a forensic scientist for the Wisconsin police. She is also living, and romantically involved, with a man named Nate. Nate has an eight-year-old daughter named Adelaide, to whom Helena has taught Kenpo as well as deductive reasoning. When Myka confronts Helena and states her belief that Helena is running away from who she is by holding onto the surrogate daughter she has found in Adelaide, Helena becomes incensed and asks her to leave. Later, however, the two women reaffirm their bond and part ways on good terms. Skills and abilities Helena's character was created within the series to have a remarkably tuned quality of deductive reasoning, extremely calm focus, and extraordinary attention to detail. Within the Warehouse 13 universe this allows her character to be portrayed as a science-fiction type of Sherlock Holmes. The Helena character is given an expertise in the martial art of Kenpo which she displays in multiple episodes throughout Seasons 2 and 3. She is also shown to be an accomplished author and inventor. Two of her many inventions are the Imperceptor Vest (allows faster-than-humanly-detectable movement) and Cavorite (a fictitious metal with anti-gravity effects, as described in the real H.G. Wells story The First Men in the Moon) - both of which are depicted in \\"Time Will Tell\\". Another invention displayed in the show is a grappler gun, shown in episodes \\"For the Team\\", \\"Buried\\" and \\"The 40th Floor\\"; and a time machine as seen in \\"Where and When\\", which allows the transference of consciousness to the minds of targeted individuals at a specific date and time. It is implied the character has a fluency in languages as she depicts a fluent grasp of French and a recognition of Demotic Egyptian upon hearing it spoken per \\"Buried\\". In the same episode, Wells says she \\"considers the study of dead languages to be a hobby\\". In the episode \\"Instinct\\", Helena is shown to be employed as a forensic scientist for a police station in Wisconsin. Relationships Helena had three professional relationships from her days at Warehouse 12, with her partner Agent Wolcott, fellow-agent McShane, and her teacher Caturanga – as depicted in \\"3...2...1...\\" and \\"Stand\\". Her professional relationships from her dealings at the current Warehouse are depicted throughout Seasons 2, 3, and 4 and are with Artie Nielsen who serves mostly as her chief detractor until the Season 4 premiere, Claudia Donovan who serves as a mentee, Pete Lattimer a fellow-agent with whom she has some difficulties, and Myka Bering who is her fellow-agent, friend, and a romantic interest of sorts. Romantic interests =Myka Bering= While never explicitly shown or stated on the show itself, Joanne Kelly addressed the Warehouse 13 panel discussion's audience at the 2012 San Diego Comic-Con to assert \\"Myka will always love H.G.\\", and reiterated the romantic attraction between her character and Jaime Murray's in a later interview that same day by saying of the characters \\"we're in love\\". In the same interview she clarifies her statement by making the sexual undertones of their love for each other definitive. =Nate= In the season 4 episode, \\"Instinct\\", Helena is shown to be part of a new family. She lives with a man named Nate and Adelaide, his 8-year-old daughter - to whom Helena has taught the arts of deductive reasoning as well as Kenpo. Helena indicates this new family life is her way of trying to fit into the world again, to find normalcy, away from the Warehouse and the world of the artifacts. Helena G. Wells versus the real-life H.G. Wells The season 2 episode \\"Time Will Tell\\" and season 3 episode \\"Emily Lake\\" establish the birth-year, birthplace, and later residence of Helena G. Wells to be the same as her real-world counterpart H.G. Wells who was born in 1866 in England. It is unclear how much of the biographical information available on the historical H.G. Wells would apply to Helena due to her claim that her brother, Charles, is the person history remembers by her name.

Squalodontids are known from all continents except Antarctica, from the Oligocene to the Neogene, but they had a maximal diversity and global distribution during the Late Oligocene and Early to Middle Miocene (). With their cosmopolitan Miocene distribution and heterodont dentition, squalodontids are the most common and basal platanistoids. They are relatively large odontocetes, comparable in size to extant mesoplodont whales. The premaxillae on their elongated rostrum have large and slightly convex fossae for the air sacs associated with the presence of a melon, indicating the ability for echolocation. Squalodon and Eosqualodon are based on partial or complete skulls. The synapomorphic traits of the family are, however, based mostly on one of the bones of the inner ear, the periotic bone, which is unknown in these genera except in Squalodon. The monophyly of the family is, therefore, uncertain. Patriocetus has also been included. Some squalodontids are known from rather complete fossils, but most were described based on a few isolated teeth. Squalodontids are most likely very distantly related to extant oceanic dolphins but, according to French palaeontologist Christian de Muizon, more closely related to the South Asian river dolphin (Platanista gangetica). The genus Squalodon was named by French naturalist Jean-Pierre Sylvestre de Grateloup in 1840 based on a jaw fragment he thought belonged to a reptile. Fossils discovered later, nevertheless, showed that this was a toothed whale. In extant odontocetes, however, the dentition is atavistic with all teeth reduced to simple, undifferentiated conical shapes. In squalodonts the teeth resemble those of the archaic whales, Archaeoceti, with conical incisors anteriorly and low-crowned, serrated teeth posteriorly.

This lifestyle is closely connected with the activity of music making at weddings. Other occupations associated with the Abdal include tinning, basket making and sieve manufacture. They are related with the Abdal (caste).  Origin  The three most remarkable characteristics of the group are its close relationship with the Alevi sect, its use of a secret language (Abdoltili/Teberce) or argot and its wide distribution. It seems that the name Abdal was associated with Alevi dervishes of Central Anatolia, whose existence is first recorded in the 16th Century. These Abdalan-ı Rum were extreme Alevis practising celibacy and withdrawal from the world. Their unorthodox behavior led to their suppression by the Ottoman authorities. At least some of the present day Abdals are descended from these groups. The Abdal language consists of borrowing from Indo-Aryan languages, Persian and other Iranian sources, some Kurdish and Romani language with an essentially Turkish grammar. A possible connection with the Romani people is seen by the facts two of their subdivisions are the Gurbet and Kara Domen, signifying possible links with the Gurbati of Iran and the Dom of the Arab Middle East. According to the Abdal themselves, they came once from North India and went to Khorasan in Iran, and are intermarried with tribe's of Turkmen, from there they went with the Seljuq to Central Anatolia.Abdal by Peter Alford Andrews pages 435 to 438 in Ethnic groups in the Republic of Turkey / compiled and edited by Peter Alford Andrews, with the assistance of Rüdiger Benninghaus (Wiesbaden : Dr. Ludwig Reichert, 1989) In southwestern Turkey, the Abdal play a particular role as musicians, minstrels, jewelers and magicians to the nomadic Barak Turkmen, as a dependent group. Abdal encampments are found at the edges of the Turkmen camps. A similar relationship also exists with certain Kurdish tribes. In the area north of Ankara, many Abdal are sedentary, but associated with certain activities as circumcision (a sacred Muslim tradition) and barbering.Marginal Groups and Itinerants by Ingvar Savanberg pages 602 to 612 in Ethnic groups in the Republic of Turkey / compiled and edited by Peter Alford Andrews, with the assistance of Rüdiger Benninghaus (Wiesbaden : Dr. Ludwig Reichert, 1989)  See also  * Tahtacı  References  Ethnic groups in Turkey Dom in the Middle East Dom in Europe Modern nomads Romani in Turkey Abdal (caste) ","title":"Abdal of Turkey"},{"id":"36544626","text":"Iris magnifica is a bulbous flowering plant in the genus Iris, in the subgenus Scorpiris.

In Smite, players control a god, goddess, or other mythological figure, and take part in team-based combat, using their abilities and tactics against other player-controlled gods and non-player-controlled minions. The game has multiple player versus player (PVP) modes, many playable characters, and has a successful esports scene with multiple tournaments, including the annual million-dollar Smite World Championship. Gameplay Smite features many different game modes with the largest being Conquest.Smite Stuff. Smite Stuff. Retrieved on July 21, 2015. Players are formed into two teams with five players on each team. All players begin at opposite sides of a map at their team's \\"fountain\\". Before the players enter the map, they are granted an amount of gold to buy starting items. These items grant special bonuses or abilities that enhance the player's god. There are three continuous \\"lanes\\" running from one side of the map to the other. Each lane is defended by a \\"Phoenix\\" which is accompanied by a pair of extra defensive towers. Phoenixes and towers deal a large amount of damage to any enemies that come too close. The goal of each game is to destroy the opposing team's Phoenixes and the Titan, a giant warrior who must be defeated to win the game. The players are accompanied by \\"minions\\", small soldiers with a weak attack. These minions spawn at the Phoenixes every thirty seconds and run along their lane until they meet opposition and attack immediately. Archers will attack not only players and other minions, but also towers, Phoenixes, and the Titan. In fact, their presence is required for players to deal full damage to these objectives. Defensive positions will prioritize enemy minions over players, allowing players to attack a tower without receiving damage; however, towers will fire upon players if there are no minions nearby or the player attacks an enemy player under their tower. If a game is going badly for a certain team, they can decide to surrender after at least 10 minutes, though this requires a majority of the team (4 players to 1) to agree. With every game, players have to choose a god or other figure to play as. Currently, players can choose between a large variety of characters from different pantheons including Chinese, Egyptian, Greek, Hindu, Japanese, Norse, Slavic, and Yoruba.Gods Official Website. Retrieved on November 25, 2019. Each character is classified as one of the following classes: Assassin, Guardian, Hunter, Mage, or Warrior. Unless otherwise stated, two players on the same team cannot choose the same character (in competitive modes and those using a Draft pick method, each player much use a different character). The player controls the god in a third person perspective, which is a unique characteristic of this MOBA, as other games of this genre are typically played from a top-down perspective. Each god has a basic attack, a passive trait, and four abilities with varying effects, such as area damage, crowd control, buffs, and many more. These abilities are acquired and upgraded when the player's character levels up by gaining experience from being in range of minions when they are killed, taking down towers or phoenixes, and defeating enemy characters. The maximum level is 20 and each successive level is more difficult to reach. Gold, which is used to buy items that increase power, defense, and passive effects, potions, wards and abilities, is accumulated through standard periodic income, by slaying enemies (player and NPC alike), or by selling owned items. The large areas between the lanes make up what is called the \\"jungle\\", where computer- controlled monsters such as packs of cyclopes or Furies (the latter alternately referred to as harpies) periodically spawn at specific locations distributed symmetrically across the map. Killing certain monsters in said jungle causes a \\"buff\\" to drop on the ground where it can be picked up by a player, which depending on the type of monster killed will grant the player bonuses to stats such as damage dealt, movement speed, attack speed. There are three special neutral monsters who appear less frequently that when killed will grant the entire team who killed it a powerful damage buff for a medium length of time, set amount of Gold, and a speed boost when coming out of the base respectively. There are also some monsters which do not offer a buff, only experience and gold.SMITE Announced – MMORPG.com News. Mmorpg.com.

Retrieved on December 10, 2012. Around December 2013, there was a feature added that allowed players to choose between US and EU servers, but was later removed from the game due to issues with the matchmaking system. This feature was eventually re-added. Originally, most modes used to operate on queues with 3-minute matchmaking timers. Every three minutes, matches would be made from the group of people in queue at that time. In late 2014, that system was replaced with a more traditional non-timed one (a more popular format in many MOBAs) that looks for an optimal match instead of just the best match-ups at the present time. In this system, if it takes 5 minutes or more to match a player, the game will gradually lower its requirements until a match is found. A new matchmaking system similar to the original one was introduced in 2018, with different times for different modes. The system will prioritize the player's general performance over their account level. In Ranked Leagues, players are matched by a variation of Elo, a system that rates players with a number that indicates how well the individual skill of that player is. The player will be matched with players that have a similar rating as them. The goal of this system is to have 2 individual teams that have a similar TOTAL Elo.

The game currently holds a score of 83 out of 100 on Metacritic, based on a dozen reviews by all major video game critics. =Depiction of Hindu gods= In June 2012, some Hindu leaders became upset at the inclusion of several Hindu gods in Smite and the fact that they are player-controlled. The deities that were in question were Kali, Agni, and Vamana (the only playable Hindu deities at the time) and there was particular opposition to how Kali was dressed. Rajan Zed, the president of Universal Society of Hinduism, released a statement urging Hi-Rez to remove these gods from the game, claiming their presence is trivialized and in other words, offensive to the devoted. Since players control the gods, this is seen as offensive to the faithful. In response Todd Harris, CEO of Hi-Rez, had this to say: Despite the response from Hi-Rez, in early July 2012, the Hindu leader who spoke out against the game had not given up on his quest to rid Smite of Hindu deities and since his initial statement he has gained new backers from other faiths that have come together in support of his stance that the game's content is offensive. Rajin Zed was joined by Rabbi Elizabeth Beyer and Buddhist Jikai Phil Bryan in condemning the game's content as offensive.Controversy Over Hindu Gods in Smite Not Over. rtsguru.com (July 2, 2012).

Despite the protests, Hi-Rez has continued to expand the Hindu Pantheon roster, with its most recent addition being Ganesha. Professional competition In mid-2014, Hi-Rez Studios implemented a system by which players could join professional leagues in teams of 5. Players first played in online competitions, then progressed to offline competitions. Next, the teams were ranked according to how well they did within these competitions, and finally, the top teams were invited to compete in the Smite World Championship. From January 9–11, 2015, Hi-Rez Studios hosted the first Smite World Championship. Teams from North America, South America, Europe, and China traveled to Atlanta, Georgia for the tournament. The $2.6 million prize pool for the tournament was at the time the third-highest in Esports, behind the third and fourth iterations of Dota 2's The International, and just slightly ahead of the League of Legends World Championships. One of the North American teams, COGnitive Prime, took home the first place prize with a little over $1.3 million. In July 2015, Stew Chisam, president of Hi-Rez Studios, announced that after discussing the prizing structure of Smite esports with team owners, players, and members of other esports communities, Hi-Rez would be placing a cap on the prize pool for the Smite World Championships at $1 million. This decision was based to pay out more money to more players throughout the year instead of paying the bulk of earned prize money at a single event. In January 2016, the Smite World Championship was held, returning to Atlanta, with the total prize of $1 million awarded.

With the ultimate goal of having one big union in the Canadian public sector, Little successfully negotiated a merger with the National Union of Public Employees (NUPE). This led to the founding of the Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE) on September 24, 1963. Little was elected National President at CUPE's first national convention alongside Robert Rintoul, the former director of the NUPE, who was elected National Secretary-Treasurer.

On the monument is shown an escutcheon with the arms of Rolle in the centre of which is an escutcheon of pretence with the arms of Lovering: Argent, on a fesse wavy azure a lion passant or, which signifies that Dorothy Lovering was an heiress.

Griffin was born and raised on the Martin estate in Connemara, being a native of Corindulla, near Ross. The family were badly hit by the famine, and in February 1847 walked the thirty miles to Galway in search of relief. \\"However, many city dwellers shunned these refugees arriving amongst them, a situation born more out of fear of contacting disease rather than selfishness or indifference.\\" Brother Paul O'Connor ran the Orphans' Breakfast Institute in Lombard Street, where Celia and her siblings were fed. However, more and more people arrived each day, and the Institute could not feed them all. What became of Griffin's parents is unknown. She and her two sisters were taken into the Presentation Convent on Presentation Road in the second week of March when Celia collapsed on the street. Attempts by the nuns to save her failed and she died as a result of the effects of starvation.

Prior to the games =IOC policy= Brand protection Protection of the Olympic brand has been the subject of some criticism. The Olympic rings themselves are protected in the United Kingdom under the Olympic Symbol etc. (Protection) Act 1995, and under provisions set out by the London Olympic Games and Paralympic Games Act 2006, the London Organising Committee of the Olympic Games and Paralympic Games (LOCOG) are empowered to prevent the misuse of Olympic branding leading up to the 2012 Games. The acts aim to prevent unauthorised commercial association with the games by traders (such as using the Olympic rings in a shop window) and to prevent attempts at ambush marketing at games events, but the constraints detailed in the guidelines issued by LOCOG have been criticised by some commentators as a form of censorship. The guidelines specify a range of trademarked logos and designs as well as certain \\"Listed Expressions\\" and protected words that advertisers may not use, which include the words \\"London\\" and \\"2012\\". Even if an advertiser does not mention the Olympics or use any of the listed words, any visual or audio representation of London and sports may be considered by a court to be an infringement of LOCOG's rights and subject to a fine of £20,000 or possible imprisonment. A number of individuals and businesses have fallen foul of the restrictions including a lingerie shop in Leicester, and a Plymouth café selling Olympic torch baguettes. An exception to these rules was successfully negotiated by the restaurant chain Little Chef, who have been permitted by LOCOG to continue to sell their fried \\"Olympic Breakfast\\" because the item has carried that name on their menu since 1994. In an interview with BBC journalist Evan Davis, Lord Coe emphasised the need to protect the rights of official sponsors such as BMW and Adidas who had contributed large sums of money to the Games. His suggestion that visitors to the London games would not be admitted if they were wearing a Pepsi-branded T-shirt was later retracted by LOCOG, who stated that such rules would apply only to large groups of spectators wearing \\"visibly branded\\" clothing. Criticism has also focused on the exclusive rights held by some sponsors to serve and advertise food at and near to Olympic venues; McDonald's held sole rights to sell chips throughout the games, preventing independent food outlets from serving chips with any meal, although an exception was negotiated with McDonald's to allow the sale of traditional British fish and chips. Food sellers must also comply with food outlet specifications which require prominent display of Coca-Cola branding with limited space for their own products. Eligibility of athletes suspended for doping The IOC amended the Olympic Charter in June 2008 in order to bar athletes suspended for at least six months for a doping offence from competing at the Olympic Games following the end of the suspension. This provision, known as the Osaka Rule or Rule 45, was challenged before the Court of Arbitration for Sport. In October 2011 the court found that the provision was not an eligibility rule, but a sanction not mandated by the World Anti- Doping Code and thus invalid. Several athletes were allowed to compete at the 2012 Summer Olympics as a result of the ruling, including defending Olympic champion LaShawn Merritt (who was suspended in 2010 for a year for taking over-the-counter genitals enlargement product, ExtenZe, which contains the banned steroid dehydroepiandrosterone) and Jessica Hardy a 2012 olympic gold medalist. In April 2012 the decision was reaffirmed, when the court found a similar rule for the British team invalid. The rulings have led to calls from the IOC to include a provision similar to the Osaka Rule in the next Anti- Doping Code, which will be in effect by the 2016 Summer Olympics. Women participants and the hijab After an initial dispute, the IOC and associated sports organizations allowed women to participate in the games as athletes or officials while wearing hijabs. According to the Associated Press, religious clerics and religious activists in some countries wanted more modest uniforms. According to Sports Illustrated, critics charged that allowing the headgear violated IOC Rule 50 which prohibits religious displays in olympic venues and that countries which required the headgear for their female representatives were practicing gender apartheid and claimed that this should require the same stand that the IOC took against South African apartheid by banning that country from the Olympics for 21 years. A group called London 2012: Justice for Women protested the IOC's allowance of the hijab by placing a copy of the Olympic charter into a coffin and then throwing it off Westminster Bridge, while a band played funeral music. =Sponsors= Healthy eating There was criticism that companies that produce junk food or otherwise unhealthy foods and drinks are major sponsors of the Olympics, notably McDonald's, Coca-Cola, Cadbury and Heineken, which seemingly conflicts with the Olympian ideal of health and wellness. Critics included the Chief Medical Officer of Wales, Dr Tony Jewell, and the head of sports science of the GB Team. The London Assembly passed a motion calling for a ban on junk food sponsors. The sponsors were defended on the grounds that they provide a significant income for the event. Jacques Rogge, President of the IOC, acknowledged concerns but noted the importance of sponsorship money and said that the issue of obesity had been raised with such sponsors. McDonald's and Coca-Cola also defended their involvement, stating that healthy eating was the responsibility of the individual to make their own purchasing choices. LOCOG's policy for food provision states a number of aims including diversity, hygiene, health and nutrition and sustainability. Payment services Electronic payment services for Olympic ticketing and in Olympic venues were provided exclusively by Visa under the terms of their global sponsorship deal with the IOC. This led to criticism during ticket sales before the Games and to complaints of unreliability of payment systems and a shortage of cash points (particularly for cardholders of cards other than those provided by Visa) to obtain cash at Olympic venues during the Games. =Security= Air defence sites The decision by the Ministry of Defence to station soldiers armed with Starstreak surface-to-air missiles on top of the Lexington building, a residential apartment block in Bow, was challenged in court on 10 July by residents of another tower Fred Wigg Tower in Leytonstone, east London, where missiles were to be sited, under Article 8 and Article 1 of Protocol 1 of the European Convention on Human Rights, over concerns the missiles made them a terrorist target. The judgement from Mr Justice Haddon- Cave was in favour of the siting of the missiles on Fred Wigg Tower. He stated in his judgement David Enright, the solicitor representing the residents said after the judgement: Security guard shortage In July 2012 the private security firm G4S, which had been contracted to supply security personnel for the Olympics, revealed that it had failed to recruit and train enough staff for the Games. The shortfall was made up by deploying 3,500 troops of the British Armed Forces. Reports in the media claimed some recruits were not able to speak adequate English. An inquiry was held by the United Kingdom Parliament into the issue and a report issued said that G4S \\"must bear the cost of its Olympic failure\\". =Nationality issues= Falkland Islands dispute On 2 May 2012, on the 30th anniversary of the sinking of the Argentine cruiser ARA General Belgrano, an advertising film depicting the captain of Argentina's hockey team, Fernando Zylberberg, training in Stanley, Falkland Islands, was broadcast in Argentina under the slogan \\"To compete on British soil, we train on Argentine soil.\\" While it was claimed by several major Argentine newspapers that the film had not been commissioned by the Argentine government, with it being produced by the local office of the Young & Rubicam advertising agency, the rights to it were purchased by the Office of the President for national broadcast. An IOC statement said \\"the games should not be part of a political platform\\", while Argentine Olympic Committee President Gerardo Werthein stated that \\"the Olympic Games cannot be used to make political gestures\\". Zylberberg stated that he had been unaware that the film would be used as a political advert. He subsequently was not selected for the Argentine hockey squad. Regent Street flags display The Chinese Taipei Olympic flag suspended alongside the national flags of Syria and Switzerland in Piccadilly As part of the buildup to the Games, the flags of all competing nations were suspended over streets in a display around the West End of London by the Regent Street Association (RSA). Included in this was the Flag of the Republic of China, the official name of Taiwan. Since 1981, the Republic of China (ROC) has not been permitted to compete at the Olympics under its own name, instead using the name \\"Chinese Taipei\\", together with the flag of the Chinese Taipei Olympic Committee, which is not Taiwan's national flag. In all official Olympic events and publications, the name and symbols of Chinese Taipei must be used. As the flag display was not connected to LOCOG, it was not subject to Olympic branding rules. However, officials from the People's Republic of China made a complaint to the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) about the display of the ROC flag, following which the FCO advised the RSA to replace the ROC flag with the Chinese Taipei Olympic flag. The removal of the national flag led to an official complaint from the Republic of China, with the Senior Representative, Shen Lyu-shun, writing to the RSA stating the view that \\"the nomenclature regarding Taiwan's participation in the Olympics shall not be applied to the display of the flags in the street\\", and that matters like this fall \\"within the scope of freedom of speech\\" and \\"shall not be subject to interference by a third party\\". Competitors' birthplaces in biographies A complaint by the Foreign Ministry of Ukraine was made about the biographies of Russian Olympic team members posted on the official London 2012 Games' website. The biographies referred to the athletes' Ukrainian birthplaces as being located in Russia. Thirty athletes that were identified as not being born in Russia had incorrect birthplace references. Georgia's Olympic Committee had also complained and asked for corrections to be made. Examples included wrestler Besik Kudukhov's birthplace in Tskhilon South Ossetia, Boxer David Ayrapetyan born in Baku the capital of Azerbaijan, and weightlifter Alexandr Ivanov from Rustavi in Georgia. Izabella Siemicks, a LOCOG spokesperson, claimed the original biographical information had been provided by the National Olympic Committees. LOCOG also apologised for an error in the official match programme for Great Britain's first game in the men's football tournament, mistakenly describing Welsh team member Joe Allen as being English. Female athletes from all NOCs After the 2008 Summer Olympics, Brunei, Qatar and Saudi Arabia were the only three NOCs that had never sent a female participant. They were put under pressure to include female athletes in their teams. All three NOCs sent female athletes to the 2012 Summer Olympics, with both Brunei and Qatar selecting female flag bearers at the Opening Ceremony. Saudi Arabia was the last NOC to select a female competitor. On 3 August 2012, the Bruneian athlete Maziah Mahusin took part in the Women's 400 metres heats and ensured that all current NOCs have had at least one female participant at the Olympics. Opening ceremony Munich memorial As they had done prior to every Olympic Games since 1976, the remaining widows of the 11 Israeli athletes murdered by Black September at the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich campaigned for the IOC to include a minute of silence during the Opening ceremony. The proposal was rejected by IOC President Jacques Rogge, who stated that his \\"hands were tied\\" by votes from 46 Arab and Muslim members admitted to the International Olympic Committee. =Logo= The design for the event logo was met with negative response. An advertisement featuring the logo being displayed in all of its colours was reported by Epilepsy Action to have caused many people to experience epileptic seizures. During the games =Tape delays= NBC, Nine Network, and Prime TV were criticised by their viewers for tape delaying the Olympics and making questionable editorial decisions and complicated viewing schemes. =Opening ceremony= Parade of Nations Gatecrasher An unknown woman gatecrashed in civilian attire and was seen walking at the head of the Indian Olympic team's march past during the Parade of Nations. Her presence attracted media attention throughout India and raised questions about security at the Olympic Games. The woman was subsequently identified as Madhura Nagendra, a graduate student from Bangalore living in London and a dancer in a segment of the opening ceremony. On 31 July 2012, LOCOG issued an apology to the Indian contingent over the incident. =Organisational issues= Empty seats Empty seats at Olympic events were reported during the first two days of the games. Although events were reported to be sold out, many empty seats were observed in highly visible areas at multiple venues. Sebastian Coe, the Head of LOCOG, stated in a press conference on 29 July that the seats were reserved for \\"the Olympic family and sponsors\\" and that the events were otherwise \\"stuffed to the gunwales\\". The empty seats were also from NOCs which had not used up the entire allocation and had not returned the unallocated tickets. Coe stated that LOCOG would investigate the claims of empty seats. The claim that the seats were allocated to sponsors led to denials from sponsors, with British Airways stating they had returned tickets it could not distribute, and McDonald's stating that all their tickets were being used. LOCOG was able to recover some \\"VIP\\" seats that would not be used and made them available for sale. On 31 July, for example, tickets to 3,800 reclaimed seats were put on sale to the public. Ticket distribution follows this system: 75% is sold to the general public, 12% goes to the National Committees of participating countries for sale in their countries, 8% is for sponsors, and 5% for the \\"Olympic family\\" (including the IOC and national Olympic organizations). It is hard to anticipate if tickets given to various sponsors and Olympic officials will actually be used, and it is also difficult to reenter them into circulation at the last minute. Non-public archery event On Friday, 27 July, the same day as the opening ceremony, but after the first sporting events outside London had started (in football), there was confusion and disappointment in some Olympic fans when they were denied access to what they thought was the first competition event in London. They had misunderstood the use by LOCOG of the phrase \\"non-ticketed\\" to mean that an archery qualification round at Lord's cricket ground was going to be open to the public for free, in a similar fashion to some other events like the road bike races or marathon. In addition, some had been sold fake tickets for the event by an illegal website. LOCOG stated \\"Tickets have not been advertised or sold by Locog for the archery ranking event...We have always made it clear that the preliminary rounds are not open for spectators. There are a number of unofficial websites claiming to sell tickets; we therefore advise people to be extremely cautious and vigilant when attempting to buy tickets and only purchase from an official source\\". Confusion of North Korea's and South Korea's flags During the women's football tournament on the first day, 25 July, the flag of the Republic of Korea (South Korea) was mistakenly displayed on the electronic display in Hampden Park instead of that of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (North Korea). The North Korean team walked off the pitch in protest at seeing the South Korean flag displayed by their names and refused to warm up whilst the flag was being displayed. The match between North Korea and Colombia was delayed by a little over an hour; the game then commenced after rectification of the error. LOCOG apologised for the error and said they would make efforts to ensure such a mishap did not recur; however, the organising committee's statement had to be reissued because it failed to use the nations' official titles (as used by the IOC) \\"Republic of Korea\\" and \\"Democratic People's Republic of Korea\\". =Competition issues= Men's cycling team sprint On 2 August, British cyclist Philip Hindes, during an interview in the mixed zone for media immediately after the race, said that he deliberately crashed in an earlier round because he did not like the start he had. Hindes reaffirmed what he said earlier in a BBC interview shortly after: \\"I just did it to get the restart. My first wasn’t the greatest so I thought to get the restart.\\" British team later responded by claiming that it was a misunderstanding and comments were lost in translation, citing English was not Hindes' first language. Hindes also retracted his original comments and said he just lost control and fell down. In Team Sprint, cyclists are allowed a restart if they crash or have a mechanical incident. The Union Cycliste Internationale said the result of the qualifying race \\"was not in question,\\" and the International Olympic Committee said it would not investigate. The French team, which came second, accepted the result, but also suggested team sprint regulation needs to be changed. Men's 66 kg judo judging On 29 July in a quarter final match in the 66 kg category, South Korean judoka Cho Jun-ho received a unanimous 3–0 judging decision that he had beaten Japanese Ebinuma Masashi. Almost immediately Marius Vizer, chief of the International Judo Federation, intervened and held a meeting with the match referee and two judges. Shortly afterwards the three officials returned to the mat and reversed their original decision by declaring Masashi the 0–3 winner. South Korean officials launched an unsuccessful appeal and the result was upheld. Women's badminton doubles matches A review of two matches in the Badminton Women's doubles competition played on 31 July was conducted after it appeared that, having already qualified for the knockout stages, players on both sides in each game had been attempting to lose their last group stage matches in order to gain a more favourable draw in the quarter finals. The matches were between China's Wang Xiaoli / Yu Yang and South Korea's Jung Kyung-eun / Kim Ha-na in Group A and South Korea's Ha Jung-eun / Kim Min-jung versus Indonesia's Meiliana Jauhari / Greysia Polii in Group C. After errors began occurring during routine shots in both matches, including shots going long and serves hitting the net, the crowd reacted badly, and the match between Yu Yang and Wang Xiaoli of China and Jung Kyung and Kim Ha Na of South Korea featured no rallies of more than four shots. In the second game, a tournament referee initially issued a black card to disqualify the players but, after the team's coaches argued, this was rescinded; play was allowed to continue while he monitored proceedings. Both the earlier match and this later match were ultimately played to a conclusion, completing the draw for the quarter finals (Group B and D having concluded earlier in the day). Technical delegate Paisan Rangsikitpho said after the Group A match, \\"If it's true what I hear, this is a shame and I don't like it. And I'm not going to accept anything that I don't like at all. It's not in a good spirit....I apologise to the public, I apologise for everyone and I am not happy.\\" On 1 August 2012, following the review, all eight players were ejected from the tournament by the Badminton World Federation, after being found guilty of \\"not using best efforts\\" and \\"conducting oneself in a manner that is clearly abusive or detrimental to the sport\\". Women's individual épée timing and appeal South Korean fencer Shin A-Lam was embroiled in a prolonged controversy at the ExCeL Centre on 30 July 2012. She had appeared to beat her opponent Britta Heidemann, but an issue developed around the timing clock: After Heidemann's last unsuccessful attempt to break the tie, the referee called a \\"halt\\" to stop the bout. However, seconds later and despite the bout having been stopped, the clock continued to count down to zero. Since an overtime minute has to be fenced in its entirety, the referee followed FIE rule t.32–3 and addressed this failure of the clock or error by the timekeeper by having the clock reset to one second, the clock's lowest possible setting. When the fencers resumed their positions, Heidemann scored the winning point. Shin was required to sit on the piste for almost an hour, often openly sobbing, while her coaches lodged an official complaint, prompting an announcer at the venue to confirm that moving from the piste would have been seen as indicating her acceptance of the ruling against her. After losing the protest, Shin fought, and lost, against Sun Yujie of China thirty minutes later in the bronze medal match. Shin was later offered a \\"special medal\\" by the International Fencing Federation but was not appeased by the prospect of the award, \\"it does not make me feel better. It's not an Olympic medal\\", she said. Korean Olympic Committee president Park Yung-Sung commented on the offer as saying \\"they know they are very sorry about her and they have to recognise her sporting spirit\\". After this incident, the rules were changed and it is now mandatory for the apparatus to show figures at the hundredths of the second starting from 10 seconds on the clock. Women's cycling team sprint China's Gong Jinjie and Guo Shuang twice set the world record, in qualifying and the first round, and finished first in the final in 32.619s. However, the team was later disqualified for an alleged \\"early relay\\" infringement and relegated to the silver medal, and the second place German team was promoted to gold. The Chinese team's coach Daniel Morelon complained that the judges refused to provide \\"video footage of the race in slow motion\\", and only provided a \\"vague explanation\\" for the infringement they had allegedly committed. He went on to proclaim that the Chinese team were \\"robbed\\" of a gold medal. Men's boxing officiating Referee Ishanguly Meretnyyazov was dismissed from the games after the men's 56 kg Round of 16 bout between Japan's Satoshi Shimizu and Azerbaijan's Magomed Abdulhamidov. During the third round of the fight, Abdulhamidov was knocked to the canvas six times. Meretnyyazov failed to issue a standing-eight count in any of the six instances. The judges awarded the win to Abdulhamidov; a decision that was later overturned by the AIBA. The AIBA indicated that the fight should have been stopped and awarded to Shimizu after three knockdowns. Before the London Olympics, Azerbaijan had faced controversy regarding a $9 million payment to WSB, and rumors surfaced that Azerbaijan had bribed AIBA for two gold medals during the London 2012 Olympics. German referee Frank Scharmach was suspended for five days after disqualifying Iran's Ali Mazaheri for excessive holding during his bout with Cuba's José Larduet. In another fight, Ukrainian world champion Evhen Khytrov was ruled to have lost to Britain's Anthony Ogogo after an 18–18 countback, despite two knockdowns. The National Olympic Committee of Ukraine protested the decision to AIBA. Canadian Custio Clayton lost to British boxer Freddie Evans in the Welterweight quarterfinals when Evans, who was awarded the fight on a countback, was cautioned three separate times for holding during the bout but was not penalised a point for the infraction as was required by the rules. Canada appealed the decision, but AIBA instead ruled that Evans was \\"incorrectly cautioned\\", and as a result did not deserve any point deductions. Men's 100 m breaststroke final Five days after setting a new world record in the 100 m breaststroke final en route to a gold medal, South African Cameron van der Burgh said that he had used illegal \\"dolphin kicks\\" while underwater after the start and turns. Van der Burgh claimed that he had to break the rule because it is done so commonly by many international breaststrokers, saying, \\"It's got to the point where if you're not doing it you are falling behind or giving yourself a disadvantage.\\" There have been complaints from other swimmers and swimming federations, with many calls for FINA to introduce underwater footage to help race officials, but no official protest has been launched against van der Burgh, who will keep his medal and record. Men's 800 m athletics heat During a preliminary heat of the 800 m event, Algerian runner Taoufik Makhloufi stopped running after only 200 m and walked off the track. It was suggested he deliberately stopped running in order to save himself for the 1500 m race the following day, where he was fancied as a medal winner, and that the Algerian officials had earlier failed in their attempts to withdraw him in time from the 800m contest. Makhloufi was dismissed from the Games by the IAAF, who accused him of not giving an honest effort, violating the Olympic ideal, but Algerian officials lodged an official protest, stating that Makhloufi withdrew from the race because of a knee injury. After being examined by doctors, Makhloufi was reinstated in time for the 1500 m final. He then won the gold medal in the 1500 m race. \\"Every person who wins a race forgets about his aches and pains\\" said Makhloufi. =Other= Athletes' behavioural issues Swiss footballer Michel Morganella was sent home by the Switzerland football team after he sent a tweet following their 2–1 loss against South Korea, saying that South Koreans 'can go burn' and referred to them as a 'bunch of mongoloids'. Gian Gilli, the director of Swiss Olympic Committee, said that the tweet \\"discriminated, insulted and violated the dignity of the South Korean football team and people\\". Australian swimmers Nick D'Arcy and Kenrick Monk were originally to be sent home once the swimming programme of the Games had concluded after posting a photo on Facebook showing them posing with guns that was deemed to bring the sport into disrepute. The Australian Olympic Committee subsequently gave the pair a reprieve allowing them to stay and join family and friends for a holiday in Europe. The two were however required to leave the Olympic Village and surrender their Olympic accreditation after the swimming program concluded. D'Arcy and Monk gave an undertaking not to engage in social media during the remainder of the Games as part of the deal. Monk had previously attracted controversy when he admitted to lying to police when he was questioned about the cause of an accident during a training session, while D'Arcy had been removed from the Australian team for the Beijing Olympics after being charged with assault. When discussing D'Arcy's upcoming event, journalist Steve Price commented \\"I don't care if he drowns\\".Price, Steve, 2012, The Project. First broadcast 30 July 2012. German rower Nadja Drygalla voluntarily left the Olympic village on 3 August after controversy arose over her relationship with a neo-Nazi far-right politician. Drygalla's boyfriend is reportedly a leading member of the \\"Rostock National Socialists\\", and has apparently fought a state election for the far-right National Democratic Party. Australian rower Josh Booth, who competed in the Men's eight event, was expelled from the Australian team after vandalising shops while drunk. Kittian sprinter Kim Collins – who carried the flag of St. Kitts and Nevis at the Opening Ceremony – was removed from the men's 100m sprint before the heats by the St. Kitts and Nevis Olympic Committee, reportedly after leaving the Athletes' Village without permission to spend a night in a hotel with his wife. The national Olympic committee responded, stating that Collins had repeatedly ignored attempts by officials to contact him, and did not register for his events as had been requested of him. Collins was sent home, his accreditation to access the Olympic Village having been cancelled. After South Korea defeated Japan in the Bronze Medal match at Millennium Stadium in Cardiff on 10 August, South Korean player Park Jong-Woo walked around the field holding a banner with a message written in Korean, \\"독도는 우리 땅!\\" (dokdo neun uri ttang lit. \\"Dokdo is our territory!). As both IOC and FIFA statutes prohibit any political statements being made by athletes at their respective sporting events, the IOC barred Park from the bronze medal ceremony and did not permit him to receive his medal. In addition, it asked FIFA to discipline Park, and stated that it may decide on further sanctions at a later date. FIFA failed to reach a conclusion on the case at a meeting at its Zurich headquarters held on 5 October, and the disciplinary committee discussed the case again on the following week, then failed to reach a verdict again. The case was heard again by the committee on 20 November, and FIFA decided on 3 December to suspend Park for two matches after he was considered to have breached the FIFA Disciplinary Code and the Regulations of the Olympic Football Tournaments. FIFA also imposed a warning on the Korea Football Association and reminded it of its obligation to properly instruct its players on all the pertinent rules and applicable regulations before the start of any competition, in order to avoid such incident in the future. The Korea Football Association was warned that should incidents of such nature occur again in the future, the FIFA Disciplinary Committee may impose harsher sanctions on the Korea Football Association. Seven Cameroonian athletes went missing while participating in the Olympics, including the reserve goalkeeper Drusille Ngako, swimmer Paul Ekane Edingue and boxers Thomas Essomba, Christian Donfack Adjoufack, Abdon Mewoli, Blaise Yepmou Mendouo and Serge Ambomo. Technology in track cycling Team GB Cycling introduced new bicycles for the London 2012 Olympics that subsequently outperformed Australia and France with margins greater than expected. In France the performance was greeted with suspicion and allegations of cheating, which were vehemently defended against by British Prime Minister, David Cameron. The former head of research and development of the British Cycling Team, Chris Boardman said that every single bicycle component was vetted and declared fit for use by the UCI, however, Joe Lindsey of Bicycling magazine stated that the spirit of equal footing had been broken. French world champion cyclist Grégory Baugé demanded that the British reveal their secret, but French omnium specialist Bryan Coquard supported the British, believing the secret is the best equipment being revealed at the last moment, also stating: \\"[T]he Australians didn't race cohesively...\\" When asked if the \\"high-tech warfare\\" between large national teams will put other countries at a disadvantage Chris Boardman replied, \\"Well, I'd like to think so, we haven't done our job if they're not.\\" The British team stress that performance is achieved through 'marginal gains', including training, and preparation. Home advantage was given as a possible reason for the British performance with omnium gold medalist Laura Trott stating: \\"I just got going and the crowd just drove me home.\\" See also *Concerns and controversies over the 2008 Summer Olympics *Concerns and controversies over the 2010 Winter Olympics *Concerns and controversies over the 2010 Commonwealth Games *Controversies at the 2012 Paralympic Games *Campaign for a Scottish Olympic Team References External links * London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games Official website 2012 Summer Olympics 2012 controversies *2012 Foreign relations of the United Kingdom ","title":"Concerns and controversies at the 2012 Summer Olympics"},{"id":"36544876","text":"Darband-e Olya () may refer to: * Darband-e Olya, Dargaz * Darband-e Olya, Sarakhs ","title":"Darband-e Olya"},{"id":"36544897","text":"Darband-e Sofla () may refer to: * Darband-e Sofla, Dargaz * Darband-e Sofla, Sarakhs ","title":"Darband-e Sofla"},{"id":"36544910","text":"Darband-e Olya (, also Romanized as Darband-e ‘Olyā; also known as Ma‘dan-e Āqdarband and Aq Darband) is a village in Marzdaran Rural District, Marzdaran District, Sarakhs County, Razavi Khorasan Province, Iran.

The film is produced and directed by Salim Khassa. The story captures the full range of immigrant struggles, beginning in New York City in the 1970s and punctuated by true human emotion and family conflict. The protagonist of Desperate Endeavors, \\"Ram Patel\\" encounters more obstacles than he can count, and ultimately finds a remedy to his numerous problems by encountering a spiritual adviser, legendary 'Dada Bhagwan' played by Bollywood star Gulshan Grover. Also stars Michael Madsen, Robert Clohessy, Ismail Bashey & Samrat Chakrabarti. In 2011 the film was screened at the Tribeca Film Festival, NYCIFF, and WorldFest-Houston International Film Festival. Rated PG 13, and had its theatrical release on 7 September 2012. Synopsis A 1970s New York City setting finds Indian-born immigrant Ram Patel trying to establish himself in the turbulent city-life where he encounters various hurdles that prevent him from obtaining his goals of becoming successful and wealthy. The pursuit of the American dream becomes littered with pot-holes for the earnest protagonist Ram Patel. Arriving from the airport to stay with a family friend, he finds himself instantly disliked by an African-American landlord (Floyd) that attempts to make Ram miserable. Pounding the pavement for a job, Ram is taken-on by a CPA firm run by a strict, former military crew-cut martinet who hires other Indian men like Ram to do countless hours of accounting grunt-work in a hot-box dingy office. With no money to save, he begins to borrow heavily and digs himself into insurmountable debt. In the midst of this self- inducedmisery, he sends for his wife and daughter from India and continues his “façade” of a successful appearance to his newly arrived wife by going into even further debt on more newly printed credit cards and “latched-onto” friends. These friends and co-workers begin to get irritated by his lack of commitment to payback, and this leads the protagonist being pressed into self- doubt and constant searching for both “a way out” and purposeful meaning in his life. Proclaiming to push ahead through his frustration and predicament is based more on stubbornness than enlightenment, where a “donʼt quit“ mind-set becomes “fuel- to-the-fire” for his out-of-control situation. Ram has his car stolen, and he becomes enslaved to his increasing debt status, which makes his wife question his responsibility as a husband, father and a man. RAMʼs wife RANI becomes pregnant again, and he must reluctantly send her back to India to deliver their new child due to a lack of medical insurance in the USA. Rani protests, but Ram mentions “financial suicide” as to their status, and Rani goes back to India for the birth of their second daughter. Into the life of Ram Patel comes an eccentric array of characters who swirl his life into confusion. A colleagueʼs mother offers her connection to a spiritual Holy-man known as “DADA BHAGWAN,” whose followers revere him as mentor and benevolent wise master, professing the release of ego for enlightenment. Ram passes up this spiritual growth opportunity, instead trying to make his way on a fortune-seeking venture in a new business with a puffed-up, egotistical entrepreneur named “ADESH.” Ram continues “spinning-his-wheels” and finally tries an introductory session with the eminent Dada Bhagwan. Confronting himself is an intensely difficult proposition, but awareness comes suddenly like lightning and Ram turns over a “new leaf” as the situation begins to eventually swing in Ram Patelʼs favor. This compelling story addresses the overall-immigrant experience of the mid–tolate 20th Century, where “culture- clash” and “making it in America” are the pillars under which many lives are built, or crushed by. The filmʼs ultimate message and Ram Patelʼs plight and subsequent transformation by Dada Bhagwan become the hook whereby any individual can absorb the bracing impact of undeniable fate that results in a firmly entrenched “never-give-up” attitude.

The Western academic divisions of science, technology and medicine have been united in the Encyclopaedia because in ancient cultures these disciplines were connected. The first edition (1997) has 600 articles by a range of experts. The arrangement is alphabetical from \\"Abacus\\" to \\"Zu Chongzi\\". It includes an index from page 1079 to page 1117. K. V.

Fabrizio Pregadio contributed 10 articles, Julio Samo wrote 9, and Richard Bertschinger, Radha Charan Gupta and David A. King wrote 8 each. Dozens of other contributors wrote fewer articles.

The book was first published on February 28, 2012 through HarperTeen and follows the series' protagonist as she explores the Wilds outside the walled community she was raised in. The book was preceded by a novella entitled Hana and was succeeded by Requiem, the final book in the series. Plot The book follows up the events of Delirium. Lena is now in the Wilds alone, and the sequel begins by switching the chapters from the present \\"now\\" and the past \\"then\\" point of view of Lena until they are joined together in Chapter 13. Unfortunately for her, the Wilds are less wonderful than she thought. She becomes very weak and is found nearly dead by a group of people. She is helped her back to health by the group, which takes place as her new family. She is now free of the \\"cure,\\" but she and her acquaintances decide that they must do the same for everyone else and restore society to its former state. That is easier said than done, as Lena and her group have much standing in their way. The book also follows Lena in her life while she lives in New York City with two other characters from the Wilds: Raven and Tack. She is part of the DFA, the Deliria Free America, and during one of its rallies, she is kidnapped by other Invalids, called Scavengers, and held in captive with Julian Fineman, the leader of the youth division of the DFA. Julian is unable to receive the procedure because he has a brain tumor. With the memory of Alex's sacrifice in mind, she navigates her way out of the place with Julian. Lena slowly begins to fall in love with Julian as he begins to tell more about his abusive father, his real thoughts kn the disease, and why he really joined the DFA.

Professionals who work in the field use adaptive equipment and modified vehicles to help people attain independent community mobility. History Many driver rehabilitation programs began in the early 1970s through the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). The VA only offers driver rehabilitation services and funding to its veterans who seek transportation options. , the VA offers driver rehabilitation services in 43 cities. The field has since expanded beyond the VA to serve clients of all legal driving ages. The Association for Driver Rehabilitation Specialists (ADED) was founded in 1977 to support and advance the driver rehabilitation professionals working in the field of driver education, driver training and transportation equipment modifications for persons with disabilities and persons experiencing the aging process.. Thirty people, from ten states, attended ADED's first official meeting. The initial meeting determined the type of organizational structure, the official name, initial officers, standing committees, and membership fees. Today, ADED is the primary professional organization in the specialized area of driver rehabilitation. ADED has continued to expand. Emphasis is placed on the yearly conference with its pre-conference workshops, conference training programs and one of the largest exhibits of products for both the driver with a disability as well as for the professional working in this field. Membership also continues to increase with representation from nearly every state as well as internationally The National Mobility Equipment Dealers Association was founded in 1989 to broaden the opportunities for people with disabilities to drive or be transported in vehicles modified with adaptive equipment. In 2003, the American Occupational Therapy Association developed the Older Driver Initiative to develop services for older drivers. Practice The goal of driver rehabilitation is to aid individuals with disabilities or age-related impairments maintain independent driving and transportation. This maybe done through the use of specialized mobility equipment and training. The process begins with a clinical assessment of an individual's visual, visual- perceptual, cognitive, and physical skills that are necessary for driving. If the individual meets the criteria, an on-road assessment is conducted, in which the evaluator uses a vehicle equipped with adaptive driving equipment, as well as auxiliary brake and mirror on the passenger's side of the vehicle. Accommodations can be made via the use of mechanical or electronic steering, and acceleration and braking equipment, which are based on the results of the clinical assessment. If it is determined that the person has the potential to drive, training is offered to develop proficiency in using the mobility equipment. For novice drivers, driver's education is included in the services. Following training, a vehicle equipment prescription is provided, with a referral to a mobility equipment dealer for equipment installation. When the installation is completed, the vehicle is checked for proper fit, with additional training provided as needed. In other instances, such as after an illness or injury, an assessment of the person's capacity for driving is required. No adaptive driving equipment may be needed; the focus is on identifying any changes in the person's sensory, motor, visual, perceptual, or cognitive ability. The clinical assessment is conducted first, followed by the on-road assessment, using a vehicle equipped with the passenger brake, mirror, and in some instances, an auxiliary steering wheel. If an individual does not possess the ability to drive, they are often referred to other therapy programs, such as wheelchair seating programs, occupational therapy, vision therapy, physical therapy, or cognitive therapy. For individuals who plan to be passengers only, driver rehabilitation evaluations are recommended to determine the person's ability to get in and out of the vehicle, the vehicle's appropriateness for safe transportation, and the safe transportation of mobility aids, e.g. scooters, manual or power wheelchairs, including proper securement of the mobility device. Recommendations for vehicle modifications may include the use of a wheelchair accessible van, wheelchair lift, or wheelchair ramp. Personnel A driver rehabilitation specialist is a specialist who \\"plans, develops, coordinates and implements driving services for individuals with disabilities\\". Driver rehabilitation specialists work with physicians, allied health personnel, Department of Motor Vehicles personnel, and mobility equipment dealers. Driver rehabilitation programs are offered in a variety of settings, such as rehabilitation hospitals, hospital outpatient therapy departments, veteran's hospitals, or as private driving schools. Professionals who work in this field are often members of ADED; where professional fields consist of: *Drivers education/training *Equipment manufacturers *Equipment dealers *Physiotherapy/Physical therapy *Kinesiotherapist *Occupational therapy *Speech-language pathology *Rehabilitation engineering *Rehabilitation specialists *Rehabilitation technology *Vocational rehabilitation Education and training Occupational therapists and driver educators comprise the two largest groups of professionals, with other professionals from the fields of rehabilitation counseling, physical therapy, rehabilitation engineering, and psychology. Occupational therapists may utilize the term \\"driving rehabilitation\\" to reflect the profession's focus on the \\"occupation\\" of driving. Many driver rehabilitation specialists obtain specialty certification from ADED. CDRS® Certified Driver Rehabilitation Specialist) is a credential offered by ADED: Representing advanced experience and expertise in diverse areas within the field. A CDRS® is an experienced practitioner in the field of driver rehabilitation who, through successful completion of a formal certification examination, has proven their capacity to provide services within the full spectrum of driver rehabilitation services. The CDRS® is considered by ADED to be the gold-standard in terms of driver rehabilitation service provision. A CDRS® is obligated to follow ADED’s Best Practice Guidelines to keep driver evaluations standardized, formalized and objective, and attests they will adhere to the ADED’s Code of Ethics. The CDRS® credential requires 30-hours of continuing education per 3-year cycle and is renewed via application and subject to audit.https://www.aded.net/page/230 References External links http://www.aded.net/ Driver's education ","title":"Driver rehabilitation"},{"id":"36545044","text":"Abū al-Makārim Hibat Allāh ibn Zayn al-Dīn ibn Jumay (هبة الله بن جميع, died 1198 / AH 594) was an Egyptian Jewish physician, chief physician at the court of Saladin.Other name forms: Abu-'l-Makārim Hibatallāh Ibn-Gumaiʻ; Ibn Jumi‘; Ibn Gumay‘ Life Ibn Jumay‘ was born to a Jewish family in Fustat, Egypt.

He was a specialist steeplechaser who ran thirty-two times and won sixteen races under National Hunt rules. After showing promise as a hurdler and novice chaser, Imperial Call emerged as a top-class jumper with a win in the Hennessy Gold Cup in February 1996. A month later, he became the first Irish-trained horse for ten years to win Britain's most prestigious steeplechase, the Cheltenham Gold Cup. His subsequent career was disrupted by injury problems but he won further major races including the Punchestown Chase in 1998 and the Punchestown Gold Cup in 1999. Unlike most modern racehorses, Imperial Call was not a Thoroughbred. Background Imperial Call was a \\"leggy, sparely made\\" brown horse bred in County Wexford, Ireland by T. A. O'Donnell. He was sired by the successful National Hunt stallion Callernish out of the mare Princess Menelek. As Princess Menelek's great-grandmother Friend Galee was of unknown parentage, neither she nor any of her offspring were Thoroughbreds. As a three-year-old gelding, Imperial Call was consigned by the Redpender Stud to the Tattersalls sales in June 1992, where he was sold for a cash bid of 6,000 guineas. A year later, Imperial Call was sold by the bloodstock dealer Tom Costello to Lisselan Farms Ltd and was sent into training with Fergie Sutherland at his stables at Killinaridish, County Cork. Sutherland was a sixty-year-old Scot who had lost a leg in the Korean War. He had trained winners at Royal Ascot in the 1950s before moving to his family estate in Ireland to train jumpers. Imperial Call was ridden in most of his early races by Gerry O'Neill. Racing career =1993-1995: early career= Imperial Call began his racing career as a four-year-old in 1993. After finishing seventh on his debut, he recorded his first win by taking a Novice Hurdle race at Limerick by fifteen lengths. After the summer break, Imperial Call competed against experienced hurdlers in the 1993/1994 season. He ran five times, winning races at Limerick, Gowran Park, and Leopardstown Racecourse. In January, he finished second by a short head in a handicap race at Naas Racecourse in which he carried ten pounds more than the winner, Dorans Pride. In the 1994/1995 season, Imperial Call tackled larger obstacles as he competed in steeplechases. He won three more races, including the Grade III Nas Na Riogh Novice Chase at Naas. Sutherland chose not to send Imperial Call to the 1995 Cheltenham Festival as he felt that the horse needed more time to develop. On his final appearance of the year, he contested the Grade I Power Gold Cup at Fairyhouse Racecourse. Racing against some of the leading Irish novice chasers, he finished third of the nine runners behind Strong Platinum and Sound Man. =1995-1997: Gold Cup years= Imperial Call began the 1995/1996 at Clonmel in November. He took the lead two fences from the finish of the Grade III Morris Oil Chase and drew clear of the opposition to win easily. His challenge for the Grade I Punchestown Chase later in the month was short-lived as he fell at the first fence. In January, carrying 156 pounds, he won a handicap at Leopardstown, beating Strong Platinum, who was carrying twelve pounds more. Imperial Call's third attempt at Grade I level came in the Hennessy Cognac Gold Cup in February, a race for which the British-trained Cheltenham Gold Cup winner Master Oats was made favourite. Ridden for the first time by Conor O'Dwyer, Imperial Call led from the start and recovered from a bad mistake at the last fence to win by six lengths from the British champion. At Cheltenham Racecourse on 14 March, Imperial Call started 9/2 second favourite for the Gold Cup in a field of ten runners. The Northern- trained grey One Man was made 11/8 favourite despite concerns that he would be ineffective over the distance of three and a quarter miles. O'Dwyer restrained the Irish gelding in the early stages before moving up to join the leaders on the second circuit. He took the lead four fences from the finish and turned into the straight with One Man challenging on the outside. The grey soon weakened and dropped away as Imperial Call stayed on strongly to win by four lengths from the future Grand National winner Rough Quest. Couldn't Be Better was nineteen lengths further back in third, whilst One Man finish a tired sixth. The win was the first for an Irish horse since Dawn Run in 1986 and provoked scenes of wild celebration, with the crowd waving flags and singing the Cork anthem The Banks Of My Own Lovely Lee. O'Dwyer waved an Irish Tricolour as he rode the horse to the winner's enclosure where he was tossed into the air by wellwishers. When asked for his comments, Sutherland at first struggled for words but then said: \\"He put them in their place didn't he. I've thought this horse could win a Gold Cup since he was five and he has improved every day this year.\\" The 1996/1997 season proved a major disappointment for Imperial Call's supporters. On his seasonal debut, he fell at the last fence of the Punchestown Chase in December, although he was not hurt and was remounted to finish a remote fourth to Royal Mountbrowne. In February, he was beaten more than twenty lengths when third to Danoli in the Hennessy Gold Cup. He was made 4/1 favourite for the Cheltenham Gold Cup after reportedly delighting Sutherland in a training gallop at Tralee. He was never in contention, made a bad mistake at the eighteenth fence, and was tailed off when O'Dwyer pulled him up before the next obstacle. =1997-1999: later career= The early part of the 1997/1998 season saw improved form from Imperial Call. After finishing second in his first two races, he easily defeated Merry Gale in the Ericsson Chase at Leopardstown in December to record his first win in 21 months. According to The Independent, the gelding jumped impeccably and was strongly fancied for a repeat win at Cheltenham in March. His season ended in February, however, when he was virtually pulled up and finished lame behind Dorans Pride in the Hennessy Gold Cup. Fergus Sutherland retired in 1998, and the training of Imperial Call was taken over by the twenty-three-year-old Raymond Hurley. Shortly afterwards, it was reported that Imperial Call would be auctioned at Doncaster in July, but he was subsequently withdrawn from the sale. On October 18, Imperial Call returned in the Munster National Handicap Chase. He carried top weight of 168 pounds and won easily despite conceding at least twenty-six pounds to his opponents. He was beaten when odds-on favourite for the Cork Grand National, but then defeated the leading racemare Opera Hat (winner of the Melling Chase) at Naas, winning by fifteen lengths. In December, he won the Punchestown Chase at his third attempt, leading from the start and jumping \\"quickly and accurately\\" to beat Dorans Pride for the first time in four meetings. At the end of the year, he was sent to England to contest the King George VI Chase at Kempton Park, but after disputing the lead for much of the way he tired badly in the closing stages and finished a distant third of four finishers behind Teeton Mill and Escartefigue. Imperial Call missed the Cheltenham Festival but returned in April for the inaugural running of the Punchestown Gold Cup. Ridden by Ruby Walsh, he started at odds of 8/1 in a five horse field against Florida Pearl, Dorans Pride, Opera Hat and Escartefigue. Imperial Call led from the start and recorded his biggest win in three years as he finished fourteen lengths clear of Florida Pearl. The Irish Independent described Imperial Call's victory as a \\"majestic display\\". whilst the Racing Post reported that the winner was given a rapturous reception form the large crowd after one of the best ever performances. On his first start of the 1999/2000 season, Imperial Call started favourite for the Powers Gold Label Champion Chase at Gowran Park in October. He was never travelling well and finished the race lame in his right foreleg. He remained in training until 2001 but never recovered fitness and did not race again. Retirement Imperial Call spent his retirement in West Cork and was reportedly still living there in 2009. He died at the age of twenty-five in late November 2014. Assessment and honours In their book A Century of Champions, based on the Timeform rating system, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Imperial Call a \\"superior\\" Gold Cup winner and the twenty-fourth best steeplechaser of the 20th century. On the horse's death in 2014, O'Dwyer said \\"His strengths were he had no weakness. He jumped, travelled, had speed and had guts to burn. He was very straightforward mentally and you could make the running or hold him up. There was no hole in him, only he might not have been the most sound and Fergie did a great job with him\\". The Imperial Call Chase is run at Cork Racecourse in honour of the local champion.

The school opened in 1882 as the city's first black school, during the era of formal racial segregation in the United States. Though the high school closed in 1973, the building reopened as an elementary school in 1998. After undergoing extensive remodeling and expansion, it is now the home of the I.M. Terrell Academy for STEM and VPA.  History  In 1882, Isaiah Milligan Terrell (1859–1931) became the head of East Ninth Street Colored School, the first free public school for African Americans in Fort Worth. Terrell became Principal and Superintendent of Colored Schools in 1890. In 1906, the school moved to a location at East Twelfth and Steadman Streets, and was renamed North Side Colored School No. 11. A new school building opened in 1910, with Terrell as principal. In 1915, Terrell left the school to become an administrator at Prairie View State Normal and Industrial College (now Prairie View A&M; University). The school was renamed I.M Terrell High School in 1921, in honor of the former principal. Due to lack of funding, during its early years, the school lacked a gymnasium, cafeteria, and library. The building also had a limited number of rooms for teaching and the textbooks were handed down from nearby white schools. Eventually, the school's first library would be started by Lillian B. Jones Horace, a teacher and librarian who encouraged parents and students to donate books. In 1938, the school moved to an existing structure (a former white elementary school) at 1411 East Eighteenth Street in the Baptist Hill neighborhood. The building was expanded as part of a Works Progress Administration project. The school's former location became an elementary and junior high school. In 1940, the Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools for Negroes (ACSSN) selected I.M. Terrell High School to participate as an experimental site in the Secondary School Study (also known as the Black High School Study). The study, funded by the General Education Board, sought to include African American teachers in the development of progressive education. According to the study, by the 1940s the school had 26 faculty members serving 900 students in grades 9 through 11. In addition to serving students in Fort Worth, the school drew students from areas outside the city, including Arlington, Bedford, Benbrook, Burleson, Roanoke, and Weatherford, where African American children could not attend school. I.M. Terrell High School closed in 1973 during racial integration of Fort Worth's schools. The building reopened in 1998 as I.M. Terrell Elementary School. In 2004, the portion of East Eighteenth Street around the school was renamed I.M. Terrell Circle South. In 2018, the former elementary school was reopened as the I.M. Terrell Academy for STEM and VPA after a $41 million restoration and construction project.  Music program  G.A. Baxter was the school's music instructor during the mid-twentieth century, when several students who would later become prominent jazz and rhythm and blues musicians attended the school. Various accounts portray Baxter as encouraging his students \\"to push the boundaries of sound,\\" or as \\"a stern band director who hated jazz.\\" Free jazz innovator Ornette Coleman was in the school band until he was dismissed for improvising during \\"The Washington Post.\\" Fellow musicians John Carter, King Curtis, Prince Lasha, Charles Moffett, and Dewey Redman all attended I.M. Terrell with Coleman. Julius Hemphill, Ronald Shannon Jackson, Cornell Dupree, Billy Tom Robinson, Thomas Reese and Ray Sharpe also graduated from I.M. Terrell. In a 1981 Musician interview, Ronald Shannon Jackson recalls:  Athletic program  From 1951 until 1966, I.M. Terrell High School was part of the Prairie View Interscholastic League, which reintegrated with the University Interscholastic League in 1970. Robert Hughes, who became the United States' winningest high school basketball coach in 2003, coached the basketball team at Terrell from 1958 until the high school's closure.

Biography He was the son of Henry Hamilton Schieffelin and Maria Teresa (Bradhurst) Schieffelin, and was educated in New York City. He entered the wholesale drug manufacturing concern founded by his grandfather Jacob Schieffelin in 1794. In 1846, he became known as an advocate for equal suffrage for all males in New York. In 1860, he introduced petroleum commercially. During the American Civil War, he organized a committee of prominent citizens for consultation with and support of President Lincoln. In the financial troubles succeeding the war, he was active in charities: he fed and sheltered thousands of destitute people at his own expense. He organized the Bread and Shelter Society for sending destitute persons from cities to rural districts for their self-support. With Charles O'Conor and Horace Greeley, he formulated a petition introduced into the United States Congress by Roscoe Conkling for the prevention of the appropriation for the use of religious corporations of public moneys or property. He was affiliated with the People's Party, whose platform he helped to draft. He believed that no republic can exist where wealth is allowed to accumulate in the hands of a small minority, and favored a law limiting inheritance. In 1883 he was nominated by his party for state senator from the 10th district of New York City, but failed to be elected. He died at his home, and was buried in the Moravian Cemetery in New Dorp, Staten Island, New York. He was survived by his wife, Lucy Dodge Schieffelin, originally of Montpelier, Vermont.

Following his graduation in 1909 from Hanover College with an A.B. degree, and from the University of Indiana in 1911 with an A.M. degree, he was commissioned from civilian life as a Second Lieutenant, Coast Artillery Corps on 13 April 1912. He served with the 6th Company, Coast Artillery Corps from 10 December 1912, until his detail in 1914 in the Aviation Section, Signal Corps. Upon completion of his flying training at the Signal Corps Aviation School at San Diego, California, he was rated a Junior Military Aviator on 2 July 1915, which automatically advanced him to the rank of First Lieutenant. He was promoted to Captain on 15 May 1917; to Major 1 July 1920; to Lieutenant Colonel 1 August 1935; and to Colonel on 26 August 1936. =Death= Colonel MacDill died as the result of an airplane crash on the morning of 9 November 1938, in Washington D.C. The accident occurred several minutes after his take off from Bolling Field in a BC-1 aircraft. Accounts pieced together from numerous eyewitnesses indicated that something went wrong with the motor. Colonel MacDill first tried to get back to Bolling Field, and then with death staring him in the face, aimed his plane for a narrow space between two houses. The descending plane cut down telephone and power wires, knocked down a pole, clipped off tree limbs, plunged to the ground and burst into flames. Colonel MacDill and his passenger Private Joseph G. Gloxner were killed instantly. References * MacDill AFB biography * United States Army biography 1898 births 1938 deaths Accidental deaths in Washington, D.C.

The road begins in Soddy-Daisy and ends north of Byrdstown in the community of Static, at the Tennessee/Kentucky state line. The length is . Route description The highway begins at an interchange with U.S. Route 27/SR 29 (US 27/SR 29) in Soddy-Daisy. SR 111 travels generally northwest as a controlled access highway before it crosses into Sequatchie County. The controlled-access sections of SR 111 are unusual, as they contain 70 mph speed limits, which are generally reserved for Interstate highways. It then proceeds over Walden Ridge and into the Sequatchie Valley, where it comes to an interchange with US 127 and starts a concurrency with SR 8 in Dunlap, where the freeway ends. The concurrency goes up the Cumberland Plateau, continuing as a 4-lane road, albeit without a dividing median or wide shoulders, and into the northern part of the county where it narrows to an improved 2-lane road and SR 8 splits off and continues to McMinnville. SR 111 turns north at this point and crosses into Van Buren County. Beyond this point, the entire road until passing Livingston is either a four-lane divided highway or a five-lane road with a continuous center turn lane, in both cases with wide, paved shoulders. SR 111 approaching the Cumberland Plateau, near Spencer In Van Buren County, the highway travels through the small town of Spencer, passing just west of Fall Creek Falls State Park, and continues into White County at the Caney Fork River. In this area SR 111 runs a brief concurrency with SR 285\\\\. The highway then proceeds north as Harold \\"Mose\\" Sims Memorial Highway and joins the concurrency of US 70S/SR 1\\\\. The concurrency continues to the west side of Sparta, at which point the highways split up and SR 111 becomes controlled access again, continuing north into Putnam County. Entering Putnam County by crossing the Falling Water River, the highway runs a brief concurrency with SR 136 before continuing north and passing through eastern Cookeville, once again losing its status as a controlled-access highway. Here it intersects Interstate 40 (I-40) and US 70N as it turns north-northeastward and into the town of Algood. After passing Algood, SR 111 turns northeastward and enters Overton County. In Overton County, SR 111 becomes Cookeville Highway and then Veterans Memorial Parkway as it approaches Livingston. It becomes a bypass around the northwest of town, known as Bradford Hicks Drive, before exiting Livingston as an improved two-lane highway and continuing northeast as Byrdstown Highway. It crosses into Pickett County and becomes Livingston Highway. Then, it crosses the Obey River, impounded as Dale Hollow Lake, and enters Byrdstown. After bypassing the center of Byrdstown, the highway continues northeastward as Robert H. Roberts Memorial Highway before ending at US 127/SR 28 in Static, just yards from the state line. From this intersection, US 127 runs northwestward to Albany, Kentucky, and southeastward toward Jamestown, Tennessee, while Kentucky Route 1076 continues northeastward to KY 696, which crosses Poplar Mountain in the direction of Monticello, Kentucky. If not for the mountain, this would be the straightest route along the western edge of the Cumberland Plateau from Byrdstown to Monticello. It has been suggested that TN 111 and parts of US 127, KY 90, US 27, KY 914, KY 80 and KY 461 be renumbered US 111 (a route that no longer exists) to create a clearly numbered route along the scenic western edge of the plateau, connecting Interstates 75, 40 and 24.http://www.mapquest.com/?le=t&saddr;=&flv;=1&vs;=directions History SR 111 existed by 1938, but only as a short portion of the current SR 111 route between the town of Spencer in Van Buren County and Doyle in White County and maintained this alignment at least through 1951. By 1963, it had been extended south from Spencer to the Tennessee State Route 8 junction in Sequatchie County north of Cagle. Between 1975 and 1978, SR 111 was extended north to Cookeville replacing SR 42 in that section. Between 1987 and 1989 the highway was extended northward over the remainder of the path of SR 42 to Static. Between 1988 and 1994, the section between SR 8 in Dunlap and US 27 between Soddy-Daisy and Bakewell was built. This extension was four lanes on the downgrades of Walden Ridge, and two lanes elsewhere, with the intent of eventually expanding the entirety to four lanes. February 25, 1999 The section opened to traffic on December 13, 1994, and cost $96 million.This was expanded to a four lane controlled-access highway between 2000 and 2004, which included replacing the four-way intersection with US 127 with an overpass and interchange.

The young Count of Munkkiniemi, Mauritz Armborg, and Katariina, the daughter of a farmhand on the estate of the Count's family, are attracted to each other. However, the count's grandmother, Yvonne Armborg, objects to the romance and tries to obstruct it. Elias Jahnukainen, a fisherman, is himself in love with Katariina and wants to marry her, but she has demurred at his marriage proposals to date. Count Mauritz dreams of making a career as a violinist and wants to study music abroad. To try to divert Katariina away from her grandson, Countess Yvonne offers to finance Katariina's dowry if she is willing to marry Elias. In addition, Countess Yvonne introduces the young count to Ingeborg Liliecrona. However, Mauritz is not attracted to Ingeborg. Mauritz and Katariina plan to elope, and make their way to Copenhagen and Rome. The lovers meet at an inn, and spend the evening together. At dawn, Mauritz leaves Katariina an old family heirloom, a necklace. However, a servant to Yvonne informs her of the lovers' plans. The lovers are intercepted before they can travel together to Copenhagen. Katariina is escorted back, apart from Mauritz. Unhappy at being separated from Mauritz, she tries to commit suicide by jumping off a cliff, but Elias saves her. She then accedes to a marriage with Elias. Separately, Mauritz has continued his journey to Copenhagen, where he is confined for several weeks because of a severe illness. Ingeborg travels to Copenhagen, meets Mauritz, and falsely tells him that Katariina will arrive in Rome in the company of Countess Yvonne. However, upon their arrival in Rome, Mauritz meets Countess Yvonne, who has traveled alone. She tells him that Katariina has married Elias, which leaves Mauritz distraught. Katariina and Elias have moved into the lower-income Katajanokan district. She has given birth to a son, whom she names Mauritz. Even though the Count is the biological father, Elias promises to treat the son as his own. Seven years pass. Mauritz and Ingeborg have married, but Mauritz is unhappy because he is still in love with Katariina. At the end of the 1860s, Finland is enduring famine, and plague. Katariina writes a letter of intent to gain admission for her son into a good school, but her application fails, because Elias is of too low a social station. One day, young Mauritz disappears. Katariina finds him at the house of the governor's wife, Elisabeth Gerhard, whose own son has died. Elisabeth offers to take care of young Mauritz. Katariina objects, but changes her mind after the death of her husband Elias from the plague. Katariina leaves young Mauritz in the care of Elisabeth, and also leaves the necklace with him. Elisabeth and young Mauritz travel to Rome, where young Mauritz meets Count Mauritz. He sees the necklace with young Mauritz, and realises that he is Katariina's son, and thus his own son. The marriage between Count Mauritz and Ingeborg finally collapses, as the Count has requested permission to travel to Finland with young Mauritz. Ingeborg agrees to a divorce. Count Mauritz and young Mauritz return to Munkkiniemi to a solemn welcome. Count Mauritz plans to apologise to Countess Yvonne, who in her turn has since repented of her scheme to keep Count Mauritz and Katariina apart. When Countess Yvonne meets young Mauritz, she immediately feels great affection for him. Upon seeing the necklace in his possession, she realises that the child is her kin. In the meantime, Katariina has also learned of her son's return to Finland. One day, Count Mauritz is walking in a park where he and Katariina spent past days of their time together. He begins to sing the 'Romance', a song that they both loved. Unbeknownst to him, Katariina is in the same park, and hears the song. The couple finally reunite, as Count Mauritz asks Katariina to come home with him, to 'our home'.

Originally established as a mission procure following World War I, over time the size of the community drastically decreased. In 2002, monks from Waegwan Abbey, South Korea, took charge of the monastery (Newton II). On January 25, 2004, Newton II was elevated to the status of a simple priory. The community's superior is Fr Prior Samuel Kim. History =Early Years of Expansion= The effects that World War I had on the Missionary Benedictines' missions in Asia and Africa contributed to the founding of houses outside of Germany. Monasteries in a variety of areas would ensure that the Ottilien Congregation had a greater chance of continuing its work in spite of political and economic crises. Thus, by 1924, the Missionary Benedictines had begun foundations in Argentina, the Philippines, Switzerland, the United States, and Venezuela. Fr Michael Heinlein, OSB, having been expelled by the British from what had been the colony of German East Africa, was entrusted with establishing a monastery in the United States. Heinlein was encouraged by Bishop Thomas Spreiter of Zululand, who happened to be in the United States raising funds for his diocese. Spreiter was confident that the United States could contribute both money and manpower to the Missionary Benedictine cause. Eventually, the two purchased a farm near Newton, New Jersey, approximately 100 km northwest of New York. In 1924, a number of German Missionary Benedictines joined Heinlein at \\"Little Flower Mission Procure\\", dedicated to the recently beatified Therese of Lisieux. Despite initial setbacks, which included financial difficulties and opposition from the Ku Klux Klan, the monastery quickly grew. By 1932, a minor seminary with 15 students was operating. The community also kept busy spreading mission awareness in surrounding parishes, as well as fostering devotion to Therese of Lisieux. While some monks raised funds for the Congregation's missions, others looked after a garden, a 180 hectare farm, and a number of workshops. With the change in Germany's political atmosphere, it became important for the monastery not only to procure funds, but also to cultivate local vocations. Thus, in 1936, Archabbot Chrysostomus Schmid elevated the procure to the status of a conventual priory. By 1940, the priory included one local priest, 13 local clerics, and six novices, many of them from the seminary. Ten years after it became a priory, Newton began sending local vocations to the missions. On June 9, 1947, Newton was elevated to an abbey, and placed under the patronage of Paul the Apostle. Significantly, an American, Fr Charles Coriston, was chosen as the first Abbot of Newton. At this time, the community included 21 priests (12 of them Americans), three American clerics, and 14 brothers (all expatriate Germans). The community expanded so quickly that the seminary students were forced into temporary housing, as the monks occupied the seminary facilities. In 1961, construction began on a new monastery that would suffice to house approximately fifty monks. =Post-Conciliar Decline= What had been a period of spectacular growth came to a halt following the Second Vatican Council. The following demonstrates the clear drop-off in vocations: * 1960: 48 monks * 1970: 33 monks * 1980: 24 monks * 1990: 17 monks Such a crisis resulted in the closure of the seminary, as well as a decrease in the number of monks assigned to the mission. Closure of the monastery seemed inevitable, but the community was assisted by monks of Waegwan Abbey, South Korea. In December 2001, a number of these monks arrived in Newton. The monastery was officially handed over on January 25, 2002, and was elevated to the status of a simple priory, known as Newton II, on January 25, 2004. The small number of American monks who remain at Newton are governed by a special statute. Apostolate Because of the decrease in vocations, the work of the community is currently not as widespread as it was in times past. Agriculture, particularly the growing of Christmas trees, remains an important part of the monks' livelihood. Members of the community are also involved in retreat work, pastoral care of the sick, and the promotion of the mission apostolate. The monastery has no dependencies. Personnel As of May 18, 2011, the community of Newton II included fourteen monks, including six priests and one oblate. Of these fourteen, nine are Korean, four are American, and one is Tanzanian. The community of Newton II is under the leadership of Fr Prior Samuel Kim.

It was introduced at AirVenture in July 2012. The aircraft is supplied as a kit for amateur construction.Bernard, Mary and Suzanne B. Bopp: Van's Aircraft: RV-14, Kitplanes, Volume 29, Number 12, December 2012, page 19-21. Belvoir Publications. As of October 2019, 113 RV-14s have been completed and flown. Design and development Derived from the four-seat RV-10, RV-14 design work was commenced several years before its 2012 debut. It is an aerobatic two- seater designed to accommodate large pilots and offer greater baggage space, to comply with the US experimental amateur-built aircraft rules. The design goals included improved visibility, a wider cabin, a low landing speed achieved by larger and more effective flaps, good rate-of-climb and glide ratio, landing gear that meets FAR Part 23 certification standards and an airframe designed to accommodate the Lycoming IO-390 powerplant. It features a cantilever low-wing, a two-seats-in-side-by-side configuration enclosed cockpit under a bubble canopy, fixed tricycle landing gear and a single engine in tractor configuration. The RV-14 is built from aluminum sheet. The prototype was fitted with a Lycoming IO-390 four-stroke powerplant. The kit is intended to be easier to assemble than earlier Van's designs through the use of pre-punched and pre-formed fuselage longerons, pre-installed wiring, plug- in avionics, a pre-trimmed and ready-to-install bubble canopy, pre-welded canopy frame, pre-fitted engine baffles as well as matched pre-punched holes. The RV-14 offers several instrument panel choices, including one designed to take modern EFIS systems, like the Dynon SkyView, without any additional cutting, as well as a blank panel that can be customized by the builder. In July 2020 Van's introduced a new version of the Lycoming IO-390, designated as the IO-390-EXP119 and optimized for the RV-14. The engine has new exhaust and induction systems and puts out . It has a revised oil sump, aluminum induction pipes, oil pump and accessory case that saves of weight. With this powerplant the RV-14 is faster in cruise speed and climbs faster. The manufacturer offers aircraft type transition training and has built an RV-14 for this purpose.

Biography =Early naval career= Hosken was born on in Plymouth, the son of a navy warrant officer. He entered the Royal Navy on 23 February 1808, (two months after his 9th birthday). In 1810 he was appointed midshipman aboard , and later served in the Baltic, the Mediterranean, and the North Sea, until the end of the war in 1815. He passed the examination for lieutenant in 1816, but was unable to gain a commission. From 1816 to 1819 he served in the frigate in the West Indies, then spent three years in the Channel serving aboard the brig . From 1824 to 1828 he served as Mate of the revenue cutter Scout, engaged in the suppression of smuggling. Finally, on 9 August 1828, he was appointed lieutenant of the bomb vessel , serving in the Mediterranean under Captain Stephen Lushington. Aetna was paid off in May 1830, and afterwards he commanded the packet ships Princess Elizabeth and , sailing to the West Indies and South America. He left the Navy in October 1832. =Merchant captain= Great Western departing Bristol in 1838. Launch of Great Britain at Bristol, July 1843. Painting by Joseph Walter. Between 1833 and 1836 he was the captain of a merchant ship sailing between Liverpool and South America. In 1837 he devoted himself to the study of the marine steam engine, and towards the end of the year was appointed to the command of the Great Western Steamship Company's paddle-wheel steamship . She sailed from Bristol on her maiden voyage on 8 April 1838, and arrived at New York fifteen days later on the 23rd. This represented a dramatic increase in speed, as the average duration of an Atlantic crossing from England to America in a sailing ship was 34 days. Side paddle steamers had brought this down to 17 days, but with experience Hosken brought his average down to 13 days in the sixty-six voyages he made between England and America. In 1844 he was appointed to command of Great Western's , the first iron-hulled screw steamship and at that time the largest ship afloat. She sailed from Liverpool for New York on her maiden voyage in August 1845.https://globalstories.ssgreatbritain.org/_/voyage/3/ However, on the night of 22 September 1846, during her fifth voyage, she ran aground in Dundrum Bay, Ireland.https://globalstories.ssgreatbritain.org/_/voyage/11/ Weather conditions were poor, and an error on the chart led Hosken to believe that the lighthouse on St. John's Point, at the entrance of the bay, was the Calf of Man, which they had passed four hours before. After several months the ship was refloated, but Hosken had no further employment in the merchant service. =Later career= From 1848 to 1849 Hosken served as master attendant and postmaster at Labuan, recently ceded to England. He then returned to the navy and in 1851 he was appointed to command of the despatch vessel in the Mediterranean, and later in the Channel. On 26 September 1853 he was promoted to commander, and during the Baltic campaigns of 1854–55 commanded the hospital ship . At the end of the Crimean War he was employed in bringing back troops from the Black Sea. In June 1857 he was promoted to captain, and in 1868 was placed on the retired list. He was promoted to rear- admiral in April 1875, and vice-admiral in August 1879, and died at Ilfracombe, Devon, on 2 January 1885. He is buried in Arnos Vale Cemetery, Bristol. In 1889 Elizabeth Ann, his second wife, published an Autobiographical Sketch of the Public Career of Admiral James Hosken. A portrait of his son Thomas Hosken (b.1831) can be seen in Merchant Hall, Bristol.

It is found primarily in the northern German state of Schleswig-Holstein, and also, in smaller numbers, in Lower Saxony. It shares the origins, ancestry and much of the history of the Danish Jutland breed, and shows some similarity to the British Suffolk Punch. It is used in agriculture and forestry, and to draw coaches and wagons.  History  The Schleswig Coldblood originates from the area of the Duchy of Schleswig, in the southern part of the Jutland Peninsula, and has its origins in the Jutland horse. In about 1860 an imported English stallion, Oppenheim LXII, either a pure-bred or a part-bred Suffolk Punch, was introduced, and became the foundation stallion of the breed. In 1888 the breeding of warmbloods and coldbloods was separated, and in 1891 various associations of coldblood breeders in Schleswig were brought together in the , and systematic breeding began. The brand V.S.P in an oval on the off hindleg was chosen to identify registered horses and is still used today. In 1893 the stallion Aldrup Munkedal 839 was born, a son of Munkedal II 585 and a descendant of Oppenheim LXII; he won the king's prize at the Jubilee celebrations in Odense in 1900, and 70,000 crowns were offered for him. From after the First World War, all Schleswig Coldbloods descended from this stallion. By 1910 the Verband recorded 12,000 breeding animals. Through regional agricultural shows, the Schleswig Coldblood became widely known and was sold throughout Germany. The division of Schleswig between Denmark and Germany in 1920, in the aftermath of the First World War, meant the loss of a large part of the breeding area and was a major setback. However numbers rose again, and in 1949 reached a peak of about 450 stallions and 20,000 or 25,000 brood-mares in the hands of more than 15,000 breeders spread throughout Schleswig-Holstein, though more concentrated in the north. In 1958 two French stallions were added to the breeding stock. In the years following the Second World War the mechanisation of agriculture, with the replacement of agricultural horses with tractors, led to a dramatic decline in numbers. By 1976 there were no more than sixty mares registered. The breed association closed and the remaining animals were registered in the Schleswig-Holstein horse register in Kiel. A society for the protection of the breed was soon formed, and in 1991 this became the , or Schleswig horse breeders' association. Since 1997 numbers have remained stable at about 200–250; in 2013 there were 189 mares and 26 stallions. The Schleswig Coldblood was listed as \\"endangered\\" by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations in 2007. In 2013 it was in Category II: \\"seriously endangered\\" on the Rote Liste of the Gesellschaft zur Erhaltung alter und gefährdeter Haustierrassen, the German national association for the conservation of historic and endangered domestic animal breeds, and was listed as \\"minimally endangered\\" by the European Association for Animal Production. Since 2012 a sub-population, the , or roughly \\"Hanoverian coldblood of Schleswig origin\\", has been included in the Schleswiger Coldblood breed; in 2012 there were a total of 62 – 4 stallions and 58 mares.  Characteristics  The Schleswig Coldblood stands between . Stallions are, on average, about taller than mares. It has a short and straight head with kind eyes and a broad forehead; short, cresty neck; powerful shoulders; a long body with good depth in the girth; powerful hindquarters; short and stocky limbs with some feather. It is usually flaxen chestnut in colour, though grey and dark colours can occur.  Uses  The Schleswig Coldblood was bred for use as a working horse. It was used on farms and for hauling timber from forests, to pull omnibuses and brewery wagons in cities, and for heavy work in the military. It is still used in agriculture and forestry, and for pulling wagons.

History =Origins= The estate was established by Carl von Ahlefeldt when he closed down the village of Østrup to establish Østrupgård in 1704 from land that used to belong to Kalundborg Castle. In 1742 it was acquired by general Christian Lerche (1692-1757). The large estate included 7 manors, 13 churches and extensive woodlands, taking in practically all of Kalundborg Amt. Lerche constructed a new seat on the estate, probably assisted by Nicolai Eigtved, Denmark's leading architect of the time. Lerche received the Order of the Elephant in 1748 and was given status of count in 1752. He renamed his estate Lerchenborg in 1754 but did not establish it as a county (grevskab) which, since he had no direct heirs, would fall back to the king. Instead he founded a stamhus which secured succession rights for other lines of the Lerche family. 19th century Lerchenborg in the late 19th century When Christian Cornelius Lerche, who had inherited Lerchenborg in 1804, was ennobled with rank of count, on 26 May 1818, Lerchenborg was combined with Aunsøgård, Mineslund, Asnæsgård, Lerchenfeld, Birkendegård, Vesterbygård, Astrup and Davrup to form the County of Lerchenborg (Grevskabet Lerchenborg). In 1862, Hans Christian Andersen stayed at Lerchenborg for a week as guest of Count C.A. Lerche. =20th century= The county was dissolved in 1923 and the Lerchenborg estate passed out of the Lerche family's ownership in 1927. However, in 1952 it was reacquired by a member of the family, Christian Albrecht Frederik Lerche-Lerchenborg, and has been owned by the Lerchenborg counts ever since. Mineslund and Asnæsgården were sold off in connection with the reacquission.. Architecture Lerchenborg is a three-winged white-washed Rococo complex, consisting of a two-storey, seventeen bay main wing and two lower, detached lateral wings. The main wing has a three-bay median risilit with a triangular pediment and corner projections of two bays with rounded pediments, all with Rococo decorations. The rear side is basically of the same pattern. There is a central entrance on each side of the building. Interior The house has fine Rococo style interiors. The hipped roofs on all three buildings are of slate, although originally they had red tiles. Surroundings The entire complex of main building, farm buildings and park form a strictly symmetrical unity in accordance with the aesthetic principles of the Baroque. On one side, the house is approached through a hierarchy of courtyards, formed by barns and stables, and on the other side the central axis of the complex continues through the park and into the countryside. The original French-style Baroque garden was designed by the Belgian-Danish architect and engineering officer Jean Baptiste de Longueville but most of it was adapted into an English-style landscape garden in the 19th century. Today the park has an area of 20 hectares.

Naval career Young was born in Ohio, on 27 November 1826. He was appointed as a midshipman from Illinois on 19 October 1841 and served in the Home Squadron from 1841 to 1844, attached first to the paddle steamer and then to the sloop- of-war . While in the Home Squadron, he was part of a boat expedition against pirates at the Isle of Pines south of Cuba in 1842 and participated in the capture of a slave ship carrying 500 African slaves.Hamersly, pp. 110-111. From 1845 to 1848, Young was attached to the 74-gun ship-of-the-line , the flagship of Commodore James Biddle, commander of the East India Squadron. During his time aboard Columbus, the ship sailed first to the East Indies and then continued around the world, stopping at Edo, Japan, in July 1846 to forcibly deliver a letter requesting the opening of trade between the United States and Japan from President of the United States James K. Polk to the Emperor of Japan, Kōmei, and receive a reply. Later in the voyage, she operated off California from 1847 to 1848 during the Mexican War before completing her circumnavigation of the globe in 1848. Young was promoted to passed midshipman on 10 August 1847.Hamersly, p. 111.heritage-history.com The Story of Japan: The United States Seeks Trade With Japan by R.

He served aboard the steamer from 1854 to 1857; while aboard Massachusetts, he was promoted to master on 14 September 1855 and to lieutenant the following day, and in 1855 gained distinction for commanding landing forces in combat with Native Americans during the Puget Sound War in the Washington Territory. After duty at the Naval Observatory again in 1858, he was aboard the steamer from 1858 to 1859 to participate in the Paraguay Expedition before another tour at the Naval Observatory from 1859 to 1860. In 1860, Young reported aboard the sidewheel steam frigate , which operated in the Gulf of Mexico, Mediterranean Squadron, and along the United States East Coast. He was aboard Susqehanna when the American Civil War broke out in April 1861, and participated in the Union blockade of the Confederate States of America. He also took part aboard Susquehanna in the seizure of Hatteras Inlet, North Carolina, on 28 August 1861 and the Battle of Port Royal at Port Royal, South Carolina, on 7 November 1861. From November 1861 to June 1862, he was executive officer of the sloop- of-war , engaged in the blockade of Wilmington, North Carolina, and from June 1862 to November 1862 he was executive officer of the sidewheel steam frigate on blockade duty off Charleston, South Carolina, being promoted to lieutenant commander on 16 July 1862. Young was commanding officer of the steam gunboat in 1863. Pembina, on blockade duty in the Gulf of Mexico off Mobile Bay, Alabama, fought an engagement with a Confederate artillery battery which had been emplaced with a goal of driving her farther offshore; she succeeded in silencing the battery and forcing it to withdraw inland. She also came under fire from Confederate troops on shore while she was destroying a blockade runner that had run aground. After contracting a fever while on duty in the harbor of Pensacola, Florida, later in 1863, Young was assigned to temporary ordnance duty until he could make a full recovery. Once recovered, he became commanding officer of the double-ended steam gunboat on blockade duty in the Atlantic Ocean off South Carolina and Georgia from March to July 1864, when he took command of the monitor in the blockade off Charleston, South Carolina. He remained in command of Sangamon until the fall of Savannah, Georgia, and Charleston, seeing action in all the attacks on the defenses of Charleston Harbor from July 1864 to February 1865, after which Sangamon served off Wilmington, North Carolina, and on Virginias James River. For the gallantry, zeal, and effectiveness of his Civil War service, Young received letters of commendation from Vice Admiral David Dixon Porter, Rear Admirals Theodorus Bailey, John A. Dahlgren, and Sylvanus William Godon, Commodore William H. Gardner, and many others under whom he had served, and the Board of Admirals recommended him for promotion. Young detached from Sangamon in the final weeks of the Civil War, on 28 March 1865. He then was commanding officer of the receiving ship at Portsmouth Navy Yard in Kittery, Maine, until 1867, and was promoted to commander on 25 July 1866. He returned to sea as commanding officer of the sidewheel steamer in the North Atlantic Squadron from 1867 to 1868.

Designed by local architect John Leopold Denman and paid for by public subscription, it commemorated the extension of the County Borough of Brighton on 1 April 1928, and stood close to the new northern boundary. The gateway consists of two stone towers known locally as \\"the Pylons\\", with built-in seats around their bases. They still stand and are clearly visible to travellers on either carriageway of the A23 road to London. They straddle the southbound carriageway of the A23 just outside the city of Brighton and Hove and are individually listed at Grade II. History and symbolic role The Pylon was built as a symbolic gateway to Brighton and was intended to extend a welcome to travellers approaching from the north along the A23. They were commissioned by Sir Herbert Carden, a local councillor, and were unveiled on 30 May 1928. He paid £2,255 towards them, and the public raised a further £993. They stand either side of what was, at the time of construction, a single carriageway road. Because the road is now a dual carriageway, one pylon now \\"stands forlornly in the central reservation, although a third is planned\\". In the spirit of welcome, the north face of the western tower bears the inscription: HAIL GUEST• WE ASK NOT WHAT THOU ART. IF FRIEND. WE GREET THEE. HAND & HEART: IF STRANGER. SUCH NO LONGER BE: IF FOE. OUR LOVE SHALL CONQUER THEE. The pylons and seats were listed at Grade II by English Heritage on 26 August 1999. Such buildings are considered to be \\"of special interest warranting every effort to preserve them\\", and \\"nationally important\\" buildings of \\"special interest\\". As of February 2001, they were among 1,124 Grade II-listed buildings and structures, and 1,218 listed buildings of all grades, in the city of Brighton and Hove. Architecture The pylons are of limestone with slightly concave north and south faces. Small buttresses protrude at the corners. Carvings and inscriptions include the coat of arms of the Duke and Duchess of York, who laid the foundation stone, the emblems of Brighton and Sussex, a female figure and a galleon. Details of the date, architect, builders, founders and other descriptive information, and a short poem, are also carved on the flat panels which are mounted on the concave faces. Next to each pylon is a seat, also made of stone and wrapping around but not touching the base. They are about off the ground, supported on small columns, and have decorative moulding. They are separately listed at Grade II.

It was first published in 1929, and has been reprinted many times in anthologies. It is viewed as a classical expression of the English tradition of horror fiction, as it elicits a well-founded and increasingly intense sense of impending doom without inserting any scenes of physical violence. Plot summary The two principal protagonists of \\"The End of the Party\\" are nine-year-olds, Peter Morton and Francis Morton. The story makes clear that although they are identical twins, they possess profound psychological differences – Peter, the elder by several minutes, is presented as a healthy child with an intensively protective attitude towards his impaired brother, while Francis is depicted as being challenged by an intense anxiety disorder. The unnamed narrator speculates that Francis suffered psychological trauma during the birth process, when he was briefly separated from Peter. Peter and Francis will be separated again during a game of hide- and-seek that is the scheduled climax of a birthday party for a family acquaintance, ten-year-old Colin Henne-Falcon. Descriptions of the home of the Mortons, where the story begins, and the Henne-Falcons, where it ends, make clear that the ambiance of the story is that of the English upper class between the two World Wars. The brief appearance of a child's nurse, and other servants, help establish the social setting. Cozy elements such as an egg-and- spoon race, a three-legged race, and a birthday cake do little to diminish the mounting horror of the story, as Francis is increasingly terrified by the prospect of being required to play hide-and-seek in the dark. As the climactic hide-and-seek game begins, the adults present turn out the lights and the children designated to hide, including Peter and Francis, are required to scatter. Peter senses his brother's terror and, aided by his instinctive grasp of his brother's psychological fears and needs, is able to guess where Francis has hidden himself. A gesture of Peter's hand in the dark, as he reaches out, tells him that his guess has been successful: he touches his younger brother and then grasps his hand and crouches close to him, attempting to provide a continuing presence of reassurance. Faint noises, described meticulously by Greene, show that the game is continuing, and darkness continues to enshroud the place of safety where the two brothers are hiding. Finally the game is over, a chandelier is lit, and the party's hostess begins to scream with horror. As light floods into the niche where the brothers have hidden themselves, the narrator reports that Francis Morton has lain sprawled and still since the terrified child was startled beyond endurance by the touch of a human hand in the dark. The story's ironic ending makes clear that the nine- year-old did not live long enough to realize that the fingers descending upon his face were those of his protective brother. Their separation would now be permanent. Critical response Greene published \\"The End of the Party\\" near the start of a writing career that would extend over more than six decades; this short story helped to develop his reputation as a significant force in English letters. The favorable response to his story may be connected to ongoing concerns in Britain due to the significant headcount of World War I veterans afflicted with \\"shell shock\\". The story was anthologized in the Greene collection, Twenty-One Stories, published in 1954. Greene himself considered this story to be among his best, and assisted in its selection among the texts reprinted in the Greene edition of the Viking Portable Library, originally published in 1973 and reprinted since in revised editions. Later commentary on \\"The End of the Party\\" tends to look at protagonist Francis Morton's impairments from the standpoint of a society that tries to help children with disabilities. A review published in 1999 by New York University encourages readers to develop a sense of empathy for the doomed child.

According to its Science Plan, UGEC aims to provide a better understanding of the interactions and feedbacks between global environmental change and urbanization at the local, regional, and global scales. UGEC pursues four areas of research: # Processes within urban systems that contribute to global environmental change (e.g., the impact of urbanization on carbon emissions; the effects of urban land cover change on biodiversity and habitat). # Pathways through which specific global environmental changes affect urban systems (e.g., climate change impacts on urban areas; decline in ecosystem services on urban climate regulation). #Urban responses to global environmental change (e.g., urban strategies for climate change mitigation and adaptation). # Consequences of urban responses to global environmental change. Additionally, the goals of UGEC include: * creating multidimensional integrative perspectives; * promoting parallel and comparative analysis across regions and themes; * utilizing cross-temporal and cross-spatial scale approaches; and * outreaching and communicating UGEC-related scientific information to policy makers and the public.

As the deputy coordinator of the National Coordination Committee for Democratic Change, he was also the most prominent Kurdish representative during the Syrian Civil War.  Political career  = Early political activities = Muslim first became involved with the Kurdish movement during the 1970s when he was studying engineering at Istanbul Technical University after becoming influenced by Mustafa Barzani's ongoing fight against the Iraqi government, the failure of which spurred him into becoming more active. In 1998, he joined the Kurdistan Democratic Party of Syria (KDP-S), the Syrian branch of the Iraqi Kurdish Democratic Party (KDP). He left the KDP-S in 2003 after becoming disillusioned by the party's failure to accomplish its objectives. 2013 VOA report about the PYD, including an interview with Salih Muslim = Democratic Union Party (PYD) = In 2003, Muslim joined the newly formed Democratic Union Party (PYD), becoming a member of its executive council, and was elected as party head in 2010. After he and his wife Ayşe Efendi were imprisoned in Syria, he fled to a Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) camp in Iraq in 2010. He returned to Qamishli in March 2011, following the beginning of the Syrian Civil War. Under Muslim's chairmanship, the PYD became the leading political party and actor in the emergence of the Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria. In July 2013, during the Kurdish-Turkish peace process, he was invited to Istanbul to negotiate with the Turkish government about the future of Syria, returning on three more occasions for talks between then and October 2014. = TEV-DEM foreign relations = In September 2017, the 7th congress of the PYD was held in Northern Syria, where two new co-chairs were elected. Muslim since works as the foreign relations official of the Movement for a Democratic Society (TEV- DEM) coalition of the Democratic Federation of Northern Syria. In this capacity, Muslim has stressed the message that \\"the Kurdish problem in Turkey and the Kurdish problem in Syria are two separate issues and will be resolved separately. To solve our problem in Syria, we have to sit down and talk with our fellow Syrians, with Arabs, Turkmens and others. Not with Turkey.\\"  Personal life  Muslim, a citizen of Syria, was born in a Syrian village close to Kobani in 1951. After an education in Syria, he studied at the Chemical Engineering faculty of Istanbul Technical University from 1970 until graduating in 1977. After a brief stint in London, he worked in Saudi Arabia between 1978 and 1990, and opened an engineering office in 1993 in Aleppo. On 9 October 2013, Salih Muslim's son Shervan, a fighter in the People's Protection Units (YPG), was killed west of Tell Abyad during clashes with al- Qaeda's al-Nusra Front. He was buried in the family's hometown of Kobanê in a public funeral which thousands of people attended. According to Muslim himself, he has permission to reside in Finland. PYD, with Ulla Jelpke at Rosa Luxemburg Foundation in Berlin  Relations with foreign countries  = Europe = Muslim is a familiar face in European capitals where he is hosted by senior officials. He is a frequent guest and speaker at European political institutions and events, inter alia in September 2016 invited to address the European Parliament. Addressing thousands during the Newroz celebration in Frankfurt, Germany, on 18 March 2017, Muslim said that \\"there is a huge resistance despite all the attacks. Nobody should doubt that the success and victory will be ours.\\" Muslim criticised Germany for banning Kurdish symbols, saying that \\"Germany should have banned the flags of Turkey and terrorist groups instead of our flags and symbols because we are fighting in the Middle East not for ourselves alone, we are fighting ISIS and terrorism for all humanity. Our resistance is for Europe, for the West and for all humanity.\\" = Turkey = Between 2012 and 2015, Muslim was Ankara’s top interlocutor within the PYD's Syrian Kurdish movement, which was inspired by former Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) leader Abdullah Ocalan. During an interview with BBC News reporter Orla Guerin in August 2012, Muslim denied any \\"operational links\\" to the PKK. Turkey has received Salih Muslim for talks in 2013 and in 2014, even entertaining the idea of opening a Rojava representation office in Ankara \\"if it's suitable with Ankara's policies.\\" However, following June 2015 AKP electoral loss in Turkey, largely due to the raise of Kurdish HDP party, the Solution process (2013-2015) collapsed in July 2015, drastically changing the course of AKP relations to the Kurdish issue. According to the pro-administration Daily Sabah, “As a reconciliation process with the PKK was ongoing between 2012 and 2015, Ankara tried to persuade the PYD to drop its hostile attitude toward Turkey, open cooperation channels and to end its affiliations with the Bashar Assad regime. As the PKK unilaterally resumed armed attacks in July 2015, the PYD and its armed wing, the People's Protection Units (YPG), provided the PKK with militants, explosives, arms and ammunition. Simultaneous armed revolts broke out in almost all towns and cities bordering Syria; whereas terrorists trained in northern Syria staged suicide attacks in Turkish cities.” The Turkish government allegedly sought to assassinate Muslim. In late 2016, Turkey issued an arrest warrant for Salih Muslim in a move considered putting Ankara on a collision course with its Western allies. On 14 February 2018, two days after Muslim was placed on the \\"most wanted terrorists\\" list by the Turkish Interior Ministry and had a bounty of 4 million Turkish lira (about $1.5US millions at the time) placed on his head, he held a press conference at the seat of European Union institutions in Brussels. He was briefly detained at Turkey’s request on 25 February 2018 in Prague, the capital of the Czech Republic, but was released 2 days later, drawing angry protests from Turkey. On 17 March 2018, the Czech authorities dismissed Turkey's request. In a February 2018 interview, Muslim said that \\"when I look back, I conclude that Turkey was never sincere about wanting to make peace with the Kurds.

Complete graphs Although closely related problems in discrete geometry had been studied earlier, e.g. by and , the problem of determining the slope number of a graph was introduced by , who showed that the slope number of an -vertex complete graph is exactly . A drawing with this slope number may be formed by placing the vertices of the graph on a regular polygon. Relation to degree The slope number of a graph of maximum degree is clearly at least \\\\lceil d/2\\\\rceil, because at most two of the incident edges at a degree- vertex can share a slope. More precisely, the slope number is at least equal to the linear arboricity of the graph, since the edges of a single slope must form a linear forest, and the linear arboricity in turn is at least \\\\lceil d/2\\\\rceil. There exist graphs with maximum degree five that have arbitrarily large slope number.Proved independently by and , solving a problem posed by . See theorems 5.1 and 5.2 of . However, every graph of maximum degree three has slope number at most four;, improving an earlier result of ; theorem 5.3 of . the result of for the complete graph shows that this is tight. Not every set of four slopes is suitable for drawing all degree-3 graphs: a set of slopes is suitable for this purpose if and only it forms the slopes of the sides and diagonals of a parallelogram. In particular, any degree 3 graph can be drawn so that its edges are either axis-parallel or parallel to the main diagonals of the integer lattice.. It is not known whether graphs of maximum degree four have bounded or unbounded slope number.. The method of for combining circle packings and quadtrees to achieve bounded slope number for planar graphs with bounded degree Planar graphs As showed, every planar graph has a planar straight-line drawing in which the number of distinct slopes is a function of the degree of the graph. Their proof follows a construction of for bounding the angular resolution of planar graphs as a function of degree, by completing the graph to a maximal planar graph without increasing its degree by more than a constant factor, and applying the circle packing theorem to represent this augmented graph as a collection of tangent circles. If the degree of the initial graph is bounded, the ratio between the radii of adjacent circles in the packing will also be bounded by the ring lemma,. which in turn implies that using a quadtree to place each graph vertex on a point within its circle will produce slopes that are ratios of small integers. The number of distinct slopes produced by this construction is exponential in the degree of the graph. Complexity It is NP-complete to determine whether a graph has slope number two.; ; . From this, it follows that it is NP-hard to determine the slope number of an arbitrary graph, or to approximate it with an approximation ratio better than 3/2. It is also NP-complete to determine whether a planar graph has a planar drawing with slope number two,. and hard for the existential theory of the reals to determine the minimum slope number of a planar drawing..

Spinola was sent to the Archdiocese of Messina to act as administrator in 1625 and upon his return to Rome in 1626 he was elevated to the office of cardinal, with the Basilica of San Clemente as his titular church. He was also named as Protector of his homeland, the Republic of Genoa, becoming its official representative to the Holy See. In 1629 Spinola was also given the title of Cardinal Priest of the Church of Santa Cecilia in Trastevere, holding both until he gave up that of San Clemente on 17 August 1637. In November 1630 he was named the Archbishop of Acerenza and Matera. He was consecrated bishop by Domenico de' Marini, Archbishop of Genoa, with Angelo Mascardi, Bishop of Noli, Pietro Francesco Costa, Bishop of Albenga, and Vincenzo Giovanni Spínola, Bishop of Brugnato, serving as co-consecrators. He was transferred to the episcopal see of Luni-Sarzana on 26 April 1632, retaining the personal rank of archbishop. He was again transferred, this time to the Diocese of Mazara del Vallo in Sicily as of 1 December 1636, still retaining the rank of archbishop. Between 1642 and 1643 Spinola also served as Camerlengo of the Sacred College of Cardinals. He participated in the papal conclave of 1644 that elected Pope Innocent X. Spinola died in Mazara in 1646, and was buried in the Chapel of San Gaetano in the Cathedral of Mazara.

The James Lick Baths (also known as the People's Laundry Building and 165 Tenth Street) in the South of Market District of San Francisco, California. It is a San Francisco Designated Landmark. It combined aspects of public bathing and self-service laundry. History In 1890 working class residents of San Francisco did not have indoor plumbing. Built in 1890 by the James Lick estate as a free public bath house, it housed a men’s bath with forty bathtubs in changing rooms in the large north wing, and a women’s bath with twenty tubs in changing rooms in the smaller south wing. The James Lick Baths were originally lavish in conception and finish. Water was pumped from the facility’s own wells, heated in boilers in the sunken boiler room, and hot and cold water was pumped into 10,000 gallon tanks in the tower. Bathers could open the taps at each tub in the bathing halls for a customized mix of hot and cold water. After extensive damage in the 1906 earthquake and fire the building was repaired and continued as a bath until 1919. From 1919 until 1973 it was The People’s Laundry, an industrial laundry, followed by a variety of offices, workshops, and stores. The two main bath spaces were divided and circulation in the building became convoluted. A wall at the base of the tower was demolished, leaving one side unsupported. The building became a San Francisco Designated Landmark in 2004. In 2008 Gelfand Partners Architects acquired the building and renovated the ground floor to be its office.J.K.

By its values and positions, the ASSÉ positions itself differently from the other province-wide student unions, the Fédération étudiante universitaire du Québec (FEUQ), the Fédération étudiante collégiale du Québec (FECQ) and the Table de concertation étudiante du Québec (TaCEQ). The ASSÉ forms the core of the Coalition large de l'ASSÉ (CLASSE), a temporary coalition created to counter the tuition hike and coordinate 2012 Quebec student protests.  Philosophy  The Association pour une Solidarité Syndicale Étudiante clamors for free education at all levels and for all, abolition of student debt, conservation of quality post-secondary education and the democratization of schools while opposing education commodification. It considers mass mobilization as a catalyst of social change. It favours local general assemblies as decision-making structures as opposed to referendums, considered less democratic. It also fights for responsible taxation, minority rights defense, promotes alter-globalization, demilitarization, implementation of public housing policy and the irrevocable right to dissidence. The basic principles of the ASSÉ lies on the foundations of student unionism as established in Article 1 of the Charter of Grenoble, in 1946. The Charter stipulates that the student is a young intellectual worker. Thus students must be associated on a union basis. The ASSÉ believes in the necessity of fighting to save the gains made by past student movements, as well as to make new gains, through permanent protest. Considering education as a right, rather than as a privilege, the ASSÉ is based on the following principles: 1\\\\. For quality, free, accessible, secular, non-discriminatory public education; 2\\\\. For adequate financial aid whose aim is to eliminate student debt and to ensure that fundamental needs are met; 3\\\\. For a public education network free from private-sector intrusion, including contract manufacturing; 4\\\\. For democratization of educational institutions from a perspective of self-management; 5\\\\. For union solidarity with all international progressive fights whose aim is society's well-being; 6\\\\. Against any and all forms of globalization that support the predominance of profit over the population's well-being 7\\\\. For a combative feminism aiming to abolish patriarchy and all forms of oppression and discrimination.

In February, the CASSÉÉ launches a series of referendums and general assemblies over the start of an unlimited general strike around three main demands: # The retroactive abolition of the reform to the Aide financière du Québec; # The abandonment of all decentralization and market alignment projects of the college network; # Both demands go towards free education and abolition of student debt. On February 24, 2005, the first associations start the strike movement. On March 16, 2005, 70,000 students are CASSÉE members, out of the 230,000 students on strike at that moment, the others being FEUQ or FECQ members. The CASSÉÉ is excluded from the negotiation table by the new Education Minister Jean-Marc Fournier because of its refusal to condemn violent acts posed during the strike. The CASSÉÉ, however, claims that it is to divide the student movement that the minister excluded it, since, shortly after the strike began, on February 16, 2005 at Montebello, students assembled by the FEUQ and the FECQ forced Château Montebello's door with a battering ram to disturb a Parti libéral du Québec caucus, leading to a Sûreté du Québec intervention.Juneau-Hotte, Maxime. \\"Assos en solo\\".

The strike ends after the signature of an accord by the student unions and Minister Fournier, that the Association pour une Solidarité Syndicale Étudiante qualifies of a \\"bargain accord\\" and is rejected by a majority of general assemblies, who still vote to return to class after 7 weeks of strike.  2012 student strike  Since summer 2011, the ASSÉ threatened the Quebec government to start an unlimited general strike.

The screenplay, based on a novel by Auguste Le Breton, explores the contemporary drug scene in Paris and the efforts of the police to limit it. The film was released as Razzia in the United States, distributed by Kassler Films Inc. with English subtitles by Herman G. Weinberg. Plot After a spell in the US, master criminal Henri \\"le Nantais\\" returns to Paris and is recruited by Paul Liski, head of a major narcotics ring, to improve efficiency of distribution. Merchandise has been disappearing and unreliable dealers must be eliminated. For the latter purpose he is assigned two hit men, Catalan and Bibi. As his cover, he is made manager of a restaurant, Le Troquet, much favoured by the underworld. As soon as he walks in, he catches the eye of the cashier, Lisette, who resolves to be his girl. The first task he is given is a courier who wants out, not understanding that there is only one way to leave the organisation: Catalan and Bibi quickly eliminate him. Then he visits a laboratory, whose courier has been dealing on the side and is quickly dealt with by the two hit men. Deciding that the laboratory is compromised, Henri himself takes its entire stock to the port of Le Havre, to be shipped overseas. Later, the organisation is shocked to learn that French police found the whole consignment. Police pressure intensifies, with a raid on Le Troquet in which staff and customers are all taken in for questioning. They exempt Lisette, who has moved into Henri's apartment upstairs and has been given a number to ring if Henri's life is in danger. Freed, he continues his investigations into weak links, visiting among other sordid spots a Chinese opium den and a club for black marijuana smokers. When Catalan and Bibi are sent on a job, they walk into a police ambush and escape wounded, after killing two cops. They rush round to Le Troquet, where Lisette overhears their story, and Henri decides that Paul must solve this problem. When the three go to his house, he gives them a map and the keys to a country hideaway; Driving there straight away, they are looking for food and drink when the house is surrounded by police and in a gun battle Catalan and Bibi are killed. The police, who had been alerted by Lisette, take the lightly wounded Henri back to headquarters, where the whole drug ring from Paul downwards has been arrested. Revealing himself to be an undercover police inspector, Henri looks forward to interrogating them.

There, she meets a girl of her age, Jack, who is clearly smitten by Diane. Diane's nose starts bleeding again and Jack gives her a hand. Jack then takes Diane to a night club. When they get there, Diane seems nauseated, having lost a lot of blood from her nose, and she goes to the restroom. She gains consciousness, meets up with Jack and the girls passionately kiss. By morning, the girls part ways and Jack is hit by a car, though she is not badly harmed. Back at Diane's home, she is reprimanded by her aunt Linda, who tells her she is grounded. Diane strikes back by telling her she's not her mother. Both of the girls feel misunderstood back in their homes. Diane visits Jack in her home.

Schooling Keller was born in New York City in 1942, and was a fan of reading from an early age. Drawing also quickly became a form of self entertainment for her. As schooling for Keller continued she went on to Sarah Lawrence College to obtain a degree in history; later attending Columbia University, Keller continued her history studies by earning her master's degree. Holly took courses at the Parsons School of Design when she finally had time and was encouraged by a professor to try illustrating children's books. In 1981, Keller put together a portfolio of her works and submitted it to an editor at the Greenwillow Press which was where she was published using her first two books and illustrations; Cromwell's Glasses and Ten Sleepy Sheep. Family Keller married in 1963 to a pediatrician and soon became the mother of two children. About the Books Keller has gotten many recognitions and awards for her books. She draws with a flat, minimalist and cartoon style. Keller's books are not only entertaining to read, but they also have a message. Some books deal with issues ranging from adoption to fitting in, from sibling relationships to saying farewell to a beloved pet. Keller's Ten Sleepy Sheep was voted a Library of Congress Children's Book of the Year which was a big step for her since it was only her second published children's book.,In 1986 Keller won the Caldecott Honor \\"When Francie Was Sick\\" and 1987 \\"Snow is Falling\\".

Ray.  Plot summary  Unsure of their financial situation, Richard Sutton and Linda Pearson have postponed their plans to marry to when they have a steady income. To be able to turn down a job offer he doesn't like, he pretends to have inherited money from a relative. Problem arises as his grandmother hears of the inheritance and believes it is a particular wealthy uncle Woodrow in Brazil who has thrown in the towel, leaving his $3 Million to Richard. She is also unaware of Richard's engagement to Linda. When Richard wants to take the grandmother out of her misconception, her doctor advises against it, saying the shock could cause her death. Believing her grandson is rich now, she starts campaigning for his engagement to young beautiful Gwenny Miller. Gwenny is the grandmother's ward. Another wealthy young woman, Barbara Cartwright, tells Richard she has an idea of how he can solve his problems. Richard goes to visit Barbara, but is quite dozy after involuntarily taking sleeping pills. He falls asleep, and when he wakes up again, he is seemingly engaged to Barbara. Outraged and jealous, Linda breaks off their engagement, and Richard goes on a bender to drown his sorrows. Again he is knocked out, and wakes up in the apartment of infamous playboy Chester Wannamaker. With him in the apartment is a chorus girl named Lorraine O'Reilly, who really is Chester's fiancé. Both Barbara and Gwenny soon arrives to the apartment to confront him, and after that also Lorraine's brother. The brother believes Richard is Chester and uses a gun to threaten him into marrying his sister. Later, Richard's grandmother and uncle arrive at the apartment, saving him from the wrath of the women and the brother, explaining to them that Richard is poor.

It has been released on iOS, Commodore 64, PlayStation Portable, Android, Ouya and various Flash based online gaming websites, such as Kongregate. Canabalt has been credited with popularising the endless runner subgenre.  Gameplay  Canabalt gameplay showing the minimalist graphics and lack of any on-screen controls. The player controls an unnamed man fleeing from an unknown threat. As the game begins, the player character jumps from the window of an office building onto the roof of a neighbouring building. He then proceeds to run forward automatically, continually accelerating as he moves. The only control the player has over the character is through a single button, which makes him jump; either from building to building or over obstacles. Missing a jump to another building will cause him to fall to his death, while colliding with a crate or an office chair will reduce his speed. Bombs are also occasionally dropped into the player's path, causing death if not avoided. Unlike many other platform games which have predesigned stages and can be played to completion, the landscape of Canabalt is procedurally generated and endless. The objective of the game is to achieve the highest score, measured in meters per run. Some versions of the game feature online leaderboards, allowing players to compete for ranking.  Development  In a 2013 interview with The New Yorker, developer Adam Saltsman said he had initially aimed for the game to be \\"fast, like a racing game.\\" He also explained that the player character wears a black suit so that he would stand out from the greyscale background art. The name \\"Canabalt\\" was derived from a combination of phrases used by Saltsman's young nephew. When asked about the origins of the main character, Saltsman stated \\"I used to have fantasies at my old office job of running down our long, long hallway just for fun. And to literally escape. I'd forgotten about that until months after Canabalt came out. There used to be an intro cinematic that I was designing, where the character receives an email, but it was all getting in the way of the main thing\\". Originally released in Flash on Saltsman's own web site, the game has since been ported to many platforms including iOS, Android, Steam, PlayStation Portable, Ouya and the Chrome Web Store, and is also featured on online gaming sites such as Kongregate and Newgrounds. The official Android/Ouya port is published by Kittehface Software, primarily a publisher of live wallpapers, under license from Saltsman. The PlayStation Portable version is published by Beatshapers. Reception and impact Canabalt has met with positive reviews. The iOS version holds aggregate scores of 77 out of 100 on Metacritic, based on 8 reviews, and 86% on GameRankings, also based on 8 reviews. The PSP version holds a score of 72% on GameRankings, based on 7 reviews. Bonnie Eisenman of 148Apps scored the iOS version 4 out of 5, writing \\"Canabalt is a gem that daringly mixes simple gameplay with an incredibly complex world, proving that minimalism doesn't have to equal minimal entertainment. If you're looking for a simple, quick-play game, this is one to buy.\\" TouchGen Torbjorn Kamblad also scored it 4 out of 5, arguing that the iOS version improved on the original Flash version; \\"Tighter controls, and a better overview of your surroundings make the portable version a classic.\\" TouchArcade Eli Hodapp scored it 5 out of 5, comparing the game to Doodle Jump; \\"I've probably sunk more combined hours in to Doodle Jump than any other game on my iPhone, and Canabalt has the exact same appeal. The pixel art graphics are great, the soundtrack is phenomenal, and [...] it's hard to find anything not to like about the game.\\" IGN Levi Buchanan scored the game 8 out of 10; \\"Canabalt is a wonderful twitch game that strikes the right balance between skill and luck [...] There is something really compelling in here -- a real desire to play again and again...and again.\\" Pocket Gamer Keith Andrew scored it 7 out of 10, calling it \\"a fun little ditty, beautifully presented, but one where success is as much down to luck as it is any skill. That's no doubt all the developers intended, but the sheer addictiveness of play suggests any follow-up that adds a more structure could give it a serious run for its money.\\" Slide to Play Andrew Podolsky scored it 3 out of 4, praising the game, but criticizing the $2.99 price; \\"The nearly-flawless execution of one simple idea makes the lack of a story or any other depth inconsequential, but we [...] think this game would be better priced at a dollar, especially since the original Flash game is still free to play as well.\\" Pocket Gamer Peter Willington scored the PSP version 7 out of 10. He criticized the lack on online leaderboards, but concluded that \\"Canabalt for PSP deserves a place on your memory stick. It has a hidden depth that the hardcore will appreciate immensely, and it's built in such a way that more casual gamers can dip into it quickly between games of more substance.\\" The game was listed among the best of 2009 by numerous video game websites, including Rock, Paper, Shotgun and Eurogamer. It went on to spawn a genre of \\"endless running\\" games; The New Yorker described Canabalt as \\"a video game that has sparked an entirely new genre of play for mobile phones.\\" Game designer Scott Rogers credits side- scrolling shooters like Scramble (1981) and Moon Patrol (1982) and chase-style game play in platform games like Disney's Aladdin (1994) and Crash Bandicoot (1996) as early forerunners to the genre.Swipe This!: The Guide to Great Touchscreen Game Design by Scott Rogers, Wiley and Sons, 2012 Derivative titles include Robot Unicorn Attack, which Kieron Gillen described in his \\"2010 Game of the Year\\" piece for Eurogamer, as a \\"shameless Canabalt clone.\\" Similarly, in Joystiq review of Halfbrick Studios' Jetpack Joyride, Ben Gilbert argued that \\"Doom is to Halo, as Canabalt is to Jetpack Joyride.\\" In May 2011, Lewis Denby of PC Gamer placed it at #13 in his list of \\"20 free PC games you must play.\\" In November 2012, Canabalt was included the permanent collection of video games at the Museum of Modern Art.  Legacy  The source code of Canabalt was released by Saltsman in 2010. The engine specific code was released under an MIT License and the game code under a proprietary license. One year later, Saltsman concluded that commercially, this had proved a non-harmful step. In 2011, Canabalt was ported to the Commodore 64 home computer by Paul Koller. This official conversion became available as a cartridge in January 2012. In March 2012, Canabalt was included in the Humble Bundle for Android 2.

Background =NBC's first attempt (1954)= NBC's first run broadcasting Canadian football involved coverage of a collection of Big Four/IRFU (the predecessor to the CFL's East Division) games and the Grey Cup in 1954. NBC's coverage during this period (simulcasting the Canadian national broadcaster) provided far more coverage than the NFL's existing contract with DuMont. NBC aired games on Saturday afternoons, competing against college football broadcasts on CBS and ABC (at the time, college football telecasts were far more restricted than are today). The revenue from the contract allowed the IRFU to directly compete against the NFL for players during the 1950s; the American viewership arguably prompted the league to finally raise the point value of touchdowns from 5 points to 6, as it has been in the American game since 1912, in 1956, and to play some exhibition and regular season games in the United States beginning in 1957. Interest in the CFL in the United States faded dramatically after the debut of the American Football League in 1960. Between 1955 and 1980, only one game was televised on U.S. television, the 1962 Grey Cup (which was broadcast by ABC). =1982 experimentation= NBC (with the exception of its northernmost affiliates that were located close to the Canadian border) broadcast games in the CFL for three weeks during the 1982 NFL players' strike The first week of broadcasts featured the NFL on NBC broadcast teams, before a series of blowout games on the network and the resulting low ratings resulted in NBC cutting back and eventually cancelling its CFL coverage. (At the time, ESPN held the U.S. broadcast rights, who sublicensed them to NBC during the strike; rights reverted to ESPN after the experiment failed.) The announcers who called the games for NBC are in parentheses. *Sept 26 **British Columbia 46 @ Toronto 14 (Don Criqui and John Brodie) **Calgary 17 @ Edmonton 36 (Dick Enberg and Merlin Olsen) *Oct 3 **Calgary 8 @ Saskatchewan 53 (Don Criqui, John Brodie, and Bob Trumpy) **Winnipeg @ Edmonton (Charlie Jones and Len Dawson) *Oct 10 **British Columbia 1 @ Edmonton 30 (Charlie Jones, Merlin Olsen, and Mike Haffner) There were blackouts of the CFL games. The blackouts weren't exactly because of not selling out the stadiums, but for being too close to Canada. For instance NBC's affiliate in Syracuse did not get these games. Their TV listings showed these CFL games on CKWS 11 (CBC Kingston, Ontario), while NBC (WSTM 3) listed “NFL Football New England at Buffalo (if strike settled) or movie” for Sunday, October 3. A game between featuring the Edmonton Eskimos at the Winnipeg Blue Bombers was tentatively scheduled for 1:30 p.m. Eastern Time on Sunday October 17, even making newspaper TV listings. At the last moment NBC cancelled the broadcast. The network was worried that the game would run over its allotted time and conflict with Game 5 of the 1982 World Series, which was supposed to begin at 4:30. NBC did not resume CFL broadcasts afterwards. As previously mentioned, the games it showed had mostly been blowouts and the network even ended its October 3, 1982 broadcast \\"Heidi Game\\" style before the game ended in order to not delay prime time programming. =Interim American coverage (1983-2011)= In 2008, when NBCSN was known as Versus and not yet under the same corporate umbrella as NBC, it aired the 96th Grey Cup. The Canadian Football League entered into a much more generous contract with the America One television network that had run from 2001 through 2009. That contract allowed for the majority of CFL games to be televised in the United States, with America One syndicating the Canadian coverage (from TSN or, prior to 2008, CBC) primarily to regional sports networks. A number of factors led to America One not renewing their contract after the 2009 season. On July 1, 2010, NFL Network began airing live Canadian Football League games, again simulcasting TSN. This much more limited package did not include any games in August (during the NFL preseason), any playoff games, the Labour Day Classic (one of the Labour Day games was carried in 2011 but not the other), Thanksgiving Day Classic, or the Grey Cup. NFL Network aired Thursday games, three Saturday games in July, and then Friday night games beginning again in September (after ArenaBowl XXIII; NFL Network also held rights to the Arena Football League and aired a weekly game on Friday nights).NFL Network Going Canadian - CFL games begin airing on network July 1 Broadcasting & Cable July 1, 2010CFL to air on NFL Network CFL Official Site June 30, 2010 NFL Network announced it would not renew its deal with the CFL on May 25, 2012.McMillan, Ken (May 25, 2012). No CFL on NFLN, eh?. HudsonValley.com. Retrieved June 14, 2012. =NBCSN's coverage (2012-2013)= The package was picked up by NBCSN starting on Monday August 27, 2012 with 14 games total broadcast on NBC Sports Network including 9 regular season games (including both Labour Day Classic games) and 100th Grey Cup Game to air live in US on NBC Sports Network . all of the playoffs and Grey Cup. NBC renewed its deal with the CFL shortly before the 2013 regular season, but the deal scaled back the network's playoff coverage (the network will not air the first round games and will only air the conference finals on tape delay). The 2013 U.S. TV schedule featured 11 regular season games live (including the lone Labour Day Classic contest), three tape-delayed contests in October (including the displaced Toronto-Hamilton Thanksgiving Day Classic, which will air at midnight the Wednesday after), and the Grey Cup live. In an oddity, NBCSN only owned the traditional television rights to the league, while another network owned the Internet rights; ESPN3 has carried CFL games on the Internet since 2008. (ESPN Inc., ESPN3's parent company, holds a minority stake in TSN.) The CFL granted exclusive broadcast and Internet rights to ESPN in a multinational, five-year deal prior to the 2014 season, ending NBCSN's involvement with the league until at least 2019.

Plot  When a recently deceased playboy, Max, gets to heaven, he is granted a wish. His request: to watch his three best friends, with whom he regularly played poker, for the next 24 hours. That day, each man would receive a letter; tomorrow, Max's will is to be read. Each letter states that he had an affair with that man's wife, all of with whom he was close. With one, Max attended Friday symphony matinees and had tea afterwards; with another, he went to night clubs and taught French; the last, he repeatedly hired as his nurse through his long battle with heart disease. Each husband reacts differently, as does each wife when she discovers that something has happened to make her husband distrust her. At the end of the 24 hours, each couple declares their intention to divorce, mistrust and disbelief having split each relationship. The lawyer reads the will, stating that Max's great fortune has been left to the three wives, as he believes that marriage is stronger when a wife is not dependent on her husband. It states in his will that Max wrote the letters to show each of his friends how much his wife was worth, as each had begun to take her for granted; he believed that jealousy was the perfect motivator to make someone re-appreciate something/someone. Each wife reiterates her intention to divorce; each husband apologizes and begs her to reconsider. The three couples all reconcile, everyone grateful for having had Max and for his final gift to them - each other.
