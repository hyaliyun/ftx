The house is now a four star country house hotel and golf resort. It is located south of Gatehouse of Fleet. History Cally House was commissioned by James Murray of Broughton, a grandson of the 5th Earl of Galloway and of the 9th Earl of Eglinton. Murray inherited the land on the death, in 1751, of his father, who had consulted William Adam about a new house at Cally in the 1740s, although nothing had then been done. While travelling in Rome in the mid-1750s, James Murray met the young architect Robert Mylne, who prepared the first plans while still abroad.Ward, Robert (2007) The Man Who Buried Nelson: The Surprising Life of Robert Mylne. London: Tempus. . p.86 The building was complete by 1763, and over of grounds were laid out with orchards and pleasure gardens, as well as hothouses and deer parks. Murray later served as MP for the constituency of Wigtownshire from 1762 to 1768, as well as serving as Receiver General for Scotland in 1783. His grandson, Alexander Murray, made alterations to the house, including the portico by John Buonarotti Papworth. Further alterations were made in the 1850s, and the grounds were landscaped by William Dewar. In the later 19th century and early 20th century, the house was let out, and the last tenant was the Maharaja of Jind who lived there between 1930 and 1932. Elizabeth Murray Usher, who inherited Cally in 1924, sold the house and grounds to the Forestry Commission in 1933. The house and was sold on and converted into a hotel, which opened in 1934. It was used as a residential school for evacuees from Glasgow during the Second World War, reopening in the later 1940s. The hotel has been owned by Trust House Forte and North West Hotels Ltd, and is now part of the McMillan Hotels group. The Forestry Commission planted around of the estate.

It was launched in 1940 by German expatriate stage director Erwin Piscator. Among the faculty were Lee Strasberg and Stella Adler, among the students Robert De Niro, Marlon Brando, Tony Curtis, Walter Matthau, Tennessee Williams and Elaine Stritch. The Dramatic Workshop considerably contributed to the resurgence of the Off- Broadway theatre.Peter Bauland: The hooded eagle: modern German drama on the New York stage. Syracuse, NY: Syracuse University Press 1968, p. 146.  History  In the spring of 1939, Alvin Johnson, the president of the New School for Social Research in New York City, signed an agreement with German expatriate stage director Erwin Piscator to found a drama and acting school at The New School. The ‚ÄúDramatic Workshop‚Äù started its operations in January 1940 with some 20 students. In September 1940 the Workshop began to launch semi- professional theatre productions within the ‚ÄúStudio Theatre‚Äù (i.e. the Tishman Auditorium) at 66 West 12th Street. In 1944 the Dramatic Workshop began to hold annual summer theatres at summer resort towns such as Sayville and Lake Placid. After the end of World War II, the G. I. Bill led to a massive student increase at the Dramatic Workshop, \\"momentarily making it one of the largest dramatic schools in the country.\\"Peter M. Rutkoff: Politics on Stage. Piscator and the Dramatic Workshop. In: Peter M. Rutkoff, William B. Scott: New School: a History of the New School for Social Research. New York: Macmillan 1986, p. 190. Since the Studio Theatre had to be closed in 1944, Piscator successively started to transfer the student productions to the ‚ÄúPresident Theatre‚Äù at 247 West 48th Street and the ‚ÄúRooftop Theatre‚Äù at 111 East Houston Street in 1946. In June 1949 the Workshop was separated from The New School. With Erwin Piscator's return to West-Germany in October 1951 his wife Maria Ley-Piscator took over the school's management.

The Dramatic Workshop's faculty included Stella Adler, Theresa Helburn, and Lee Strasberg all of whom taught different acting approaches such as Stanislavski's ‚Äúmethod acting‚Äù and Piscator's ‚Äúobjective acting‚Äù.

Published in 1797, it relates an anonymous Occitan tale dating back to at least the 13th century. Count Peter of Provence leaves home in search of the reputedly beautiful Magelone, daughter of the King of Naples. He meets her, they fall in love, and they elope. But the two are separated by ill fortune and Peter becomes infatuated with a Muslim woman, Sulima. Peter and Magelone are eventually reunited and live happily ever after. The tale was expressed in print in French in 1453 (Pierre de Provence et la belle Maguelone) and in German in 1535 (Die Sch√∂n Magelona [sic]). The latter, which served as Tieck‚Äôs immediate source, resulted from a 1527 translation by Veit Warbeck issued after Warbeck‚Äôs death as a chapbook, or Volksbuch. Tieck‚Äôs narrative appeared in a three-volume collection of tales and dramas: Volksm√§rchen herausgegeben von Peter Lebrecht (Folk-Tales edited by Peter Lebrecht). In 1802 and 1803, Tieck worked on a drama based on the tale but completed only a short prologue in verse. Later, in 1811, Die sch√∂ne Magelone also appeared as a tale in his Phantasus. Furthermore sixteen of the eighteen poems were published separately as a lyric cycle, Des J√ºnglings Liebe (Of the Young Man‚Äôs Love). Between 1861 and 1869 Johannes Brahms set to music fifteen of Tieck‚Äôs eighteen poems, scoring them for voice with piano accompaniment. These were published as the composer‚Äôs Opus 33 in five volumes of three songs each in 1865 and 1869: Romanzen aus L. Tieck‚Äôs Magelone f√ºr eine Singstimme mit Pianoforte [sic].

Educated at Eton college, in 1801 he entered the diplomatic service, serving it in Vienna, St Petersburg, French occupied Spain, and Portugal. It was as ambassador in Spain that he became indispensable to the Duke of Wellington, and accompanied him during Napoleon's Hundred Days through to the Battle of Waterloo.

They had two daughters Charlotte (later Lady Canning), and Louisa (later Lady Waterford). His greatest achievement was the treaty which enabled Brazil to become independent of Portugal in 1825. In 1828 he was made Baron Stuart de Rothesay, and in the same year was appointed for a second term as ambassador to France. The Grand'Maison at les Andelys, Normandy, by John Sell Cotman Early retirement from the diplomatic service meant Lord Stuart could start on the project to build a new family home, and by 1830 he had purchased much of the eastern end of the estate, which previously had been owned by his forebears. This allowed him to start construction of the modern Highcliffe Castle. William Donthorne, a founder member of the Royal Institute of British Architects designed Highcliffe Castle. The castle is built on an L shaped plan, oriented on a south-east axis, so the oriel window is central on the south east elevation, providing a vista across the landscaped gardens to a panorama of The Needles and the Isle of Wight. Used in the building of the house was carved medieval stonework from the Norman Benedictine Abbey of St Peter at Jumieges and from the Grand' Maison of Radeval, at les Andelys. Both of these buildings had fallen into disrepair after the French Revolution. Also included in the castle, were a 16th-century oriel window and a stained glass window. After the Castle was completed, Charles became Ambassador to Russia in 1841. However ill-health caused his return to England and he died at Highcliffe in 1845. He was buried at St Mark's Church, Highcliffe and his memorial can still be seen there. =Louisa, Marchioness of Waterford: 1845‚Äì1891= Louisa, Marchioness of Waterford, 1870 After Charles's death, his widow Lady Stuart de Rothesay inherited the castle. She died in 1867 and left the property to Louisa her younger daughter as Charlotte, the elder daughter, had predeceased her. Louisa had been born in 1818 in Paris. The family moved into Highcliffe Castle in 1834 and lived there and also in their London residence. Louisa wrote some of her memories of her life at Highcliffe Castle which were recorded in a book by Hare. In 1842 Louisa married Henry, Marquis of Waterford and became the Marchioness of Waterford. The couple lived at Curraghmore, County Waterford for many years, and during this time Louisa became an accomplished painter whose work is still valued today. Her husband died in 1859 and she moved to the estate left to her in Ford in Northumberland. It was here that she built a school hall and on the walls painted Biblical scenes. These paintings survive today in what is now called Lady Waterford Hall in Ford. In 1867 her mother died and she inherited Highcliffe Castle. She spent the summers at Highcliffe and returned to Ford Castle in the winter. She had many visitors at the castle one of whom was Augustus Hare, a fellow painter. He recounts a typical day at Highcliffe Castle. :‚ÄúThe late breakfast in the pleasant room which looks across the sunlit sea to the Isle of Wight through the leaves of large magnolia trees was always a happy meeting, at which Lady Waterford brimmed over with the anecdotes and reminiscences evoked by her morning letters. Immediately afterwards she would read aloud from the newspapers in the porch-room, then she went to write in her own room, and her guests dispersed till she summoned them back by playing and singing loudly with wide-open windows. Then all adjourned to the library, where one of the party read aloud, whilst Lady Waterford painted. After luncheon there was a walk, generally on the sands, often to the Haven House and its wild fir wood.\\". She entertained the Prince and Princess of Wales (later King Edward and Queen Alexandra) at Highcliffe Castle. In 1880 she recounts one of their visits. :\\"I have had a great surprise in the unexpected visit of the Prince and Princess of Wales, with their two sons and the three little Princesses, landing on the beach, coming up to tea, and drawing nets on the shore till evening ‚Äî the young Princes swimming about in flannels, and finally the Prince and two sons swimming away to join the steam-tug.\\" A picture of the royal family at around the same time as this visit is shown on the left. In 1891 Lady Waterford died and as she had no children she left Highcliffe Castle to a very distant cousin Edward Stuart Wortley. =Edward Stuart Wortley: 1891‚Äì1950= Major General Edward Stuart Wortley Edward James Stuart Wortley was born in 1857. He was the second son of the Hon Francis Dudley Montagu Stuart Wortley and Maria Elizabeth Martin. He was educated at Eton in 1886 and afterwards joined the Army. In 1877 he entered the Kings Royal Rifle Corps. He distinguished himself in the First Boer War in the 1880s and in other African Battles until 1900. In 1901 he became Military Attache in Paris which he held for three years before returning to England. In 1907 Kaiser Wilhelm II stayed at Highcliffe Castle for three weeks to recover his health. This visit was widely publicised. While he was there, the Kaiser presented two stained glass windows to Stuart Wortley which were inserted in one of the rooms. In the following year he was invited to be guest of honour to the German Army manoeuvres held in Alsace. He was promoted to Major General in 1913. He served in the First World War but his Division did not greatly distinguish itself and he was sent to Ireland to help quell the rebellion there. He retired from the Army in 1919 and died in 1934. His wife Violet Stuart Wortley (n√©e Guthrie) was the longest resident of Highcliffe Castle. She was born in 1866 and married Edward in 1891, the same year that he inherited the Castle from Lady Waterford. The couple had three children Nicholas, Louisa and Elizabeth. Unfortunately Nicholas died in 1926 at the age of 34. Violet wrote many books, most notably the history of the Stuart family called ‚ÄúHighcliffe and the Stuarts. Towards the end of her life she wrote an autobiography called ‚ÄúLife Without Theory‚Äù which outlined her early life. She sold Highcliffe Castle in 1949 and died four years later in 1953. =Harry Gordon Selfridge: 1916‚Äì1922= Harry Gordon Selfridge, circa 1900 During the time that the Stuart Wortleys owned the Castle it was rented several times. One of the most notable tenants from 1916 to 1922 was the American-born retail entrepreneur Harry Gordon Selfridge. He lived there with his wife Rosalie, his mother Lois and son Gordon. At the age of 21, Wisconsin- born Selfridge joined the wholesale retail firm of Marshall, Field and Co in Chicago, where he worked for 25 years. He rose to become a junior partner, and amassed a considerable fortune. In 1906 he came to London and opened his own store, Selfridges, in 1909. It was a huge success as he introduced new American ways of marketing. In 1916 Selfridge leased Highcliffe Castle. Although he was only a tenant he set about fitting modern bathrooms, installing steam central heating and building and equipping a modern kitchen. During the War Rose opened a tented retreat called the Mrs Gordon Selfridge Convalescent Camp for American Soldiers in the castle grounds. Unfortunately Rose died in 1918 and Harry's mother Lois died in 1924. Harry did not do well after this and squandered his money, giving up the lease to Highcliffe in 1922. He died almost penniless in 1947 in Putney, and is buried in St Marks Churchyard at Highcliffe next to his wife and mother. =1950s onwards: decline= Early in 1950 local businessman J.H.Leonard Lloyd bought it from the Stuart Wortley family to turn into a large children's convalescent home. Having already founded and run a successful similar home near Lynton in North Devon, he charged four guineas a week. Unfortunately later on unfounded media allegations of the indecent assault of children led to a subsequent court case, which although dismissed resulted in the home's closure. Put on the market for ¬£45,000, it was bought by a developer, who created Rothesay Drive on the estate lands on which he built new private homes. He then sold on the castle and residual gardens for ¬£14,000 to the Roman Catholic Claretian Missionary, who wanted to develop a training centre for student priests. The chapel was in the great hall, flanked by two staircases. A dormitory was built next to the East Wing which now houses the Castle's tearooms. Latterly used as a seminary, with rising maintenance costs the Claretians moved out in 1966. =Fires, dereliction= Bought for ¬£21,000 in 1967 by three local businessmen, a fire just before this badly damaged the Great Hall, and another fire the following year caused more devastation, the staircase having to be removed. Blocked from any form of development or demolition, resultantly exposed to the weather and vandals, the Castle deteriorated into a ruin. National concern about its fate was voiced by local people, English Heritage, the Ancient Monuments Society, the Victorian Society, the Buildings at Risk Trust, SAVE Britain's Heritage, as well as prominent architectural historians. =Restoration: 1977‚Äì1998= After a long series of legal redevelopment disputes with the businessmen, in 1977 Christchurch Council compulsorily purchased the Castle for ¬£65,000 ‚Äì its valuation set by a Land Tribunal undertaken by the Adjudicator to HM Land Registry ‚Äì and opened the grounds and beach access to the public to mark the Queen's Silver Jubilee. Unable to afford the projected cost of restoration, in 1986 the Council offered the building on a 125-year lease for it to be restored for residential or hotel use within three acres of land for enabling development, but although several schemes were submitted none materialised. In 1989 the Council and English Heritage jointly commissioned Niall Phillips Architects of Bristol to consider what future the Castle might have. In 1990 a shroud of scaffolding and sheeting was put around it to protect it, and in 1994 a start was made on a phased scheme to repair and conserve the building, funded initially by Christchurch Council and English Heritage. The first phase repaired the Castle's south wing, including the Wintergarden, Drawing Room and Library. On its completion, the Heritage Lottery Fund agreed to fund the Council's ¬£2.6million bid, enabling all major repairs to be completed by 1998, including the rebuilding of the East Tower which had been demolished in 1974 when it became unsafe. Craftsmen and women from Dorchester-based St Blaise Ltd won a prestigious Stone Federation award for their work on the Castle, with the judges describing it as ‚Äúa textbook example of great care and skill‚Äù. Present day Highcliffe Castle is a Grade I listed building now owned by Christchurch Council, and described as \\"the most important remaining example of the Romantic and Picturesque style of architecture.‚Äù It holds events, is open to the general public throughout the year and can be used for weddings and other private events. In 2008, Dorset construction company Greendale Construction Limited carried out major refurbishment works as part of the sixth phase of a substantial repair, renovation and development programme for the castle. This was the first significant change made to the building in the last decade. As a result of the restoration work, an estimated 55,000 visitors will now be able to access parts of Highcliffe Castle that were previously not open to the public, including the state dining room, butler‚Äôs pantry and the East Tower. The project also completed improvements to the Great Hall, food preparation area and bar, as well as constructing new public toilets in the basement and upgrading the external car park. Following the success of Phase 6, in 2018 Greendale Construction Limited carried out yet another major 18-month renovation and restoration of Highcliffe Castle‚Äôs Penleaze Wing. This more recent work has opened up parts of the castle previously impassable for over 50 years, since devastating fires and vandalism of the 1970s that destroyed and cut off parts of the building. The works have also seen the extension of upper level stairs with timber and the formation of 2 new lift shafts and 5 new or restored stairs. A mezzanine level walkway has been completed, and new steel stairs extending to the first and second floor.

There are various selection theorems, and they are important in the theories of differential inclusions, optimal control, and mathematical economics.  Preliminaries  Given two sets X and Y, let F be a multivalued map from X and Y. Equivalently, F:X\\\\rightarrow\\\\mathcal{P}(Y)is a function from X to the power set of Y. A function f: X \\\\rightarrow Y is said to be a selection of F, if : \\\\forall x \\\\in X: \\\\,\\\\,\\\\, f(x) \\\\in F(x) \\\\,. In other words, given an input x for which the original function F returns multiple values, the new function f returns a single value. This is a special case of a choice function. The axiom of choice implies that a selection function always exists; however, it is often important that the selection have some \\"nice\\" properties, such be continuous or measurable. This is where the selection theorems come into action: they guarantee that, if F satisfies certain properties, then it has a selection f that is continuous or has other desirable properties.  Selection theorems for set-valued functions  1\\\\. The Michael selection theorem says that the following conditions are sufficient for the existence of a continuous selection: * X is a paracompact space; * Y is a Banach space; * F is lower hemicontinuous; *For all x in X, the set F(x) is nonempty, convex and closed. 2\\\\. The Deutsch‚ÄìKenderov theorem generalizes Michael's theorem as follows: *X is a paracompact space; *Y is a normed vector space; *F is almost lower hemicontinuous, that is, at each x \\\\in X, for each neighborhood V of 0 there exists a neighborhood U of x such that \\\\cap_{u\\\\in U} \\\\\\\\{F(u)+V\\\\\\\\} e \\\\emptyset. *For all x in X, the set F(x) is nonempty and convex. These conditions guarantee that F has continuous approximate selection, that is, for each neighborhood V of 0 in Y there is a continuous function f \\\\colon X \\\\mapsto Y such that for each x \\\\in X, f (x) \\\\in F (X) + V. In a later note, Xu proved that Deutsch‚ÄìKenderov theorem is also valid if Y is a locally convex topological vector space. 3\\\\. The Yannelis- Prabhakar selection theorem says that the following conditions are sufficient for the existence of a continuous selection: *X is a paracompact Hausdorff space; *Y is a linear topological space; *For all x in X, the set F(x) is nonempty and convex. *For all y in Y, the inverse set F‚àí1(y) is an open set in X. 4\\\\. The Kuratowski and Ryll-Nardzewski measurable selection theorem says that the following conditions are sufficient for the existence of a measurable selection: * X is a Polish space and \\\\mathcal B(X) its Borel œÉ-algebra; * Cl(X) is the set of nonempty closed subsets of X. * (\\\\Omega, \\\\mathcal B) a measurable space, and F : \\\\Omega \\\\to Cl(X) a B-weakly measurable map (that is, for every open subset U \\\\subseteq X we have \\\\\\\\{\\\\omega \\\\in \\\\Omega : F(\\\\omega) \\\\cap U eq \\\\empty \\\\\\\\} \\\\in B ). Then F has a selection that is B-\\\\mathcal B(X)-measurable.V. I. Bogachev, \\"Measure Theory\\" Volume II, page 36.

Clarence rashly charged into the Scottish ranks. He and his knights were soon surrounded. During the battle Sir John Carmichael of Douglasdale broke his lance unhorsing the Duke of Clarence. Once on the ground, the Duke was slain by Sir Alexander, apparently with a mace. In other versions of the incident, Sir Alexander kills the Duke by piercing him with a lance.Smibert, Thomas, The clans of the Highlands of Scotland: an account of their annals, with delineations of their tartans, and family arms, 1850, p.38 Sir Alexander held the prince's coronet aloft on his lance, bringing such dismay to the English that the battle was lost to them. In recognition of this the Clan Buchanan coat of arms to this day depicts a ducal coronet being held up in triumph.

He previously lived in Canada training at the Can-Am Wrestling School under Scott D'Amore, working regularly for the Maximum Pro Wrestling promotion. He is currently signed to Wrestle-1. Professional wrestling career =MUGA (2007)= Soya debuted in MUGA as Osamu Nishimura's pupil, losing to Katsushi Takemura on April 11. Over the next few days however Soya reached a five-minute draw with Yutaka Yoshie, Katsushi Takemura, and Nobuyuki Kurashima to show that he was more than just your average rookie. On July 1 Soya got a match against Tatsumi Fujinami himself, but Fujinami would have little trouble putting him away. In October Soya and Nishimura would leave MUGA for All Japan Pro Wrestling, and Soya would join the other All Japan dojo mates (such as T28 and Seiya Sanada) to help form a very strong group of young wrestlers. =All Japan Pro Wrestling (2007-2014)= Soya teamed with Sanada for much of the year in the mid-card, as they gained valuable experience wrestling against the Voodoo Murders. He did not take part in any of the tournaments, but he showed that perhaps he is the head of his class when he defeated Sanada convincingly at the November Sumo Hall event. In the World's Strongest Tag Determination League he teamed with Sanada, but the pair would come in last place. After starting the year continuing with his mentor Nishimura, things didn't stay that way as Soya switched over to team with Nishimura's old nemesis Riki Choshu. Starting the year Nishimura and Soya wrestled together in the mid-card, but unlike Sanada he did not take part in the Champion Carnival. After teaming with Nishimura at Sumo Hall and losing to Choshu and Koshinaka, soon thereafter Soya decided he had enough of MUGA and switched to Choshu-ism. After teaming off and on during the fall (whenever Choshu was in All Japan), the pair teamed in the World's Strongest Tag Determination League, and they did very well as they came in 4th place including a big win over All Asia Tag Team Champions Akebono and Ryota Hama. Near the end of the year, Soya left Japan to train under Scott D'Amore at the Can-Am Wrestling School. He also began appearing on Ontario independent shows. In Canada for the beginning of 2010, Soya has become a regular of the independent circuit in Ontario, most notably Maximum Pro Wrestling. After returning to Japan, Soya teamed up with Seiya Sanada and on August 29, 2010, they defeated the Voodoo Murders (Big Daddy Voodoo and TARU) to win the All Asia Tag Team Championship for the first time. They would lose the title to Daisuke Sekimoto and Yuji Okabayashi on March 21, 2011. In late 2011 to early 2012 Manabu Soya and All Japan veteran Takao Omori formed the team \\"GET WILD\\". On March 20, 2012, Soya and Omori defeated Dark Cuervo and Dark Ozz to win the World Tag Team Championship. After losing the title to Joe Doering and Seiya Sanada on May 20, Soya and Omori regained the title on June 17. They vacated the title on October 30, in time for the 2012 World's Strongest Tag Determination League. They then won Block A defeating the team of Turmeric Storm (Tomoaki Honma and Kazushi Miyamoto). They got to the finals defeating Last Revolution (Joe Doering and Suwama) to win 2012's World Strongest Tag Determination League and to become the 64th generation World Tag Team Champions. On December 11, Soya unsuccessfully challenged Masakatsu Funaki for the Triple Crown Heavyweight Championship. As a result, Get Wild was forced to disband, despite still holding the World Tag Team Championship. Get Wild went on to lose the title to Burning (Go Shiozaki and Jun Akiyama) on March 17, 2013. Following the loss, Soya was sidelined with a cervical hernia and an oculomotor nerve palsy. Soya underwent eye surgery on May 29 and shoulder surgery on June 12. While still sidelined from in-ring action, Soya held a press conference on December 27, 2013, to announce his resignation from All Japan. =Wrestle-1 (2014-2020)= On January 12, 2014, Soya made his debut for Keiji Mutoh's All Japan splinter promotion Wrestle-1, in an on-screen matchmaker role. Soya was portrayed as a biased authority figure, favoring former tag team partner Seiya Sanada. On February 15, Soya made a surprise in- ring return for a twenty-man battle royal, helping Sanada win the match to become the number one contender to the TNA X Division Championship. Soya wrestled his official return match at a Wrestle-1 event on February 21, losing to Masayuki Kono. On May 4, Soya was defeated by Kai in a grudge match and, as a result, lost his job as the matchmaker of Wrestle-1. On August 8, Wrestle-1 announced Soya had signed with the promotion, ending his days as a freelancer. On September 22, Soya entered the Wrestle-1 Championship tournament, but was defeated in his first round match by Kai. In mid-2014, Soya entered a storyline, where he began accusing Akira of being a spy for the villainous Desperado stable. However, on November 1, after it had been revealed that Soya had been wrong and Tajiri had been the spy, Soya and Akira formed a new version of Get Wild, later named \\"new Wild order\\". Later that same month, new Wild order took part in the First Tag League Greatest tournament, set to determine the inaugural Wrestle-1 Tag Team Champions, where they finished second in their block with a record of two wins, one draw and one loss, advancing to the semifinals. On November 30, new Wild order defeated Masayuki Kono and Tajiri to advance to the finals of the tournament, where, later that same day, they were defeated by Kaz Hayashi and Shuji Kondo. Following the tournament, Wrestle-1 quickly set up a rematch between the two finalist teams, but Soya and Akira were again defeated in the title rematch on December 7. On January 30, 2015, Soya received his first shot at the Wrestle-1 Championship, but was defeated by the defending champion, Keiji Mutoh. On April 1, new Wild order received another shot at the Wrestle-1 Tag Team Championship, but were for the third time defeated by Hayashi and Kondo. Following the loss, Soya and Akira announced they were looking for new members to join new Wild order. This led to an evaluation match on June 18, after which Jun Kasai and rookie Kumagoro were accepted as the third and fourth members of new Wild order, turning it from a tag team into a stable. On July 12, Soya and Kasai defeated Hayashi and Kondo to win the Wrestle-1 Tag Team Championship. On August 30, Soya defeated Shuji Kondo in the finals to win the 2015 Wrestle-1 Grand Prix. On September 21, Soya defeated Kai to win the Wrestle-1 Championship. On November 27, Soya and Kasai lost the Wrestle-1 Tag Team Championship to Masayuki Kono and Shuji Kondo. On January 10, 2016, Soya lost the Wrestle-1 Championship to Yuji Hino. On July 1, Soya won his second Wrestle-1 Grand Prix in a row, defeating Hino in the finals. On July 29, Soya and Kasai won the Wrestle-1 Tag Team Championship for the second time. After Soya had been sidelined with a shoulder injury, he and Kasai were stripped of the title on August 20. On December 18, the reunited Get Wild defeated Jake Lee and Kento Miyahara in the finals to win All Japan's 2016 World's Strongest Tag Determination League.

She became a public speaker and wrote pamphlets on issues related to socialism, feminism and worker's rights. After becoming concerned with the rights of female mill workers at an early age, Ford became involved with trade union organisation in the 1880s. A member of the National Administrative Council of the Independent Labour Party, she was the first woman to speak at a Labour Representation Committee (which became the British Labour Party) conference. Biography Isabella Ford was born 23 May 1855 in Headingley, Leeds, in the north of England. She was the youngest of eight children of Quakers Robert Lawson Ford and Hannah (n√©e Pease). Her mother was a cousin of abolitionist Elizabeth Pease Nichol. Her father was a solicitor who ran a local night-school for mill-girls. Contact with these girls gave Ford and her sisters an insight into class differences and an interest in working conditions. When she was 16, she began teaching at her father's school. In the 1880s, Ford became involved with trade unions. She worked with tailoresses who were campaigning for better working conditions; she helped them to form a trade union and was involved when they went on strike in 1889. In 1890‚Äì91, she marched with workers from Manningham Mills in Bradford. As a result of her involvement, she was elected a life member of the Leeds Trades and Labour Council. She helped found the Leeds Independent Labour Party (ILP) and was president of the Leeds Tailoresses' Union. Her concerns were trade union organisation, socialism and female suffrage. She overcame a natural shyness to become an experienced public speaker, speaking at many meetings related to socialism, workers' rights and women's emancipation. She wrote many pamphlets, as well as a column in the Leeds Forward. In 1895 she was elected parish councillor for Adel cum Eccup in Leeds. In the 1900s, Ford increased her focus on her work for the ILP, and was elected to the national administrative council. She became more involved in the national women's suffrage movement, but felt that feminism and the labour movement were equally important. In 1903 she spoke at the annual conference of the Labour Representation Committee (later the British Labour Party), and was the first woman to do so. Following a 1904 debate with future politician Margaret Bondfield, Sylvia Pankhurst described Ford as \\"a plain, middle-aged woman, with red face and turban hat crushed down upon her straight hair, whose nature yet seemed to me ... kindlier and more profound than that of her younger antagonist\\". =Personal life= Ford formed friendships with Labour politician Philip Snowden, socialist writer Edward Carpenter, poet Walt Whitman, Josephine Butler, Millicent Fawcett and Olive Schreiner. She lived most of her adult life with her sisters Bessie and Emily in Adel Grange, the Leeds home that the family moved to when she was 10. Bessie Ford died in 1919 and her sisters moved to a smaller property called Adel Willows in 1922. Isabella Ford died 14 July 1924. Posthumous recognition Adel Grange Home of Isabella Ford Ford's name and image, and those of 58 other women's suffrage supporters, are etched on the plinth of the statue of Millicent Fawcett in Parliament Square, London that was unveiled in 2018.

She was elected to the position at ICN's May 2013 quadrennial congress in Melbourne, Australia. The term of the presidency is 2013-2017. Shamian is also the former president and CEO of the Victorian Order of Nurses (VON) and past president of the Canadian Nurses Association (CNA). She is also a professor at the Lawrence S. Bloomberg Faculty of Nursing at the University of Toronto, a co-investigator with the Nursing Health Services Research Unit, and was the Executive Director of the Canadian federal government's Office of Nursing Policy for five years. In addition to her extensive international work, she was vice president of Nursing at Mount Sinai Hospital in Toronto for 10 years and has held various academic positions since 1989. Shamian has published and spoken extensively nationally and internationally on a wide range of topics. Government departments and agencies and academic bodies, including the World Health Organization (WHO), often call on her to speak and consult on many issues surrounding nursing, health human resources, leadership, and health-care policy.  Campaign for presidency of the International Council of Nurses  Shamian's campaign to become ICN president focused on uniting nursing, health-care and other groups to ensure nurses are able to turn their \\"expertise, experience and credibility into tangible policy action on the ground for the benefit of humanity.\\" She said her \\"top priority as ICN president would be supporting outreach activities that multiply opportunities for nurses to connect, building mutual understanding and trust.\\" Shamian's \\"vision\\" for ICN is to maximize the organization's ability to empower nurses and nursing organizations to influence nursing and health agendas globally. She has a three-point plan to achieve this: * Focus on health-care solutions. Optimizing the use of evidence and expertise is essential to convince governments and others to improve health-care policy. * Ensure nursing speaks with one voice on key issues. When professional associations, unions and regulatory bodies present clear messages, they cannot be ignored. * Listen and work with nursing organizations and nurses around the world. ICN's greatest resources are individual nurses and nursing organizations. Together, we can make ICN and its member organizations the best they can be.  International work  Shamian has worked extensively with national and international partners to strengthen health policy. In the 1980s, she worked in Botswana on an International Development Research Centre-funded research project ‚Äì the first nursing research project in the country. The University of Botswana now has numerous PhD-prepared faculty members and offers graduate education. Later, she established the first World Health Organization Collaborating Centre for Leadership Development in a hospital environment, which brought together nurse executives from the Caribbean, Israel, Eastern Europe and Africa to learn more about their role in leading a facility's nursing services. Shamian has also been a consultant on nursing projects in Israel, China, Barbados, the British Virgin Islands, Hungary and the United States; one of her major accomplishments was helping Polish nurses establish their national nursing association. She has also contributed to many expert panels, including several for the World Health Organization: the Expert Advisory Panel on Nursing, the Nursing Advisory Group, and the Global Advisory Committee on Nursing and Midwifery. Shamian served as a Commissioner at the UN High Commission on Health Employment and Economic Growth during 2016.  Canadian work  As the president and CEO of VON Canada, Shamian guided the organization through a time of transition and transformation. She created a reorganized structure to ensure VON would continue to be Canada's largest, not-for-profit, charitable home and community care provider. Shamian stepped down as CEO in December 2012 and was replaced by Chief Operating Officer John Gallinger. Shamian was the president of CNA from 2010-2012. Some of the major initiatives she led include ensuring that nursing's voice was heard as Canada renewed its 10-year health accord. Shamian also led CNA on a national tour to hear first-hand the concerns of nurses, and she oversaw CNA's National Expert Commission, which generated nursing-led solutions to some of the country's most pressing health-care challenges. From 1999-2004, Shamian was executive director of Health Canada's Office of Nursing Policy. She helped lead a study that resulted in policy solutions to improve nurses‚Äô work environments, an example of her longstanding advocacy efforts for nursing solutions to the biggest health-care challenges. On October 4, 2012, an episode of the Canadian reality TV series Undercover Boss' aired in which Shamian worked in disguise to witness the pressures faced by nurses employed by the VON.  Education and awards  Shamian obtained her PhD from Case Western Reserve, Cleveland, Ohio, her Master's in Public Health from New York University, and her Baccalaureate in Community Nursing from Concordia University in Montreal. She is the 1995 recipient of the Ross Award for Nursing Leadership, the Golden Jubilee Medal in 2002 by the Governor General of Canada, the Award of Merit by CNA and the Canadian Federation of Nurses Unions in 2004, and is the recipient of two honorary doctorate degrees from the University of Lethbridge, Alberta in 2005, and Ryerson University, Toronto in 2006.

Topic: Fire Adapted Communities. http://www.fs.fed.us/fire/prev_ed/fac/facbriefing_paper.pdf the following are some of the elements of a fire adapted community: What does a fire adapted community look like? The public understands: * the role of fire on the surrounding landscape * fire authorities may not save all homes * community mitigation actions reduce the impacts of wildfire The community takes actions to: * create a collaborative group to develop a CWPP * develop and maintain a mitigation education program including prevention * support and enhance local fire protection capacity (RSG!) * prepare structures for wildfire via Firewise, Living With Fire or similar principles * build with fire resistant materials and site structures in low risk landscapes * develop evacuation plans * create safety zones in the community and fuel buffers at its edge * use codes and ordinances if applicable * work with public and private landowners to treat hazardous fuels * maintain cooperative agreements with partners * increase and maintain risk reduction efforts over time. Fire Adapted Communities Coalition Resources The Fire Adapted Communities Coalition is a group of partners committed to helping people and communities in the wildland-urban interface adapt to living with wildfire and reduce their risk for damage, without compromising firefighter or civilian safety. See External Links below for Coalition resources. Quadrennial Fire Review The term has existed for a number of years, but was given prominence in the 2005 ‚ÄúQuadrennial Fire and Fuel Review (QFR),‚Äù a publication that examines the future of wildfire in the United States and provides insight and predictions about potential changes in mission, roles and responsibilities. The 2005 QFR suggested promoting ‚Äúfire-adapted human communities, rather than escalating protection of communities at risk in the wildland-urban interface.‚Äù Quadrennial Fire and Fuel Review Report. 2005. Page 4. The ultimate aim would build toward the goal of a greater ‚Äúsense of living with fire within communities,‚Äù and ‚Äúestablishing responsible partnerships with communities.‚Äù Quadrennial Fire and Fuel Review Report. 2005. Page 18. The 2009 QFR also says the notion that ‚Äúthe government will always be there‚Äù (p. 32, 2009 QFR) during a wildfire needs to be changed to a model where property owners and local agencies ‚Äútake responsibility and become active participants and an integral part‚Äù in curbing the effects of wildfire to communities. (p. 21, 2009 QFR.) ‚ÄúAs some ecosystems must adapt to a fire-prone environment in order to survive, so must human communities in the interface, if they are to survive over the long-term.‚Äù Quadrennial Fire Review 2009. Final Report. 2009. Page 32/) The 2009 QFR further examined the characteristics of fire-adapted communities. ‚ÄúThe premise is that all partners recognize a general set of common operating precepts: namely, fulfilling pre-fire mitigation, defensible space, and individual responsibilities, applicable regulations; and providing a robust local response capacity ‚Ä¶ Other key steps include building community defensible space or fuels reduction zones ‚Ä¶ as an essential component of a larger integrated fuels management portfolio ‚Ä¶‚Äù Quadrennial Fire Review 2009. Final Report. 2009. Page V. Reducing risks Achieving fire-adapted communities is an approach that concentrates on plans and activities that reduce risk before a wildfire occurs. It does not rely on government agencies, through suppression activities, to protect communities after a wildfire starts. While a precise definition may not exist, a fire-adapted community has a combination or mixture of similar characteristics: # The community exists within or adjacent to a fire-prone ecosystem and has a defined geographic boundary. # Residents possess the knowledge, skills, and willingness to properly prepare their homes before a wildfire threatens, prepare to evacuate, and safely evacuate when necessary. # Local fire suppression forces have the adequate skills, equipment and capacity to manage wildfire. # Residents and the local fire agencies have met and understood the local fire suppression capability and related fire-response expectations. # Landowners are aware of fuel threats on their property and have taken action to mitigate the danger. # Structures and landscaping are designed, constructed, retrofitted, and maintained in a manner that is ignition-resistant. # A community wildfire protection plan is developed and implemented. # The community has embraced the need for defensible space by creating fuel reduction zones and internal safety zones, where treatments have been properly spaced, sequenced, and maintained over the long term. # Local government has effective land use planning and regulation, including building codes and local ordinances. # Property owners have an understanding of their responsibilities before, during and after a fire. # Public expectations are realistic and not based on reliance of government to provide all answers. Individuals accept personal responsibility for their property. The public understands that fire authorities cannot provide protection for every structure affected during a wildfire; and understands that it is dangerous for firefighters to attempt to protect a structure where owners have not taken the appropriate measures to make it defensible.(Pam Leschak, USDA Forest Service, ‚ÄúStrong Partnerships and the Right Tools: The Pre-wildfire Strategy of Fire-adapted Communities,‚Äù Institute for Business and Home Safety magazine, ‚ÄúDisaster Review,‚Äù March 2010, p. X; and International Association of Fire Chiefs definition of fire-adapted communities.) Partnerships The role of partnerships in achieving fire- adapted communities was explained by Vicky Christiansen, the Arizona state forester, to a congressional subcommittee. Representing the National Association of State Foresters, she testified, ‚ÄúOur work builds on the vision that effective partnerships, with shared responsibility held by all stakeholders of the wildland fire problem, will create well-prepared, fire- adapted communities and healthy, resilient landscapes.‚Äù (Vicky Christiansen, Arizona State Forester, statement before the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Interior, Environment and Related Agencies, April 1, 2009.) Pam Leschak, wildland-urban interface program manager for the USDA Forest Service, compared the overall efforts of fire-adapted communities to an umbrella. ‚ÄúThink of fire-adapted communities as an umbrella under which exist the goals, the elements, the programs and tools, the partnerships and the processes needed to enable communities to reduce risk from wildfire. Partners at every level joining forces, before a wildfire starts, to use existing and new ‚Ä¶ tools to creative fire-adaptive communities, which have taken the necessary actions to safely survive a wildfire with little or no additional structural protection resources while sustaining little or no damage.‚Äù (Pam Leschak, USDA Forest Service, ‚ÄúStrong Partnerships and the Right Tools: The Pre-wildfire Strategy of Fire-adapted Communities,‚Äù Institute for Business and Home Safety magazine, ‚ÄúDisaster Review,‚Äù March 2010, p. XX) Washoe County, Nevada In 2009, University of Nevada Cooperative Extension‚Äôs Living With Fire program received funding from the Nevada Division of Forestry and USDA Forest Service to bring the concept of Fire Adapted Communities to five of Washoe County‚Äôs high and extreme fire hazard neighborhoods. The project collaborators (federal, state, and local firefighting agencies, Nevada Fire Safe Council, and others) identified and described five key elements of a fire adapted community that homeowners should be aware of: # Community protection # Access # Built environment # Defensible space # Evacuation This information was then presented to residents of the five targeted communities at workshops and through newsletters, direct mail pieces, an exhibit and through a publication titled, Fire Adapted Communities: The Next Step in Wildfire Preparedness available at the University of Nevada cooperative extension fire-adapted communities publication website.

Biography Firetto became known as a DJ in the 1970s, then as a television personality in the 1980s. His career began in the nightclubs of Bristol when he was 15, introducing chart acts to the Bristol music scene, before becoming a finalist in the 208 Radio Luxembourg \\"Celebrity DJ\\" competition. Firetto won a 30-minute guest slot on the radio station. His broadcasting career started when he filled in at Radio 210 in Reading and Radio Victory in Portsmouth. He was then signed to the English version of Radio Luxembourg, before being chosen by Dave Cash, the programme director of the new independent radio service for Bristol, Radio West, to launch the service and host the breakfast show. After a short period presenting the breakfast show, he moved to the weekends to present a Sony award‚Äìnominated children's show called Nino's Gang, which urged young listeners to sign up as free members to a musical gang. In September 1984, Firetto began presenting the weekday evening Music Magazine. Firetto's childhood hero in the mid 80's was Gary Glitter and favourite TV show was The Cosby Show After two years with Radio West, Firetto left in 1984 to pursue a career in television, firstly on the Children's ITV flagship magazine programme Splash!. He also hosted the music strand on the Saturday morning children's show Get Fresh. In 1987, Firetto was voted the Children's ITV Personality of the Year. He also became a presenter on pan-European music channel Music Box. He went on to present the British version of the dating game show Love me, love me not produced by TVS for ITV; later, he presented a modern version of the seminal ITV quiz show Mr. and Mrs. Other credits include hosting a weekly American football show for ITV called The American Match, showbiz correspondent for LNN's London Tonight, and hosting the Malibu World Dance Championship strand on ITV's Summertime Special. Firetto became a regular guest on panel shows such as Give Us a Clue, Whose Baby?, and What's My Line; but he retained his contact with radio, presenting breakfast on Galaxy 101 and on a national satellite service called \\"Night Tracks\\". In 2000, Firetto became the morning host on Kestrel FM in Basingstoke. Then, in February 2001, he moved to present the weekday drive programme for Wave 105, the English regional station for the south coast. He remained there until June 2003. In July 2004, he moved to the US to work as weekend afternoon host and swing presenter for Adult Top 40 music station KLLC Alice 97.3 in San Francisco. Returning to the UK, Nino Firetto launched Nino Firetto Casting and presented the daily morning show on Radio Exe in Devon. Following an ongoing joke between Firetto and the editor of the Express & Echo newspaper in Exeter, Firetto donned Speedo-style swimwear for his radio show to raise money for the charity Dream-A-Way.

History of study  Nannaroter was named in 2009 by Canadian paleontologists Jason Anderson, Diane Scott, and Robert Reisz. It is known from only the holotype specimen, which was found in the Dolese Brothers Limestone Quarry in Oklahoma. The holotype, a well preserved skull, was found in early Permian-aged fissure fill deposits in Ordovician limestone. The species name is given for Mark McKinzie, who found and donated the specimen to the Sam Noble Oklahoma Museum of Natural History.  Anatomy  Nannaroter is the smallest known ostodolepid and is diagnosed by: (1) the high subtemporal recess that separates the postorbital from the squamosal; (2) four premaxillary tooth positions; (3) 12 maxillary tooth positions; circumorbital walls formed by medial laminae of the prefrontal, lacrimal, and jugal; (5) a ventral flange of the frontal meeting the sphenethmoid; (7) an anterolaterally bulbous sphenethmoid; and (8) a massive epipterygoid. Like other ostodolepids, it has a wedge-shaped skull, a pointed snout, and a temporal emargination. The skull is highly ossified in order to resist anteroposteriorly directed forces, as indicated by the markedly interdigitated sutures.  Ecology  The high degree of ossification in the skull of Nannaroter is seen as an adaptation to a fossorial, or burrowing, lifestyle. More specifically, the animal would likely have used its recumbent snout to push forward into the substrate, facilitated by increased epaxial musculature that inserted into the broad, sloping occiput, as in amphisbaenians. As Nannaroter is known from only one specimen, it has been suggested that it was either a naturally rare component of the assemblage or that its inferred burrowing ecology did not lend itself well to preservation in the fissure fill system.

Shearer's Snacks was founded in 1974 as a snack food distributor in Brewster, Ohio, and now has factories in Ohio, Texas, Arkansas, Oregon, Virginia, Iowa, Minnesota and Ontario, with worldwide distribution. Shearer's manufactures, warehouses, and distributes branded snacks as well as private label products for snack food companies and retailers. Its branded products include Shearer's Potato Chips, including home-style, savory and kettle-cooked options, tortilla chips, pretzels, pork rinds, corn puffs and curls. Their plant in Massillon, OH is the first food manufacturing plant in the world to achieve the highest sustainability award for environmental responsibility. Shearer's employs more than 3,400 people in eight facilities. Its headquarters is located in Massillon, Ohio. History In the early 1900s, the Shearer family opened Shearer's Market in Canton, Ohio. The third generation, Jack Shearer and his wife, Rosemary, operated the family grocery store from the 1950s until 1976, and in 1974 bought a snack food distributorship and named it Brookside Distributing. In 1979, they began manufacturing \\"hand-cooked\\" potato chips until discovering that a kettle cooked chip provided more of a crunch and a standardized method of preparation. The Shearers hand-cooked potato chips from the kettle, packaged them in one-pound poly bags with a twist tie, delivered them from a warehouse and first sold them under the Kettle-Cook'd label. =Growth and transition= In 1982, Shearer's purchased a 20,000 square foot facility on ten acres in Brewster, Ohio. Soon after, six hand-kettles and a peanut roaster were in operation. The Grandma Shearer's logo appeared on shelves in 1983, and 3,700 pounds of potatoes were processed daily. Shearer's installed its first continuous fryer to produce up to 1,000 pounds of potato chips every hour and expanded its warehouse and maintenance space by 9,000 square feet in 1986. In 1988, the company increased its plant size again. This growth continued through the 1990s and included the addition of a second continuous fryer, two hand-kettle fryers that featured automatic stirring systems (among the very first manufactured in all of the United States), computerized combination weighers, state-of-the-snack equipment for tortilla chips and cheese curls, and an additional 100,000 square feet of space. In the early 2000s, six hand- kettle cookers, a new potato peeling system, distribution and transfer conveyors, and a new seasoning system were installed. Thirty-three acres adjacent to the current location were purchased to combine for 77 acres in total, while a portion of the storage operation was relocated nine miles from the headquarters to Massillon. The company was named \\"Snack Manufacturer of the Year\\" by Snack Food & Wholesale Bakery magazine in 2002 and again in 2011. Shearer's developed a new logo, revamped packaging, and expanded its factory outlet store in 2004. A $2.6 million wastewater treatment plant was completed in the spring, and six additional hand-kettle cookers were installed along with a new packaging area, making Shearer's one of the largest manufacturers of kettle-cooked potato chips in the nation. =Recent history= An increasing trend of whole grains and better-for-you snacks resulted in three new whole grain tortilla chip products with 100% whole grain yellow corn in 2006. In 2008, Shearer's Foods unveiled plans to build the first manufacturing plant in the world to achieve the highest sustainability award for environmental responsibility. In 2009, Shearer's introduced two multi-SKU brands to retail, Tangos‚Ñ¢ Tortilla Chips and Shapers‚Ñ¢ Whole Grain Chips. In 2010, Shearer‚Äôs acquired Snack Alliance, Inc. and its Canadian affiliate (collectively, ‚ÄúSnack Alliance‚Äù), a branded, contract pack and private label snack producer in North America. Founded in 2000, Snack Alliance employed over 400 associates across the United States and Canada. Snack Alliance had manufacturing operations located in Hermiston, Oregon and Bristol, Virginia that produced potato chips, tortilla chips, extruded products, popcorn, and their Riceworks brand of whole grain rice snacks. In May 2011, Shearer's extended their line of potato chips to include zero trans fat chips, cooked in 100% canola oil. In June 2012, Shearer's moved its headquarters into the four story Grand Mill Centre building in downtown Massillon, Ohio. In October 2012, Shearer's sold to Chicago based Wind Point Partners. In January 2015, Ontario Teacher's Pension Plan acquired majority stake in Shearer's Snacks through the purchase of additional equity stake. The private equity group had initially acquired stake in the company in 2012 alongside Wind Point Partners and in partnership with CJ Fralaigh. Since the sale in 2012, Shearer's completed acquisitions of Lance Private Brands and Medallion Foods. These acquisitions doubled the size of the business and significantly expanded private label and contract manufacturing offerings. In 2016, Shearer's acquired Barrel O' Fun, a division of KLN Family Brands located in Perham, Minnesota. The Barrel O' Fun brand includes many of the same snack items that Shearer's already produced. Shearer's now operates the Barrel O' Fun manufacturing plant and warehouse under their name and are not associated with KLN, although they share the same property. The Perham plant continues to manufacture the Barrel O' Fun brand of snacks, but now produces private label brands as well. Environmental sustainability The company has expressed a commitment to sustainability and energy performance, joining Energy Star in 2006 and working to improve energy performance in its offices, manufacturing facilities and distribution centers. The company received recognition by way of a Crain's Cleveland Business Emerald Award for its efforts. Their energy management program includes: *A zero waste program that calls for all facilities to send less than one percent of waste to landfills. * Recycling finished goods and wet waste for use as animal feed. * Reclamation of all potato starch for refinement as industrial lubricant. * Recycling of all used vegetable oil. * Conversion to high efficiency T8 & T5 lighting in Brewster and Lubbock manufacturing sites, and in Navarre Distribution warehouse areas. * New oil filtration equipment to increase oil quality and eliminate rendering of oil. * Economizers on large air handling units to greatly reduce natural gas consumption during heating season. * Wastewater management facilities that comply with state Environmental Protection Agency requirements The company broke ground on its LEED Platinum Certified snack food manufacturing plant in 2009. The plant in Massillon, Ohio was the first manufacturing plant in the world to achieve the highest sustainability award for environmental responsibility. Manufacturing =Manufacturing capabilities= Products include sliced, rippled, and wavy potato chips, kettle-cooked potato chips, tortilla and whole grain extruded chips, and other extruded products such as cheese curls and puff corn (also known as hulless popcorn). Shearer's various products are made from potatoes, yellow, white, blue, and organic corn, and for tortilla chips, company-produced masa. Seasonings and flavors are developed by an in-house R&D; group and also in conjunction with external partners.

He was born into an eminent Zeeland family in Middelburg. In 1826, he graduated from the Latin school there. After the outbreak of the Belgian Revolution while he was a medical student at Leyden University, he joined the Leidse Jagers, a volunteer company of soldiers drawn from the Leyden student body, and participated in the Ten Days' Campaign. Upon his safe return, he continued his studies. He received a doctoral degree on November 3, 1832 with his thesis de Hippocratis doctrina a prognostice oriunda. He returned to his native city and practiced as a doctor. He married Barta Antonia van der Feen, with whom he had several children. His practice soon prospered, but he continued his study of his beloved Greek doctors, to which he devoted all the time he could spare from his daytime occupation. In the meantime he was appointed President of the Provincial Medical Commission and Secretary of the Zeeland Provincial Society. In 1839 his love for the classics induced him to move to Paris, to work full- time at the royal library on transcribing and organizing of ancient manuscripts, in particular those of Aretaeus. The next year this resulted in the publication of his Anecdota medica Graeca, followed soon after by additional works. Upon the death of Professor S. E. Stratingh, he was appointed in his place at the university of Groningen. He took up this appointment on September 12, 1844 with an inaugural lecture entitled de veteris medicorum interpretis munere a medicis non recusando. He lectured on a wide variety of topics in medicine, due to the lack of a sufficient number of professors, a situation which, as Ermerins wrote to a good friend, \\"benefits neither professors nor students\\". Beginning in 1852, however, he limited himself to general pathology, pathological anatomy and histology, and clinical courses in the Academic hospital. In spite of this busy schedule, he completed after ten years his main work Hippocratis et aliorum medicorum veterum reliquiae, which was published in three volumes by the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences, of which he had been a member since 1855. Near the end of his life he was threatened with total blindness; he died of typhoid May 27, 1871. The French scholar Charles Daremberg called him \\"one of the glories of medical erudition.\\"  Bibliography  * Dissertatio de Hippocratis doctrina a prognostice oriunda. L.B. 1832 4¬∞.

It aired May 3, 2010. Plot Although Robin and Don have only been dating a short while, he surprises her by suggesting she move in with him. The rest of the gang think it might be too soon, so she agrees to let them meet Don, which she had specifically avoided before. They enjoy his company, but it soon becomes clear Don does not know that both Ted and Barney had once dated Robin. Don eventually finds out from Barney and Lily about the past relationships (Don had thought Ted to be gay), and, unable to comprehend that Robin continues to hang out with two of her exes, leaves the bar. Don apologizes the next day and offers to invite them over for dinner. Once he and Robin have left, Barney reveals to Ted he still wants Robin. Ted tries to convince him he does not, and shows him the \\"letter\\"; Ted explains that every time he broke up with someone, he would write a letter to convince himself why he shouldn't get back with the girl in the future. Ted had Barney write such a letter after breaking up with Robin, although it becomes clear after reading it he still misses her; and he proceeds to misbehave during dinner, bemusing Robin and Don. Ted reads his own letter, after he mentions Robin's then-fear of commitment, he realizes he too misses her. The two end up arguing about who should get to be with her, becoming very drunk, and eventually crashing Don's place, much to Robin's embarrassment, especially as Ted has re-stolen the blue French horn for her. The next day, Ted and Barney apologize for their behavior, but Robin reveals she wants to take a break from the rest of the group and has agreed to move in with Don. Several days go by with no word from Robin or evidence that she has moved out, but one day Ted checks her room and finds it empty; all that has been left behind is the blue French horn. Meanwhile, after spending a weekend sleeping in separate beds at a hotel, Marshall and Lily realize they both enjoy their personal space and get separate beds for their own room; they even plan to get a third bed just for sex. After going to Don's place for dinner, however, Lily begins to fear sleeping apart could ruin their marriage; especially as Don reveals he and his ex-wife slept in separate beds before divorcing. Marshall is not keen on giving up his own bed, but after having sex, Marshall ends up climbing into Lily's bed with her. Critical response Donna Bowman of The A.V. Club rated the episode grade B‚àí.

Claude Ahrens, 1954 The beginning of Miracle John Ahrens founded Miracle Recreation in Grinnell, Iowa in 1927. He redesigned the merry-go-round after seeing an exhibit for a ‚ÄúPerpetual Motion Machine. He called his product the ‚ÄúMiracle Whirl‚Äù. He was awarded a patent and created the company known as Ahrens Manufacturing Company. John passed his company to his son Claude in 1940. Claude already owned a hybrid seed corn company but in 1946 he focussed his attention on manufacturing and selling the Miracle Whirl. Claude sold his seed corn business, and started the Miracle Recreation Equipment Company, formerly known as Ahrens Manufacturing Company. Claude set up the production for the Miracle Whirl merry-go-round in the Grinnell Glove Factory. Claude redesigning it to replace the wooden platform with a more durable metal one, eliminating the center post and adding tubing handrails for the children to hold onto. Claude painted the product with a candy stripe so the product was clearly identifiable, an idea he carried through to other products as well. Almost all of Miracle's first customers were country schools. The schools bought the Miracle Whirl to entertain their students during recess. During 1947, Miracle's first year of operation, 900 whirls were sold to schools throughout Iowa. Soon after, Miracle expanded their product offering to include playground equipment such as swings, teeter-totters, and jungle gyms. The growth of Miracle After a fire in the Grinnell Glove Factory, a new facility was built on farmland purchased on the west side of Grinnell. The operation expanded rapidly and Claude hired sales managers assigned to districts and states. By 1960, Miracle had 40 district managers covering the entire country. Miracle moved into the new facility in 1963. Miracle pioneered the use of fiberglass for slides and canopies which helped to differentiate its products from the competition. Fiberglass allowed Miracle to create colorful components. Miracle was the first playground manufacturer to use powder coating of steel parts in the late 1960s. After World War II, Miracle widened their market to include the increasingly popular drive-in movie theaters, selling two smaller versions of carousels that were commonly found at fairs and amusement parks. The first year they sold over 200 carousels, which Claude Ahrens described as his ‚Äúfirst big money in the recreation equipment business‚Äù for Miracle. Miracle Carousel 1960 After experiencing a splinter while sitting on a wooden bleacher at a University of Iowa football game, Claude set out to create bleachers made from the fiberglass he used in many of Miracle's playground items. Miracle replaced the wooden bleachers at the university with fiberglass coverings, saving the university over $60,000. Orders came in from other large schools such as the University of Michigan and Ohio State. Seating became one of Miracle's most important offerings. By 1970, Miracle Recreation Equipment had 200 employees selling and manufacturing playground equipment and bleachers at facilities in Iowa, California and Virginia. The fast food revolution Miracle was the first to design and manufacture playgrounds and sets for the fast food industry. Miracle purchased the Setmaker Company in California, and with the help of Claude's son, Paul Ahrens, creating playground designs for fast food giant McDonald's. Miracle had installed play equipment at over 500 McDonald's throughout the USA. Together, Paul and Claude developed over 16 patents for their designs. Miracle switches hands Paul Ahrens became president of Miracle in 1972, the same year the company sold 30% of its shares to the public. After facing labor struggles in the 1980s, the company began moving some operations to factories outside of Grinnell, Iowa. Paul announced plans in 1982 to build a new plant in Monett, Missouri. By 1983 Paul had resigned as chair of the Miracle board and turned the business over to Sharp Lannom. The decision was made to move complete operations for the company to Monett in 1986; the plant in Grinnell was later closed. Sharp resigned later in 1986, after feeling he had accomplished moving the company and resolving the labor issues. Paul became chairman of Miracle late in 1986. Claude Ahrens had sold all of the stock in the company to his son, giving him controlling interest of the company. In 1989 Paul died of cancer. After putting all his possessions as collateral against the company, Claude bought the firm's shares back private and took over Miracle once again. By that time, Claude was looking to sell Miracle Recreation Equipment Company and it was sold to PlayPower in 2002. Miracle today Based in Monett, Missouri, Miracle offers made to order products. The company has 400 employees, 100 domestic sales consultants, and 40 international distributors.

Unlike the other aristocratic Nair factions of North and Central Travancore who are descended from the NƒÅgas, the Meenachil Karthas were of Rajput origin.History of Kerala, R. Leela Devi p.150 Origin The Meenachil Karthas were originally Rajputs belonging to royal lineage who migrated to Madurai in the 14th century (the reason for their exodus or their roots in Rajasthan is given as some family disputes & inter family quarrels). They settled in Madurai (which was a great cultural center and capital city during that time).http://mevadathampans.com/index.html Later they migrated to Kerala (the reason for which is stated as outbreak of an epidemic in Madurai) and settled in this place \\"Meenachil\\" which was named after \\"Meenakshi\\" of Madurai. Their capital was named Mevada (after Mewar).Kerala District Gazetteers: Kottayam, Kerala (India) p.34-35 Culture and assimilation In Kerala, they were gradually assimilated into the Illathu Nair caste, which was the major aristocratic caste in Travancore region. As they amassed power, Samanthan status as well as the aristocratic title of \\"Kartha\\" (meaning Lord in Malayalam) were bestowed upon them. But they retained their original surname \\"Simhar\\" (variant of Singh) and their culture remained markedly different from other local ruling clans. Most famous of the rulers were Veera Kerala Damodara Simhar, under whose reign, the principality achieved maximum glory.Kerala District Gazetteers: Kottayam, Kerala (India) p.34-35 Defeat and destruction The rise of Marthanda Varma of Venad, the nephew of Raja Rama Varma spelled trouble for the Nair ruling clans all over Travancore. Marthanda Varma was able to seize power after killing Raman Thampi and Padmanabhan Thampi, who were the sons of Raja Rama Varma (with Princess Abhirami, a Rajput from Kosala). Marthanda Varma and his trusted Iyer Dalawa Ramayyan started conquering the Nair kingdoms of Central and Northern Travancore one by one during the 18th century and the members of the Meenachil ruling clan were not able to avert the impending disaster. After breaking the backbone of the Southern Travancore Nair aristocracy by exterminating the most powerful clans such as the Ettuveedans and the members of Venad royal family who identified most strongly with the Illathu Nair nobility (the Thampis), Marthanda Varma under the influence of his Iyer mentor wreaked havoc on smaller Nair principalities such as Thekkumkur, Vadakkumkur, Kayamkulametc., ably supported by his Tamil allies. Many of the ruling Nair dynasties were exterminated within a few days without any trace. Marthanda Varma's forces invaded Meenachil in 1754, and the ruler of the principality committed suicide. Almost all the members of the royal family were either killed in the battle or executed, while a handful (almost all of them women) were able to escape and take refuge under the Zamorin. At the time of Hyder Ali's invasion of Malabar during 1766, only two young females were alive within the clan.

Barney had bought a fifth ticket for Robin, despite knowing she had wished to spend time away from them, and indeed she ends up declining. Meanwhile, Ted finds himself continuously snubbed by his friends whenever he tries to appear intellectual, such as by reciting a poem, as his friends always make fart noises to interrupt him. At Ted's apartment, Barney finds an envelope addressed to Marissa Heller, who Ted explains was the apartment's previous occupant. Ted has been receiving her mail ever since they had moved in 10 years ago, and over the years, he and Marshall had become curious about her personality. Ted opens the envelope, which is an invitation to a high-society party in the Alberta Building, a famous building that Ted describes as the most beautiful in Manhattan. Unfortunately, the party is the same night as \\"Robots Versus Wrestlers\\", so Ted convinces the gang they will make a brief appearance at the party before heading over to Robots, having Lily pretend to be Marissa so that they can gain entry to the party.

Lily assures Barney that, though they might drift apart, they will still remain friends. Meanwhile, Ted continues to have a good time at the party and begins reciting a poem to everyone there, in the original Italian.

It had a 29.5 inch barrel, compared to the 32.5 inch barrel of the Model 1868, and had an overall length of 48.8 inches. The Model 1869 was produced using Model 1868 receivers and breech blocks, but used a stock that was manufactured specifically for the Model 1869. The Model 1869 had a narrower buttplate and the stock around the barrel was thinner than on the Model 1868. This model has its own sequence of serial numbers, running from 1 to approx. 3422.

The park consists of west of the lake itself, in Harrison County, near Karnack, Texas. The lake and surrounding area was drilled for petroleum in the 1900s. The lake was created by a gigantic log jam known as the Great Raft. History =Early inhabitants and exploration= A map of the Native American tribes in alt=A map of the U.S. and Canada with different colored sections The first humans settled in the area near the park around 10,000 BC. For several centuries, these people used the marshlands of Caddo Lake to gather food. Sometime around 800 AD, the first Caddo settlements appeared in the area. At the time, the tribes in the region were not a connected nation, instead being a large collection of close-knit, peaceful gathering communities. Over time, the Caddo communities grew and prospered, becoming a highly farming community by at least 1200 AD, learning to grow crops such as maize (corn). In 1542, the Francisco de Soto expedition, led by Luis de Moscoso Alvarado due to De Soto's death earlier in the expedition, discovered the complex Caddoan society. They sent back the first descriptions of the Caddo. Several more European expeditions explored the area around the park throughout the 1600s. The Spanish established several Missions and trading-posts during the 1700s, and numerous epidemics caused by the European settlements virtually wiped out the Caddo that inhabited the area. They used the nearby Red River for trading. =1800s= alt=A map of the U.S. with a large green area in the middle 1800‚Äì1812 In 1800, as part of the secret Treaty of San Ildefonso, Spain, who had been defeated in the Napoleonic Wars, was forced to return Louisiana to France. France regained Louisiana in 1802, two years later.Crossroads of North America pp. 124‚Äì125 This treaty did not establish the borders of Louisiana, which would lead to issues just a short while later.Schoultz 1998 pp. 15‚Äì16 In early 1803, diplomat James Monroe was sent to France to negotiate purchasing Louisiana from France. Louisiana was bought from France later that year. This was known as the Louisiana Purchase, which doubled the size of the United States. The northeastern part of Texas was thought to be included in the purchase. There was no official border between Louisiana and Texas, which caused disputes between Spain and the United States. In 1806, United States General James Wilkinson and Spanish Lieutenant Colonel Sim√≥n de Herrera attempted to negotiate establishing a border between the two nations. On November 5, 1806, an agreement was made to establish a Neutral territory between the two countries. The neutral territory did not have official borders, and the Caddo Lake area was likely located within the territory. Because the territory was not possessed by either nation, neither of them could enforce laws in the territory, so it became popular with outlaws and escaped slaves. In both 1810 and 1812, the two nations sent joint military expeditions into the Neutral Territory to expel the outlaws inhabiting it. Formation of Caddo Lake A wood engraving showing the effects of the alt=A drawing of an earthquake destroying land Although the exact date of the formation of Caddo Lake is unknown, both of the major theories behind the lake's origins date back to the early 1800s. The Caddo legend behind the formation of the lake is that the Great Spirit caused an earthquake after one of the Caddo chiefs failed to obey him. The earthquake filled and formed the lake. The earthquake being described in the story is the 1812 New Madrid earthquake, which is believed by some geologists to have caused the creation of the lake. The theory behind the earthquake creating Caddo Lake is that the earthquake's seismic waves caused the ground to sink, which filled up and became the lake.Texas State Parks p. 112 The additional theory behind the creation of Caddo Lake was that it formed because of the Great Raft. The Great Raft was a large log jam that blocked the flow of the Red River, as well as a few smaller rivers. The jam was first reported by early Spanish explorers in the 1500s, but was not studied until the early 1800s. It is believed that Caddo Lake was formed by the Great Raft acting as a natural dam, and the first studies of this were reported around 1806.Red River Steamboats p. 7 \\"Spanish explorers reached the Red River in the 16th century, and discovered a massive jam of fallen trees and debris. This natural damming came to be known as \\"The Great Raft.\\"[...] Although the French and Spanish explored the region during the 18th century, a thorough effort to explore and document the river did not occur until it came into the hands of the United States in 1803. The first thorough exploration occurred in 1806 with the Freeman Custis Expedition, which ascended the Red, but was eventually stopped by Spanish military forces\\" 1819‚Äì1829 In 1819, the Adams-Onis Treaty was signed, which established the border between Spanish Texas and Louisiana. The border between the two was set along the Sabine River and the 32nd parallel, which placed the Caddo Lake Area within the borders of Texas. In 1821, after 11 years of fighting, the Spanish territory of Mexico won its independence. This included the area of the present-day Caddo Lake state park. Winning the Texas Revolution allowed the Republic of Texas to become independent from Mexico and be annexed by the United States. =1900s= 1931‚Äì1937 The 1931 Texas Legislature dedicated state property at Caddo Lake as a public park. Land was donated by various institutions and individuals between 1933 and 1937, the bulk coming from a gift of 385 acres by Thomas Jefferson Taylor II. Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) Company 889 began development of the park in 1933. They began building entrance portals, Texas Park Road 2, trails, a shelter house, a boat house, nine cabins, a concession building (currently the group recreation hall), picnic sites, culverts, vehicle bridges, and a well house.

Four Middle English Romances. Kalamazoo, Michigan: Western Michigan University for TEAMS.

Two Middle English versions There are two Middle English versions of this romance represented by these surviving manuscripts, both of which condense the plot of the Old French original to about a third of its length.Hudson, Harriet (Ed). 1996. One of these is known from only one copy, British Museum MS Cotton Caligula A.ii, a manuscript copied sometime between 1446 and 1460Hudson, Harriet (Ed). 1996. In this manuscript, Octavian precedes two Arthurian romances, Sir Launfal and Libeaus Desconus.Mills, Maldwyn (Ed). 1969. Sir Launfal is known only from this one manuscript and is signed with the name Thomas Chestre. On grounds of style, mode of composition and dialect it is believed that the two romances flanking Sir Launfal, including Octavian, may be by the same author.Mills, Maldwyn (Ed). 1969.Lupack, Alan. 2005. Oxford Guide to Arthurian Literature and Legend. Oxford University Press, p 320. This version of Octavian is known as the Southern Octavian. The Southern Octavian is written in a Middle English dialect close to that of the southeast Midlands of England, as is Sir Launfal, although the problem of the direct borrowing of lines by Thomas Chestre in order to steal rhymes in other dialects, part of his ‚Äúeclectic mode of composition‚Äù, is common to all three of these poems.Mills, Maldwyn (Ed). 1969. pp 34‚Äì35.

Octavian: Introduction. Plot summary (This summary is based upon the copy of the Northern Octavian found in Lincoln Cathedral Library MS 91, the Thornton Manuscript.) The Roman Emperor Octavian, upset that, after seven years of marriage, his wife has born him no child, weeps to himself in bed. Octavian's wife hears this and tries to comfort him with the suggestion that they build an abbey and dedicate it to the Virgin Mary. In thanks the Virgin will provide them with a child, she is sure (Octavian became the Roman Emperor Augustus in 27 BC, nearly thirty years before the birth of Christ. Geoffrey Chaucer also transports us back to the age of Augustus in his Book of the DuchesseChaucer ‚Äì texts: http://www.umm.maine.edu/faculty/necastro/chaucer/texts/bd/bd07.txt line 368.). Soon, the empress is pregnant with twins! When her time comes, she gives birth to two healthy boys. Octavian is delighted. His mother, however, tells him that the children are not his, a malicious lie that she tries to corroborate by bribing a male kitchen servant to enter the empress's bed while she is asleep. Octavian is taken to the room, sees the boy, kills him at once and holds his severed head in stark accusation before his terrified wife as she wakes from sleep. On the day of an important Church service soon afterwards, Octavian's father-in-law is deceived into giving a verdict upon his daughter's alleged crime, not knowing that it is his own daughter whom he is passing judgement upon. She should be burned alive, with both her children, for doing such a thing, he insists. Octavian announces that this shall be done at once! They all gather outside the walls of Rome where huge branches are blackening in the flames. Her father cannot bear to attend. But at the last moment the emperor relents and banishes his wife and her two children into exile, instead. Wandering alone in the forest, the empress (she is given no name in this romance) lies tired and exhausted at a spring one evening and falls asleep. In the morning, as the dawn chorus begins, an ape suddenly emerges from the forest and steals away one of her babies. Then a lioness appears and takes away the other in its mouth. The woman is distraught! She assumes that she is being punished for her sins and undertakes to journey to the Holy Land, so she travels to the Aegean Sea and takes a ship bound for Jerusalem. On the way, the crew stop at an island to take on fresh water and encounter a lioness suckling a human baby. The empress goes ashore and finds her own baby being treated by the lioness as her cub (a griffin ‚Äì we already know ‚Äì had snatched away the lioness shortly after it stole the child and took it to this island, where the lioness had killed it). The empress returns to the ship with her child and the lioness follows. They all arrive in Jerusalem where the King recognises the lady for who she is, names her little boy Octavian and allows her to stay, with her child and her lioness, in wealth and comfort. The story now turns to the fate of the other child, the one who was taken by the ape, and it is this branch of the story that occupies the greater part of the romance. This child is soon rescued from the ape's clutches by a knight, who then loses the baby to a gang of outlaws who take the infant to the coast to sell. The baby is bought by a travelling merchant, Clement the villain (villain in a feudal sense, as a type of farmhand, not a moral sense; Clement, in fact, earns the listener's sympathy as the story unfolds). Clement does his best for the baby, finds it a wet-nurse, brings it back to his home in Paris and gives it to his wife. They rear the little boy as their own child, naming him Florent. As he grows up, however, Florent's noble blood manifests itself when he prefers to buy a falcon rather than two oxen. On another occasion he shows an inclination to be over-generous rather than drive a hard bargain and Clement despairs, leading to some comical scenes which culminate in Florent's insistence that he should borrow his father's rusty armour to go out to fight against a giant. The Saracens have invaded France and are laying siege to Paris. The Saracen king has a giant to whom he has promised the hand of his beautiful daughter Marsabelle if he can bring to her the head of the French king, Dagobert. At this moment, the giant is leaning over the city wall of Paris, taunting the population and threatening to destroy them all. Everyone is terrified. Six knights have already sallied out and been slaughtered by this giant. Now he is leaning over the wall again and taunting them all once more. Florent persuades his father to lend him the rusty armour, laughs as his parents fall over backwards when they try to pull the rusty sword from its scabbard, mounts his horse and rides to the outer wall where the waiting population burst out laughing in anxious derision and shout abuse. 'Here comes a mighty bachelor, magnificent in his saddle!' they cry. 'You can see by his shining armour that he is going to save us from this giant!' :\\"Ilk a man sayde to his fere, :'Here commes a doghety bachelere, :Hym semes full wele to ryde: :Men may see by hys brene bryghte :That he es a nobylle knyghte :The geaunt for to habyde!'‚ÄùHudson, Harriet (Ed). 1996. Octavian, lines 983‚Äì994. Florent, of course, defeats the giant and immediately rides off to present the head to Marsabelle, explaining that the giant was unable to get the head of the King of France for her so he has brought his own instead! Then he tries to abduct her, but he is immediately set upon by all those in the castle, fights his way to safety and returns alone to Paris to a hero's welcome. Florent is knighted and the listener is treated to another comic scene as Clement worries that he might have to pay for the feast that the King of France and the Emperor of Rome have put on in Florent's honour. Yes, the Emperor of Rome, Florent's real father, has arrived in Paris to help life the siege. The emperor is astounded at the noble bearing of this merchant's son and asks the boy if Clement is his real father. Florent replies equivocally. Clement explains truthfully how he came by the child and the Emperor realises that Florent is his long-lost son. The next morning, Florent rides out to the pavilion of the Saracen king, provoking, by his confident boasts, a military engagement the very next day. He rides back to Paris to warn everybody of the impending battle. The next day the forces engage and the fighting is long and hard. Sir Florent performs magnificently, wearing Marsabelle's sleeve on his lance, and saves the Christian forces from defeat. As night falls and the armies fall back, Florent rides to where Marsabelle is staying, where she vows to marry him and become a Christian, and warns him about her father's invincible horse. Early the next morning, Clement earns his own moment of glory when he rides into the Saracen camp and, through a brave deception, comes away with this horse to give to his son Florent. Florent, however, in keeping with his true nobility, asks Clement to give it instead to the Emperor of Rome as a gift from himself. Later that day, battle resumes and Florent brings Marsabelle into Paris by boat. However, things go badly for the Christian army during Florent's absence and it is defeated. They are all led away captive, including Florent, the Emperor of Rome and King Dagobert of France. Suddenly and unexpectedly, however, another Christian army arrives, raised by the King of Jerusalem and headed by Florent's brother Octavian. It vanquishes the Saracen host and when the fighting is over they all retire to a nearby castle where Octavian reveals his true identity to the Emperor of Rome and presents his mother to him. Then the lady notices Florent and recognises him as her own son. ‚ÄúThen was thore full mekill gamen, with halsynge and with kyssyngez samen‚ÄùHudson, Harriet (Ed). 1996. Octavian, lines 1795‚Äì1796. Then there was hugging and kissing! Florent and Marsabelle are married and return to Rome. The emperor explains what was told to him on that fateful day so long ago, and his mother is sentenced to be burned to death in a brass tub, but conveniently, she takes her own life instead. And so ends the story of Octavian. Sources and analogues Octavian has similarities with the Middle English Breton lays and is imbued, like much of medieval romance, with the characteristics of folktale and myth.Brewer, Derek. 1983.

The middle of the romance is almost a burlesque comedy between Florent and his father Clement who, ‚Äúobsessed with merchandise, is the great comic character of the romance, and he fights a long and losing battle against the boy's inability to extract the smallest financial advantage from any commercial transaction entrusted to him.\\"Mills, Maldwyn (Ed). 1972. p xvi.

Fossils have been found from Nova Scotia, Ohio, and the Czech Republic and are Late Carboniferous in age. Tuditanids were medium-sized terrestrial microsaurs that resembled lizards. Postcranial material is best known from the genus Tuditanus, showing that it had size, proportions, and skull configuration that were similar to captorhinids. Tuditanids have also developed an astragalus in the ankle (a reptilian feature) from the fusion of several other bones. Tuditanus punctulatus. In comparison to other microsaurs, tuditanids were short-bodied, with fewer than 30 presacral vertebrae. The limbs are large and well developed. Unlike other microsaurs such as gymnarthrids, the jaw articulation is at the posterior margin of the skull. The teeth are blunt and peg-like. Tuditanids are thought to have had a similar lifestyle to reptiles such as captorhinids. They were terrestrial and likely fed on insects and other small arthropods. The similarity between tuditanids and contemporary reptiles may have contributed to their rarity in the Late Carboniferous and their relatively early extinction before the start of the Permian.

He is reputed to be the only known prisoner to have successfully escaped from a \\"total-control zone\\" grade internment camp in North Korea. He was the subject of a biography, Escape from Camp 14: One Man's Remarkable Odyssey From North Korea to Freedom in the West, by former Washington Post journalist Blaine Harden. Shin has given talks to audiences around the world about his life in Camp 14 and about the totalitarian North Korean regime to raise awareness of the situation in North Korean internment and concentration camps and North Korea. Shin has been described as the world's \\"single strongest voice\\" on the atrocities inside North Korean camps by a member of the United Nations' first commission of inquiry into human rights abuses of North Korea. In January 2015, he recanted aspects of his story, but a majority of experts continued to support his credibility as a victim of North Korean human rights abuses.  Biography  The following is Shin's biography as told by him prior to 2015 which he later partially recanted. =Early life= Shin Dong-hyuk was born Shin In GeunHarden 2012, p. xiii. at the Kaechon internment camp, commonly known as Camp 14. He was born to two prisoners who were allowed to marry as a reward for good work, although \\"neither bride nor groom had much say in deciding whom they would marry.\\"Harden 2012, p. 17. Shin's father, Shin Gyung Sub, told Shin that the guards gave him his mother, Jang Hye-gyung, as payment for his skill in operating a metal lathe in the camp's machine shop. Shin lived with his mother until he was 12. He rarely saw his father who lived elsewhere in the camp and was allowed to visit a few times a year. According to Shin, he saw his mother as a competitor for their insufficient food rations, and consequently had no bonds of affection with his parents or his brother, Shin He Geun.Harden 2012, pp. 49-51. The North Korean government officials and camp guards told him he was imprisoned because his parents had committed crimes against the state, and that he had to work hard and always obey the guards; otherwise he would be punished or executed. Shin went to primary and secondary school while in the camp. The secondary school was \\"little more than slave quarters from which he was sent out as a rock picker, weed puller and dam laborer.\\" At one point, a young girl was beaten to death by the teacher for hoarding a few kernels of corn. His education did not include propaganda or even basic information about North Korea. The personality cult around Kim Il-Sung and Kim Jong-Il was also absent; for example there were no portraits of the Kim leaders on display.Harden 2012, p. 27. The camp was near a hydroelectric dam and mines in which the prisoners were forced to labour. In one of Shin's prison cells, where he was held during an interrogation, he said he had electricity and running water. Shin's mother lived in a house with multiple rooms in a \\"model village\\" in the camp, given to women who had children.Harden 2012, pp. 17-18. Shin experienced considerable violence in the camp,NKDB 2011, p. 261. and witnessed dozens of executions every year. Part of Shin's right middle finger was cut off by his supervisor as punishment for accidentally breaking a sewing machine.NKDB 2011, p. 289. He witnessed adult prisoners and children beaten every day,NKDB 2011, p. 422.NKDB 2011, p. 425. and many prisoners dying of starvation, illness, torture and work accidents. He learned to survive by any means, including eating rats, frogs, and insects, and reporting fellow inmates for rewards. =Mother and brother plan to escape= When Shin was 13 years old, he overheard his mother and brother planning an escape attempt. Shin had just finished eating watery corn porridge, and was trying to sleep until he overheard that He Geun, his brother, had run from the cement factory. Shin's mother Jang was preparing rice, a symbol of wealth in North Korea, for the escape from Camp 14. Shin was jealous his brother was getting rice. Shin's teacher was already in the gated Bowiwon village, so Shin told the night guard of his school with another boy, as informing was something he was taught to do from an early age, and he hoped to be rewarded.Harden 2012, pp. 51-52. However, the school night guard took full credit for discovering the plan, and rather than being rewarded, Shin was arrested and guards tortured him for four days to extract more information, believing him to be part of the plan to escape.Harden 2012, pp. 54-59. According to Shin, the guards lit a charcoal fire under his back and forced a hook into his skin so that he could not struggle which caused many large scars still visible on his body. On 29 November 1996, after approximately seven months spent in a tiny concrete prison cell, he was released and joined by his father, who had also been imprisoned. They were driven back to the main camp wearing blindfolds and their hands tied behind their backs. Camp officials then forced Shin and his father to watch the public executions of Shin's mother and brother; he then understood he had been responsible for the executions. Shin stated that at the time of the executions of his brother and mother, in his teenaged mind he felt they \\"deserved\\" their fates for both breaking prison rules and, conversely, not including him in the escape plan.Harden 2012, p. 66. Shin has since expressed remorse over his actions, saying in an interview with Anderson Cooper for the CBS television show 60 Minutes, \\"My mother and brother, if I could meet them through a time machine, I would like to go back and apologize\\". In interviews to South Korea's National Intelligence Service and others, and in his Korean language memoir, Shin had said that he had no prior knowledge of the escape. It was only when talking to Harden that he revised his story and said that he had informed on his mother and brother.Harden 2012, p. 47. =Escape with Park= While working at a textile factory, Shin became friends with a 40-year-old political prisoner from Pyongyang (surnamed Park), who was educated and had traveled outside North Korea. Park had been to East Germany and China. Park said that he shook Kim Jong Il's hand. Park told him about the outside world, such as stories about food that Shin had not experienced before.Harden 2012, pp. 97-99. According to Shin, nearly every meal he had eaten up to that point had been a soupy gruel of cabbage, corn, and salt, with occasional wild-caught rats and insects. He was excited by the idea of being able to eat as much food as he wanted to, which Shin considered to be the essence of freedom. \\"I still think of freedom as roasted chicken,\\" he later acknowledged. Shin decided to attempt to escape with Park.Harden 2012, p. 104. They formed a plan in which Shin would provide local information about the camp, while Park would use his knowledge once outside the camp to escape the country. On 2 January 2005, the pair was assigned to a work detail near the camp's electric fence on the top of a mountain ridge to collect firewood. Noting the long interval between the guards' patrols, the two waited until the guards were out of sight, then made their attempt to escape. Park attempted to go through first, but was fatally electrocuted climbing the high voltage fence. Shin managed to pass over the wire using Park's body as a shield to ground the current, but still suffered severe burns and permanent scars when his legs slipped onto the lowermost wire as he crawled over Park's body.Harden 2012, pp. 115-116. After escaping, Shin broke into a nearby farmer's barn and found an old military uniform.Harden 2012, p. 118. Wearing the uniform, he was able to masquerade as a North Korean soldier at times. He survived by scrounging and stealing food. Shin was unfamiliar with money, but within two days of his escape, he had sold a bag of rice stolen from a house and used the money to buy cookies and cigarettes. Eventually, he reached the northern border with China along the Tumen River and bribed destitute North Korean border guards with food and cigarettes.Harden 2012, pp. 139-140. Revision in 2015 In January 2015, Shin contacted Blaine Harden and recanted parts of his story. Harden outlined the changes to Shin's account in a new foreword to his book, Escape from Camp 14, but did not revise every detail. He said a complete revision of the book would have taken months and he wanted to publish the new version as soon as possible. Shin told Harden that he had changed some dates and locations and incorporated some \\"fictive elements\\" into the story. Shin said that he did not spend his entire North Korean life at Camp 14. He said that he was born there, but when he was young, his family was transferred to the less severe Camp 18, and spent several years there. He said that not only did he inform on the escape plan of his mother and brother, but also falsely implicated them in murder. He said that he twice escaped from Camp 18. The first time, in 1999, he was caught within days. The second time, in 2001, he said he crossed into China, but was caught after four months by Chinese police and sent back to North Korea. He said that he was tortured in Camp 14 in 2002, when he was 20 years old (not 13, as previously stated), as punishment for his escape. He said he was repeatedly burned and tortured in an underground prison for six months. As a result of education in Camp 18, and his previous escapes, he said he wasn't as naive about the outside world when he made his final escape from Camp 14 as he had previously described. In Escape from Camp 14 Blaine Harden commented that, \\"Shin was the only available source of information about his early life.\\"Harden 2012, p. 46. In his new foreword for the book in 2015, he described Shin as an \\"unreliable narrator\\" and commented that, \\"It seems prudent to expect new revisions\\", but also clarifying \\"I don‚Äôt know if that's true (that the story will change)\\". Harden theorized that \\"Shin appears to have been exposed to prolonged and repeated torture. We can expect that this would have a major impact on every aspect of who he is, on his memory, his emotional regulation, his ability to relate to others, his willingness to trust, his sense of place in the world, and the way he gives his testimony.\\" A Russian-born Korean specialist Andrei Lankov commented that \\"some suspicions had been confirmed when Shin suddenly admitted what many had hitherto suspected\\", described Harden's book as unreliable, and noted that defectors faced considerable psychological pressure to embroider their stories.See also Some defectors said his testimony is \\"completely lies\\". A former member of South Korea's National Intelligence Service said Shin had never lived in a \\"prison camp\\". The writer Simon Winchester commented that the \\"authority\\" of the UN Commission of Inquiry report was \\"somewhat challenged\\" by this revelation. Shin explained he did not tell the full story because he wished to hide \\"that my mother and brother were executed because of my report,\\" saying \\"the most important reason why I could not reveal all of the truth was because of my family.\\" He went on to say \\"All I did until last September was discuss the camps as they were, but once the video was released [of his father], the nastiness of North Korea infuriated me. Then I realized I should not hold anything back.\\" Post-North Korea life US Secretary of State John Kerry listens to Shin Dong-hyuk speak about his experiences in North Korea. After spending some time working as a laborer in different parts of China, Shin was accidentally discovered by a journalist in a restaurant in Shanghai, and the reporter recognized the importance of his story. The journalist brought Shin to the South Korean embassy for asylum,Harden 2012, pp. 157-158. and from there he traveled to South Korea, where he underwent extensive questioning from authorities to determine if he was a North Korean assassin or spy. Afterwards, his story was broadcast by the press and he published a Korean language memoir. Shin later moved to southern California, changing his name from Shin In Geun to Shin Dong-hyuk in \\"an attempt to reinvent himself as a free man,\\"Harden 2012, p. 1. and worked for Liberty in North Korea (LiNK), a non-profit organization that raises awareness of human rights issues in North Korea and provides aid to North Korean refugees. Shin moved back to South Korea to campaign for the eradication of the North Korean prison camps. In August 2013, Shin gave several hours of testimony to the United Nations' first commission of inquiry into human rights abuses of North Korea. A member of the UN commission described Shin as the world's \\"single strongest voice\\" on the atrocities inside North Korean camps. Shin described some aspects of his personal life in South Korea in a Financial Times interview on popular culture saying that \\"I don't really know anything about music. I can't sing and I don't feel any emotion from it. But I do watch lots of films and the one that moves me the most is Schindler's List\\". On food he says \\"I know everything is delicious. I look at the colours and the way the food is presented on the plate but it's very difficult to choose. When I first came to South Korea, I was so greedy that I used to order too much food. Nowadays I try to order only as much as I can handle.\\" Although Shin lives in South Korea, he was informally adopted by an American couple in Ohio during his time in the United States. He says he maintains the relationship, \\"I have a good relationship with my US foster parents. I contact them often. Whenever I have a holiday, I visit them. I think of them as good parents and I try to be a good son.\\" In December 2013, Shin wrote an open letter in the Washington Post to American basketball star Dennis Rodman who visited North Korea a number of times as a self-avowed \\"friend for life\\" of Kim Jong-un. On June 30, 2017 Shin Dong-hyuk became a father. His wife Leeann gave birth to Lucas Yohan Shin. North Korean response In 2012, when the United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention asked the North Korean government about the status of Shin Dong-hyuk's father, they responded that there was no such person. Then in 2014, after identifying Shin Dong-hyuk as Shin In Geun, the North Korean government produced a video which attempted to discredit Shin through interviews with his father and other supposed witnesses. His father denied Shin had grown up in a prison camp. According to the video, Shin had worked in a mine and fled North Korea after being accused of raping a 13-year-old girl. It also said that Shin's mother and brother were guilty of murder. The video claimed he was now spreading \\"preposterous false information\\" about human rights. Shin confirmed the man was his father. He said that the rape allegation was a fabrication that he had heard before. He later confirmed that his mother and brother were convicted of murder, but stated they were innocent. Shin said that he believed the North Korean government was sending him a message to be quiet about human rights abuses or his father would be killed, in effect holding his father hostage. The video prompted Shin to recant parts of his story. In 2015, North Korea produced another video about Shin Dong Hyuk. On September 24, 2014, the DPRK Permanent Representative Department to the United Nations issued a communique refuting the DPRK human rights report, including the \\"full text of the Shin Dong-hyuk information (Ïã†ÎèôÌòÅ ÏûêÎ£åÏ†ÑÎ¨∏).\\" Next to the information also given in the videos, it included additional information on Shin's birth place and his father: Shin was allegedly born in Soksan-ri, Pukchang, South Pyongan Province (ÌèâÏïàÎÇ®ÎèÑ Î∂ÅÏ∞ΩÍµ∞ ÏÑùÏÇ∞Î¶¨)and later moved into Pongchang-ri, Pukchang, South Pyongan Province (ÌèâÏïàÎÇ®ÎèÑ Î∂ÅÏ∞ΩÍµ∞ Î¥âÏ∞ΩÎ¶¨). He had committed an illegal border crossing to China and had been repatriated in 2002. Shin's father was born in 1944 in Ryongbuk-ri, Mundok, South Pyongan Province, not 1946. It was said that his father have married Shin's mother in 1972 and sent to a prison in 1975 for theft of state property (Íµ≠Í∞ÄÏû¨ÏÇ∞ÎûµÏ∑®ÌñâÏúÑÏ£Ñ). Books and films In 2012, journalist Blaine Harden published Escape from Camp 14: One Man's Remarkable Odyssey From North Korea to Freedom in the West, based on his interviews with Shin. Harden gave a one-hour interview about the book on the C-SPAN television program Q&A.;Blaine Harden discusses his historical narrative, Escape From Camp 14: One Man's Remarkable Odyssey from North Korea to Freedom in the West, Q&A; with Blaine Harden, C-SPAN video library, 11 April 2012. Executive Director of the US Committee for Human Rights in North Korea, Greg Scarlatoiu, said the book played \\"an important role\\" in raising wider public awareness of the North Korean camps. Dalhousie University issued a statement averring that Shin's story, as told through the book, \\"has shifted the global discourse about North Korea, shining a light on the human rights abuses so prevalent within the regime.\\" A German documentary, Camp 14: Total Control Zone, directed by Marc Wiese, was released in 2012. It includes interviews with Shin Dong-hyuk and two former North Korean officers: the first, Kwon Hyuk, was a guard in Camp 22 and brought out amateur film footage (the only known footage of Camp 22), and the second, Oh Yang-nam, was a secret policeman who arrested people who were sent to camps. Supplementing the film are animated sequences of the camp created by Ali Soozandeh. On 2 December 2012, Shin was featured on 60 Minutes during which he recounted to Anderson Cooper his story of his life in Camp 14 and escape. Shin said \\"when I see videos of the Holocaust it moves me to tears. I think I am still evolving‚Äîfrom an animal to a human.\\" Awards and honours In June 2013, Shin received the Moral Courage Award given by UN Watch, a Geneva-based NGO (non-governmental organization). In May 2014, Shin was awarded an honorary Doctor of Laws degree from Dalhousie University (Nova Scotia, Canada). Students at the university \\"held a peace march and launched a social media campaign to raise awareness of human rights violations in North Korea. They then fundraised to bring Mr. Shin to Halifax, where his speech to an over- capacity crowd drew international attention.\\" See also * Human rights in North Korea References Further reading External links * ‚Äì Shin Dong-hyuk discusses his escape from North Korea. * ‚Äì Shin Dong-hyuk talks about his experience in Kaechon internment camp * ‚Äì Overview of North Korean prison camps with testimonies and satellite photographs * - Interview with Blaine Harden * Shin Dong-hyuk Freedom Collection interview * Fifield, Anna (15 February 2015). \\"Trauma, shame made North Korean defector alter story, author says\\".

Wounded and was awarded several medals in the fighting in the Carpathians and the Dnieper basin. ;Promotions: *1914 Captain *1916 Lieutenant Colonel = Czechoslovak Service in Russia = From December 1917 he was Commanding Officer 3rd Rifle Regiment (of Jan ≈Ωi≈æka z Trocnova) (took office in February 1918). From May 1918 he was Senior military commander of the Czechoslovak Legion in the area of Chelyabinsk and was also a member of the Military Collegium of the Provisional Executive Committee of the Czecho-Slovak army in Russia: a body heading the Czechoslovak armed forces that opposed the Bolsheviks. During the night of 26 to 27 May 1918, commanding the 2nd and 3rd Czechoslovak infantry regiments, he took Chelyabinsk with no losses. On 27 May 1918 he was appointed Commander of the army units of the Chelyabinsk and Ural front. As a result of hostilities in May - June 1918 in Chelyabinsk he was joined by the troops of the Siberian Tatar group of Czechoslovak troops under the command of Czech general Radola Gajda. On 11 June 1918 he was promoted, by decision of the Chelyabinsk branch of the Czechoslovak National Council, to the rank of colonel and was appointed to lead the Western Group of Forces (2nd and 3rd Czechoslovak Rifle Regiments and the Kurgan infantry battalion). In June 1918 he took Troitsk and Zlatoust, then in July was sent to the Urals. After taking Yekaterinburg on 25 July he stayed in Yekaterinburg. In August‚ÄìSeptember 1918 his group was expanded by groups from the 2nd Infantry Division and was then fighting in the area of Yekaterinburg, Nizhny Tagil, Kungur and Tyumen. Colonel Wojciechowski personally led the battles to capture the Verkh-Neyvinsky plant, leading a group of Czechs. They moved along the east coast of Tavatuy Lake and took Nizhny Tagil. On 17 October 1918 \\"for distinction in combat and distinguished service\\" he was promoted by the Czechoslovak National Council to major-general and appointed commander of the Samara group of troops of the Government Directorate. He commanded defensive battles in the Volga region: not only did he stop the advance of the Red forces, but he threw them back across the Ik River, securing a firmer footing on the white Samara front. In an era of increasing contrasts between the command of the Czechoslovak army and the Supreme Ruler Aleksandr Kolchak he supported the latter. = Army General under Admiral Kolchak = On 8 March 1919 he returned to the Russian service (in the army of the Supreme ruler Kolchak) with the rank of major-general. He was appointed commander of the 2nd Ufa Corps, which headed part of the White Russian forces in the spring offensive of 1919, in the battles of Ufa, Zlatoust and Chelyabinsk. Major-general Wojciechowski was awarded the Order of St. George 4th degree in July 1919 for having captured Chelyabinsk, Troitsk, Chrysostom, and Yekaterinburg in 1918. From August 1919 he was Commander of the Ufa group of troops. During the Tobolsk White offensive on 1 September 1919 despite the plight of his right flank, he completely fulfilled his task of flanking the 27th Red Infantry Division. Then he turned his force northwards during the battle and destroyed the enemy on the Siberian Army front, than let her go ahead, although it is early in the course of the failed counter-attack. During this period on 12 September 1919 Major-general Wojciechowski was awarded the Order of St. George in the 3rd degree. From 1 October 1919 he was Commander of the 2nd Army. As a supporter of strict discipline he personally shot and killed, on 20 November 1919 in the village of Ust-Tarka, Major-General P. P. Grivin for unauthorized abandonment of his front that forced the retreat of Wojciechowski's southern group. Then the troops appointed a new commander and he ordered them to return to the abandoned position. = The Great Siberian Ice March = After the death of General Vladimir Kappel on 25 January 1920 during the Great Siberian Ice March, Major-General Wojciechowski succeeded him as Chief of the Eastern Front.(Kappel with an order dated 21 January 1920 handed Command to Wojciechowski) He supervised the entrance of the White Army into Irkutsk and on 30 January 1920 destroyed the red troops in that area and on 1 February 1920 also took the suburb of Cherm. Later, he led fierce fighting near Irkutsk, where his army was weakened by an epidemic of typhus. Kolchak demanded the surrender of the reds and the gold reserves, and the supply of the white troops with food, fodder, and warm clothing. On hearing that Kolchak had been shot, Major-General Wojciechowski did not storm Irkutsk: instead two Infantry units skirted the city and the Angara river up to Lake Baikal and on 14 February in a surprise attack floated troops across from the eastern shore. He brought out the remnants of Kolchak's troops across Lake Baikal. On 20 February 1920, General Grigory Semyonov appointed him commander of the Russian eastern regions. From 5 to 6 March 1920, Major-General Wojciechowski successfully withdrew his forces from the area around Krasnoyarsk. But in May 1920, Wojciechowski was seconded to the Crimea to establish a connection with the Armed Forces of South Russia, becoming the Army Reserve of General Wrangel. In November 1920, together with his troops he was evacuated to Constantinople, and then moved to Czechoslovakia. = Army General of the Czechoslovak Republic = On 1 May 1921 he was appointed to serve in the Czechoslovak army and served in different posts in the following years as follows: *Sep 1921 - Feb 1922 Commander of the 24th infantry Brigade. *Feb 1922 - 1924 Deputy Commander of the Subcarpathian Military Region in Uzhgorod *1924 - 1927 Commander of the 9th infantry division in Trnava *1927 - 1935 Head of the Land of the military district in Brno *1935 - 1938 Head of the Prague military district. On 30 December 1929 was promoted to the rank of Army General. In September and October 1938 he was in command of the 1st Czechoslovak Army. During the Munich crisis of 1938 he took an active anti- capitulatory position (at that time one of the advocates of surrender was General Jan Syrov√Ω) and for that in April 1939 he was discharged. In 1939, after German occupation of Czechoslovakia, he created and headed an underground organization called Obrana n√°roda (\\"Defence of the nation\\"). He was under surveillance by the Gestapo and was a member of the underground Czechoslovak government where he served as Minister of War.  Post-War fate  On 12 May 1945, despite being a Czechoslovak citizen, Wojciechowski was captured in Prague by a Soviet military counter-intelligence commando SMERSH and immediately abducted to Moscow. The warrant was only issued on 30 May 1945, two days after he was interned in Lefortovo prison. On 15 September 1945, he was sentenced in absentia to 10 years in prison for 'anti-Soviet activity'. After the trial, Wojciechowski was moved to Butyrka prison, awaiting another transfer to Unzhlag GULAG camp. On 25 May 1949, he was transferred again, this time to a recently established special GULAG camp MVD Ozerlag for political prisoners in Irkutsk Oblast. Due to his advanced age, he was assigned a job of an orderly. The post-war Czechoslovak government didn't take any action in relation to Wojciechowski's disappearance. On 17 September 1945, unaware of its general's whereabouts, the Czechoslovak Ministry of Foreign Affairs consulted the Ministries of Defense and Interior if the government should seek explanation and Wojciechowski's release from the Soviet authorities. The Ministry of Interior headed by the communist minister [V√°clav Nosek] declared such an intervention as 'undesirable'. In 1949, after the communist putsch, the Czechoslovak communist government stripped Wojciechowski of his military rank and the communist propaganda labelled him as a counter- revolutionary. Sergei Wojciechowski died in the Ozerlag camp on 7 April 1951, aged 67. He was rehabilitated after the fall of the communist regime in Czechoslovakia. In 1997, he was awarded the Order of the White Lion in memoriam by V√°clav Havel, the then President of the Czech Republic. In 2004, a certificate dated 1996 of Wojciechowski's rehabilitation by the Russian Public Prosecutor's office was delivered to the Czech embassy in Moscow.

History A worshiping community of Syrian Christian adherents existed in Thazhathangady dating back to the 12th century AD. Thazhathangady was the headquarters of the Thekkumkoor (Thekkumkur) Rajas who ruled over a principality which includes the larger parts of the present Kottayam and Idukki districts.

In 1973, KHC originated its first bond issue totaling $51.2 million and received its first allocation from the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) for 623 Section 8 New Construction units totaling $1.9 million. In-house mortgage loan underwriting and the Kentucky Appalachian Housing Programs were established in 1976. In 1978, the debt ceiling was raised by the General Assembly from $400 million to $700 million. KHC purchased Wheelwright, Kentucky an abandoned coal company town in eastern Kentucky, to rehab and resell housing to its residents in 1979. =1980s= KHC‚Äôs debt ceiling was raised to $1.125 billion by the General Assembly in 1982.

Three new KHC programs were added in 1985, Senior and Special Needs Housing Program, Homeownership Trust Fund for 1-6 percent loans, and the Kentucky Indoor Plumbing Program. In that same year, KHC purchased property at 1225 and 1231 Louisville Road in Frankfort, Kentucky, to construct a new office building. In 1987, the Housing Foundation, a 501(c)3 nonprofit, was established to attract charitable contributions for affordable housing. Also in 1987, KHC was appointed to administer the federal Low-Income Housing Tax Credit Program for Kentucky.

In 1992, the Affordable Housing Trust Fund (AHTF) was established by the General Assembly, without a designated permanent funding source, to serve the state‚Äôs lowest- income population with critical housing needs. KHC began administering all federal McKinney‚ÄìVento Homeless Assistance Act homeless funding programs in 1993 and received a $400,000 grant from HUD in 1994 for the HOPE Rental Assistance Program. The Housing Policy Advisory Committee was created by the General Assembly in 1996 to establish state policy on housing issues. In 1997, KHC contributed to the Jimmy Carter Work Project, Hammering in the Hills, and participated with Habitat for Humanity in eastern Kentucky including sponsorship of two house builds. In 1998, KHC provided housing assistance to 253 households rendered homeless by the 1997 Ohio River Valley flood. Later that year, the AHTF received allocation of unclaimed lottery winnings in excess of $6 million annually received by the General Assembly for the next biennium. In 1999, KHC received a HUD grant of $290,281 to expand homeownership education and counseling programs and the AHTF was funded by unclaimed lottery winnings totaling $5.8 million. =2000‚Äì2005= In 2000, the General Assembly raised KHC‚Äôs debt ceiling to $2.5 billion, as well as continued the allocation of unclaimed lottery winnings for the AHTF for another two years. Morehead State University was contracted in 2001 to conduct a statewide homeless study and the University of Louisville was contracted to conduct a statewide housing needs assessment. KHC‚Äôs Board of Directors adopted a universal design policy to require building concepts that support minimal alteration to accommodate changing needs of current and future residents. Also in 2001, the First Appalachian Housing Summit was hosted by Kentucky Housing Corporation in Prestonsburg, Kentucky. In 2002, KHC was one of eight state HFAs selected to participate in the National Homeless Policy Academy by HUD and the United States Department of Health and Human Services. The General Assembly adopted federal income guidelines in qualifying home buyers rather than using the lower state income guidelines. KHC‚Äôs Board of Directors also raised the maximum home purchase price from $99,000 to $144,000. The AHTF received funds of $6.2 million designated by the General Assembly following discontinuance of the lottery appropriation in 2003. Also in 2003, KHC received a grant for $454,280 from the Corporation for Supportive Housing to integrate state systems, help establish 532 units of supportive housing, and increase awareness of the need for supportive housing. In 2004, KHC established regional offices. Also, KHC‚Äôs Renaissance Kentucky program named Hodgenville, Kentucky, as the 100th participating community and the National Council of State Housing Agencies (NCSHA) recognized KHC for the HouseWorks program. Governor Ernie Fletcher launched Recovery Kentucky in 2005 to reduce chronic homelessness for drug and alcohol addicted Kentuckians and charged KHC with the administration of the program. A new Housing Choice Voucher to Homeownership program was started for Section 8 rental assistance participants and a statewide, Don‚Äôt Borrow Trouble task force was established to raise awareness of predatory lending. =2006‚Äì2010= In 2006, Kentucky‚Äôs Ten-Year Plan to End Chronic Homelessness was unveiled by Governor Fletcher, legislation establishing a permanent funding source for AHTF was passed by the General Assembly, and Hurricane Katrina victims were helped by KHC with housing assistance. That same year, KHC had $500 million in more than 5,000 home loans and raised the maximum home purchase price to $200,000 and the income level up to $90,440. Ground was broken for seven Recovery Kentucky centers in 2006 and supportive housing was provided to 776 individuals who were victims of domestic violence, persons with mental illness, and homeless families, through the new Safe Havens program designed to help end chronic homelessness. KHC celebrated its 35th anniversary in 2007. Lee Square, a 27-home community renovation project in Bowling Green, was also opened. A Recovery Kentucky center development broke ground in Owensboro, Kentucky, and another center opened in Henderson, Kentucky. A new Scholar House development broke ground in Bowling Green and another was under construction in Louisville. In 2008, Governor Steve Beshear established the Recovery Kentucky Task Force to further help Kentuckians through the Recovery Kentucky program. Three Recovery Kentucky centers opened in Florence, Morehead, and Richmond. The Kentucky Homeownership Protection Center was created by the General Assembly to help homeowners avoid foreclosure, which absorbed the Don‚Äôt Borrow Trouble task force. KHC participated with the federal Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008, created to address the subprime mortgage crisis. KHC‚Äôs bond ceiling was increased from $2.5 billion to $5 billion. HUD awarded a record $17.2 million in grants to help fund 76 homeless programs. The first two Scholar House facilities opened in Louisville and Owensboro. Staff conducted the KHC Listening Tour to learn of local affordable housing needs across the state. In 2009, in conjunction with the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, KHC launched Kentucky‚Äôs Housing and Emergency Assistance Reaching The Homeless program in addition to the Tax Credit Assistance, Tax Credit Monetization, and Weatherization Assistance Programs. Also, the Kentucky Homeownership Protection Center received a $1.5 million grant to provide counseling services. Two Recovery Kentucky centers were opened in Erlanger and Harlan and a Scholar House opened in Bowling Green. In 2010, KHC hit historic lows for interest rates. Funding A portion of KHC's funds comes from the interest earned through the sale of tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds. KHC also operates through the receipt of fees for administering federal programs including rental assistance that makes housing available to low-income Kentuckians. Programs/Functions KHC‚Äôs programs and/or functions include rental housing and home production financing, homeownership, education and/or counseling towards homeownership, rental assistance, housing rehabilitation, home repair initiatives, loan servicing, special needs housing, and ending homelessness initiatives. Leadership =Board of directors= KHC is governed by a 15-member Board of Directors consisting of ten private members appointed by the governor who represent designated interests in affordable housing (home construction industry, nonprofit housing organizations, financial institutions, consumers, financial professionals, local government, real estate practitioners, state building trades council, homeless, and manufactured housing). The private members serve four-year terms. The five public members are state government officials whose participation on the Board is part of the responsibilities of their positions (lieutenant governor, attorney general, secretary of the Finance and Administration Cabinet, secretary of the Economic Development Cabinet, and the commissioner of the Department for Local Government). Regular meetings of the Board of Directors will be held at KHC‚Äôs offices in Frankfort, Kentucky, unless otherwise designated by the Board. There are three standing committees of the Board (Executive, Finance, and Communications) that meet on an as- needed basis. The public and press are notified of all meetings in accordance with the Kentucky Open Meetings Law.

It was supposedly brought by Jewish refugees from the destruction of Jerusalem and buried by expelled Jews around 1494, before they left the island. Whether it was the original Golden Calf is open to interpretation. Legend A farmer named Sidor is supposed to have had unearthed a golden horn from the Calf in one of his fields, after having been told of the statue by a stranger. He asked a merchant named Pupull for advice on selling the statue, but the merchant tricked him into turning the statue over to him for a few coins. When the farmer's wife found out, she became angry and told her neighbours about the deal. The story reached the ears of the grand-master who sent men to investigate. Concerned, Pupull and the hakem (governor) hid the statue, fooling the men. Finally the grand master himself came to investigate. He became suspicious after meeting the hakem and talked to the farmer who told him the whole story. The hakem was dismissed from his post. Pupull refused to tell where he had hidden it. He was imprisoned in the dungeons of Fort St Angelo, but died under torture without revealing the location of the Calf. Another version of the legend changes the merchant to a goldsmith, Calogero. Factual version A cave was discovered in 1729 near Inland Sea, Dwejra Point, that once held the statue of a golden calf on a solid gold pedestal. Some of the details of the legend match with this story, naming the grand master as Manoel de Vilhena. Pupull's name is given as Dr. Cassar. Count CiantarLikely Gio Antoine Ciantar, a Maltese historian states that on Ghelmus hill near ≈ªebbuƒ°, Gozo a golden calf was found in 1729.Ciantar, Book I Note X, ¬ß XXIII Baron Bali de Stadl wrote a dissertation about it. It was likely of Phoenician origin.

The highway's western terminus is at SR 269 approximately south of Bellevue. The eastern terminus of SR 547 is at the concurrency of U.S. Route 20 (US 20) and SR 18 in downtown Monroeville. Located in western Huron County, State Route 547 traverses primarily rural terrain excepting the easternmost stretch of the highway through Monroeville. It came into being in the late 1930s, and has not seen any significant changes since that time. SR 547's western endpoint is situated on the Seneca-Huron county line, which serves as the western boundary of the historic Firelands and Connecticut Western Reserve. Route description The entirety of SR 547 is situated within Huron County. No portion of this route is included as a part of the National Highway System. SR 547 begins at the intersection of SR 269 and Township Road 186 on the Seneca-Huron county line approximately south of Bellevue. The vast majority of SR 547's path is in rural farm country, passing a house here and there along the way. Heading due east from the SR 269 intersection into Sherman Township, the state highway arrives at its junction with SR 4 just from its starting point. East of there, the route turns northeasterly, and as it passes a large clump of trees that abut the north side of the road, it meets Hayman Road. Crossing into Lyme Township, SR 547 next crosses Section Line Road. Continuing northeast through the vast farmland, the state highway passes intersections with Dogtown Road, Sand Hill Road and Townline Road, just past which the route enters Ridgefield Township. SR 547 then crosses T-intersections with Williams Road and Farr Road, after which it enters the village of Monroeville. At that point, the highway picks up the name Monroe Street, and passes into a backdrop that is primarily residential. After crossing the Wheeling and Lake Erie Railway tracks, the highway arrives at its junction with SR 99, a four-way stop intersection. SR 547 continues easterly through the residential portion of Monroeville prior to entering the central business district, where it comes to an end at the signalized intersection it has with the concurrency of US 20 and SR 18. History SR 547 was designated in 1937 along the routing that it occupies to this day between SR 269 and US 20/SR 18\\\\. The highway has not experienced any major changes to its routing since it was first designated. Major intersections Truck State Route 547 As SR 547 follows narrow two-lane Monroe Street through Monroeville between SR 99 and US 20/SR 18, trucks are prohibited from this stretch of highway. Consequently, a Truck State Route 547 (SR 547 Truck) is signed, starting from the junction of SR 547 and SR 99, following SR 99 north to US 20/SR 18, then following the concurrency southeasterly to downtown Monroeville intersection marking SR 547's eastern terminus, which doubles as the truck route's endpoint.

Cyrus McCormick III, in his Century of the Reaper, called Manny \\"the most brilliant and successful of all [Cyrus McCormick I's] competitors,\\". a field of many brilliant people. Life John Henry Manny was born November 28, 1825 in Amsterdam, New York. His father was Pells Manny and mother was Sarah Swart. Siblings included Josiah Manny, Eliza Manny, Rebecca Ann Manny, and Gabriel Manny. He moved to Waddams Township in Stephenson County, Illinois, in the early 1850s. The Mannys visited George Esterly (1809‚Äì1893) who was manufacturing some of the first mechanical grain harvesting machines in Heart Prairie, near modern-day Janesville Wisconsin a short distance to the north. Manny helped in the shop to produce one and brought it back with him. Manny married Mary Dorr in 1853, and by the fall of 1853 moved to Rockford, Illinois. There he could have more reapers manufactured by the firm Blinn & Emerson, and have them transported on the Galena and Chicago Union Railroad line. In 1854 he formed J.H. Manny & Company with investors Wait and Sylvester Talcott. In the summer of 1854 Jess Blinn and Ralph Emerson (1831‚Äì1914) joined the company. Reaper John Henry Manny laid the foundation for the reaper business of Rockford. At the time of the invention of his reaper, he was farming with his father, Pells Manny, in Waddams Township, Stephenson County, Illinois, near McConnell, Illinois. They had a large crop of wheat and wanted a machine to cut it. The Mannys had heard that George Esterly, of Wisconsin, was making machines that would harvest grain. They visited Esterly to buy one of his machines but found that he would probably not be able to get one finished for them in time for their harvest. John H. Manny remained with Esterly at his shop to help him complete the \\"header\\", the part with the cutter bar. It was this insight into the construction of harvesting machinery that inspired the Manny family to develop their own reaper. Subsequently the Mannys conceived the idea of creating a number of additional reapers that were to be sold to neighboring farmers. There weren't any railroads through the country at this time, except a line to Rockford, so John Henry Manny and those interested in building his machine went to Rockford in the fall of 1853. In the spring of 1854, the Talcott brothers, Wait and Sylvester along with Jess Blinn and Ralph Emerson organized J.H. Manny & Co. Between 1855 and 1856 this new company manufactured about 6,000 machines for harvest.. reaper and twine binder in 1884 that was part of the McCormick Reaper patent case Cyrus McCormick filed a lawsuit against Manny for patent infringement in 1855, styled McCormick v. Manny. McCormick demanded that Manny stop producing reapers, and pay McCormick US$400,000. The trial, originally scheduled for Chicago, Illinois in September 1855, had prominent lawyers on both sides. McCormick hired former US Attorney General Reverdy Johnson and New York patent attorney Edward Nicholl Dickerson. Manny hired Edwin M. Stanton who hired local Illinois lawyer Abraham Lincoln. However, the trial was moved to Cincinnati, Ohio. Although Manny won the case, with an opinion by Supreme Court Judge John McLean, U.S. District Court of Ohio record Lincoln ended up not contributing to the defense. After later being elected President, Lincoln chose Stanton as his Secretary of War. See Abraham Lincoln's patent. John H. Manny died in 1856 of a stomach illness and the manufacturing of his machine was then carried on by the Talcott brothers and Ralph Emerson until 1860, when Mr. Emerson bought out his partners and associated himself with William A. Talcott. Following the death of Manny the firm was known as Talcott, Emerson, & Co. After Manny's death on January 31, 1856, McCormick appealed the case to the United States Supreme Court. McCormick lost again. The firm meanwhile had continued to manufacture reapers as Talcott, Emerson & Company. In 1860 Emerson bought out the other partners, and then the name was changed back to Talcott, Emerson & Company about 1874. Emerson (who was a cousin of poet Ralph Waldo Emerson) ran the company until it became Emerson-Brantingham in 1909 under the leadership of Charles S. Brantingham. The company purchased a number of other manufacturers including Reeves & Co, but by 1915 ran into financial difficulties. After a merger with the former D. M. Osborne company, in 1928 it was bought by J. I. Case Company, now Case Corporation. Manny's widow married Robert Hall Tinker in 1870 and lived the house now called Tinker Swiss Cottage. John Henry Manny is sometimes confused with John Pels Manny, a cousin.

Liberty View Farm is named for its view of the Shawangunk Ridge and for \\"liberty\\" from pesticides and conventional farming practices. The organically grown vegetables, herbs, edible flowers, bee hives, goats for milk and cheese and 100 chickens, are maintained by van Roestenberg, and a team of interns, apprentices, volunteers, and staff. The orchard is one of many \\"Certified Naturally Grown\\" farms throughout the Northeast, a designation many smaller farms consider a more transparent, less- expensive alternative to organic certification. The farm's \\"Lease a Tree\\" program allows seasonal \\"ownership\\" of an apple tree and its produce. The \\"Charter a Chicken\\" program offers access to eggs and visitation with the renter's \\"pet\\". The farm works with local agencies, schools, and groups in order to provide internships and employment for people with various disabilities. Through the VESID program, disabled workers are given the opportunity to learn about agriculture, small business, marketing, and other aspects of farming. There are educational programs for local students to learn about sustainability, and there are classes addressing topics such as the honeybee crisis.

His newsletter and blog, \\"Cultivating Community and Farmers\\" and \\"The Frugal Farmer\\", highlight events of agricultural and political import and encourage community involvement. The farm was named among \\"America's Top Ten Apple Picking Farms\\" by Travel & Leisure Magazine American Express in 2009. The apples grown at Liberty View Farm are certified naturally grown. Political activism van Roestenberg is a political and gay rights organizer, and is involved in organic \\"food activism.\\" He sits on the Board of Eat Local Food, a group of farm market operators with the goal of bringing locally grown food to area residents. Van Roestenberg works with the food community of the Hudson Valley to increase awareness of issues and to make sustainable agriculture more accessible to more people. Some issues he is interested in include fighting hunger, living healthy, and promoting and preserving farmland. Van Roestenberg was a member of the first same-sex couple married in New York State, in New Paltz, New York, in February 2004. The wedding ceremonies, marrying 21 same-sex couples, were conducted by Mayor Jason West. Although van Roestenberg had initially planned elaborate nuptials, the civil ceremonies were organized and carried out within days of the Mayor agreeing to participate. The event attracted the attention and scrutiny of the media, the gay community, the legal community, and local law enforcement. In 2005 van Roestenberg organized Autogamy, an event which gave participants the opportunity to experience what it was like to plan his wedding. van Roestenberg served five years on the Zoning Board of Appeals, over two years on the zoning commission, and served as Vice Chair of the town Democratic Commission. Van Roestenberg made an unsuccessful bid for County Legislature on the Democratic ticket in 2005. In 2010, van Roestenberg organized the \\"Unhappy Anniversary\\" to commemorate the sixth anniversary of the New Paltz same-sex weddings. Conducted at the original site by the Village Hall, gay activists sought to bring attention to the continued lack of marriage equality in New York State and in the U.S. Awards Van Roestenberg was nominated for the Heart of Green Local Hero Award by the Daily Green in 2010, losing to Fred Schaeffer, who led the transformation of a decaying railroad bridge spanning the Hudson River into New York's newest state park, Walkway Over the Hudson.

It is recognized as a form of cyber bullying. Prevalence Due to the prevalence of mobile devices today, mobile harassment has emerged as worldwide trend. Based on recent studies, harassment involving mobile devices are particularly prevalent in the United Kingdom and Australia while in the United States, the Internet is the favoured method. In 2009, a survey in the United Kingdom showed that approximately 14 percent of the young participants reported that they had been victims of mobile harassment, ranging from name calling to sending threatening text messages, or sending photos or videos intended to frighten or intimidate. Another study out of Queensland, Australia suggests that number of victims could be even higher, finding that 93.7 percent of teenagers experienced mobile harassment of some kind. This study concluded that while boys tend to experience more mobile bullying than girls, girls are more likely to be upset about the harassment.Drennan, Judy, Mark Brown, and Gillian Sullivan Mort. 2007. The Impact of M-Bullying on Self-Esteem and Subjective Well Being Social Entrepreneurship, Social Change and Sustainability: Proceedings of the 2007 International nonprofit and Social Marketing Conference, Brisbane, Australia Researchers also revealed that about a third of adolescents have been harassed or cyberbullied. This number could still expand considering the fact that there are victims who do not recognize this kind of harassment or those who do not want to acknowledge it because it is humiliating in itself. Cases of mobile harassment often transpire outside of school but, since the perpetrators and victims are often classmates, the harassment can spill over to the school environment.  Solutions  Since mobile harassment is a relatively new phenomenon, there is a current lack of measures that specifically address the problem aside from generic legislation. However, schools often adopt policies and regulations that could help deter its incidence. For instance, administrators prohibit students from taking pictures and sharing visual materials within the school premises. There are also proposals that sought to completely ban the use of mobile devices in school. Private organizations are also increasingly adopting their respective regulatory policies to contribute to tackling the issue. This is evident in a recent decision on the part of Facebook to adopt its own internal harassment and bullying policies. The social media company, which is cited as one of the commonly used network to harass people, also adopted measures that enable them to \\"remove content that appears to purposefully target private individuals with the intention of degrading or shaming them.‚Äù  Awareness  In November 2009, LG Mobile Phones released an advertising campaign in the United States, that used humor to encourage teens to think before they text. The adverts featured James Lipton.

Ito1 is active during phase 1, causing a fast repolarization of the action potential The cardiac transient outward potassium current (referred to as Ito1 or Ito ) is one of the ion currents across the cell membrane of heart muscle cells. It is the main contributing current during the repolarizing phase 1 of the cardiac action potential. It is a result of the movement of positively charged potassium (K+) ions from the intracellular to the extracellular space. Ito1 is complemented with Ito2 resulting from Cl‚àí ions to form the transient outward current Ito. Mechanism Ito1 is rapidly activated and deactivated. It is activated after the fast increase of the membrane potential following the phase 0 of the cardiac action potential. Once activated, (K+) ions from inside the cells flow to the extracellular space. This outward flow of positively charged ions constitutes the Ito1 and causes the transmembrane voltage to decrease. This decrease of the transmembrane potential is known as repolarization. Ito1 is then quickly deactivated, stopping the repolarization and ending the phase 1 of the action potential. Ito1 is Ca2+-independent and has been clearly demonstrated in myocytes from different cardiac regions and species. There are two kinetic variants of cardiac Ito1: fast Ito1, called Ito1,f, and slow Ito, called Ito1,s. The channel responsible for Ito1,f is formed by assembly of Kv4.2 (KCND2) subunits, Kv4.3 (KCND3) subunits or a combination of the two, while the channel responsible for Ito1,s is composed of Kv1.4 (KCNA4) subunits. In addition, several regulatory subunits and pathways modulating the level and biophysical properties of cardiac Ito have been identified. Ito1 affects the opening of Ca2+ channels during Phase 2 of the Action Potential. As a result, changes in Ito1 modulate changes in the action potential duration. Role in disease *Reduction in Ito1 density is associated with prolonged action potentials and is a common finding in cardiac disease . :*Ito1 density is significantly lower in the cells of a failing heart in comparison to the cells of a healthy heart. :*There is correlation between decreased Ito1 density and atrial fibrillation. *An increase in the Ito1 density caused by a mutation in Kv4.3 can be a cause of Brugada Syndrome.

Provided from an online platform, Caitra is based on AJAX Web.2 technologies and the Moses decoder. The web page of the tool is implemented with Ruby on Rails, an open source web framework, and C++. Caitra assists human translators by offering suggestions and alternative translations. History Machine Translation (MT) systems are typically used by readers who do not need a thorough translation and want quick access to the foreign language. Professional translators usually require advanced machine translation tools to make their work easier and to give a higher quality translation to their clients. The Trans-Type project (Langlais et al., 2000) gave a pioneer approach to the MT as an aid to human translators. This translation tool would suggest different translations for a segment while providing the translator an opportunity to accept the suggested translation or overwrite it with their own translation, which in turn would trigger new potential translations to the tool. This is, however, not necessarily suitable for professional translators. Tools with post-edition facilities have also been developed as an intermediate field between typical MT and human translators in order to integrate MT and human translation and to achieve the desired results. The School of Informatics and the Machine Translation Group of the University of Edinburgh, created a research program, CAITRA, to analyze the benefits of different types of MTs and to explore the interaction between the machine and the user in order to develop new CAT tools. Properties Caitra is programmed with an open-source web framework, Ruby on Rails (Thomasand Hansson, 2008). The online platform uses Ajax-style Web 2.0 technologies (Raymond, 2007) connected to a MySQL database-driven back-end. The machine translation back-end is powered by the statistical sentence-based MT, Moses (Koehn et al., 2007). C++ is integrated to improve the speed of the process of translation suggestions. The tool is provided online by the School of Informatics as a study of the user‚Äôs interaction with the tool, as well as the ability for members suggest additional features and fixes to the program. The user inputs text into the provided text box. Caitra processes the text as the user clicks the \\"Upload\\" icon. The process may last a few minutes, and Caitra will find different options for the translation, one of them is taken by default. Once the process is finished, translators have multiple options of assistance, presented in an interface. The segment for translation is the sentence and so Caitra works with only one sentence at the same time. Interactive Machine translation The Trans-Type project (Langlais et al., 2000) has done an investigation about Interactive Machine Translation, consisting of sentence-segment translation aided by a CAT tool, which suggests several different options for the translation. The human translators may choose one of them or provide their own translation if they do not like the offered translations. This process is similar to the auto-completion tool used in several office programs. The statistical translation system is followed to generate the predictions for translation. These predictions are provided in short phrases, according to the statistical phrase-based translation model. This model also makes it easier for the user to read the predictions. The suggestions and user actions are stored in a large database. During the user interaction, Caitra quickly matches user input against a graph using a string edit distance measure. The prediction is the optimal completion path that matches the user input with (a) minimal string edit distance and (b) highest sentence translation probability. This computation takes place at the server and is implemented in C++, as Philipp Koehn explains. Once the user accepts a suggestion, a new one is displayed as well the typing of a new segment. The acceptance of suggestions depends on the pair of languages and the complexity of the text. Preliminary studies about CAITRA suggest that users usually accept 50-80% of predictions generated by the system. Translation process Once the text is uploaded, users can see the result of the machine translation and edit the text based on the predictions. The prediction table is displayed by clicking the edit icon. The text is divided into sentences, which are also divided into smaller units. Predictions for these units appear in a box, and the most likely suggestion has a different colour in the highest part of the table. Predictions are accepted by clicking on them and the system updates the election to the user input. The database is made of amounts of pairs of translated texts and translations. The most likely prediction is the result of previous matches in the database. The user's choices are scored in the database to be used in future translations. These predictions help not only professional translators, but also novice translators who do not know the vocabulary and people without knowledge of the foreign language. Post- editing Machine Translation process Users can review their translation and make any change to correct possible mistakes. The changes appear in the output display. User activity Caitra stores the allotted time in which the users accept a prediction or write their own translation. The actions have different importance for the future predictions depending on the user's actions and in the time they need to perform their translation. Every action, pause or movement is relevant in order to improve future translations.

USAMMCE's mission is to provide the best medical logistics support to the U.S. European Command. USAMMCE‚Äôs missions also include out-of-sector support to the Department of State Humanitarian Assistance Program and the U.S. Central Command in Southwest Asia. From the Gulf War through the Bosnia and Kosovo deployments, business process improvements at USAMMCE benefitted deployed forces throughout the European theater. History The United States Army Medical Materiel Center-Europe (USAMMCE) was originally activated as the Rhein Medical Depot in December 1951 in Kaiserslautern, Germany. In the spring of 1957, the Rhein Medical Depot was reorganized as the U.S. Army Medical Depot, Einsiedlerhof (USAMDE) and assumed the operation control of the 67th Medical Depot. USAMDE and the Medical Supply Division of the U.S. Army, Europe, were combined to form the U.S. Army Medical Materiel Center-Europe (USAMMCE) in October 1968. USAMMCE moved to its current location in Pirmasens, Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany, in November 1975 as part of an Army‚ÄìAir Force restationing initiative. The following medical supply, optical, and maintenance (MEDSOM) battalions were formed as subordinate units to USAMMCE in January 1980: 37th MEDSOM to support the U.S. V Corps, 428th MEDSOM to support the U.S. VII Corps, and the 226th MEDSOM to support the Communications Zone. USAMMCE was designated as the Theater Single Integrated Medical Logistics Manager in June 1986 and assumed medical logistics support responsibility for all U.S. Armed Forces serving the U.S. European Command. The 226th MEDSOM was redesignated as the 226th Medical Battalion (Logistics, Rear), the 37th was redesignated as the 37th Medical Detachment (Logistics), and the 428th as the 428th Theater Medical Materiel Management Center (TMMMC) in June 1993. In October 1994, the 226th Medical Battalion (Logistics, Rear) was redesignated as the 226th Medical Battalion (Logistics, Forward) and was assigned to the 30th Medical Brigade, and the 37th Medical Detachment and the 428th TMMMC were inactivated. Upon inactivation of the U.S. Army‚Äôs 7th Medical Command, USAMMCE was assigned to the U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command in October 1994. USAMMCE became the executive agent for the Department of State‚Äôs Humanitarian Assistance Program on 1 October 1996. In 2007, USAMMCE was designated as the TLAMM (Theater Lead Agent for Medical Materiel) for Europe. This designation allows USAMMCE to be more involved in logistical planning and coordination for two major combatant commands.

It is formed from several small tributaries that come together on the eastern slope of the Schneeberg west of the Vordorf Mill (Vordorferm√ºhle) at Trostau in the Russel forest division.  Spring tapping  A spring, impounded by granite rocks, was tapped by the town of Wunsiedel in 1930 at a height of . The source is the start point of the 44 km long R√∂slau Path, which was created in 1980 by Fichtelgebirge Club. The Seenweg path from Wei√üenst√§dter See to the Fichtelsee runs past the spring.  Course  After leaving the steep slopes and high forest on the Schneeberg the R√∂slau runs past the Vordorf Mill, turns initially southeast to Leupoldsdorf and Tr√∂stau, grazes Wunsiedel and swings gradually in an easterly and northeasterly direction. Along the way it picks up numerous brooks from the region of the Platte, Hohe Matze and K√∂sseine. Near Th√∂lau the great railway bridge on the Marktredwitz to Hof line stretches across the R√∂slau valley. Next it reaches Lorenzreuth and Seu√üen, where it is reinforced by the K√∂ssein. It flows through the narrow valley of the Gsteinigt to Arzberg and snakes through pastureland to the Schirnding. East of the village it forms Germany's boundary with the Czech Republic until it discharges into the Eger near Fischern.  Economic usage  Since the Middle Ages the river was used to drive the many hammer mills (Hammerwerke) and corn mills (Mahlm√ºhlen) along its length. The town of Wunsiedel also used the watercourse from the 16th century for timber rafting.  Origin of the name  The river was first mentioned quite late on, in 1403, under the name of Rosslin and then under various spellings. Colloquially it is called the Riasla and, on official maps, the R√∂slau. Recent research suggests the name combines words meaning \\"in lively motion, stirring\\" and \\"flowing\\" or \\"streaming\\".  Further reading  *Dietmar Herrmann: Lexikon Fichtelgebirge.

There are also ghales who reside in south Bhutan Lhotshampa who are of nepalese descent. The Ghale speaks Ghale language. Ghale is not a caste within other group, Ghale is a separate indigenous group of people in Nepal. They celebrate Ghale Lhosar . Ghale have 4 major clans, Dange, Samari, Rildi, and Pailang. Other ghale clans are listed below. Ghale is not a subcaste of Gurung, Tamang or other groups. Gurung and Ghale are separate tribes. They have their own language, clothes and tradition. Unlike most groups who sacrifice goat , the Ghale sacrifices a sheep in Dashain. More information on ghale Going more in-depth to ghale. In Bhutan there are many ghales who reside there. Maybe even more than in Nepal. These ghales in bhutan often go by Ghalley or Ghaley. (Different spelling, same meaning). It is around the 12th century when Nepalese Ghale started migrating into Bhutan, specifically the southern low lands. Ever since, they have lived in Bhutan but keep the traditional language Nepali as they are descended from Nepal]. Ghale , Gurung , Magar The Ghales are often put in subcaste with Gurungs in nepal. However like previously stated, they are two different tribes. They have a similar dialect and share some similarities but are different groups. Same goes for Magar. It is more frequent in Bhutan where Magar is sometimes associated with Ghale / Ghalley. This is again because magar language is similar to ghale language. Once again, they are different groups.

The word comes from the Arabic word ≈°awa, which means \\"grilled, roasted\\". This dish is very popular in North Africa. In Algeria and Morocco , the term m√©choui \\"refers to the method of cooking a lamb or a sheep cooked whole on the spit\\". In Tunisia, however, it applies to any piece of meat or fish grilled with embers.  Presentation  M√©choui is a dish served at the beginning of the meal, as part of a feast or diffa . With the fingers of the right hand, the host takes pieces of grilled meat and offers them to guests. Traditionally, no cutlery is used to serve a mechoui, because, due to the slow cooking of the meat, should be able to be detached without any effort. The nomadic populations, in addition to their main herd often composed of several thousand sheep, raise a small number of male lambs specifically for mechoui, feeding them with cheih, a species of wild mugwort which gives the lamb a distinctive character.  Preparation  After having slaughtered and dismembered the young lamb, all the organs of the stomach cavity are removed, with the exception of the kidneys. This cavity is stitched after being sprinkled with spices, particularly ras el hanout. The lamb is skewered on a tree branch and cooked next to a pile of embers. The spindle is rotated slowly and evenly so as to ensure evenly distributed cooking. The prepared lamb is not placed directly above the embers, for the melting fat could ignite and char the outer flesh. The cooking is started gently, so that the interior cooks almost at the same time as the outside. During cooking, the meat is brushed with melted butter or oil , to make it crispy. Gradually, the lamb is brought close to the hot embers, so that the flesh takes on an amber color. The cooking time varies according to the weight of the animal, typically about a quarter of an hour per kilogram.  Regional variations  Mechoui is prepared, especially in Morocco, by digging a vertical hole, or by constructing an earthen oven, 0.8 to 1 meter in diameter and 1.5 to 2 meters deep. Wood is stacked in this cavity and burns for five or six hours. When the earth surrounding the hole is smoking and the wood is transformed into embers and ashes, most of it is removed to avoid flare-ups. The prepared lamb is added to the oven vertically and enclosed with a lid covered with clay, mud, or wet sand, sealing the lid as well as possible. Cooking lasts four to five hours. When the lamb is done, the hardened cover is broken to remove the lamb from the oven.  Serving  Traditionally, m√©choui is served with cumin and salt, either on a plate or in a decorative serving dish. The diners sprinkle salt and cumin to taste on the lamb before eating.

School history Lowell began as nursery school in the basement of Cleveland Park Congregational Church at 34th and Lowell Streets, N.W. The annual tuition was $325.Lowell School: The First Thirty Years, self-published booklet, August 1995. Gail Shandler joined the staff in 1966 and went on to become the school's director in 1967. In 1975 the school added a kindergarten. Growing enrollment caused the school to move in 1978 to the Sixth Presbyterian Church on 16th and Kennedy Streets, N.W., making it one of the first independent schools to be located on the east side of Rock Creek Park. In 1983, 1st grade was added. In 1984, in addition to adding 2nd grade, the Parents Association was formed and renamed the Lowell Parent Community in 1984. In 1985 Annual Giving was instituted to fund financial aid to improve financial accessibility. Lowell Primary School library opened in 1986 with 400 volumes, and today it holds 10,000 volumes. In 1987, Lowell expanded to 3rd grade. A year later, Abigail Wiebenson, formerly the head of the lower school at Georgetown Day School, became the third head of school. In 1989 Lowell purchased the Himmelfarb mansion at 16th and Decatur Streets, N.W. and moved into its own building in October of that year. Lowell was accredited by the Association of Independent Maryland Schools in the 90s, and moved to its present campus on Kalmia and 16th Street NW and expanded to 5th grade. In 2001, the first 6th grade class was added. In 2007 Lowell appointed its fourth head of school, Debbie Gibbs, who had been the assistant head at Marin Country Day School in California. During Gibbs' tenure, Lowell expanded to include a middle school, adding 7th grade in 2011 and 8th grade in 2012. The Parkside Building renovation was complete in the fall of 2014, and currently houses the Middle School. Debbie Gibbs announced her retirement in 2016. In 2019, Donna Lindner, former lower school head at The Agnes Irwin School, joined Lowell as its fifth head of school. Campus The Main Building, listed on the National Register of Historic Places as the Marjorie Webster Junior College Historic District.

The Main Building contains Primary School classrooms, the Pre-Primary School rooms, a makerspace, rooftop science lab, the Primary School library and Pre-Primary Book Nook, a gym, a heated swimming pool, two art studios, and a dance studio. Parkside, located along 17th Street NW and next to Rock Creek Park, holds Middle School classrooms, an engineering fabrication lab, a science lab, the Berkeley Library, two art studios, a makerspace, woodshop, and a black box theater. Marjorie Webster House, bordering Kalmia Road, houses various administrative offices, and a second creative woodshop. A fourth building (Frazier, a former dormitory) was razed in 2016. There are three named spaces on campus including the Berkeley Library in the Middle School, the Gail Shandler playground in front of the Pre-Primary entrance, and the Debbie Gibbs back playground. =Campus History= The campus bordering Rock Creek Park has a long history. Records show that the property was a working farm called Clouin Course in the 1840s.Legal Description of Property prepared in connection with sale of property from Gallaudet College to Lowell School, 1997. Its history still exists on the campus: a 150-year-old spring house with a small pond beside it.Letter from Adrienne Coleman, Superintendent, Rock Creek Park to Lydia Gillman, Lowell School, July 16, 2001. Today the and the Kalmia Creek, which the school daylighted soon after acquiring the property, are used as outdoor classrooms where students learn how to grow vegetables, and observe and care for the environment. In 1928, the property became The Marjorie Webster School of Expression and Physical Education, which later became known as Marjorie Webster Junior College, a two-year, private junior college for women.See Baist's Real Estate Atlas Surveys of Washington, D.C., Plan 37 1937, 1954 (Washington, D.C.: Wm. E. and H.V. Baist). The school operated until 1971. Six years later, the property was purchased by the United States Fire Administration to house the new National Fire Academy. In 1978, while the property was still vacant, a more suitable location was found for the National Fire Academy and other elements of the U.S. Fire Administration. The property was subsequently transferred to Gallaudet University, which made it a satellite campus.Celebrating 30 Years of Service, the Creation of the National Emergency Training Center, United States Fire Administration, 2009. In 1997, the property was acquired by Lowell School. The buildings were once again renovated, and the school moved in at the start of the 1999 school year. The campus was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2014.  Academics  The school-wide themes of community, diversity, and identity, ground the curriculum in the school‚Äôs core values of insight, empathy, inclusivity, and equity.

Family Son of baron Luis de Requesens y Montoliu, deceased after 1382. His mother, from the \\"de Relat\\" Catalan family, should be probably related to Bishop for the Christian communities living at Morocco, North Africa, Francesc de Relat, deceased in Morocco in 1327, sent in 1309 there by the king James II of Aragon, (1267 - king 1291 - 1327), a.k.a. king James I of Sicily, (1267 - king of Sicily 1285 to 1296), to negotiate the freedom of 44 Catalan warriors, and confirmed by Avignon Roman Catholic Pope Clement V, (circa 1264 - Pope 1305 - 1314), a.k.a. Raymond Bertrand de Got . This Bishop seems to have played also a role in the permission to notorious Majorcan alchemist and philosopher, Raymond Lull, (1232 - 1315), to preach Christianity in Tunisia, 1314 - 1316, based on the previous good terms settled up there, including trade, by exiled Castilian Prince Henry of Castile, \\"The Senator\\", (1230 - 1304), the cadet brother of king Alfonso X of Castile, (1221 - 1284), who had fought there with another cadet brother, Fadrique of Castile, at the service of Hafsid king of the Algeria - Tunisia- Libya region Muhammad I al-Mustansir, ( - ruler 1249 - 1277). Luis de Requesens y de Relat came in 1396 from Sicily to help Martin, the father of king Martin I of Sicily \\"The younger\\", (circa . 1374/1376 ‚Äî consort king of Sicily after 1384 - Widower king of Sicily 1401 - July 25, 1409), married in 1384 to Maria of Sicily, Duchess of Athens, (1366 - Queen of Sicily 1380, aged 14 ‚Äì 1401) to take the vacant Aragonese crown of his brother and uncle respectively, no male issue, John I of Aragon, (1350 - king 1387 - 1396). Therefore, Prince Martin of Aragon, the father of this Martin I of Sicily, took the Aragonese crown as Martin I of Aragon in 1396 while his son was king consort of Sicily earlier and till 1401, whereby his wife, the Queen Maria of Sicily, Duchess of Athens, died . Then, when Martin I of Sicily died in 1409, his aging father, the king Martin I of Aragon, successor in 1396 of John I of Aragon was known in Sicily, during 1409 and 1410, when he died, as Martin II of Sicily. In other words, oddly enough, Martin II of Sicily, was the father of Martin I of Sicily, something rather unusual as far as Monarchies go. Luis de Requesens y de Relat went to Sardinia Island too, in 1408, both with Martin I of Sicily and with his father Martin I of Aragon to fight a revolt there in the city of Arborea. When king Martin I of Aragon died in 1410, his son Martin I of Sicily having died in 1409, there was no valid male issue for the kingship of the Crowns of Aragon, Sicily, Sardinia and the Catalan Counties globalised by then as a unit, in Barcelona . It was agreed that the succession crisis in the widely scattered Mediterranean Empire of the king of Aragon should be solved by political deputies representing several of the kingdoms and lands amalgamated, at Caspe, Zaragoza. The new king, a sickly Castilian Royal Prince, a cadet brother of the sickly king of Castile, Henry III of Castile, (1379 - 1406, aged 27), a.k.a. \\"Henry the Sufferer\\", a.k.a. \\"Henry the Infirm\\", a.k.a. Enrique III el Doliente in Spanish would be chosen in 1412, the elected being known aince then as Ferdinand I of Aragon \\"Trastamara\\", (1380 - elected king of the widely scattered Empire of the king of Aragon - 1312 - 1316, aged 35). He had even respected his very young (orphaned) nephew John, a.k.a. John II of Castile, rather than longing for the Castilian crown indeed. The new elected king appointed Luis de Requesens y de Relat, Governor of Catalonia in 1515, which he occupied till his death in 1426. Married to Constanza de Santa Coloma, the chatelaine of Santa Coloma de Farners, province of Girona, got the bases for a powerful family. Deaths One of his sons, Bernat de Requesens y Santa Coloma was financial agent for king Alfonso V of Aragon, a.k.a. king Alfonso I of Naples, (king 1416 - deceased 1458), for Alfonso V brother, king Juan II of Aragon, (king 1458 - 1479), for bastard king Ferrante I of Naples, the son of king Alfonso I of Naples by Giraldona Carlino, above mentioned, and for the unfortunate first son of king Juan II of Aragon, Prince Charles of Viana, rather unexpectedly deceased in 1461. Bernat, became Viceroy of Sicily, 1463 - 1464 . He died in 1469. Another brother of Bernat de Requesens y Santa Coloma, was Galceran de Requesens y Santa Coloma, deceased in the exile at Valencia in 1465.

Description and history The Benjamin Colton House is located in central West Hartford, south of the town center, on the south side of Sedgwick Road at its junction with Ridgebrook Drive. It is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure on a brownstone foundation, with five bays and a large central chimney. The main entrance and the windows are simply trimmed, and the second story hangs slightly over both the front and rear, a feature not found on the town's other 18th-century houses. Upper level windows are set close to the eave. The land on which this house stands originally belonged to Samuel Sedgwick, one of the area's first settlers. Benjamin Colton Jr. purchased the land where this house stands in 1770 from Benjamin Sedgwick, at which time an older structure stood on it. It is not known whether portions of the older structure survive in this one. Colton was the son of West Hartford's first pastor; his granddaughter married Dr. Edward Brace, who was for many years the town's only doctor.

George Cowles House, also known as the Solomon Cowles House, is a historic house at 130 Main Street in Farmington, Connecticut. Built in 1803, it is a prominent local example of Federal style architecture in brick, built for a prominent local family. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on May 11, 1982. Description and history The George Cowles House is located on the northwest side of Main Street (Connecticut Route 10) in geographically central Farmington, between Smith Drive and Pearl Street. It is a roughly square 2-1/2 story brick structure, four bays wide, with a side- gable roof and a rear two-story ell. The main entrance is slightly recessed in the load-bearing brick wall, and is flanked by sidelight windows and topped by a semi-elliptical transom window. The side elevation is notable for a pair of Palladian windows in the central bay, which are set higher than the flanking sash windows. The south elevation, facing the garden, has as particularly elaborate Jeffersonian portico. The house was built 1803 for George Cowles, around the time of his marriage, by his father Solomon, a wealthy merchant. Both father and son were prominent in town affairs. The son did not have the business acumen of the father, and lost the house in foreclosure to a wealthy relative. Although a number of the building's owners subdivided its larger chambers to increase the number of bedrooms, these changes have generally been reversed.

It is an active Anglican parish church in the deanery of Brampton, the archdeaconry of Carlisle and the diocese of Carlisle. It is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade I listed building and is the only church designed by the Pre-Raphaelite architect Philip Webb. The architectural historian Nikolaus Pevsner described it as \\"a very remarkable building\\". History The church was built on the site of a former late 17th-century hospital that had been converted into a chapel in 1789. It was built for George Howard, who later became the 9th Earl of Carlisle, together with other contributors, and was constructed between 1874 and 1878; the tower was added in 1906. The architect was Philip Webb who was closely connected with the Pre- Raphaelite Brotherhood; it is the only church designed by Webb. It was the successor to Brampton Old Church, situated about to the west of the town centre. Architecture =Exterior= St Martin's is built in red sandstone from Wetheral quarry; it has green slate roofs and a lead spire. Its plan consists of a square west tower, a four-bay nave with north and south aisles, and a single-bay chancel with a two-storey vestry to the north and an organ chamber to the south; the body of the church is almost square. On the north side of the tower is an open arched porch with a lean-to roof. The west face contains two small two-light windows over which is a larger two-light window; all these windows are recessed within an arch. Above these are clock faces on all sides of the tower over which are two-light louvred bell-openings. At the top of the tower are gables to the west and east, and shaped parapets to the north and south. On the tower is a short pointed spire with extensions to the north and south. On the north side of the church are three two-light windows separated by buttresses, and over each window is a battlemented gable. The south aisle has a round west window, and on the south side are small rectangular windows and three gabled dormers in the clerestory. On the south wall of the organ chamber is a three-light Perpendicular style window. The east window has five lights. =Interior= Interior of St Martin's Church The entrance leads into the base of the tower that acts as a porch and a baptistry; this leads in turn through two arches into the nave. Above the arches is a clear four-light window that is lit by the window in the west wall of the tower. All the ceilings are of painted wood; that of the north aisle is a tunnel vault, the south aisle ceiling is sloping, and the ceiling of the nave and chancel is flat. On each side of the nave is a four-bay arcade supported by octagonal piers; there is no chancel arch. All the stained glass was made in 1878‚Äì80 by Morris & Co. and designed by Edward Burne-Jones and William Morris. The five-light east window contains three tiers of figures. The central figure at the top is the Good Shepherd, and on each side are angels, the middle tier consists of angels, the central image in the lowest tier is a pelican, bounded on each sides by saints. The east window was a memorial to Charles Howard, MP, brother of the 8th Earl of Carlisle. The font dates from the 13th century. Soldiers' Chapel To the north of the chancel is a war memorial chapel, with the vestry on the floor above. The chapel contains an altar panel by Byam Shaw, and a carpet with a William Morris design. The three-manual organ was built about 1920 by Jardine & Co. of Manchester. It was rebuilt in 2008 by Nicholson & Co. of Malvern. There is a ring of six bells that were cast in 1826 by Thomas Mears II of the Whitechapel Bell Foundry. External features To the west of the church is St Martin's Hall, built in 1895 and designed by C. J. Ferguson. It is constructed in red sandstone with green slate roofs. The building is in two ranges, with three-bay meeting rooms in front and a five-bay hall behind. The hall is listed at Grade II. It now houses an antiques centre. Between the church and the hall is Church Cottage. This is also constructed in red sandstone with a slate roof, and pre-dates the church, being built in the early 19th century. It is a small building in one storey and two bays. In about 2000 it was being used as a chiropodist's surgery and a probation office. It is also listed Grade II. Present day The church holds services on Sundays and during the week and works in the local community. In the summer, a series of concerts is organised in the church. During 2009 the church was damaged by vandals, which led to a decision to lock it during the day.

He worked extensively in Mexico with Edward William Nelson and described and revised many groups of mammals. He was born Edward Alphonso Goltman in Mount Carroll, Illinois, on July 7, 1873, to French-German American parents Jacob H. and Laura C. Goltman. They were originally from Pennsylvania before moving to Illinois, then to Nebraska, where Jacob changed the surname to Goldman, and finally California. There, Jacob, who had an interest in natural history, met naturalist Edward William Nelson, who was looking for an assistant, around 1891. Young Edward became this assistant, beginning a friendship and professional relationship with Nelson that was to last until the latter's death.Young, 1947, pp. 91‚Äì92. Goldman did well on their first joint collecting trip in California, which ended in January 1892, and then set out for Mexico with Nelson for a three-month trip. In fact, they stayed for four years, beginning an acquaintance with Mexico that would take them to almost every corner of the country and result in the collection of over 20,000 mammal specimens. He met Emma May Chase in 1901, and married her the next year, the marriage producing three sons. While in the United States, Goldman performed many other functions, and during World War I he was a major in the U.S. Armed Forces in France working on rodent control.Young, 1947, pp. 93‚Äì94. After being released from administrative duties in 1928, he was able to devote all his time to scientific study and he continued even after his 1944 retirement.Young, 1947, pp. 94‚Äì95.

For a long time its formation was believed to have been caused by natural disasters such as earthquakes. Today it is known that processes such as weathering and erosion over a long period are much more likely to have been responsible for the formation of the rock labyrinth. Goethe wrote in 1820 The well-rounded shapes of the individual blocks were formed by spheroidal weathering (Wollsackverwitterung) in the tropical, humid climate of the Cenozoic era. Over the course of time they were left behind as the ground around was eroded; they became unstable and began to shift. This resulted in the jumble of rocks with wild, romantic paths through the narrow clefts and steep steps.  Tourism  False ruins above Prinz Ludwig Platz The jumble of rocks (a blockfield) named after Queen Louise was already being exploited for tourism in the 18th century and it is also well- known today as a result of the natural amphitheatre surrounded by rocks as well as the annual Luisenburg Pageant that take place there. The concept of opening it up and exploiting it was heavily influenced by the Society for the Portrayal of the History, Customs and Rights of the Fatherland (Gesellschaft zur Aufkl√§rung vaterl√§ndischer Geschichte, Sitte und Rechte) established in Wunsiedel in 1784. The local townsfolk began around 1790 to turn the rocky area into a landscape garden. The first construction phase lasted until about 1800 and, referring to remnants of an ancient motte nearby, resulted in the name Luxburg, which was changed in 1805 to Luisenburg. Visitors to the site had to stoop or even crawl if they wanted to explore its natural beauty. For the nobility of the time this was a rare posture that for many of them gave it an additional charm. In 1805 the Prussian queen visited the prehistoric, natural wonder with her husband, Frederick William III and, totally spellbound, told her son about the experience. A second construction phase took place between 1811 and 1815. The Luisenburg developed into a jewel of civic culture and landscape architecture. The terrain was used in 1794 for the singspiel Die kleine √Ñhrenleserin by Johann Adam Hiller and Christian Felix Wei√üe.  Today  Today the rock labyrinth is a popular destination and can be appreciated by anyone with stout footwear. Children also enjoy climbing and crawling over the rocks. In 2006 the rock labyrinth was awarded the status of a national geotope. The site is owned and maintained by Wunsiedel town council (forestry department). They charge an entry price of EUR 4.50 for adults (as of September 2017) (with reductions for children, etc.), which is used for the care and preservation of this natural monument.

Puck lights can create scallops, spots, or pools of lighting instead of even illumination across the counter top. Linear lights can come as a light strip or as a linear fixture or light bar. Linear fixtures resemble small puck lights on one mounting strip. Light strips are less than 1 inch wide are quite narrow. They are sold by the foot and can be cut to length during installation.  Factors in selecting under-cabinet lighting  For wood tones, wood-colored tiles, copper-tones, or warm-toned walls, look for a light with correlated color temperature (CCTs) in the 2700-3500 K range. For glass tiles and shelves, look for CCTs in the 3500-5000K range. You should also look at the distance of the lighting requirement, where puck style better suits smaller width cabinets and linear styles suit longer width to maintain consistency and allow the lights to be linked together.

It is just north of Interstate 4 along State Road 535 on Fenton Street. The name is not used much any more, since the City of Lake Buena Vista lies just to the south and west and is a more well-known name. Orange County officially calls the area Buena Vista North or Orange Center, its original name. The area was given the name Orange Center when it was platted in 1911. Previously it had the name Englewood, probably given to it by the Florida Midland Railroad. The name was changed to Vineland in 1924, supposedly due to confusion with Orange City, Florida. Vineland Cemetery was est. c. Reconstruction. Two Civil War veterans were buried at the cemetery. Later, it became known as Vineland Cemetery after 1924. In 1934 and 1936 Loma and John McGinnis were buried there, but later removed. History of the Vineland Cemetery This is one of the lost cemeteries in Orange County. The cemetery is unmarked and in thick palmetto scrub. Access is very difficult. There could be other graves, but they are not obvious. The last survey was in Nov 1996. Vineland (town): MCGINNIS, John, b. Jan 17 1868 d. May 25, 1936, Age 68 * and MCGINNIS, Loma, b. Apr 17 1897 d. Jun 15 1934, Age 37 * American Civil War: LUDWIG, Corp. W, b. 1839 d. C.

Two McGinnis metal markers were surrounded by a low wire fence but have deteriorated and are unreadable. (information is from an earlier survey LDS Survey in 1956 - FHC# 0002104). Ludwig and Foster stones are flat and about 50 feet away. The graves of McGinnis are no longer present as they have been moved by the family. The Civil War graves are still present though are planned to be moved to a United States National Cemetery. Graves Corp. Washington Ludwig Corporal Washington Ludwig is one of two soldiers that were buried at the Vineland Cemetery in Vineland, Florida. Ludwig was born in New York in 1839 and died in Florida. He was in Battery M. 1st New York Regiment of Light Artillery. He did not die in the war but did later on in Florida. Charles H. Foster Charles H. Foster is one of two soldiers buried at the Vineland Cemetery in Vineland, Florida. Foster was born in 1827 in Massachusetts. In the American Civil War he fought, but not in Florida. He later moved there and passed in the early 1900s. The McGinnis' Graves Two McGinnis family graves were buried there and later moved by the family. John and Loma McGinnis were buried and died in Vineland. John McGinnis was born January 17, 1868 and died May 25, 1936, at age 68. Loma MCGINNIS was born April 17, 1897, and died June 15, 1934, at age 37. The graves were marked by two metal markers, but they were diminished by natural mechanisms. Other Graves No other graves have yet been found at this cemetery, but there still is a possibility graves may be hidden or unmarked as years ago there was no fence and a great amount of Florida Scrub. Restoration The restoration of the cemetery itself is complete. With grass, mulch and floral arrangements as well as a ceremony to top it off. It used to be full of weeds and brush; it was also desecrated twice. Repairs to its fence and a new coat of paint has been added to the fading fence. Eagle Scout Marshall Polston, BSA Troop 6, and the Sons of Union Veterans of the Civil War have funded and run the restoration. Until the area is developed into a park that will surround the cemetery in a few years, it is off limits to all people excepting all authorized personnel: The owners, Sons of Union Veterans of the Civil War Officials, and authorized Scouts from BSA Troop 6. The fence is chained up and locked; however, people may view the cemetery outside the fence and gate on or near the designated paths to pay their respects.

The film loosely adapts the homonymous novel by Antonio Dal Masetto, who was reportedly unhappy with the final result. It is Polaco's first major studio production, featuring A-list comedians from the popular comedy troupe Tr√≠o Midachi (two out of the three).  Plot  The movie follows a group of four friends who arrive to a small town and crash a wedding party in the evening. That night they go out to a disco, and one of them hooks up with a girl. They both head to her place, where they engage in bizarre sexual acts at the bottom of an empty swimming pool. The following day, the four friends rob a bank, but the getaway is complicated when a policeman spots them as they leave. They are forced to leave the car and split up: Ramiro and Cucurucho remain together and dash down the railroad tracks; they eventually get to a garage, where they hide, accidentally killing the mechanic. They split up: Ramiro stashes himself in a truck, which drives off, whereas Cucurucho hides in a monastery, attacking a group of nuns at gunpoint, and, later on, a blind woman's house. The driver (the man who had met the girl the night before) is pursued by an angry mob, who torches the shed he hides in. As he escapes he is shot; he in turn kills the boy that wounds him. Wading down the river, he manages to get to the girl's house, where she bandages him. Just then a policeman storms in. He is shot and killed, but not before shooting them both, as well as the aquarium they're behind. The fourth member has a friendly encounter with an artist, who helps him; later on he is pursued too and hides atop the church's belltower, holding a priest hostage. He is killed by a sniper. Throughout the movie, various characters falsely attribute other crimes to the robbers as means of using them as scapegoats. A man asphyxiates his wife with a pillow and claims the robbers did it; a woman likewise accuses one of them of rape. Ramiro has a brief sexual encounter with a woman, Susana. Cucurucho escapes the blind woman's house and reunites with Ramiro as he steals the very truck in which he was hiding. They have seemingly escaped when they're suddenly forced to stop in front of a cemetery, and are cornered by various arriving truckloads of angry villagers. The camera freezes on the duo as they are stoned by the mob in the cemetery. A text then appears on screen, telling that the following day everything in the village had reverted to normal, and that nobody ever knew what happened to the money.

Founded in 1875 by two prominent residents of the town at a time when Protestant Nonconformism was well established in Sussex, the chapel continued in religious use for over a century until it was sold for conversion to a family home in 1999. The Neoclassical building stands in a conservation area opposite Burgess Hill's main park. English Heritage has listed the building at Grade II for its architectural and historical importance. History Burgess Hill‚Äînow a town of about 30,000 people‚Äîdid not exist until the mid-19th century, when the London and Brighton Railway built a railway line across St John's Common, an area of common land divided between the parishes of Clayton and Keymer. The line and Burgess Hill railway station opened in 1841, and rapid population growth led to the building of an Anglican church, St John the Evangelist's, in the early 1860s and the creation of an ecclesiastical parish in 1863. One of the most important early residents was Frederick Hoadley. In 1857 he founded a department store on a prominent site near the railway station; it was so successful that other branches were opened elsewhere in Sussex. In 1875, together with fellow resident Eli Ashdown, he formed a trust to fund the establishment of a Strict Baptist place of worship in the town. St John's Park, a recreational area in the town centre, was presented to the town in 1871 as a memorial to a local philanthropist. Hoadley and Ashdown bought a site on Park Road, with a southward view across the park, in 1875 and commissioned architect Simeon Norman to design a chapel. It was registered for marriages on 20 June 1876. There were already other Nonconformist places of worship in the town: a Congregational church of 1829 predated the railway- influenced development, and congregations of both Plymouth Brethren and General Baptists were founded in 1870. Methodists, Congregationalists and the Salvation Army also had a presence by 1900. Simeon Norman's chapel continued to serve the Strict Baptist community throughout the 20th century, but attendances gradually fell. It was therefore sold in 1999, and has been converted into a family home and renamed Providence House. The Providence Strict Baptist Chapel was listed at Grade II by English Heritage on 27 November 1975; this defines it as a \\"nationally important\\" building of \\"special interest\\". As of February 2001, it was one of 958 Grade II listed buildings, and 1,028 listed buildings of all grades, in the district of Mid Sussex. It is within the St John's Common Conservation Area designated by Mid Sussex District Council. Architecture The chapel was built in a style described as either Classical or Neoclassical. The two-storey structure has three equally spaced round-headed windows on the upper floor of the fa√ßade, and two square-headed windows flanking the entrance door below. Between these are four Doric pilasters which are topped with a pediment. Originally faced with cement, it is now stuccoed.

On its summit is an observation tower (the Asenturm) and a transmission tower for VHF and TV programmes by Bayerischer Rundfunk. There are cable cars to the Ochsenkopf from south and north. The valley stations are, in the north, in the village of Bischofsgr√ºn and, in the south, in Fleckl, part of the municipality of Warmensteinach. In winter there is skiing on the Ochsenkopf. In summer a sommerrodelbahn (dry toboggan run) can be used. This is accessible from the northern valley station. In addition since July 2007 there has been a tree-walk (Kletterwald), that can be used by individuals or groups. The White Main - the right-hand, northern headstream of the River Main - rises just a short distance to the east of the mountain, above the village of Fichtelberg as does the Fichtelnaab, a headstream of the Naab. The European Watershed also runs over the mountain. The Naab flows south towards the Danube, the Main west to the Rhine.  Origin of the name  The Goethe Rocks The name \\"Ochsenkopf\\" does not appear in old descriptions of the mountains. The first person to write about the Fichtelgebirge, Matthias von Kemnath (actually Matthias Widmann, b 23 February 1429 in Kemnath) reported in 1476: Ein bergk, hoch, weitt, wolbekant ligt in Beiern, gnant der Fichtelberg (\\"A mountain, high, wide and well-known, lies in Bavaria, known as the Fichtelberg\\"). In descriptions of the border in 1499 and 1536 the mountain is called Vichtelberg, thereafter the name was extended to the whole mountain region. It is also mentioned in old documents: around 1317 the Lords of Hirschberg were enfeoffed inter alia with the walt zu dem Vythenberge. By the 14th century iron ore was being extracted in the St. Veith Pit on the southern foot of the Ochsenkopf. Vyth ‚Üí Veit ‚Üí Fichtel. High-profile local history and name researchers have still not had the last word. The name Ochsenkopf appeared in mining deeds for the first time in 1495, when Lorenz von Ploben from N√ºrnberg was given the mine on the Fichtelberge \\"near the Ochsenkopf\\" as a feoff. That may be the first reference to the head of a steer carved into a rock on the suummit, which can still be seen today.  The Asenturm  The Asenturm with adjoining pub View from the Asenturm In 1878 on the foundation of the Fichtelgebirge Section of the German-Austrian Alpine Club (predecessor of the Fichtelgebirge Club) there was already an observation post on the Ochsenkopf - a wooden structure for the ordnance survey. In 1876 a stone survey column had been erected (a Saxon survey post, still there today) and surrounded with a wooden scaffold. Later this scaffold was adapted as an observation tower and raised a little in height, but in 1894 the structure was reported as \\"very rickety\\". The Fichtelgebirg Club (Fichtelgebirgsverein or FGV) restored the structure time and again. In 1896, master forester, List, from Bischofsgr√ºn modified the tower and it was raised by 10 metres. On 21 December 1902 the local FGV group in Bischofsgr√ºn applied to the FGV's main office for the construction of a robust, stone tower and transferred a basis of 230 marks as a first estimate. A tower was decided upon, but it was many years before the project could proceed; the First World War putting paid to the plans initially.

Its exploration office is located in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada. Hathor's exploration projects concentrate on properties within the Athabasca Basin of Northern Saskatchewan, Canada. In 2009, Hathor Exploration was reported as having the sixth most significant exploration project in Saskatchewan (based on expenditures) and the 51st out of 100 in Canada at their Midwest NorthEast property in the Athabasca Basin, by Natural Resources Canada. The name Hathor was inspired by the ancient Egyptian goddess, who besides being one of the most important and popular deities throughout the history of Ancient Egypt,The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Ancient Egypt, Lorna Oakes, Southwater, p157-159, was also the patron goddess of miners in ancient Egyptian culture. History The company was founded on June 28, 1996 in Alberta as Longview Minerals Ltd. Following its inception, the company then moved out of Alberta and was renamed pursuant to the Canada Business Corporations Act under the name of Sixgill Minerals Ltd. on September 26, 1996. On May 28, 1997 the company changed its name to Hathor Exploration Limited. In 2006 Hathor Exploration completed the acquisition of Roughrider Uranium Corp. which led to the discovery of the Roughrider Deposit of the Midwest NorthEast property, and then in 2009 and 2011 respectively acquired Northern Continental Resources Inc. and Terra Ventures Inc. giving the company full control of both the Russell Lake and Midwest NorthEast properties. On August 26, 2011, Cameco announced its intention to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Hathor Exploration Limited, and made an all-cash offer to shareholders of $3.75 CAD per Hathor share. This announcement initiated a bidding process between Cameco Corp. and Rio Tinto which came to an end on November 30, 2011. Rio Tinto succeeded in its bid to acquire Hathor Exploration by obtaining 70.21% of the outstanding Hathor common shares on a fully diluted basis through their all-cash offer of $4.70 CAD per Hathor share. On January 12, 2012, Rio Tinto announced that it had successfully acquired 135,290,661 Hathor common shares, representing 100% of the outstanding Hathor common shares on a fully diluted basis. As a result, Hathor de-listed from the Toronto Stock Exchange. Roughrider deposit and discovery The most significant assets attributed to Hathor Exploration is the Midwest NorthEast Project and the Roughrider Deposit's multiple zones of uranium mineralization. The Roughrider Deposit's West Zone was discovered in February 2008 with drill hole MWNE-08-12 which showed concentrations of up to 5.29% U3O8 over 3.3m. As of May 17, 2011, the Roughrider Deposit contained a NI 43‚Äì101 compliant combined resource (indicated and inferred) of 57.94 million pounds U3O8 (Resource estimates prepared by SRK Consulting (Canada) Inc., a division of SRK Consulting), where intercepts have shown grades of up to 81.9% U3O8. The resource estimates to date have only included the West and East zones of the Roughrider Deposit and not the recently discovered Far East Zone. The West Zone of mineralization currently accounts for 27.81 million pounds U3O8 at an average grade of between 1.98% (indicated) & 11.03% (inferred) U3O8, while the larger East Zone currently accounts for 30.13 million pounds U3O8 of the total estimated resource at 11.58% U3O8. With all current resource estimates taken into account, the Roughrider Deposit is currently the third-highest grade uranium deposit in the world, following Cameco's McArthur River and Cigar Lake Deposits. The (RRZ) of mineralization is located in the same region which also accommodates several other significant uranium deposits. Roughly 4 km to the southwest is the Midwest uranium deposit owned by AREVA Resources Canada Inc, Denison Mines Corp. and OURD Canada Co., Ltd. which contains 41.7 million pounds of U3O8 at a grade of 5.47%, and only 900 meters to the southwest is the Midwest A discovery (formerly known as the Mae Zone) which contains an additional 19.5 million pounds of U3O8 at a grade of 1.57%, and is also owned jointly owned by AREVA Resources Canada Inc, Denison Mines Corp. and OURD Canada Co., Ltd. Corporate activities As a result of negotiations regarding either the acquisition and/or management of various properties Hathor Exploration Limited had previously entered into joint venture agreements, with Forum Uranium Corp., Northern Continental Resources Inc., Triex Minerals Corporation, Terra Ventures Inc., and ESO Uranium Corp. on various projects across Canada. In March 2009, Hathor Exploration spun-out its Eskay Creek precious metals project to form the new company called Standard Exploration Ltd. (until October 7, 2010 known as MAX Minerals Ltd.) which now oversees all aspects of that project. In December, 2009 Hathor Exploration completed its acquisition of Northern Continental Resources Ltd. where through a financial agreement, Hathor became the owner of 100% of the interest in the Russell Lake property which is located 15 km northeast of the Key Lake mine/mill complex and 12 km southeast of the McArthur River uranium mine, which was previously divided between the two companies. On August 5, 2011, Hathor Exploration took full ownership and control of the issued and outstanding securities of Terra Ventures Incorporated. This arrangement consolidated a 100% interest in the Roughrider uranium deposit and 100% interest in the Russell Lake exploration project, located at either end, respectively, of the eastern corridor of the Athabasca Basin.

He was an educator and an editor. He spent most of his academic career at Columbia University. Early life He was born in New York City. His father Montgomery Schuyler (1842‚Äì1914) was a journalist and architectural writer, and mother Katherine Beeckman Livingston (1842‚Äì1914), a direct descendant of Robert Livingston the Elder, the first Lord of Livingston Manor, was a gifted amateur artist and singer. His elder brother was Montgomery Schuyler, Jr. (1877‚Äì1955), who served as United States Minister to Ecuador and El Salvador He began his undergraduate studies in 1899 at Columbia University where he studied under some of the principle founders and shapers of the historical profession in the United States ‚Äì John W. Burgess, William Archibald Dunning, Herbert L. Osgood, and James Harvey Robinson. From them he derived a lifelong interest in constitutional history and an impressive capacity for exploiting documentary materials. Career He worked as a reporter for The New York Times as he worked on his M.A. from Columbia. He later contributed many book reviews for the newspaper. Upon obtaining his master's degree, he became an instructor in history at Yale University. There he worked with George Burton Adams, whose celebrated textbook on English constitutional history Schuyler revised in 1934. He married Sara Keller Brooks on Oct. 19, 1907. He received his Ph.D from Columbia in 1909 and became a lecturer there the next year. He was promoted to assistant professor in 1911, to associate professor in 1919, and to full professor in 1924. He was given the title of Gouverneur Morris Professor in 1942. In his book, Parliament and the British Empire (1929), Schuyler discredited the old contention ‚Äì which had been recently revived by C.H. McIlwain of Harvard University ‚Äì that the acts against which American colonists had protested in the middle of the eighteenth century were without legal authority. Schuyler was one of a group of American historians who rejected the nationalistic bias endemic to much American- history writing. He attempted to explain how the old British Empire had really worked. Schuyler had a continuing interest in his great English predecessors Thomas Babington Macaulay, J.R. Green, and above all, Frederic William Maitland, to whom he devoted his presidential address to the American Historical Association in 1951 entitled, [The Historical Spirit Incarnate: Frederic William Maitland]. Between 1936 and 1941, he was the managing editor of the American Historical Review. He was also a fellow of the Royal Historical Society. To say that he inspired the historical profession would be an understatement. Most of his colleagues in the history department were among his students. He drew up the syllabus for the Columbia College course in American history (1913) and, with Carlton J. H. Hayes, the syllabus in modern European history (1912). The latter is notable for its attention to economic and cultural history. In his later years at Columbia, he was in charge of the historiography course required of graduate students, and anyone who heard his opening lectures was permanently inoculated against the dangers of present- mindedness.Dictionary of American Biography, Supplement 8, 1988.

Opened in 1972, the mall became largely vacant by the late 1990s. It underwent renovations in 2004 and 2005 which added new anchor stores and tenants, but after the mall's developers filed for bankruptcy protection in 2009, the complex was closed except for three anchor stores: Sears, The Bon-Ton and Save-A-Lot, with two more vacant anchors last occupied by Steve & Barry's and a Macy's closeout store. As of September 2017, Save-A- Lot has closed permanently, leaving only Sears and The Bon-Ton still open in the mall. On April 18, 2018, it was announced that The Bon-Ton would be closing in August 2018. as it is going out of business leaving Sears as the only tenant left.http://www.businessinsider.com/bon-ton-stores-closing- list-2018-4 On May 7, 2018, Sears announced that would also be closing in August 2018 which will leave the mall with no tenants.http://buffalonews.com/2018/05/07/sears-to-close-store-at-summit-mall/ The Summit was located on Williams Road, south of US 62 (Niagara Falls Boulevard) and north of NY 265/NY 384 (River Road). History The original anchor stores of Summit Park Mall were Sears and three local department stores: AM&A;'s (bought out by The Bon-Ton in 1995), Hens & Kelly, and Jenss, with other major tenants including Child World and McCrory. Hens & Kelly moved out in 1982, and remained vacant until October 1992, when Macy's opened its first closeout store in the space. Also in 1992, Child World closed its store, which was converted to a Toys \\"R\\" Us by year's end. The Macy's closeout store closed in 1995 and was never replaced by another anchor. By the late 1990s, the mall was 40% vacant, and its owners had expressed interest in converting portions of it to office space. Jenss closed in 1998. In 2004, a local developer purchased the mall for $5 million, with plans to rename the complex Destination Niagara USA. At that point, the mall was 65% vacant. The mall was then renamed The Summit, and new tenants were added, including a Steve & Barry's, which opened in 2005 in the former Jenss space, a children's play center in the former McCrory and the Niagara Aerospace Museum, although this institution later moved to the former Niagara Falls International Airport's old terminal on Niagara Falls Boulevard. The mall's sales increased by 18% in 2007. Toys \\"R\\" Us closed its store in early 2006 as part of the chain's reorganization plan. Two years later, a Save-A-Lot grocery store opened in half of the Toys \\"R\\" Us building. Steve & Barry's closed in 2008. In May 2009, the mall's owners, Oberlin Plaza One, announced that the mall would close on June 6 following the company's filing for bankruptcy protection. At the time, twenty-five stores operated within the mall. The mall was allowed to stay open beyond this date after the U.S. Bankruptcy Court decided to extend the deadline for closure, although many of the twenty-five remaining tenants relocated. By August 2009, the mall's last three inline tenants moved out, leaving only Sears, The Bon-Ton and Save-A-Lot operational until its closure. In January 2013, the mall building was flooded with up to six inches of water from a pipe, in what was believed by Niagara County police to be an act of vandalism. In March 2014 Zoran Cocov purchased the mall for 4.2 million dollars. Cocov revealed plans in late 2014 to revive the space adding stores, museums, a sportsplex, wine tasting center, and a business incubator. Cocov also received tax breaks for 700,000 dollars for five years for renovations to revive the space. In 2016, it was announced that a brewery project was to be added to the current mall project. In 2018 both the Sears and Bon-Ton anchor locations at the mall began liquidation sales due to declining sales locally and nationally. This represented the final ceasing of the mall as an operating retail complex pending other plans.http://www.niagara- gazette.com/news/local_news/wheatfield-official-laments-closing-of-sears- store-at- summit/article_8d1f2a2e-5282-11e8-88ea-675d7c6c76c5.htmlhttp://news.wbfo.org/post/its- official-bon-ton-close-aug-31 The Niagara International Sports and Entertainment Center project was estimated to finish by the fourth quarter of 2018.

The APB was originally a campus of the Technikon Witwatersrand. Uniquely, the campus is an enclosed section of a suburb. The main thoroughfare of the suburb is Bunting Road, whose name, according to the City of Johannesburg archives, is derived from a subspecies of bird and not the decorative banner it is currently associated with. A common misconception, as with Kingsway Campus, is that the campus itself is in Auckland Park. However, it is not technically within the demarcated suburb of Auckland Park, but rather in the suburb of Cottesloe. The roads within the campus are Lark Street, Jay Street, Vista Close, Ibis Street, Katjiepiering Street, Falcon Street and Dorbie Street. Faculties The campus is home to the Faculty of Art, Design and Architecture (FADA), as well as the Faculty of Management. =Faculty of Art, Design and Architecture= FADA has a vibrant 80-year history and serves approximately 1200 students who work and study in the FADA building, which has many facilities integrated into it, such as workshops, studios, computer laboratories, common lecture venues, auditorium, gallery, and library. FADA is divided into eight departments: Architecture, Fashion Design, Graphic Design, Industrial Design, Interior Design, Jewellery Design and Manufacture, Multimedia, and Visual Art. =The College Of Business and Economics= The College of Business and Economics operates on the Auckland Park Kingsway Campus, the Auckland Park Bunting Road Campus and the Soweto Campus.The CBE consists of 7 schools (housing 12 departments): ‚Ä¢ The Johannesburg Business School ‚Ä¢ School of Accounting ‚Ä¢ School of Consumer Intelligence and Information Systems ‚Ä¢ School of Economics ‚Ä¢ School of Management ‚Ä¢ School of Public Management, Governance and Public Policy ‚Ä¢ School of Tourism and Hospitality Demographics Of the 9255 students enrolled at the Bunting Road Campus in 2011, 9177 were undergraduate students and only 78 were postgraduate. Student amenities When on campus the visual impression one gets is not of an education institution but rather that of a middle class South African suburb, as is the case with the surrounding suburbs. The Bunting Road Campus has two entrances. The east and main entrance is located on Annet Road (M71) and the west entrance is located on Canary street, opposite the SABC Headquarters, in Auckland Park. The campus has a total of 55 lecture halls equipped with 4412 seats. The university's radio station UJFM is also located on the Bunting Road Campus. Located within the campus is a Netcare Clinic which, along with the Faculty of Health Sciences of Doornfontein Campus, serves the City of Johannesburg. Opposite Lark Street on Bunting Road is the Cottesloe Boer Memorial, National Monument. =Restaurants= Several restaurants can be found at the Bunting Road Campus, thanks to School of Tourism and Hospitality Management, which falls under the Faculty of Management. Restaurants here include the Design Caf√©, the Waterford Restaurant, and the Bistro. =Venues= The campus is home to the Con Cowan Building, which is where the fully equipped, 180-seat Con CowanTheatre is also situated, and the Great Hall, which can accommodate up to 550 people and is a popular location for concerts, prize-giving ceremonies, exhibitions, and meetings. The Great Hall is also used for examinations. Other venues can be found within the Kerzner Building, which is under the jurisdiction of the School of Tourism and Hospitality. The Kerzner Building is a R20 million building where the training of hospitality and tourism students takes place. =Transport= The University of Johannesburg has its own shuttle service that transports students between the Doornfontein Campus, Soweto Campus, Kingsway Campus, and Bunting Road Campus. Additionally, all of these campuses are served by Rea Vaya, a bus rapid transit system in Johannesburg. =Student residences= The campus has five residences, Horizon and Ndlovukazi for undergraduate females, Kilimanjaro for undergraduate males, and Goudstad Flats and Mayine, mixed-gender residences for postgraduate students.https://www.uj.ac.za/newandevents/Documents/New-Residences-Names-and- Meanings.pdf The Kilimanjaro Junior Men's Residence is located on-site in Cottesloe. It can accommodate up to 310 junior male students from the Bunting Road campus. It is an eleven-floor high rise that has five sharing rooms and 21 single rooms on each floor. The residence is managed by the residence manager and staffed by eleven floor representatives (one representative per floor), full-time security, and six full-time cleaners. The Mayine Mixed Senior Residence on campus an integrated residence for both male and female students. Although third-year students may also live here, the residence primarily houses students who are busy with postgraduate degrees, such as Bachelor of Technology and Honours degrees. It also accommodates sports students of the campus as well as members of the campus' SRC. The building has seven blocks with 88 units, each outfitted with a kitchen to facilitate self- catering. Students formerly from the junior residences Kilimanjaro, Horizon, and Ndlovukazi typically form a large part of the population of the Mayine Mixed Senior residence. It can accommodate up to 338 students who, depending on their academic performance, are assigned to either single or double room flats. Postgraduate students have priority when it comes to placing students into single rooms, while undergraduate students are often placed into double rooms. At the Ikhayalethu Day-House, day students of the University of Johannesburg's Bunting Road Campus can gather.

This may result in concern and confusion, because of automated features of dormant accounts (e.g. birthday reminders), uncertainty of the deceased's preferences that profiles be deleted or left as a memorial, and whether information that may violate the deceased's privacy (such as email or browser history) should be made accessible to family. Issues with how this information is sensitively dealt with are further complicated as it may belong to the service provider (not the deceased) and many do not have clear policies on what happens to the accounts of deceased users. While some sites, including Facebook and Twitter, have policies related to death, others remain dormant until deleted due to inactivity or transferred to family or friends. The FADA (Fiduciary Access to Digital Assets Act) was set in place to make it possible to transfer digital possessions legally. More broadly, the heavy increase in social media use is affecting cultural practices surrounding death. \\"Virtual funerals\\" and other forms of previously physical memorabilia are being introduced into the digital world, complete with public details of a person's life and death. E-mail Gmail and Hotmail allow the email accounts of the deceased to be accessed provided certain requirements are met. Yahoo! Mail will not provide access, citing the No Right of Survivorship and Non-Transferability clause in the Yahoo! terms of service. In 2005, Yahoo! was ordered by the Probate Court of Oakland County, Michigan, to release emails of deceased US Marine Justin Ellsworth to his father, John Ellsworth. By website =Facebook=  Policies In the early days Facebook used to delete profiles of dead people. In October 2009, the company introduced ‚Äúmemorial pages‚Äù in response to multiple user requests related to the 2007 Virginia Tech shooting. After receiving a proof of death via a special form, the profile would be converted into a tribute page with minimal personal details, where friends and family members could share their grief. In February 2015, Facebook allowed users to appoint a friend or family member as a \\"legacy contact\\" with the rights to manage their page after death. It also gave Facebook users an option to have their account permanently deleted when they die. As of January 2019, all 3 options were active. Controversies In 2013, BuzzFeed criticized Facebook for the lack of control over memorialization that resulted in a ‚ÄúFacebook death‚Äù prank aimed at locking users out of their own accounts. In 2017, Reuters reported that a German court rejected a mother‚Äôs demand to access her deceased daughter‚Äôs memorized account stating that the right to private telecommunications outweighed the right to inheritance. In July 2018, Dubai‚Äôs DIFC Courts ruling clarified that Facebook, Twitter and other social media accounts should be bequeathed in legally binding will. Social media networks have also been criticized for not responding to relatives' requests to alter information on memorialized accounts. Another criticism is that Facebook users often are unaware that their content is ultimately owned not by them, but by Facebook. =Dropbox=  Policies Dropbox determines inactive accounts by looking at sign-ins, file shares, and file activity over the previous 12 months. Once an account is determined inactive, Dropdox deletes the files on the account. To request access to the account of a deceased person, heirs are required to send appropriate documents by physical mail. =Google= Policies In April 2013, Google announced the creation of the 'Inactive Account Manager', which allows users of Google services to set up a process in which ownership and control of inactive accounts is transferred to a delegated user. Google also allows users to submit a range of requests regarding accounts belonging to deceased users. Google works with immediate family members and representatives to close online accounts in some cases once a user is known to be deceased, and in certain circumstances may also provide content from a deceased user's account. =Twitter= Policies Until 2010, Twitter (launched in July 2006) did not have a policy on handling deceased user accounts, and simply deleted timelines of deceased users. In August 2010, Twitter allowed memorialization of accounts upon request from family members, and also provided them with an option of either deleting the account or obtaining a permanent backup of the deceased user's public tweets. In 2014, Twitter updated its policy to include an option to delete deceased user photographs. This policy was implemented after multiple Twitter trolls sent Zelda Williams, daughter of Robin Williams, photoshopped images of her father. As of January 2019, the only option that Twitter offered for the accounts of dead people was account deactivation. Previously published content is not removed. To deactivate an account Twitter requires an immediate family member to present a copy of their ID and a death certificate of the deceased. Twitter specified that it does not provide account access to anyone,, but does allow people having account login information to continue posting. A prominent example is Roger Ebert‚Äôs account maintained by his wife Chaz. Controversies In 2012, The Next Web columnist Martin Bryant noticed that since Twitter, unlike Facebook, did not have a \\"one account per real person\\" emphasis, memorializing accounts presented a difficulty to the service. He also criticized the service for the lack of control over hacking of such accounts and disapproved the practice of passing dead people‚Äôs usernames to new owners after a certain period of inactivity. In 2013, Variety ran a feature about Cory Monteith‚Äôs Twitter account that had 1.5 million followers at the moment on his death and gained almost 1 million new followers afterwards. Monteith‚Äôs fans also launched #DontDeleteCorysTwitter campaign. As of January 2019, the celebrity‚Äôs account had 1.64 million followers. Various media reported awkward incidents related to automatic posting and account hacking. =iTunes= Policies iCloud and iTunes accounts are ‚Äúnon transferable‚Äù since the content is not owned ‚Äî users only have a licence to access it. =Wikipedia= Users who have made at least several hundred edits or are otherwise known for substantial contributions to Wikipedia can be noted at a central memorial page. Wikipedia user pages are ordinarily fully edit-protected after the user has died, to prevent vandalism. =YouTube= YouTube grants access to accounts of deceased persons under certain conditions. It is one of the data options that one can select to give access to a trusted contact with Google's Inactive Account Manager. Digital inheritance Digital inheritance is the process of handing over personal digital assets to human beneficiaries. These digital assets include digital estates and the right to use them. It may include bank accounts, writings, photographs, and social interactions. There are several services which store account passwords and send them to selected individuals after death. Some of these periodically send the customer an email to confirm that that person is still alive; after failure to respond to multiple emails, the service provider assumes that the person has died and will thereafter distribute the passwords as arranged. The Data Inheritance function from SecureSafe gives an \\"activator code\\" that the customer transfers to a trusted individual, and in the event of death that individual enters the code into Secure Safe's system to get access to the deceased person's digital inheritance. Legacy Locker and SafeBeyond require two persons to confirm the death, together with the presentation of a death certificate, before any passwords are distributed. Aimed at those concerned with their online privacy, platforms like LifeBank store a customer's Internet account passwords offline while ensuring that a trusted person is given permission to access the stored passwords upon the customer's death. In July 2018, the Michigan Court of Appeals found that an Evernote document the decedent had typed into his phone shortly before committing suicide was enforceable as valid will..

Fung, 20 Apr 2010 The ECCPC was set up in April 2010 in a symbiotic relationship with the Taiwanese ECCC, similar to that between bodies representing Taiwan and mainland China in cross-strait talks, under a slightly hands-off approach that is often known as the \\"white glove\\" policy. The two councils, both with participation by high-ranking ministers, are incorporated as legal entities but will be authorised by the two governments to sign pacts. The two bodies were established against a background of strengthened Hong Kong-Taiwan links and trade, which match improved China-Taiwan relations. With the establishment in 2009 of direct flights between Taiwan and the mainland, Hong Kong's role as a transit point was eliminated. The ECCPC has only one major committee, the Business Co-operation Committee, reflecting the Hong Kong government's focus on business and economic aspects of the relationship, such as seeking mutual avoidance of double taxation and collaboration between the two financial markets. This contrasts with the broader agenda of the Taiwanese side, which is looking for progress on matters such as infectious disease control, relaxation of visa requirements for travellers and cultural exchanges. The committee chair, for a term of two years, is David Lie Tai- chong, also a vice-chairman of the ECCPC itself and a Hong Kong delegate to the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. ECCPC is located at the Central Government Offices in Admiralty. Transportation The council is accessible within walking distance North from Admiralty Station of Hong Kong MTR.

It is situated beside the River Thames, and was established in 1646 by Richard Aldworth, who named it \\"Aldworth's Hospital\\". Aldworth founded a near-identical school in Basingstoke in the same year. History Brunswick House, the home of the Reading Blue Coat School from 1852 to 1947, now expanded and used as a nursing home The school was established in 1646 at the height of the English Civil War, when a wealthy London merchant, Richard Aldworth of Stanlake Park, left the Corporation of Reading the sum of ¬£4,000, the proceeds of which were to be devoted to \\"the education and upbringing of twenty poor male children, being the children of honest, religious poor men in the town of Reading.\\" From this bequest, which in 17th century terms was quite substantial, originated the Aldworth's Hospital charity school now better known as the Reading Blue Coat School. Aldworth, who had been a governor of Christ's Hospital in London, modelled the new foundation on his former school, the boys being required to wear the Bluecoat attire of gown, yellow stockings, and buckled shoes. Aldworth's will further stipulated that the Master of the new school should be \\"an honest, Godly and learned man\\" who for his \\"paines\\" would receive a stipend of ¬£30 a year. His duties were to include the instruction of reading, writing and ciphering and to \\"teach the Catechism in the points of Christian Religion.\\" The Talbot The School was originally accommodated in an old building situated at the corner of Silver Street and London Street known as 'The Talbot' in one of the oldest parts of Reading. The house, once an old inn, was in a dilapidated condition. Owing to litigation in connection with Aldworth's will, it was not until 1660, the year of Charles II's restoration, that the first boys entered the School to be taught. Despite many difficulties at the outset, the School flourished and even received generous subventions from local benefactors such as William Malthus and John West. Malthus also left a certain sum for an annual sermon to be preached to the boys, a tradition still maintained in Reading at the end of each summer term. In 1666, Sir Thomas Rich of Holme Park, Sonning, gave the Corporation the sum of ¬£1,000 to \\"maintain six poor boys in Aldworth's Hospital, three of whom to be chosen from the parish of Sonning\\". In 1947, the new School moved to its current home on Rich's estate. Indeed, the present Holme Park mansion is situated within a few hundred yards of Rich's own manor house, an old residence which in turn had been built near an ancient but ruined palace that had belonged to the Bishops of Salisbury long before the Norman Conquest in 1066. The 'Talbot' was not at all suited to the needs of a growing school, and soon the Corporation, as Trustees, decided to replace it with a more modern structure in 1723. That the School's reputation and circumstances stood at a low ebb is further confirmed by an order of the Trustees that \\"the Master of the Blue Coat School do not suffer the boys to play about the streets but that they be kept within the limits of the said School between and after School times, and that the Master go with the said children to the Parish Church of St Laurence every Sunday\\". This they unfailingly did, every Sunday until 1946. In these premises the School was to remain until 1852 when it removed to the more commodious Brunswick House on the Bath Road in Reading. For nearly 90 years, generations of Blue Coat boys were to be educated there in 'the three Rs', many proceeding to a variety of local apprenticeships, trades and professions. Changing times The impact of the Second World War, combined with rising educational expectations, posed challenges to the School which was faced with the fate of eventual closure unless it removed to more extensive premises outside Reading and met the terms of the Education Act 1944. Described by the Headmaster, Bernard Inge, as \\"an act of faith\\", and following a local fundraising appeal sponsored by the Bishop of Reading, the Mayor, and Corporation, the Trustees acquired the Holme Park estate. 150 boys, of whom a hundred were boarders, with nine teachers eventually made the move to Sonning on 21 January 1947, the headmaster's 44th birthday. Buildings and facilities had to be updated in haste if the Ministry of Education's stringent regulations were to be met and its 'recognition of efficiency' accorded. New classrooms were opened in 1955 and named after the Dunster brothers. In 1961, the School's first Sixth Form was opened. A major new science centre was opened in 1973, closely followed by a brand new Sixth Form Centre and enlarged library. Further classrooms including modern facilities for technology and computing were added in the 1980s in response to rising educational expectations and growing pupil numbers. In 2001, the new Allan Sanders Science Centre was completed and a brand new Sports Hall opened in 2004. In 2006, the School celebrated its 360th anniversary. In 2008, the school opened their brand new cricket pavilion which overlooked the cricket field adjacent to the car park. 2009 was a year of change in the school, the new Boat House was opened on the banks of the river below the school and the sixth form centre was expanded and altered with the knocking through of many interior walls. The connecting (and little used) squash court was incorporated into the centre. The newly completed 'James McArthur Sixth Form Center' (named after a previous headmaster) was opened in the autumn of 2010 by Old Blue and MP for Reading West Alok Sharma April 2011 saw the demolition of the Dunster, Gaines Cooper and Lesser buildings and the start of construction of a new classroom block, the Richard Aldworth Building, which now provides first-class teaching facilities for a number of major departments. English, Maths, Modern Languages, Classics and Geography are housed in the new building, which also includes a new Art department that enjoys a view over the School's pitches and the River Thames. The RAB also contains a Common Room for Middle School pupils (aged 13‚Äì16). The building has a light and airy feel thanks to an atrium design and a glass roof running the length of the building, and includes a number of environmental features, such as a ground-source heat pump, and the recycling of rainwater. The new building was opened in time for the start of the 2012/13 academic year. It was opened officially on 28 September 2012 by the Home Secretary, The Rt. Hon. Theresa May MP. On Remembrance Day 2014, 100 years after the outbreak of the First World War, a 13-year-old pupil, Harry Hayes, who is a member of the School's Combined Cadet Force (CCF), planted the last poppy of the Blood Swept Lands and Seas of Red, a 2014 work of installation art placed in the moat of the Tower of London, England on 11 November 2014, specifically commemorating the centenary of the outbreak of World War I (28 July 1914). Media location The school has been used as the location for a number of films, documentaries, and television programmes. * 1971 film Unman, Wittering and Zigo was filmed at the school, with the proceeds being used by the then Headmaster Patrick Richardson to pay for a fund-raising appeal for the new science block * Numerous episodes of Inspector Morse were filmed at the school, such as Last Seen Wearing (1988, Season 2, Episode 2) * 2001 film The Hole starring Keira Knightley was filmed at the school * 2005 movie Goal! was also filmed at Blue Coat. Holme Park was used as Newcastle United's training centre, with the school rugby pitches also being used as practice pitches for the football team. Extracurricular activities * The school opened a new sports centre which is also available for members of the surrounding village of Sonning to use. The Sports Hall includes a gym, changing rooms and a multi-purpose hall. * The school has its own resident orchestra, the Aldworth Philharmonic Orchestra (APO). APO was formed in 2002 by an Old Blue, Andrew Taylor. * The school was a founding member of the World Individual Debating and Public Speaking Championships, and hosted the tournament from 1988 to 1995.

A cluster algebra of rank n is an integral domain A, together with some subsets of size n called clusters whose union generates the algebra A and which satisfy various conditions. Definitions Suppose that F is an integral domain, such as the field Q(x1,...,xn) of rational functions in n variables over the rational numbers Q. A cluster of rank n consists of a set of n elements {x, y, ...} of F, usually assumed to be an algebraically independent set of generators of a field extension F. A seed consists of a cluster {x, y, ...} of F, together with an exchange matrix B with integer entries bx,y indexed by pairs of elements x, y of the cluster. The matrix is sometimes assumed to be skew-symmetric, so that bx,y = ‚Äìby,x for all x and y. More generally the matrix might be skew-symmetrizable, meaning there are positive integers dx associated with the elements of the cluster such that dxbx,y = ‚Äìdyby,x for all x and y. It is common to picture a seed as a quiver with vertices the generating set, by drawing bx,y arrows from x to y if this number is positive. When bx,y is skew symmetrizable the quiver has no loops or 2-cycles. A mutation of a seed, depending on a choice of vertex y of the cluster, is a new seed given by a generalization of tilting as follows. Exchange the values of bx,y and by,x for all x in the cluster. If bx,y > 0 and by,z > 0 then replace bx,z by bx,yby,z \\\\+ bx,z. If bx,y < 0 and by,z < 0 then replace bx,z by -bx,yby,z \\\\+ bx,z. If bx,y by,z ‚â§ 0 then do not change bx,z. Finally replace y by a new generator w, where :wy=\\\\prod_{t: \\\\, b_{t,y}>0}t^{b_{t,y}} + \\\\prod_{t: \\\\, b_{t,y}<0}t^{-b_{t,y}} where the products run through the elements t in the cluster of the seed such that bt,y is positive or negative respectively. The inverse of a mutation is also a mutation, i.e. if A is a mutation of B then B is a mutation of A. A cluster algebra is constructed from an initial seed as follows. If we repeatedly mutate the seed in all possible ways, we get a finite or infinite graph of seeds, where two seeds are joined by an edge if one can be obtained by mutating the other. The underlying algebra of the cluster algebra is the algebra generated by all the clusters of all the seeds in this graph. The cluster algebra also comes with the extra structure of the seeds of this graph. A cluster algebra is said to be of finite type if it has only a finite number of seeds. showed that the cluster algebras of finite type can be classified in terms of the Dynkin diagrams of finite-dimensional simple Lie algebras. Examples =Cluster algebras of rank 1= If {x} is the cluster of a seed of rank 1, then the only mutation takes this to {2x‚àí1}. So a cluster algebra of rank 1 is just a ring k[x,x‚àí1] of Laurent polynomials, and it has just two clusters, {x} and {2x‚àí1}. In particular it is of finite type and is associated with the Dynkin diagram A1. =Cluster algebras of rank 2= Suppose that we start with the cluster {x1, x2} and take the exchange matrix with b12 = ‚Äìb21 = 1. Then mutation gives a sequence of variables x1, x2, x3, x4,... such that the clusters are given by adjacent pairs {xn, xn+1}. The variables are related by :\\\\displaystyle x_{n-1}x_{n+1}=1+x_n, so are given by the sequence :x_1, \\\\ x_2, \\\\ x_3 = \\\\frac{1+x_2}{x_1}, \\\\ x_4 = \\\\frac{1+x_3}{x_2}=\\\\frac{1+x_1+x_2}{x_1x_2}, :x_5 = \\\\frac{1+x_4}{x_3} = \\\\frac{1+x_1}{x_2}, \\\\ x_6 = \\\\frac{1+x_5}{x_4} = x_1, \\\\ x_7 = \\\\frac{1+x_6}{x_5} = x_2, \\\\ \\\\ldots which repeats with period 5. So this cluster algebra has exactly 5 clusters, and in particular is of finite type. It is associated with the Dynkin diagram A2. There are similar examples with b12 = 1, ‚Äìb21 = 2 or 3, where the analogous sequence of cluster variables repeats with period 6 or 8. These are also of finite type, and are associated with the Dynkin diagrams B2 and G2. However if b12b21 ‚â• 4 then the sequence of cluster variables is not periodic and the cluster algebra is of infinite type. =Cluster algebras of rank 3= Suppose we start with the quiver x1 ‚Üí x2 ‚Üí x3. Then the 14 clusters are: :\\\\left\\\\\\\\{ x_1,x_2,x_3 \\\\right\\\\\\\\}, :\\\\left\\\\\\\\{\\\\frac{1+x_2}{x_1},x_2,x_3 \\\\right\\\\\\\\}, :\\\\left\\\\\\\\{x_1, \\\\frac{x_1 + x_3}{x_2},x_3 \\\\right\\\\\\\\}, :\\\\left\\\\\\\\{x_1,x_2,\\\\frac{1+x_2}{x_3}\\\\right\\\\\\\\}, :\\\\left\\\\\\\\{\\\\frac{1+x_2}{x_1}, \\\\frac{x_1 +(1+x_2)x_3}{x_1 x_2},x_3 \\\\right\\\\\\\\}, :\\\\left\\\\\\\\{\\\\frac{1+x_2}{x_1},x_2,\\\\frac{1+x_2}{x_3} \\\\right\\\\\\\\}, :\\\\left\\\\\\\\{\\\\frac{x_1+(1+x_2)x_3}{x_1x_2},\\\\frac{x_1 + x_3}{x_2},x_3 \\\\right\\\\\\\\}, :\\\\left\\\\\\\\{x_1,\\\\frac{x_1+x_3}{x_2},\\\\frac{(1+x_2)x_1+x_3}{x_2x_3} \\\\right\\\\\\\\}, :\\\\left\\\\\\\\{x_1,\\\\frac{(1+x_2)x_1 + x_3}{x_2 x_3},\\\\frac{1+x_2}{x_3} \\\\right\\\\\\\\}, :\\\\left\\\\\\\\{\\\\frac{1+x_2}{x_1},\\\\frac{x_1+(1+x_2)x_3}{x_1 x_2},\\\\frac{(1+x_2)x_1 +(1+x_2)x_3}{x_1 x_2x_3}\\\\right\\\\\\\\}, :\\\\left\\\\\\\\{\\\\frac{1+x_2}{x_1},\\\\frac{(1+x_2)x_1 +(1+x_2)x_3}{x_1 x_2x_3}, \\\\frac{1+x_2}{x_3} \\\\right\\\\\\\\}, :\\\\left\\\\\\\\{\\\\frac{x_1+(1+x_2)x_3}{x_1x_2},\\\\frac{x_1+x_3}{x_2},\\\\frac{(1+x_2)x_1+(1+x_2)x_3}{x_1 x_2 x_3} \\\\right\\\\\\\\}, :\\\\left\\\\\\\\{\\\\frac{(1+x_2)x_1 +(1+x_2)x_3}{x_1 x_2x_3},\\\\frac{x_1+x_3}{x_2},\\\\frac{(1+x_2)x_1+x_3}{x_2 x_3} \\\\right\\\\\\\\}, :\\\\left\\\\\\\\{\\\\frac{(1+x_2)x_1+(1+x_2)x_3}{x_1 x_2 x_3},\\\\frac{(1+x_2)x_1+x_3}{x_2 x_3},\\\\frac{1+x_2}{x_3} \\\\right\\\\\\\\}. There are 6 cluster variables other than the 3 initial ones x1, x2, x3 given by :\\\\frac{1+x_2}{x_1},\\\\frac{x_1 + x_3}{x_2},\\\\frac{1+x_2}{x_3}, \\\\frac{x_1+(1+x_2)x_3}{x_1x_2}, \\\\frac{(1+x_2)x_1+x_3}{x_2 x_3}, \\\\frac{(1+x_2)x_1 +(1+x_2)x_3}{x_1 x_2x_3}. They correspond to the 6 positive roots of the Dynkin diagram A3: more precisely the denominators are monomials in x1, x2, x3, corresponding to the expression of positive roots as the sum of simple roots. The 3+6 cluster variables generate a cluster algebra of finite type, associated with the Dynkin diagram A3. The 14 clusters are the vertices of the cluster graph, which is an associahedron. =Grassmannians= Simple examples are given by the algebras of homogeneous functions on the Grassmannians. The Pl√ºcker coordinates provide some of the distinguished elements. Mutation between two triangulations of the heptagon For the Grassmannian of planes in ‚ÑÇn, the situation is even more simple. In that case, the Pl√ºcker coordinates provide all the distinguished elements and the clusters can be completely described using triangulations of a regular polygon with n vertices. More precisely, clusters are in one-to-one correspondence with triangulations and the distinguished elements are in one-to-one correspondence with diagonals (line segments joining two vertices of the polygon). One can distinguish between diagonals in the boundary, which belong to every cluster, and diagonals in the interior. This corresponds to a general distinction between coefficient variables and cluster variables. =Cluster algebras arising from surfaces= Suppose S is a compact connected oriented Riemann surface and M is a non-empty finite set of points in S that contains at least one point from each boundary component of S (the boundary of S is not assumed to be either empty or non- empty). The pair (S, M) is often referred to as a bordered surface with marked points. It has been shown by Fomin-Shapiro-Thurston that if S is not a closed surface, or if M has more than one point, then the (tagged) arcs on (S, M) parameterize the set of cluster variables of certain cluster algebra A(S, M), which depends only on (S, M) and the choice of some coefficient system, in such a way that the set of (tagged) triangulations of (S, M) is in one-to-one correspondence with the set of clusters of A(S, M), two (tagged) triangulations being related by a flip if and only if the clusters they correspond to are related by cluster mutation. =Double Bruhat Cells= For G a reductive group such as GL_n with Borel subgroups B_\\\\pm then on G^{u,v} = B u B \\\\bigcap B_- v B_- (where u and v are in the Weyl group) there are cluster coordinate charts depending on reduced word decompositions of u and v. These are called factorization parameters and their structure is encoded in a wiring diagram. With only B or only B_-, this is Bruhat decomposition. References    .

He later returned to St Mirren and played there until January 1919, when he joined Football League First Division club Newcastle United as an amateur. He was given a professional contract in May of the same year, but failed to break into the first team and left at the end of the 1919‚Äì20 campaign without having made a senior appearance.Dykes, p. 47 Hutchinson rejoined Football League Third Division North outfit Ashington on a permanent deal in the summer of 1920. He played there for one season, scoring four goals in 23 league matches. In May 1922, he signed for fellow Third Division North side Nelson on a free transfer. Hutchinson made his Nelson debut on 26 August 1922 in the 2‚Äì6 defeat away at Bradford Park Avenue.Dykes, p. 76 He became first-choice left-winger at the club, and scored his first goal for the side in the 4‚Äì0 victory over Durham City at Seedhill on 10 February 1923. Hutchinson played every league game in the 1922‚Äì23 season as Nelson won the league, achieving promotion to the Football League Second Division for the first time in their history. He kept his place in the side and his final league match for Nelson was the 0‚Äì1 defeat to Oldham Athletic on 26 January 1924.Dykes, p. 77 Later in the month, his stay with Nelson ended as he moved to Stockport County in a swap for Duggie Humphrey. His spell at Stockport was brief, as he played only four league games, scoring one goal. In the summer of 1924, Hutchinson returned to the Third Division North when he joined Chesterfield on a free transfer. After one goal in 13 matches, taking him to exactly 100 league appearances, he again switched clubs at the end of the campaign, signing for Barrow in July 1925. At Holker Street, Hutchinson became a first-team regular for the first time since leaving Nelson, scoring four goals in 37 games as the side finished bottom of the Third Division North.Robinson, p. 20 Hutchinson emigrated to the United States in 1926, initially playing with the New Bedford Whalers before joining the Springfield Babes later in the season. For the 1927 campaign, he played for the Fall River Marksmen before transferring to the Newark Skeeters. He went on to assist the Hartford Americans later in 1927, playing 11 league games. He returned to England early the following year, and joined Third Division North team Darlington in March 1928. Hutchinson played three league matches and then moved into non-league football with West Stanley at the end of the season. After two years with the club, he became an amateur for Gosforth & Coxledge in September 1930, before retiring from football completely. Hutchinson died in Gosforth in the autumn of 1971, at the age of 76.

It was originally the parish church of Brampton but is now redundant. The church is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II* listed building. History The church was built on the site of a Roman fort situated on the Stanegate Roman road some south of Hadrian's Wall. The church building dates from the 12th century, with later alterations and additions. It formerly consisted of a tower, nave and chancel. The tower and nave were demolished between 1787 and 1789, although a porch was added in 1861. It was possibly re-roofed in 1891. It was replaced as the parish church in 1878 by St Martin's Church in the town of Brampton. The church was declared redundant in 1978 and the internal furnishings were removed. Architecture The church is constructed of red sandstone rubble, some of the stone having been obtained from Hadrian's Wall, with slate roofs. It consists of the former chancel and the porch. On the north side is the former sexton's lean-to shed. The porch has iron gates and oak doors, and on its gable is a cross finial. The chancel has a Norman window; the other windows date from 1891. In the chancel is a piscina and aumbry dating possibly from the 12th century. On its east gable is a cross finial and on the west gable is a bellcote.

The tiny building was opened for worship in 1834 in a part of Sussex which was a hotbed of Protestant Nonconformism, and remained as one of three places of worship in the small Wealden village until 2001, when it was sold for conversion to houses. The chapel is protected as a Grade II listed building. History Newick lies north of Lewes next to the River Ouse in the Sussex Weald. Although it is not named in the Domesday survey of 1086, it may have been considered part of a nearby settlement called Allington. It was closely associated with the nearby villages of Barcombe and Hamsey in medieval times. A church existed by 1147, when William de Warenne, 2nd Earl of Surrey granted it to Lewes Priory. From the 17th century, Protestant Nonconformity became prevalent throughout Sussex, especially in central and eastern parts of the county. Small chapels were regularly built for followers of denominations such as General Baptists, Strict Baptists, Quakers, Presbyterians, Congregationalists and Methodists, often in small villages. One such chapel was founded in 1834 on the main road from Haywards Heath to Uckfield, west of the centre of Newick village. Neither its founder nor its architect are recorded. The founding date is considered to be 14 October 1833, when a rood of land () was granted to \\"certain dissenters from the Church of England called Calvinistic Baptists\\" to build a chapel for their use. They had to pay the Lord of the Manor ¬£0.2s.6d for this right. The date of construction was recorded on the entrance porch. The population at that time was 724; by 1851 this had fallen to 483, and a population of 1,000 was only reached by 1931‚Äîby which time an Evangelical mission hall, opened in 1892, had become Newick's third place of worship. The religious census of Sussex in 1851 recorded that the chapel had 300 sittings, 250 of which were free; and attendances at morning and afternoon services were given as 130 and 50 respectively. The building was also used for Sunday school scholars, but attendance figures were not given on the census return by the minister John Poynder, who also stated that the average attendance was considerably affected by \\"the weather and other things attached to our locality\\". Zion Chapel served the Strict Baptist congregation throughout the 20th century, in common with similar chapels in nearby Wivelsfield, Lewes, Handcross, Burgess Hill, Uckfield, East Grinstead, Bolney and many other towns and villages in Sussex. Over time, its congregation dwindled, and in 2001 the decision was taken to sell the building. Its Grade II listed status, granted on 27 September 1979, offered some protection against demolition or significant alteration. Approval was granted by Lewes District Council for an extension of the structure and conversion into three houses under the name Chapel Grove. Architecture The chapel is a small and simple but \\"striking red and grey brick building\\". The street-facing fa√ßade has two round-arched windows and a gabled entrance porch inscribed with the year 1834. Above this is a pediment, flush with the fa√ßade, whose tympanum has an oculus-style recess. A distinctive feature of the pediment is its use of alternate grey and red bricks laid in Flemish bond formation; the stretcher bricks (those with the long face showing) are red and the header bricks (whose short side is showing) are red, producing a regular pattern. The other walls are solely of red brick. A cemetery survives behind the chapel, but it is not part of the conservation area; as of 2007, Lewes District Council were considering extending the area to include it.

The band consisted of Arthur Shepherd (vocals/guitar), Joseph Grillo (vocals/guitar), John Wilkinson (bass), and Drew Thomas (drums).  Former and current bands  The members of God Fires Man had been involved in several bands before God Fires Man‚Äôs creation. Arthur Shepherd (\\"Arty\\") had been part of Mind Over Matter, Errortype: Eleven, Instruction, and Gay For Johnny Depp (using the name Marty Leopard), and he is currently a member of Primitive Weapons. Joseph Grillo had been a member of Garrison, Instruction, and Gay For Johnny Depp (using the name Sid Jagger), and he is currently a member of I Hate Our Freedom. John Wilkinson previously played guitar and keys in The Symphony Case, and was also a member of Slept. Drew Thomas had played drums for Youth of Today, Bold, Into Another, Walking Concert, New Rising Sons, and Bloody Social, and he is currently in Dead Heavens.  Formation, sound, and debut album  God Fires Man was formed in 2006 following the dissolution of Instruction, in which both Arty and Joseph were members, and after the duos creation of the band Gay For Johnny Depp. God Fires Man, whose name started out as ‚ÄúFires‚Äù, finalized their lineup, and name, with the addition of John Wilkinson and Drew Thomas. The band's early sound was largely influenced by a mix of shoegaze and punk rock, which is more obvious in their b-sides. However, as the band began collaboratively writing, they quickly found their sound being more hard rock, with the subtle influence of these styles still being heard in many of their songs. On September 5, 2006, God Fires Man played their first hometown show at CBGB, their first official show being at an art space (the Lilypad) in Cambridge, MA. Working hard through the end of 2006, the band released a 5-track EP, followed by a tour in the United Kingdom in January 2007 with Hundred Reasons and Kids in Glass Houses. When God Fires Man returned stateside, they signed a record deal with InDeGoot Recordings (US), and XTRA Mile (UK). In 2007, the band recorded their debut album, ‚ÄúA Billion Balconies Facing the Sun,‚Äù working with Ethan Dussault (who had engineered records for Cave In, Toadies, and Lot 6) and Brian Virtue (who had engineered and mixed records for Audioslave, Deftones, and Jane's Addiction). Following the album's release in March 2008, God Fires Man went on a US tour with Filter, while also sharing the stage with Taking Back Sunday, Thursday, Frank Turner, 65daysofstatic, Chevelle, and Scott Weiland. For the release of \\"A Billion Balconies Facing the Sun,\\" God Fires Man was named one of iTunes ‚ÄúTop 10 New Rock Artists‚Äù in 2008.  Life Like  In January 2009, God Fires Man finished their second album titled Life Like for a June 26, 2009 release. Life Like was produced by Alex Newport (who had engineered and mixed records for At The Drive In, Mars Volta, Death Cab for Cutie, and The Melvins), and released on Arctic Rodeo Recordings (EU/JP). Swimming against the current of music conformity, Life Like was originally released on vinyl LP format. On September 22, 2009, Life Like became available for purchase on iTunes. In October and November 2009, God Fires Man toured in Germany with the Picture Books, which was the band's first time as a headliner. The tour kicked of in Dortmund, where God Fires Man played at the 20th anniversary show for the music magazine Visions. Playing the support slot for the Donots and Fire in the Attic, portions of this performance were televised on the German music show Rockpalast. At the end of the year, iTunes named Life Like as one of the best rock albums of the year in their ‚ÄúiTunes Rewind 2009‚Äù. Upon returning from Germany, God Fires Man went on permanent hiatus. In March 2010, the band play two shows supporting their good friends Rival Schools.  Past Shrugs (2005-2009)  Past Shrugs is a compilation album featuring God Fires Man songs from 2005-2009 that were not released on either of the band's two full-length studio albums. Past Shrugs features songs from the band's 2007 Dark EP, bonus tracks found on versions of Life Like, along with four songs never released, including \\"There's Nothing Left to Underachieve,\\" which was recorded with Brian Virtue in Nashville, TN on a day off while on tour with Filter.

Before his publication of the case in the British Medical Journal, Dr William Edmund Cooke had already testified at Kershaw's inquest that \\"mineral particles in the lungs originated from asbestos and were, beyond reasonable doubt, the primary cause of the fibrosis of the lungs and therefore of death\\". Her employers, Turner Brothers Asbestos, accepted no liability for her injuries, paid no compensation to her bereaved family and refused to contribute towards funeral expenses as it \\"would create a precedent and admit responsibility\\". She was buried in an unmarked pauper's grave. The subsequent inquiries into her death led to the publication of the first Asbestos Industry Regulations in 1931. Early life Nellie Kershaw was born to Elizabeth and Arthur Kershaw in Rochdale in 1891. In 1903 she left school, aged 12, to take up employment as a cotton rover in a cotton mill and 5 months later began working at Garsides asbestos mill. She transferred to Turner Brothers Asbestos on 31 December 1917, where she was employed as a rover, spinning raw asbestos fibre into yarn. She was married to Frank Kershaw, a slater's labourer, and had at least one child, a daughter born in about 1920. Illness and death She first began to exhibit symptoms in 1920 at the age of 29 but continued to work in the asbestos mill until 22 July 1922, when she was certified unfit to work. Because Kershaw's medical certificate (produced by her local physician Dr Walter Scott Joss) recorded the diagnosis as \\"asbestos poisoning\\" she was ineligible for National Health Insurance sickness benefits. As the illness was linked to her occupation, the insurers advised her that she should instead seek sickness benefits from her employers, under the Workmen's Compensation Act, and wrote to Turner Brothers on her behalf on several occasions. However, Turner Brothers refused to pay any benefits because asbestos-related illness was not a recognised occupational disease at that time, and instructed their insurance company to \\"repudiate the claim\\" as it would be \\"exceedingly dangerous\\" to accept \\"any liability whatever in such a case.\\" Percy George Kenyon, Turner's works' manager at Rochdale, wrote to Dr Joss demanding that he \\"inform us what you have said to Miss Kershaw about suffering from Asbestos poisoning\\" and then wrote to the medical insurance board stating that \\"We repudiate the term \\"Asbestos Poisoning\\". Asbestos is not poisonous and no definition or knowledge of such a disease exists. Such a description is not to be found amongst the list of industrial diseases in the schedule published with the Workmen's Compensation Act.\\" She is known to have written to Turner Brothers herself on at least one occasion, asking: \\"What are you going to do about my case? I have been home 9 weeks now and have not received a penny ‚Äì I think it's time that there was something from you as the National Health refuses to pay me anything. I am needing nourishment and the money, I should have had 9 weeks wages now through no fault of my own.\\"Mrs N. Kershaw, letter to Turner Brothers Asbestos Company, 1922. Quoted in Selikoff; Greenberg, above. There is no record that she received payments of any form from any official source between July 1922 and her death. She died at 6.30am on 14 March 1924, aged 33. Inquest E. N. Molesworth, the coroner for Rochdale, was obliged to investigate all cases of \\"unnatural\\" death, and Dr Joss's diagnosis of \\"asbestos poisoning\\" led Molesworth to launch a formal inquest on 14 March 1924, which was adjourned awaiting an autopsy, to be conducted by Dr F.W. Mackichan.Selikoff and Greenberg record the pathologist as Dr \\"Machichan\\" while Cooke writing in 1924 gives \\"Mackichan\\". Mackichan gave the cause of death as \\"pulmonary tuberculosis and heart failure\\" but a further adjournment was granted for microscopic examination of the lungs. When the inquest was resumed on 1 April 1924 Turner Brothers instructed a barrister, Mr. McCleary, and their solicitor G.L. Collins, of Jackson & Co., to attend in order to represent their interests and to \\"evade any financial liability for Mrs. Kershaw's death.\\" Dr William Edmund Cooke, a pathologist and bacteriologist at Wigan Infirmary and Leigh Infirmary, testified that his examination of the lungs indicated old scarring indicative of a previously healed tuberculosis infection, and in addition, extensive fibrosis, in which were visible \\"particles of mineral matter ... of various shapes, but the large majority have sharp angles. The size varies from 393.6 to 3 Œºm in length.\\" Having compared these particles with samples of asbestos dust provided by Dr S.A. Henry, Medical Inspector of Factories, Cooke concluded that they \\"originated from asbestos and were, beyond a reasonable doubt, the primary cause of the fibrosis of the lungs and therefore of death\\". In his written testimony to the inquest, Walter Joss stated that his diagnosis of \\"asbestos poisoning\\" was based upon his \\"previous experience of such a lung condition for many of his patients who were asbestos workers\\", and that he personally saw 10 to 12 similar cases each year, all in persons working with asbestos. Nellie's death certificate was issued 2 April 1924, citing \\"Fibrosis of the lungs due to the inhalation of mineral particles\\" as the cause of death. In a fuller version of Kershaw's case published in the BMJ in 1927, Dr Cooke gave the disease the name by which it is still known: \\"pulmonary asbestosis\\". Parliamentary inquiry As a result of Cooke's paper, Parliament commissioned an inquiry into the effects of asbestos dust by Dr E. R. A. Merewether, Medical Inspector of Factories, and , a factory inspector and pioneer of dust monitoring and control. Their subsequent report, Occurrence of Pulmonary Fibrosis & Other Pulmonary Affections in Asbestos Workers, was presented to parliament on 24 March 1930.Published as Report on the effects of asbestos dust on the lungs and dust suppression in the asbestos industry. Part I. Occurrence of pulmonary fibrosis and other pulmonary affections in asbestos workers. Part II. Processes giving rise to dust and methods for its suppression. London: HMSO, 1930. It concluded that the development of asbestosis was irrefutably linked to the prolonged inhalation of asbestos dust, and included the first health study of asbestos workers, which found that 66% of those employed for 20 years or more suffered from asbestosis. The report led to the publication of the first Asbestos Industry Regulations in 1931, which came into effect on 1 March 1932. Memorial In April 2006, a relative of Kershaw unveiled a memorial stone to asbestos victims worldwide in Rochdale. The memorial service was organised by the Save Spodden Valley campaign, an action group concerned about asbestos contamination on the former Turner's factory site where Kershaw had been employed.

In high school he developed a strong interest in baseball, discovering the alt.sports.baseball.sea-mariners newsgroup, reading Rob Neyer and playing the sport. Cameron, a varsity catcher, made the state's all-star team his senior year when he led the league in walks. After high school he attended the University of North Carolina at Greensboro where he received his degree in economics. In 1999 he began writing for Baseball Prospectus then, three years later, in 2002 he created U.S.S. Mariner with Derek Zumsteg and Jason Barker. The website was named after \\"the U.S.S.

Make Felix throw a change-up or a curve ball to the first batter. Throw a first pitch slider in the first inning.\\". This letter eventually was passed along by a fan to Chaves, who had previously been attempting to make the same point to Hernandez and used the letter as reinforcement. Hernandez changed his pitching approach the next game saying: \\"On the internet, they say when I throw a lot of fastballs in the first inning, they score a lot of runs. I tried to mix all my pitches in the first inning.\\" =San Diego Padres= On January 10, 2018 it was reported Cameron would join the San Diego Padres.

It was organized as a bicameral legislature with a territorial council and a territorial house of representatives.Brown, Kenny L. \\"Oklahoma Territory ,\\" Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture. (accessed September 30, 2013) They met for 120-day sessions in Guthrie, Oklahoma.Everett, Dianna, \\"Organic Act, 1890 ,\\" Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture (accessed September 30, 2013). George W. Steele of Indiana, the first Oklahoma territorial governor, scheduled the election of the first legislature for August 5, 1890. The elected lawmakers met for the first time later that year. The Oklahoma Territorial Legislature met for the last time in 1905.Darcy, R. \\"The Oklahoma Territorial Legislature: 1890-1905.\\" (accessed September 30, 2013) The territorial legislature was responsible for establishing higher education institutions in the region. Politics The People's Party rose during the Territorial era and voters sent several Populist candidates to the legislature. A large majority of Populist legislators were farmers.Miller, Worth Robert. \\"Populist (People's) Party) ,\\" Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture. (accessed April 20, 2010) Populists elected five of 39 territorial legislators in 1890, but led through a coalition of Populists, Democrats, and renegade Republicans. They were responsible for the location of what would become Oklahoma State University in Stillwater. George Gardenhire served as the First Territorial Senate President and Arthur N. Daniels as Territorial House Speaker. The question of where the capitol would be located was what drove the coalition that wrested power away from Republicans. Generally, the Democrats were in favor of Oklahoma City while the Republicans favored Guthrie, but the two Republicans who joined the coalition of Democrats and Populists were from Oklahoma City. With 14 Democratic lawmakers, five Populists, and two Republicans, the coalition had 21 of the 39 seats. However, a veto by the territorial governor blocked the 1890 effort to relocate the capitol. Democrats and Populists again gained control of the legislature in 1893, despite a Republican majority in the council and a Democratic defection in the House. Republican W.A. McCartney was elected Council President by Democratic and Populist votes while T.R. Waggoner was elected Speaker of the House when a Republican tired of tied votes and changed sides to move the process along. Only one Democrat was elected to the 1895 council and voted with the seven Republicans against the five Populists to make J.H. Pitzer the council's president. Republicans also took control of the House, but lost some power due to the Democratic governor's veto. Republicans took control of the legislature only one more time during the territorial era; Populists lost in the election of 1902 and thereafter. Actions =Contributions to Education= The Oklahoma Organic Act required that educational institutions be created within the state. Governor George Washington Steele legally approved the creation of University of Oklahoma in Norman, Oklahoma on December 19, 1890, and the Oklahoma Agricultural and Mechanical College in Stillwater, Oklahoma and Oklahoma Normal School for Teachers located in Edmond, Oklahoma on December 25, 1890.\\"History of the State System\\", Oklahoma State Regents for Higher Education. (accessed September 30, 2013) In 1897, Colored Agricultural and Normal University in Langston, Oklahoma Normal School for Teachers in Alva, Oklahoma, were created. In 1901, Normal School for Teachers in Weatherford, Oklahoma, and the Oklahoma University Preparatory School in Tonkawa, Oklahoma, were also established. In 1901, the territorial legislature appropriated funds to establish the University Preparatory School at Tonkawa, Oklahoma.Wilson, Linda D., \\"Schools, Preparatory,\\" Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture.

It was commissioned by Baron Louis Empain, son of the Belgian industrialist √âdouard Empain. Since its restoration in 2009‚Äì2011, it has been open to the public. History =Background= Baron Louis Empain (1908‚Äì1976) was the second son of √âdouard Empain (1852‚Äì1929), a respected Belgian industrialist who had spent much of his career in Egypt. In 1930, he commissioned the Swiss architect Michel Polak to build a large house in the Art Deco style on the edge of the Bois de la Cambre/Ter Kamerenbos in the emerging southern suburbs of Brussels. =Building= Built between 1930 and 1934, the Villa Empain is organised around a large enclosed courtyard. It was designed in the Art Deco style, and the project aroused significant interest in Belgium where prestigious houses in the style were comparatively rare. Various expensive stone facings were used from around the world. =Occupation= Despite the expense incurred in construction, Louis Empain barely used the house after its completion and lived primarily in Canada. In 1937 it was donated to the Belgian State to house a museum of applied arts for the √âcole nationale sup√©rieure d'Architecture et des Arts d√©coratifs de La Cambre. It was commandeered by the German Army in November 1943 during the occupation. After the war, the Villa was ceded to the Soviet Union as an embassy at the initiative of Paul-Henri Spaak. Disapproving of this use, it was reacquired by the Empain family in 1963 and resold in 1973 to Harry Tcherkezian, an Armenian-American tobacco entrepreneur. It was used by Radio-T√©l√©vision-Luxembourg (RTL) from 1980 to 1993, before becoming unoccupied after 1995. The building was classified in 2007, but its condition degraded significantly.

It was first broadcast in syndication on December 17, 1980. The story takes place in the Evergreen Forest, home of the forest ranger Dan, his children Tommy and Julie, and their pet sheepdog, Schaeffer. The special was followed by The Raccoons on Ice (1981) and The Raccoons and the Lost Star (1983), the direct-to-video special The Raccoons: Let's Dance! (1984) and finally the television series beginning in 1985. Plot On December 23, Ranger Dan receives a call that all the trees in the forest are disappearing. Tommy and Julie are concerned, but Dan is doing the investigating. Meanwhile, in another part of the forest, a trio of raccoons (married couple Ralph and Melissa and their friend Bert) prepare their home, The Raccoondominium, for Christmas. Their joy is cut short when they see in the news that all the trees in the forest are disappearing. Nearby, local aardvark millionaire Cyril Sneer is revealed to be the tree thief hoping to make a profit out of the lumber. His college-educated son Cedric tries to talk him out of his crazed plans to destroy the whole forest. Cyril ignores Cedric and chops down a whole line of trees, including the Raccoondominium. However, Cyril loses the Raccoons' tree and Tommy, Julie, and Schaeffer find it and take it home. Left without a home, the Raccoons try to find who's behind the destruction of the forest. Ralph sees Tommy, Julie and Schaeffer dragging it to the cabin and deduces they are the forest destroyers and follows them. While Tommy and Julie go out, leaving Schaeffer alone in the cabin, the Raccoons sneak inside and find the Raccoondominium decorated with ornaments, tinsel, and lights. As Melissa tries to get their Christmas stockings back, Schaeffer wakes up from his nap and chases the Raccoons through the forest. The chase leads the four animals to Cyril's sawmill, where they find the source of the forest destruction. As Cyril and Cedric head out to cut down the rest of the trees in the forest, the Raccoons and Schaeffer catch the two Sneers. After some convincing that there's a profit in planting trees, Cyril reluctantly agrees to replant all of the trees. The animals are pleased they have saved the forest, but the Raccoons are still homeless. Schaeffer returns to the cabin, where Julie and Tommy wait for him. Just then, Julie and Tommy see the homeless Raccoons in the cold and realise that their Christmas tree must be the Raccoons' home. Julie phones their father to ask him to find a new home for them. Dan agrees and the group celebrate. The next day Julie and Tommy wake up only to find it is Christmas Eve and they must have dreamed the events of the previous 'day'. However, Dan tells them that the trees have miraculously stopped being cut down. He reads a newspaper article to them which says that thousands of seedlings were planted overnight, but the tree planter is anonymous. Suddenly, Schaeffer, Julie and Tommy see outside the window the Raccoons settling in a newly re-planted tree nearby.

Portrayed by Nia Caron, the character first appeared on-screen in 1999. Anita is the mother of Daren Howarth (Huw Euron), Dwayne Richards (Paul Morgans/Darryl Shute) and Eira Pierce, as well as the step-mother to Kevin Powell (Iwan \\"Iwcs\\" Roberts) and Gabriella Gonzalez through her marriage to Meic Pierce (Gareth Lewis). Since her onscreen debut in 1999 the character has been involved in many high profile storylines including the deaths of two of her children, Dwayne and Eira, the Deri Arms (of which she was landlady) burning down in 2008, an affair with Colin Evans (Jonathan Nefydd) that led to the break up of her marriage with Meic Pierce, and discovering that her partner Moc Thomas (Aneirin Hughes) had abused his son Gethin (Simon Watts) as a child. Character information =Storylines= A stubborn woman with firm opinions, Anita has shown to be deeply protective of her nearest and dearest, as well as anyone else who has problems. Llanarthur resident Anita first entered the lives of Cwmderi residents as the mother of Darren Howarth. Darren had never known his biological father, however with time he was revealed to be Meic Pierce, with whom Anita had had a brief relationship several years earlier. As father and son got to know each other for the first time, so there was a slow rekindling of the relationship between Anita and Meic. It was Meic who persuaded Anita to attend Darren's wedding to Lowri Jenkins (Meleri Bryn) (a partnership of which Anita disapproved) arguing that her relationship with her son would never recover. Anita later moved to Cwmderi where she found work first as a cleaner, and later at the Cafe with Reg Harries (Huw Ceredig), running adult toy parties for women and at the Deri Deithio taxi company before becoming the landlady of the Deri Arms pub with Meic in 2003, eventually purchasing the business from Kath Jones (Siw Hughes). 2003 saw Anita's niece Kelly Evans (Lauren Phillips) come to stay at the Deri Arms while she was on bail. Anita and Kelly developed a strong bond and Kelly decided to remain in Cwmderi for a prolonged period. Following a car crash, Anita gave birth prematurely to a daughter with Meic, Eira in 2005. Tragically, she died soon after. Anita blamed Darren for the crash, though the pair eventually reconciled. By 2008 the Deri Arms was suffering financially due to competition from the newly opened rugby club at the top of Cwmderi high street. It was at this time the Deri caught fire and was destroyed. For a time there was suspicion that the fire had been started deliberately for the insurance money. Before long Anita and Meic were able to buy the rugby club and re-christened it as the Deri Arms. In 2009 Anita lost her son Dwayne suddenly to a fatal brain haemorrhage. It was suspected that the brain haemorrhage was the result of an altercation with Garry Monk (Richard Lynch) the previous day which had ended in Dwayne banging his head on a metal shelf. Anita took the loss very hard and was determined to see Monk persecuted for the death, though he was eventually found not guilty. Meic and Anita's marriage came to an end in 2011 when Anita's affair with Colin Evans was discovered. While Colin and Anita's relationship was ultimately short-lived it did bring about an end of an era. Meic and Anita sold the Deri Arms to Ed Charles (Geraint Todd) and Angela Probert (Tara Bethan) while Anita found refuge staying with Diane (Victoria Pluknett) at Bryn Tirion. The arrival of Moc Thomas as Cwmderi's new bank manager led to a new romance for Anita, and she was fiercely protective when accusations of historical child abuse were made against him by his son Gethin. Anita was left devastated when Moc had an affair with Sheryl before felling as the accusations proved true. Anita felt that her relationship with Moc had placed her own grandchild, Will in danger. Despite their marriage being over Anita and Meic found themselves living together under the same roof once again. Relations between the two were generally friendly and Anita was of great support to Meic when his son Kevin was found guilty of rape. Anita struggled when Meic started seeing Kevin's former wife Debbie Collins (Maria Pride) but this relationship proved short lived and Anita and Meic rekindled their romance. This reunion, however, was marked by tragedy however as Meic was diagnosed with terminal cancer. It was at this time that Meic discovered the existence of a Patagonian daughter, Gabriella Gonzalez, the result of an affair with Mair James when Meic and Anita were dating for the first time in the 70s. Anita struggled with Gabriella's presence in their lives and felt jealous of the time the two were spending together. Meic and Anita planned to re-marry but as Meic's condition deteriorated they were unable to go through with ceremony. Unwilling to put Anita through the burden of caring for him during his dying days, Meic decided to leave for Patagonia with Gabriella. Anita was devastated by his decision and was angry that the choice was made for her. When news came of Meic's death Anita was further distraught at discovering that he had already been cremated by Gabriella, robbing her of the chance to arrange his funeral. The two eventually made peace and spread Meic's ashes together in Anglesea. Following Meic's death Kelly returned to Cwmderi to live with Anita and help her through her grief. 2016 saw Anita start work for Awyr Iach clothing company as an accountant. She also started a fling with Sam Evans, Colin's father, for whom she faced stiff competition from Dol Collins. Sam moved in for a brief while but the final straw came when his pet snake escaped and Anita decided she saw no future for their relationship. In late 2016 Kevin was granted bail, on condition that he had somewhere to stay. Feeling a sense of duty, and believing it to be what Meic would have wanted, Anita decided to allow Kevin to stay at No.10 with her and Kelly. Many of Cwmderi's residents did not take kindly to Anita's decision least of all Kelly, herself a rape survivor. Kevin slowly began to earn the family's trust and Anita decided to offer him half of the house as an inheritance from Meic, it soon transpired however that Kevin's intensions were far from pure. He had intended to take advantage of Anita and Kelly's holiday abroad to rob them of everything in a plot devised with his mother Nansi Furlong (Marged Esli). They were caught in the act by Anita, who returned earlier than planned following an argument with Kelly. Anita was hospitalised after being pushed by Nansi, and though she decided not to report Kevin's actions to the police she did ask him to leave Cwmderi. =Family= Anita first met and had a relationship with Meic Pierce before he moved to Cwmderi. This relationship led to the birth of her eldest son Darren Howarth, although Meic was completely unaware of his sons existence for decades. Anita went on to have a second son in Dwayne Richards. Upon rekindling her romance with Meic later, decades after their initial affair Anita gave birth to a daughter, Eira who died tragically shortly afterwards. Through Darren she has two grandchildren, Will and Alys. Anita has one sister, Amanda (Sian Rivers D'Alesio) and is very close to her niece Kelly.

Although it is very hard to determine the age of yew trees,Harte 1996Kinmonth 2006 the churchyard gate holds a certificate from the Yew Tree Campaign in 2002, signed by David Bellamy, which states that \\"according to all the data we have to hand\\" the tree is dated to between 4,000 and 5,000 years old. There is an alternative theory that presumes the tree is only as old as the adjacent saint site, which would make it around 1,500 years old.Bevan-Jones 2004, p. 49. In the mid-1990s the church oil tank stood in the space between the two trunk fragments; however, this was moved when it was realised that the tree was ancient. When this tank was built a lot of the dead wood was removed from the site which makes dating the age of the tree more difficult for dendrochronologists. In June 2002, the Tree Council, in celebration of the Golden Jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II designated the Llangernyw Yew tree one of the Fifty Great British trees in recognition of its place in national heritage. Legend of the Angelystor According to local tradition, the church of Llangernyw is inhabited by an ancient spirit known as Angelystor (the \\"Recording Angel\\" or \\"Evangelist\\" in WelshPughe 1832, p. 53.). This tradition holds that every year at Halloween a booming voice foretells the names of parishioners who will die the following year. Folklore tells of a disbelieving local man, Si√¥n Ap Rhobert, who challenged the existence of the spirit one Halloween night only to hear his own name called out, followed by his death within the year.Owen 1896, p. 170.

The program has the form of a game show in which two teams, each with a team leader and weekly guest, compete against each other. The scoring is not serious; after the first round, for instance, the score is always 4-4. History Dit was het nieuws is based on the BBC television program Have I Got News for You. On 28 June 1996, the first episode of Dit was het nieuws was aired by broadcasting station TROS on the Nederland 2 channel. The team leaders were Thomas Acda and Raoul Heertje, and the show was hosted by Harm Edens. Initially, the program garnered the same bleak impression that many failed attempts of satirical television in the Netherlands had given in the past. However, thanks to the members' council of TROS, the program had the chance to become a successful variation of the British show. The core of the show's cast remained the same until the sixth season (2000), when Thomas Acda left the show in order to pursue a singing career with Paul de Munnik (Acda en De Munnik). The seventh season was a special season about the European Football Championship, and Peter Heerschop, a Dutch actor, replaced Acda as one of the permanent team leaders. For the next season, comedian Marc-Marie Huijbregts replaced Peter Heerschop as team leader. Huijbregts' successor was young comedian Jan Jaap van der Wall, who served as team captain for a decade. Even though the show had been increasing in ratings and was becoming more popular, TROS decided to discontinue the program in 2009.Dit w√°s echt het nieuws, televizier.nl, 12 november 2009 While other public networks had expressed interest in the program, the network manager of Nederland 1, Marcel Peek, believed that the program should end. He thought that the guests were not always good enough and that too few episodes were made per year.DWHN, Raoulheertje.nl, 15 december 2009 On 19 December, after thirteen years and over 150 episodes, the last episode aired. In December 2009, RTL Boulevard announced that commercial broadcaster RTL was interested in the program, and there were talks about the continuation of the show by RTL.RTL ge√Ønteresseerd in 'Dit was het nieuws', RTL Boulevard, 15 december 2009 On 5 June 2010 eventually, RTL broadcast a single test episode that was dedicated to the Dutch general election. As a result of its success, RTL started broadcasting new episodes as of 20 May 2011. Since Van der Wal was busy working on other shows, Thomas Acda resumed his role as a team captain. In 2014, Raoul Heertje and Thomas Acda decided to leave Dit was het nieuws. They were replaced by comedians Martijn Koning and Dani√´l Arends. In 2017, the show returned to the AVROTROS, broadcast on NPO 1, with team captains Jan Jaap van der Wal and Peter Pannekoek.

That firm was later acquired by Paine Webber, which is today a part of UBS History The firm's predecessor, J. & W. Seligman & Co. was founded as an importing house by Joseph Seligman and his brothers in New York in 1846. After the American Civil War ended, the Seligman brothers decided to go into the banking business and a year later, Jesse Seligman went to Frankfurt, Germany, to open a bank, where they were the first American banking firm to sell United States Government bonds in Europe. In the post-Civil War robber baron era, the firm invested heavily in railroad finance, in particular acting as broker of transactions engineered by Jay Gould. Later, in 1876, the Seligmans joined forces with the Vanderbilt family to create public utilities in New York.The Seligman Legacy. Archived Company Website, Retrieved April 20, 2010 In the early 20th century the firm's predecessor backed the construction of the Panama Canal. In this period, J.& W. Seligman & Co.

In 1910 William C. Durant of the fledgling General Motors Corporation gave control of his company's board to the Seligmans and Lee, Higginson & Co. in return for underwriting $15 million worth of corporate notes. However, by the 1930s, Seligman's investment banking business was declining.

The museum sits on the Thea Foss Waterway. Along with the Discovery Wharf Children's Activity Area, the WWMM is a part of the Foss Waterway Seaport, a 501c3 non-profit organization founded in 1996. In conjunction with the Foss Waterway Development Agency, the Seaport seeks private and public funds to support its mission statement. The Working Waterfront Maritime Museum is dedicated to creating \\"a permanent education and activity venue on the Tacoma waterfront\\". Mission and vision The activities of the Working Waterfront Maritime Museum are governed by a mission statement which is as follows: \\"The mission of the Foss Waterway Seaport is to celebrate Tacoma's rich maritime heritage ‚Äî past, present, and future.\\" From the foundation of the current city to the modern day, a large part of Tacoma's commerce has depended on maritime industry. The museum also includes education on marine biology, pre-contact maritime culture, and recreational boating. The museum's vision statement reads as follows: > The development partners of this project ‚Äî the Foss Waterway Seaport and the > Foss Waterway Development Authority ‚Äî are dedicated to creating a venue that > will continue to bring the downtown waterfront to life as a place for > everyone. When fully completed, the Seaport will be the most comprehensive > maritime heritage and education center on the US west coast and the only > authentic facility in the Pacific Northwest to showcase the region's > maritime history in a location where that history actually took place[.] The claim of authenticity is based on the history of the site (see below). This vision includes a broad visitor base, however the Maritime Museum features many exhibits and events geared towards children. Organizational structure Like many non-profit museums, the WWMM is governed by a board of trustees. At the Working Waterfront Maritime Museum the regular board consists of 23 members, including a president, two vice-presidents and a treasurer. In addition, two members comprise the emeritus board. The museum has five full- time staff members: an executive director, administrative manager, marketing and program manager, visual art producer, and facilities manager. The WWMM also depends on a large group of volunteers. History The Maritime Museum began in the 1990s as \\"Life on the Sound,\\" a project which attempted to increase community space available to \\"celebrate the art, culture, crafts and skills of Puget Sound's maritime community.\\" In 1996 this was incorporated as a 501(c)(3) organization, then called the Commencement Bay Maritime Association. When the project's concept expanded beyond the museum itself, in 2005, it was renamed the Foss Waterway Seaport. The building is housed in the Puget Sound Freight Warehouse. At the center of the Maritime Museum is the historic Balfour Dock building, which served as a cargo wharf for over seven decades, until its closure in the 1970s. The museum has recently renovated this space to expand meeting space and exhibits. Audience The vision statement (see above) of the museum describes their audience as \\"everyone.\\" Many of their programs and exhibits are intended for children, which in turn drives their audience towards families. Many reviews of the museum also mention children's experiences. This is fairly common among many types of museums, however, and visitors will find adult-oriented content alongside that intended for children. Exhibitions The Working Waterfront Maritime Museum has two primary exhibitions, \\"Back Yard to Big Time,\\" and the \\"Balfour Dock Building.\\" The museum also holds several exhibits of individual objects, including the James Robert Hanssen rowboat, Andrew Foss rowboats, Willits canoes, a model SS Tacoma, and a selection of early maritime photos. The museum houses ongoing boat restoration projects, which are on view. Tall ships also frequent the museum's dock on yearly festival rounds. Ten upcoming exhibits have been proposed by the development teams, descriptions of which are available through their website: Early Waterfront Life, Connecting Waterfront Communities, The Lumber Capital of the World, The Foss Story, Tacoma Ships, Our World Waterfront Link, International Shipping and Trade, Labor and the Working Waterfront, The Waterfront and the Environment, Balancing the Uses, and The Recreational Boat Building Business. These exhibits are still in development and dates have not been provided for their openings. Public programs The Working Waterway Maritime Museum hosts one major public program designed to educate the public and foster community. During the summer, the museum hosts a weekly children's event called \\"Whoopee! It's Wednesday!\\" with weekly educational themes like individual histories or specific crafts related to local maritime industry. Admission is variable, based on the activities. Collections The museum feature a number of historic boats (see Exhibits). Collections information is not available through the primary website. The absence of a full-time collections manager may indicate the museum does not hold a traditional collection of accessioned, permanent objects. This does not mean the Working Waterfront is not a museum, but it is closer to the ecomuseum tradition, instead of the classic cabinet of curiosities model.

In the song, Nixon not only asserts that he is the father of Gibson's child, but is also married to her (with Joan Collins performing the ceremony at a chapel in Las Vegas). He also manages to insult Rick Astley (\\"a pantywaist\\"), Spuds McKenzie (\\"hate that dog\\") and Tiffany (\\"wrestling in Jello\\") along the way, all in just two minutes and three seconds. The song is not, however, a direct attack on any one artist, but rather a parody of tabloid gossip (hence the title) and pop culture in a similar vein to Weird Al Yankovic's \\"Headline News\\" of several years later. Not surprisingly, the song caused a bit of controversy. Gibson herself was even moved to write an answer song, \\"Stuffy White Girl\\", which she planned to release as a b-side, but ultimately thought better of it. It did give Mojo his first Billboard chart appearance, as the tune peaked at #16 on the Modern Rock listings in the summer of 1989. Video The music video, produced by T'Boo Dalton and directed by Scott Kalvert, features Nixon and Roper with lookalikes of Tiffany, Astley and Collins‚Äîand actress Winona Ryder as Debbie Gibson. Ryder (who once called the video \\"my favorite role of all time\\") wears a wedding dress and gives birth to \\"a Bigfoot baby, all covered in fur\\" with the requisite two heads. Kalvert's Boston partner and producer David Horgan was on the set offering Kalvert creative support. However, MTV (perhaps fearing legal action) declined to add the video to its regular rotation, despite having Nixon as a network spokesman (itself surprising, since Mojo had first won fame with his song \\"Stuffin' Martha's Muffin\\", a reference to then-VJ Martha Quinn). Mojo and Skid did perform the song on MTV's late-night 120 Minutes (even then, Nixon was forced to mumble the word \\"fornication\\"), but the channel's refusal to air the video led to Mojo Nixon severing ties with the network.

Founded in 1817 by members of the congregation of an older Baptist chapel in the ancient town, it was extended several times in the 19th century as attendances grew during Hastings' period of rapid growth as a seaside resort. It was closed and converted into a house in the late 20th century, but still stands in a prominent position in the Old Town. English Heritage has listed the building at Grade II for its architectural and historical importance. History Hastings is one of the oldest settlements in Sussex. Its position‚Äîa sheltered natural harbour near fertile fishing grounds in the English Channel, surrounded by forests and marshes‚Äîallowed an autonomous settlement to develop from about the 8th century. The Haestingas tribe, finally overcome by King Offa of Mercia in 771, gave its name to the settlement in which they were based. The town was large and important enough to have a mint by 928; and a century later its most famous event, the Battle of Hastings, brought it to wider attention. Several churches were founded in the medieval era: there were seven in 1291. Over the centuries, most were closed and demolished. The two oldest survivors, St Clement's Church (rebuilt after being damaged by French raiders in 1377) and All Saints Church (about 1410), lie either side of the parallel streets which formed the heart of the Old Town. In 1801, these were still the only two churches in the Old Town; but in about 1809, Protestant Nonconformism‚Äîprevalent throughout Sussex since the 17th century‚Äî made its first appearance in the form of a small chapel on Tackleway, behind the beach at Rock-a-Nore. Cow Lodge Chapel was built for Strict Baptists and was attended by a David Fenner. A disagreement among the congregation led to the secession of some members in 1817. Fenner was one of the secessionists, and in that year he built a new chapel on a steeply sloping site behind Tackleway. Ebenezer Baptist Chapel now occupies this building in the Silverhill area of Hastings. Later, the road on which the chapel stood took the name Ebenezer from the chapel. The congregation grew throughout the 19th century as Hastings developed into a popular seaside resort. The religious census of Sussex in 1851 recorded that the chapel had 280 sittings, 135 of which were free; and attendances at the morning and afternoon services were given as 200 and 210 respectively. The minister David Fermer stated on the census return that \\"the number of persons who attend Ebenezer Church amount to about 300, but seldom all meet at one service\\". Extensions and alterations were made in 1872, 1882 and 1886, and the pedimented fa√ßade was added around that time as well. In contrast, attendances declined in the late 20th century, and in common with many other Baptist chapels in Sussex (at, for example, Burgess Hill, Newick, Hadlow Down, Bolney, Southover, Pell Green Rye and Shover's Green), it has been sold and converted into a house. The building's marriage registration was cancelled in October 1999. The cause survives, though: a former Plymouth Brethren meeting room in the Silverhill suburb of Hastings was acquired and is now a Gospel Standard Strict Baptist chapel, again named Ebenezer. Ebenezer Particular Baptist Chapel was listed at Grade II by English Heritage on 19 January 1951; this defines it as a \\"nationally important\\" building of \\"special interest\\". As of February 2001, it was one of 521 Grade II listed buildings, and 535 listed buildings of all grades, in the borough of Hastings. Architecture The chapel is Neoclassical in style and has a rendered exterior which has now been painted over. The walls underneath are brick. The two-storey building has three bays, each with a sash window (described by Ian Nairn and Nikolaus Pevsner as \\"oddly debased\\"). A wide string course divides the upper and lower floors. The entrance porch is flanked by pilasters and has a cornice and parapet with a tympanum. Below the roofline, a set of three sash windows are topped with slightly recessed arches which extend above the level of the cornice; the centre arch is higher. Above these is a pediment with a circular recess surrounded by four keystones. At the rear (facing Tackleway), some of the original red-brick wall remains, although it has been altered. There are some yellow brick dressings, three arched windows and another pediment.

The episode premiered on the Fox network on May 11, 2010. It was directed by Alfonso Gomez-Rejon and written by series creator Ryan Murphy. In \\"Laryngitis\\", glee club member Puck (Mark Salling) dates Mercedes (Amber Riley) in an attempt to raise his social status. Kurt (Chris Colfer) is jealous of the time his father is spending with Finn (Cory Monteith), and Rachel (Lea Michele) worries about her future when she is diagnosed with tonsillitis. Mike O'Malley guest-stars as Kurt's father Burt, and Zack Weinstein appears as disabled former football player Sean Fretthold. The episode features cover versions of seven songs, five of which were released as singles, available for digital download, and three of which are included on the soundtrack album Glee: The Music, Volume 3 ‚Äì Showstoppers. \\"Laryngitis\\" was watched by 11.57 million American viewers and received mixed reviews from critics. Emily VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club, Bobby Hankinson of the Houston Chronicle, Vanity Fair Brett Berk and James Poniewozik of Time all enjoyed the episode, noting that it came after several lesser-quality episodes since the show's return from its mid-season break. In contrast, Lisa Respers France of CNN felt that \\"Laryngitis\\" was lecturing in tone, and more sad than it was comedic. Henrik Batallones of BuddyTV and Entertainment Weekly Darren Franich both expressed concern with the disability plot, the former finding it forced and the latter questioning whether Glee honors its disabled actors, or uses them shamelessly. Plot When glee club member Puck (Mark Salling) has his mohawk shaved off at the insistence of his dermatologist for medical purposes, he discovers he is no longer considered a credible bully. He realizes that Mercedes (Amber Riley) has become popular since joining the cheerleading squad, and resolves to date her. Mercedes initially attempts to dissuade him, but after the two sing a duet of \\"The Lady Is a Tramp\\", she warms to him. Puck's former girlfriend Santana (Naya Rivera) is jealous, and she and Mercedes sing \\"The Boy Is Mine\\". When Mercedes realizes that Puck has returned to being a bully, she breaks up with him and resigns from the cheerleading squad. Meanwhile, Rachel (Lea Michele) realizes that some glee club members are faking their singing. She tells glee club director Will Schuester (Matthew Morrison), complaining that she is doing most of the work, exhausting herself and getting ill in the process. She reveals the non-participants as Finn (Cory Monteith), Quinn (Dianna Agron), Puck, Brittany (Heather Morris), and Santana. Will gathers the students and gives them a new task for the week: each club member will have to do solos, and each must choose a song that best represents their feelings. Rachel then confronts the non-participating glee members and insults them, but when she starts to sing Miley Cyrus's \\"The Climb\\", she sounds terrible: she has started to lose her voice. Later, after an examination by Rachel's doctor reveals that she suffers from tonsillitis and may need to have her tonsils removed, she is afraid to have the surgery lest it affect her voice, as she believes her singing ability is her only asset. Finn, who accompanied her to the doctor's, tries to convince her that he loves everything about her and that there is more to her than her voice. He warns her that if she loses her ability to sing then Jesse (Jonathan Groff) would no longer find her attractive. Rachel tells Finn that she still cares about Jesse and that he needs to move on, prompting Finn to sing \\"Jessie's Girl\\" as his solo assignment. To put her fear into perspective, Finn introduces her to his friend Sean (Zack Weinstein), who was paralyzed from the upper chest down during a football game. At first, Rachel is nervous and overwhelmed by the meeting, but Finn forces her to stay as Sean tells her about his grueling experiences with his disability and how he realized that a person is not just one single thing. She then begins to understand why Finn brought her and thanks Sean as she leaves. In the meantime, Kurt (Chris Colfer) is jealous of the time his father Burt (Mike O'Malley) is spending with Finn, now that their parents are dating, and attempts to emulate Burt's personality. He dresses in outdoorsman gear, sings John Mellencamp's \\"Pink Houses\\" during a glee club rehearsal, and attempts to have a fling with Brittany, making out with her in his bedroom and ensuring that his father is aware of his new behavior. Frustrated that Burt is still spending time alone with Finn, Kurt reverts to his former personality and sings \\"Rose's Turn\\". Burt overhears his performance, praises Kurt's singing and apologizes for not spending enough time with him. He reassures Kurt that he still loves him, and always will, no matter who his son chooses to be with. Rachel eventually recovers her voice after taking the antibiotics her doctor prescribed. She goes back to Sean's house to thank him again, and offers to give him singing lessons. They start singing U2's \\"One\\", and the scene switches back and forth between her duet with Sean and the full glee club's performance of the song on stage at school. Production In \\"Laryngitis\\", Riley (left) and Salling (right) duet on Sammy Davis Jr.'s \\"The Lady Is a Tramp\\". Recurring characters who appear in \\"Laryngitis\\" are Kurt's father Burt Hummel (Mike O'Malley), glee club members Santana Lopez (Naya Rivera), Brittany (Heather Morris), Mike Chang (Harry Shum Jr.) and Matt Rutherford (Dijon Talton), school reporter Jacob Ben Israel (Josh Sussman) and AV club president Lauren Zizes (Ashley Fink). Rizwan Manji plays Dr. Gidwani. Zack Weinstein guest stars as Sean Fretthold, a football player who was paralyzed below the upper chest after injuring his spinal cord at C4 in an accident, similar to the actor's injury in real life. Sean is the second wheelchair-using character to appear on Glee. In November 2009, the episode \\"Wheels\\" attracted criticism from disability advocates, who called attention to the fact that disabled character Artie Abrams is played by able- bodied actor Kevin McHale. Weinstein defended McHale's casting, opining that if he was the best auditioning actor for the role, then his ability to walk should be irrelevant. However, Weinstein also stated he \\"would like to see wheelchair users given the chance to audition and be seriously considered for roles that aren't specifically written for someone with a disability.\\" Weinstein revealed that he wished he had auditioned for the role of Artie, and that Glee was his favorite show. Around February 2010, Weinstein's agent got him an audition to play Sean, and within a week and a half, he learned he had got the part. Glee was Weinstein's first professional acting job. He called the twelve hours he spent filming his scenes \\"twelve of the most important hours of [his] life\\". The episode features cover versions of seven songs. Rachel performs \\"The Climb\\" by Miley Cyrus, and Finn sings \\"Jessie's Girl\\" by Rick Springfield. Puck and Mercedes duet on Sammy Davis Jr.'s \\"The Lady Is a Tramp\\", and Mercedes and Santana sing \\"The Boy Is Mine\\" by Brandy and Monica. Kurt sings John Mellencamp's \\"Pink Houses\\", and \\"Rose's Turn\\" from Gypsy: A Musical Fable. The glee club closes the episode with \\"One\\" by U2, featuring guest vocals from Weinstein as Sean. \\"Jessie's Girl\\", \\"The Lady Is a Tramp\\", \\"The Boy Is Mine\\", \\"Rose's Turn\\" and \\"One\\" were released as singles, available for digital download. \\"The Lady Is a Tramp\\", \\"Rose's Turn\\" and \\"One\\" are also included on the soundtrack album Glee: The Music, Volume 3 ‚Äì Showstoppers. Reception =Ratings= In its original broadcast, \\"Laryngitis\\" was watched by 11.57 million American viewers and attained a 4.8/12 rating/share in the 18-49 demographic. In the United Kingdom, the episode was watched by 1.81 million viewers and was the most-watched show of the week on the non- terrestrial channels. In Canada, \\"Bad Reputation\\" was watched by 1.97 million viewers, making Glee the 13th most watched program of the week. In Australia, the episode was watched by 1.44 million viewers, making \\"Laryngitis\\" the 15th most-watched program of the week. =Critical response= The episode received mixed reviews from critics. Lisa Respers France of CNN felt that \\"Laryngitis\\" highlighted a trend of Glee storylines becoming progressively sadder, rather than comedic. She wrote that the plotlines came across as lecturing, and concluded: \\"I still heart Glee, which is clearly one of the best shows on television right now. I just think they may want to lighten the life lessons a bit or spread them out more over several episodes rather than clobbering us all at once.\\" Henrik Batallones of BuddyTV wrote that he was uncertain what to make of the episode, noting: \\"Sure, there were some high points, and it was a pretty enjoyable watch, but unlike the last few episodes this one left me a little high and dry.\\" Batallones observed that the Sean storyline felt \\"totally forced into the episode, making Rachel's epiphany [...] very forced and unnatural.\\" Entertainment Weekly Darren Franich was also troubled by the storyline, noting: \\"It seems like the height of vanity to basically use this storyline to teach Rachel an important lesson about being herself. [...] Glee has used disabled actors before, and I think it's worth debating whether the show honors that or uses it shamelessly.\\" Emily VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club graded the episode \\"B+\\". While she had been disappointed with several episodes since the show's mid-season break, VanDerWerff noted: \\"Glee still has its inconsistencies, but it's getting back to the show I so enjoyed last fall.\\" She wrote of the Sean storyline that it: \\"should feel offensive but mostly skates away from actually being so because it treats the paralyzed character with a great deal of respect\\". Bobby Hankinson of the Houston Chronicle also noted that he had been underwhelmed with the show since its return, but loved \\"Laryngitis\\", writing: \\"The story focused exclusively on the kids‚Äînot Mr. Shue or Sue Sylvester‚Äîand the performances were realistically small-scale. [...] All that classic Glee charm came washing over me once more and it was glorious.\\" Gerrick D. Kennedy of the Los Angeles Times similarly stated: \\"When Glee is at its best, you get episodes like this week's. There were no gimmicks, no over-the-top productions, no unnecessary stars [...] It was just great storytelling and superb finger-snapping music.\\" Vanity Fair Brett Berk deemed \\"Laryngitis\\" a \\"truly successful episode\\", but also highlighted the show's inconsistency in quality since its return. James Poniewozik of Time called \\"Laryngitis\\" the first episode of Glee since its mid-season break that he enjoyed \\"(mostly) without reservation.\\" Eric Goldman of IGN rated the episode 8.8/10, deeming it one of his favorite episodes of Glee, \\"with some of the funniest material the show has delivered thus far.\\" References External links * \\"Laryngitis\\" at Fox.com \\"Laryngitis\\" at TV.com Category:2010 American television episodes Category:Glee (season 1) episodes Category:Television episodes written by Ryan Murphy (writer) ","title":"Laryngitis (Glee)"},{"id":"27039659","title":"Robinsonekspedisjonen 2003"},{"id":"27039660","text":"Matleena Fofonoff or in (n√©e Gauriloff, born in 1949 in Rautaper√§j√§rvi, Inari, Finland) is a Skolt master craftsman and artisan, renowned for her work with traditional Skolt crafts such as root basketry, leather crafting with tanned fish skin and beadwork.

The NCP program was formerly known as the Homescan Consumer Panel before the formation of the joint venture with IRI and the merger of the two companies' existing panels. The store, price, quantity, and special deals have to be entered manually for the products scanned and the information is transmitted weekly to the company. This information then allows the company to calculate measures such as market penetration, average weight of purchase and loyalty for its manufacturing clients. In return for scanning services, participants earn \\"rewards points\\".  Program Details  The company calls the participants its \\"panelists\\" and they represent a \\"mini USA\\" in which they track what people buy from where and send it to marketing companies and manufacturing clients. Panelists are requested to scan their data after every shopping trip, including simple purchases such as a candy bar or soda from a vending machine, lottery tickets, fruits and vegetables, gasoline, and anything with a barcode. The scanner records what store the purchase was made at, the price and quantity of each product, as well as the total amount spent at that store. As of late 2019, scanning can also be done using a smartphone application. The data is expected to be transmitted weekly to NCP either directly (by connecting the scanner to a phone line) or by USB connection to computer where their software is installed. After each transmission the panelist receives \\"points\\" which can be redeemed for prizes in the NCP catalog, which contains several different types of prizes. Points per transmission increase depending on the length of time spent in the panel, bonus points are awarded if no weekly submissions are missed. In addition, NCP periodically runs sweepstakes in which one weekly transmission is considered one entry into the drawing. Besides price scanning, Nielsen collects data through online surveys matched to panelist based on shopping data, household demographics, and the needs of their current clients. There is an \\"NCP Connect\\" option in which NCP requests the panelist to install software onto their home computers to monitor how they use the internet, what they buy, and what they do with their computer. Membership in this section of the panel rewarded with the usual points and sweepstakes entries. Membership in the program is available through online registration at the NCP website.

The episode was written by series creator Ian Brennan and directed by Elodie Keene. It premiered on the Fox network on June 1, 2010 and was watched by 9 million viewers. In \\"Funk\\", New Directions is intimidated by rival glee club Vocal Adrenaline. Jesse St. James (Jonathan Groff) defects back to Vocal Adrenaline, and New Directions explores funk music, knowing it is their rival club's weakness. The episode features cover versions of six songs, all of which were released as singles, available for download, and two of which are included on the soundtrack album Glee: The Music, Volume 3 Showstoppers. The episode received mixed reviews from critics. Lisa Respers France of CNN and Blair Baldwin of Zap2it both received the episode positively. Emily VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club, Entertainment Weekly Tim Stack and James Poniewozic of Time highlighted continuity issues with the show, while VanDerWerff and Henrik Batallones of BuddyTV deemed \\"Funk\\" a set-up episode for the season finale. Bobby Hankinson of the Houston Chronicle gave a more positive review, but still found \\"Funk\\" lacking compared to previous episodes, a sentiment shared by Aly Semigran of MTV. Plot Jesse (Jonathan Groff) returns to rival glee club Vocal Adrenaline, claiming that he was not appreciated in New Directions. In a successful attempt at intimidation ahead of the Regionals competition, Vocal Adrenaline gives a performance of \\"Another One Bites the Dust\\" in the McKinley High auditorium, and toilet paper New Directions' choir room. The New Directions members become depressed, and club director Will Schuester (Matthew Morrison) tries to reinvigorate them by asking them to perform funk numbers. Quinn (Dianna Agron) performs \\"It's a Man's Man's Man's World\\" to vent her frustration of being an unwed teenage mother. Mercedes (Amber Riley) sympathizes with Quinn and invites her to move in with her. Later, Mercedes, Puck (Mark Salling) and Finn (Cory Monteith) perform \\"Good Vibrations\\" as their own \\"funk\\" number, based on Marky Mark's band name being the Funky Bunch. Will and Terri (Jessalyn Gilsig) finalize their divorce. Attempting to deal with his sorrow and cheerleading coach Sue Sylvester's (Jane Lynch) incessant bullying, Will seduces Sue with a performance of \\"Tell Me Something Good\\" and asks her out on a date, standing her up to humiliate her. Sue withdraws the cheerleading squad from the upcoming Nationals competition and becomes bed-bound. Will sees the negative impact on the cheerleaders and realizes that some of them might lose their college scholarships. Will knows that hurting his nemesis did not make him feel any better, and encourages her to be there for her girls. Sue reenters and wins Nationals, but later gives Will two options: either house her new trophy inside New Directions' choir room, or kiss her. As Will is about to kiss her, Sue backs out and decides she prefers that the trophy be set up in the choir room as a reminder of her superiority. In retaliation to Vocal Adrenaline's vandalism, Puck and Finn slash the tires of their rivals' Range Rovers. Principal Figgins (Iqbal Theba) thinks they should be expelled, but Vocal Adrenaline director Shelby Corcoran (Idina Menzel) disagrees: she decides not to press charges, but she insists they pay for the damages. She then recommends taking the money out of Glee's budget, but Will says that the club will go bankrupt. Finn then says that he and Puck will get jobs, and Shelby agrees. They begin working with Terri at Sheets-N-Things. Expressing the dissatisfaction in their lives, Puck, Finn, Terri, customer Sandy Ryerson (Stephen Tobolowsky), and employee Howard Bamboo (Kent Avenido) perform \\"Loser\\" in a dream sequence. Terri finds that Finn reminds her of Will, and befriends him, helping him with his funk assignment. Jesse further breaks Rachel's (Lea Michele) heart when he lures her to the parking lot, where he and the other Vocal Adrenaline members throw eggs at her, which leaves Rachel distraught. The male New Directions members, led by Puck, are talked out of violent retaliation by Will, and instead the group performs \\"Give Up the Funk\\" to show Vocal Adrenaline that they have not been defeated by their bullying. The performance intimidates their rivals, who unlike New Directions have never been able to master a funk number. Production Terri (Gilsig, pictured) returns to the series in \\"Funk\\", beginning a friendship with Finn. \\"Funk\\" was originally intended to air on May 25, 2010, but was switched in the schedule with the episode \\"Theatricality\\". Series creator Ryan Murphy has stated that there are three relationships which are the cornerstone of Glee: those between Finn and Rachel, Will and Emma (Jayma Mays), and Will and Sue. Murphy explained that Will's seduction of Sue in \\"Funk\\" is an attempt to get her to leave the Glee club alone, expanding: \\"I think he's just done getting pushed around by Sue, but they had great fun with that.\\" Will's wife, Terri, returns to the series in \\"Funk\\", giving her first vocal performance. Murphy planned a redemptive storyline for Terri, in which she realizes that Finn is similar to Will. He explained: \\"She met Will at 16, so she sees a way to redemption... a way to redo that relationship in a positive way [by acting] almost as Finn's guardian angel, his fairy godmother. She gives him proper moral advice.\\" Murphy enjoyed seeing Gilsig and Monteith work together, so much so that he stated their friendship will continue into the show's second season. On June 2, 2010, Megan Masters of E! Online reported that Gilsig had yet to be officially invited back for the second season, but was confident that she would be. Discussing Terri's relationship with Finn, Gilsig explained: \\"She sees in Finn so much of what she saw in Will when she first met him because he's the same age as Will was. It's her way of remembering happier times‚Äîwhen she used to be kind to Will. And she realizes, here's a chance to be supportive of this kid.\\" The episode features cover versions of six songs: \\"Another One Bites the Dust\\" by Queen, \\"Tell Me Something Good\\" by Rufus, \\"Loser\\" by Beck, \\"It's a Man's Man's Man's World\\" by James Brown, \\"Good Vibrations\\" by Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch featuring Loleatta Holloway and \\"Give Up the Funk (Tear the Roof off the Sucker)\\" by Parliament\\". All of the songs performed in the episode were released as singles, available for download. \\"Loser\\" is Gilsig's only vocal performance on the show, and is included on the deluxe edition of the soundtrack album Glee: The Music, Volume 3 Showstoppers. \\"Give Up the Funk\\" is included on both the deluxe and standard editions of the album.

It was the third most- watched show of the week in the 18-49 demographic (losing to America's Got Talent the night of the broadcast), the highest scripted show, and the eleventh most-watched program amongst all viewers. \\"Funk\\" received mixed reviews from critics. CNN's Lisa Respers France called it \\"incredible\\", and was pleased to see New Directions performing funk music, although noted that she was \\"slightly disturbed\\" by Quinn's \\"weird\\" performance of \\"It's a Man's Man's Man's World\\" utilizing pregnant teenagers as backing dancers. In December 2012, TV Guide named Quinn's cover one of Glee worst performances. Blair Baldwin of Zap2it stated: \\"While it didn't have the poignant vocals of previous episodes, it was fresh and fun...a nice change of pace for the series.\\" Bobby Hankinson of the Houston Chronicle called it a \\"pretty good\\" and \\"solid\\" episode, albeit noting that it lacked the \\"emotional punch\\" of previous episodes. Emily VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club graded the episode \\"C\\", writing that it felt like \\"a frantic attempt to raise a bunch of potential storylines for season two and an attempt to put things in place for the season finale\\". She criticized the show's lack of continuity, particularly with regard to the Jesse and Rachel storyline. Entertainment Weekly Tim Stack also observed the lack of continuity in the Jesse storyline, calling it \\"slightly confusing\\" and \\"a little half-baked\\"; continuity errors in his storyline may have been the result of the change in episode broadcast order. He felt that the episode was \\"a slight let down\\", noting: \\"There wasn‚Äôt as much tension as I would have hoped going into the finale but there were still plenty of fun moments to enjoy.\\" James Poniewozik of Time attributed part of the episode's problems to it being \\"an episode that could air easily out of order\\", explaining: \\"Glee is a very serial show, after all, but this episode largely consisted of moments that felt dropped in and random, in a way that undermined even the good moments.\\" Henrik Batallones of BuddyTV deemed \\"Funk\\" a bridge between \\"Theatricality\\" and the season finale, writing: \\"It feels like the episode got itself in a funk, and when things get close to being awesome, it pulls back.\\" Eric Goldman of IGN rated the episode 6.8/10 for \\"Passable\\", but deemed it the weakest episode of Glee thus far, while Gerrick D. Kennedy of the Los Angeles Times called it \\"just one big funked-up mess.\\" Broadway World Mary Hanrahan felt that: \\"While \\"Funk\\" had some redeeming, even charming, moments, it did nothing to make up for the perplexing episode that preceded it and ultimately left much to be desired.\\" In contrast, Aly Semigran of MTV had enjoyed the preceding episode, yet still received \\"Funk\\" poorly, calling it: \\"a step down from last week's strong 'Theatricality'.\\" As with Respers France, Semigran noted that Quinn's performance\\" felt a little uncomfortable and borderline 'offensive'.\\" In contrast, Raymund Flandez of the Wall Street Journal enjoyed Quinn's song, which he called a \\"magnificent surprise\\", praising the \\"perfect jazzy‚Äìfunk choreography\\". Flandez criticized the \\"Good Vibrations\\" performance, however, deeming it a \\"song so bad it can't be saved by irony or nostalgia\\", and felt that \\"Give Up the Funk\\" was \\"underdeveloped\\" asking: \\"Where's the soul?

The band was influenced by the new wave of British heavy metal phenomenon developing in the UK in the 1980s and started their career playing classic heavy metal, that later changed to power metal with death metal and thrash metal influences.  Biography  =Early career= Nightmare was formed in 1979 and became known when opened for Def Leppard at the Alpexpo of Grenoble in 1983, in front of an audience of more than 4000. They signed for the label Ebony Records, which published the album Waiting for the Twilight. The LP entered the charts in Japan and was distributed in Greece by Virgin Records. Nightmare replaced singer Christophe Houpert with Jean-Marie Boix to record their second album Power of the Universe. Shortly after, the band terminated its partnership with Ebony Records and the album was reissued in France by Dream Records. Their new label was soon subjected to financial difficulties, which delayed the release of an LP the band was working on. In addition, Jean-Marie Boix was forced to leave the band because of health problems. He was replaced by Scottish singer Tom Jackson (ex- Praying Mantis), hoping that his vocal qualities and his mastery of the English language could help the success of Nightmare on the other side of the Channel. This incarnation of Nightmare produced a demo with two songs and did a few shows in France and England, with moderate success. However, dissension between the musicians about the musical direction for the band, whose music was veering toward AOR, led to disbandment in 1987, closing for more than a decade the career of Nightmare. =Second career= Nightmare was reborn in 1999 with a revised line-up. Jo Amore, former drummer, took the singer position and left the sticks to his younger brother, David. The band signed a contract with Adipocere Records and released the mini-album Astral Deliverance, recorded in tribute to Jean-Marie Boix deceased a few months before. Moreover, the old albums were reissued by Brennus Records. Nightmare released also the double-live album Live Deliverance, recorded at the reunion concert held on 30 October 1999 at the Summum of Grenoble. It was the first double-live album ever made by a French metal band. In 2000, Nightmare performed at the festival of Artifacts in Strasbourg and at the prestigious Wacken Open Air Festival. At the end of the year, Nightmare formalized their collaboration with Napalm Records and in June 2001 began recording the album Cosmovision at Soundsuite Studio, changing their music to melodic power metal. The album was produced by Terje Refnes, known for his work with Theatre of Tragedy, Enslaved, Carpathian Forest and others. The famous French guitarist Patrick Rondat made a guest appearance on the first song \\"Spirit of the Sunset\\". The band then left for a short tour with Saxon in France and Italy and opened in Grenoble for Grave Digger, who played on this occasion their first concert in France. At the end of the tour, Alex Hilbert replaced at the guitar Jean Stripolli, who left the band along with keyboardist Stephane Rabilloud. The following year, Nightmare flew to the United States to participate to the Metal Meltdown Festival, which included in the roster Manowar and Saxon. Back in Europe, they opened for Blind Guardian on the dates of Lyon and Paris and were featured in several festivals, including again the Wacken Open Air. In 2003, Nightmare returned to Soundsuite Studio to record the concept album Silent Room and started the year 2004 with a European tour (France, Spain and Belgium), supporting After Forever and Dark Moor, that brought them to festivals such as the Rotunda Festival and Raismes Fest. Some time later, Nightmare ended amicably their collaboration with Napalm Records. At the end of the year, Nicolas De Dominicis, historical member of Nightmare, left the band and was replaced by guitarist Franck Milleliri. A contract was signed with Regain Records for the album The Dominion Gate, recorded again at Soundsuite Studio with Terje Refnes. A long tour followed in 2006, supporting After Forever, as in the previous one. The band visited France, Spain, the United Kingdom, Belgium, the Netherlands and Italy. The group also played a show in Tel Aviv. Nightmare were present at many summer festivals, including the Hellfest, where Alex Hilbert was unable to play and was substituted at the guitar by JC Jess. In August 2008, Alex Hilbert decided to leave the group for \\"personal reasons\\" after 6 years of service. He was permanently replaced by JC Jess. In September 2009, Nightmare released their seventh album, Insurrection, with AFM Records. This album, heavier and more direct than its predecessors, earned the group many good reviews from press and fans. On 31 October 2009 the band held a concert for their 30th anniversary at the Edmond Vigne Hall in Grenoble, where the group originated. The concert was filmed for a DVD released in 2011. The group participated to the 2010 edition of the Wacken Open Air Festival and toured in South America the same year. In July 2015, Jo and David Amore decided to quit Nightmare and \\"stop any collaboration with Yves Campion\\".

In Greek and Roman mythology, Aura (, or Œë·ΩîœÅŒ∑) is a minor deity, whose name means \\"breeze\\".For a discussion of literary sources, see Canciani, p. 52. The plural form, Aurae () is sometimes found. According to Nonnus, Aura was the daughter of the Titan Lelantos and the mother, by Dionysus, of Iacchus, a minor deity connected with the Eleusinian mysteries, while Quintus Smyrnaeus makes the Aurae daughters of Boreas, the North-wind.Quintus Smyrnaeus, The Fall of Troy 1.684. Aurae was the title of a play by the Athenian comic poet Metagenes, who was contemporary with Aristophanes, Phrynichus, and Plato.Canciani, p. 52; Smith, s.v. Metagenes; Suda s.v. Metagenes. Nonnus Nonnus' tells the story of the rape of Aura, by Dionysus, in the final book of his epic poem the Dionysiaca (early 5th century).Davidson, pp. 678-679 n. 17; Nonnus, Dionysiaca 48.238-942 (III pp. 440-491). The only other source for the story of Aura's rape by Dionysus, is Etymologicum Magnum, s.v. 'ŒîŒØŒΩŒ¥œÖŒºŒ©ŒΩ' ('Dindymon'), where the Phrygian mountain's name is connected with Aura's twin sons, see Hadjittofi, p. 127 n. 10. In this account, Aura is the nymph daughter of the Titan Lelantos.Grimal, \\"Aura\\" p. 71; Nonnus, Dionysiaca 48.238-247 (III pp. 440-443), 48.421 (III pp. 454, 455); 48.444 (III pp. 456, 457). Nonnus seems to imply that Aura's mother was the wife of Lenatos, the Oceanid nymph Periboia,Nonnus, Dionysiaca 48.245-247 (III pp. 440-443). although elsewhere, he calls Aura the \\"daughter of Cybele\\".Nonnus, Dionysiaca 1.26-28 (I pp. 4, 5). Aura was a resident of Phrygia and companion of the goddess Artemis. She was \\"Aura the Windmaid\\", as fast as the wind, \\"the mountain maiden of Rhyndacos\\", a \\"manlike\\" virgin, \\"who knew nothing of Aphrodite\\", and huntress, who \\"ran down the wild bear\\" and \\"ravening lions\\", and \\"kept aloof from the notions of unwarlike maids\\". Nonnus describes Aura as follows: :Then [Dionysus] left the halls of Pallene and Thracian Boreas, and went on to Rheia‚Äôs house, where the divine court of the prolific Cybele stood on Phrygian soil. There grew Aura the mountain maiden of Rhyndacos, and hunted over the foothills of rocky Dindymon. She was yet unacquainted with love, a comrade of the Archeress. She kept aloof from the notions of unwarlike maids, like a younger Artemis, this daughter of Lelantos; for the father of this stormfoot girl was ancient Lelantos the Titan, who wedded Periboia, a daughter of Oceanos; a manlike maid she was, who knew nothing of Aphrodite. She grew up taller than her yearsmates, a lovely rosy- armed thing, ever a friend of the hills. Often in hunting she ran down the wild bear, and sent her swift lance shooting against the lioness, but she slew no prickets and shot no hares. No, she carried her tawny quiver to shoot down hillranging tribes of ravening lions, with her shafts that were death to wild beasts. Her name was like her doings: Aura the Windmaid could run most swiftly, keeping pace with the highland winds.Nonnus, Dionysiaca 48.238-257 (III pp. 440-443). One day,Nonnus, Dionysiaca 48.936-942 (III pp. 490, 491). angry at Eros (\\"Desire\\") and \\"Sleep\\" and \\"Dream\\" for forcing upon her an unchaste dream, Aura goes hunting with Artemis. For relief from the midday heat, the hunting party stops for a swim. Aura then teases Artemis, saying that her breasts were better than Artemis's, since hers were small and round like a man's, while Artemis's were large and voluptuous like a woman's, and so belied Artemis' supposed \\"unviolated maidenhood\\". Deeply offended, the angry Artemis goes to Nemesis, the goddess of divine retribution, who arranges for Aura to be raped. Dionysus is made mad with desire for Aura, by an arrow from the bow of Eros. But knowing that he will never be able to seduce the obdurately virginal Aura, Dionysus drugs Aura with wine, ties her up, and rapes her while she is unconscious and unmoving. When Aura awakes, discovering she is no longer a virgin, but not knowing who is responsible, enraged, she proceeds to slaughter every man she finds. When she realizes she is pregnant, she tries to kill herself but is unable. Aura finally gives birth to twins boys. She gives them to a lioness to eat, but it refuses. So Aura seizes one of the boys, flings it high into the air, and after it falls back to hit the ground, she eats it. However, Artemis spirits the other child safely away. Aura then drowns herself in the river Sangarios, where Zeus turned her into a spring:Nonnus, Dionysiaca 48.258-942 (III pp. 442-491). :her breasts became the spouts of falling water, the stream was her body, the flowers her hair, her bow the horn of the horned River in bull-shape, the bowstring changed into a rush and the whistling arrows into vocal reeds, the quiver passed through to the muddy bed of the river and, changed to a hollow channel, poured its sounding waters. According to Nonnus, Aura's surviving child by Dionysus, is Iacchus,Bernab√© and Garc√≠a-Gasco, p. 109; Nonnus, Dionysiaca 1.26-28 (I pp. 4, 5), 48.848-968 (III pp. 484-493). a minor deity connected with the Eleusinian mysteries, although other accounts have Iacchus, when not identified with Dionysus himself, the son of Demeter or Persephone. Ovid The Augustan poet Ovid, in the Ars Amatoria and again in the Metamorphoses, introduces Aura into the tragic story of Cephalus and Procris, perhaps playing on the verbal similarity of Aura and Aurora, the Roman goddess of the dawn, who was Cephalus' lover.Ovid, Ars Amatoria 3.687-746 (pp. 166-171) and Metamorphoses 7.690-862 (pp. 390-403); Green, p. 254, cf. Servius, Ad Virgil, Aeneid 6.445. For the story of Cephalus and Procris, see Davidson, pp. 256-258\\\\. For Ovid's treatment of the story see Green, Chapter 14, \\"The Innocence of Procris: Ovid AA 3.687-746\\" pp. 250-263. In the Metamorphoses, Ovid has Cephalus tell how it was his habit, that after finishing a hunt, he would seek out the cooling breeze: :\\"I wooed the breeze, blowing gently on me in my heat; the breeze I waited for. She was my labour‚Äôs rest. ‚ÄòCome, Aura,‚Äô I remember I used to cry, ‚Äòcome soothe me; come into my breast, most welcome one, and, as indeed you do, relieve the heat with which I burn.‚Äô Perhaps I would add, for so my fates drew me on, more endearments, and say: ‚ÄòThou art my greatest joy; thou dost refresh and comfort me; thou makest me to love the woods and solitary places. It is ever my joy to feel thy breath upon my face.'Ovid, Metamorphoses 7.811-820 (pp. 398, 399). But one day, as Cephalus tells: \\"Some one overhearing these words was deceived by their double meaning; and, thinking that the word ‚ÄòAura‚Äô so often on my lips was a nymph‚Äôs name, was convinced that I was in love with some nymph.\\"Ovid, Metamorphoses 7.821-823 (pp. 398-401). When Cephalus' words were reported to his wife Procris, she was stricken with grief and fear, over, according to Cephalus, a \\"mere nothing\\" and \\"an empty name\\".Ovid, Metamorphoses 7.830 (pp. 400, 401). The next day after a successful morning's hunt, Cephalus cried out again: \\"Come, Aura, come and soothe my toil\\" but when he said this Cephalus thought he heard a groan and called out: \\"Come, dearest\\".Ovid, Metamorphoses 7.835-838 (pp. 400, 401. Then hearing the rustle of leaves, he threw his javelin, at what he thought was some animal, but was instead Procris, who had come to spy on her husband.Ovid, Metamorphoses 7.839-850 (pp. 400, 401). With her dying breath Procris says: \\"By the union of our love, by the gods above and my own gods, by all that I have done for you, and by the love that still I bear you in my dying hour, the cause of my own death, I beg you, do not let this Aura take my place.\\"Ovid, Metamorphoses 7.851-855 (pp. 402, 403). And Cephalus says: \\"And then I knew at last that it was a mistake in the name\\".Ovid, Metamorphoses 7.856-857 (pp. 402, 403). Iconography A pair of velificantes ‚Äì possibly Aurae ‚Äì on the Ara Pacis (late 1st century BC). Between them is Tellus Mater. Extant images of Aura from antiquity are rare.For a detailed discussion of the Aura/Aurae iconography, see Canciani, pp. 52-54. There are only two which can be identified as Aura by inscription.de Grummond, p. 669. The oldest is a fifth- century BC skyphos from Taranto, now in the Nicholson Museum, University of Sydney (53.30), which shows a figure labeled \\"Aura\\", seated on a rock by the sea, with velificatio, a billowing garment that forms an arch overhead.Trendall, pp. 55, 64 fig. 66; Spaeth, p. 77 n. 103; Canciani, pp. 52, 53, LIMC 32269 Aurai 1. The other is found on a volute-krater funerary vase (c. 370-350 BC), now in the British Museum (F277). Depicted on its neck is a polos-crowned head with curls, and the inscription \\"Aura\\" above the polos crown.Trendall, pp. 92-93; Davidson, p. 679 n. 17; Canciani, p. 52, LIMC 6862 Aurai 2; British Museum, 1885,0314.1, image with description; Metropolitan Museum of Art, \\"Funerary Vases in Southern Italy and Sicily\\". Pliny describes two statues of Aurae with , \\"spreading their cloaks like sails\\", at the Porticus Octaviae in Rome.Pliny, Natural History 36.29 (pp. 22, 23); Spaeth, p. 77; Canciani, p. 52, LIMC Aurai 3. Influenced by Pliny's description, a pair of velificantes (figures framed by a velificatio) that appear on the Ara Pacis Augustae (\\"Altar of Augustan Peace\\") have often been identified as Aurae, although this identification has been criticized, and many other identications have been proposed.Spaeth, pp. 67, (with nn. 11-15), 77; de Grummond, p. 669. For identifications as Aurae see for example Zanker, pp. 174‚Äì175; Simon, p. 27. According to de Grummond, this identification [as Aurae] \\"rests on a thin foundation\\", pointing out that the mere presence of a velificatio is not definitive as many other figures are shown with them. Spaeth, p. 78, asserts that the identification as Aurae \\"may therefore be rejected\\". Other identifications for the pair, mentioned by Spaeth, p. 67, are \\"an Aura and a Nereid; nymphs; a nymph and a Nereid; a Muse and a sea divinity; the celestial and marine aspects of Venus; and the Horae.\\" de Grummond identifies the pair as Horae, while Spaeth, p. 78, identifies the pair as \\"a Nereid, or a sea nymph, and a Naiad, or freshwater nymph\\". Aurae can resemble Nereids, from whom they are distinguishable mainly by the absence of marine imagery.Spaeth, pp. 77‚Äì78. The female figures with wind-blown drapery, which adorned the Nereid Monument at Xanthos, though usually identified as Nereids, have sometimes been identified as Aurae.Robinson, p. 355; Canciani, p. 54. Aura is sometimes identified as the female figure carried by Zephyr in Sandro Botticelli's painting The Birth of Venus.

Critics described his minimalist installation, Bloom (1995‚Äì6), as a subversively seductive yet repulsive meditation on violence; it consisted of Plexiglas cases on spare metal tables containing luminous blocks of ballistic gelatin replicating human flesh, into which hollow-point bullets were fired. The transitional Note on Levitating the U.S. Pentagon or How to Operate a Car Jack (1996) foreshadowed his growing conceptual and political focus; it featured 195 hydraulic jacks arranged in a pentagonal formation, referencing low-rider culture, the minimalism of Robert Morris, and 1960s Happenings and protests.

He completed his studies in architectural and building techniques at the ITIS Bernini in Rome, Italy and began his professional career exploring several related fields: architectural and interior design as well as structural calculations. Early career When he moved to the United States he applied this experience working with manufacturers designing office and school furniture at the Herbert L. Farkas Company in New Jersey and at the same time exploring an artistic career with luminous sculptures, using to full advantage the characteristics of materials like Plexiglas. Development years In 1969 Rossi, in New York, met Seymour Evans one of New York's few lighting designers at that time. Evans after reviewing Rossi's professional qualifications, offered him a leading position in his lighting design firm. At this point, Rossi also began to study and to attend lighting design courses to enhance his qualifications in this new field. Having heard about Rossi's creativity and design capabilities in 1970 Howard Brandston one of the most prominent architectural lighting designers in the United States asked him to join his architectural lighting design firm in New York. At this time that Rossi while directing, among others, the lighting design project for the S√£o Paulo Hilton in Brazil met and worked closely with Brazilian artist and landscape architect Roberto Burle Marx. In 1972 Brandston and Rossi decided to open a partnership branch of architectural lighting design in Milan, Italy. In 1975 Rossi was formally accepted as a Corporate Member of the IALD International Association Of Lighting Designers (IALD). During these years Mr. Rossi also taught lighting design at Fairfield University in Fairfield, Connecticut. Lighting design firm thumb After moving definitely to Italy, in 1981 Rossi established his own professional firm in Rome, and since then it has produced close to 250 architectural lighting design projects in Italy and abroad. Rossi, was the first (and still is the only) IALD Italian member and American-trained architectural lighting designer in Italy.

Malartic mine plan of the malartic mine The Canadian Malartic mine is located in Malartic, Quebec, a community about 550 km northwest of Montreal in the administrative region of Abitibi-T√©miscamingue. The gold deposit, which extends a couple kilometers along the Cadillac fault and includes porphyry gold has a resource of up to 348 tonnes. Only areas considered to have more than 3g/ton of gold will be mined. Expansion projects near Malartic were considered after favourable drilling results in Southern Barnat. 204 of the 205 homeowners in the area representing about 1/7 of the town's population, were bought out but the 1 remaining tried to use his interest in the area to keep the company from going ahead despite support for it from the mayor who estimates that it will create 880 direct and indirect jobs. In August 2010 a superior court judge awarded the property to Osisko Mining Corporation after determining it was an obstacle for important preparation work at the project. Production at the mine was scheduled to begin in June 2011. The Malartic mine reached commercial production in May/June 2011 after processing averaged per day in the four weeks ended June 17, 2011. In March 2008, Osisko created Le Fonds Essor Malartic Osisko, a 3 million dollar fund to be used in support of Malartic economic development projects, public facilities and infrastructure. Also, a project follow-up committee was established to oversee the operation and bring up any concerns the community might have such as those regarding the environment. Its members were chosen with the intent that the committee be completely independent of the Company to avoid conflicts of interest. Gold mining in Malartic produced about between 1935 and 1983. The last major mining in the area was done by Barrick Gold in 2002. =Production= In 2012 gold production totaled , up from the year before. During the three months from June 30 to September 30, 2011, the company produced of gold up from the previous quarter, and of silver (up from 16,432 the quarter prior). Gold was produced at a cash cost of US$939/oz (quarter). In terms of sales, of gold and of silver were sold during the quarter. Operating costs account for 79% of total costs. For the first time since 2008, the company had positive earnings ($9.3m) In January 2017 Osisko reported it earned record gold equivalent ounces totaling 38,270 from its royalties and streams, along with record revenue from gold sales of CA$62.7 million, in 2016. As of December 31, 2016 the company had cash and cash equivalents totaling $499.2 million. Corporate history The company was incorporated on February 18, 1982, as Ormico Exploration Lt√©e but changed names to Osisko Exploration Lt√©e with its headquarters in Montreal. Its name derived from Osisko Lake, located within Quebec's portion of the Abitibi gold belt in the region of Rouyn-Noranda is where, in 1920, Noranda founder Edmond Henry Horne made his first major mineral discovery, a deposit that became known as the Horne Mine. Its shares were publicly listed on the Montreal Stock Exchange and then the TSX Venture Exchange. It did business as a mineral exploration company with a focus on Quebec properties. It acquired rights to the properties, conducted exploration work and assessed mineral development potential. In November 2004 they acquired the Canadian Malartic property, a former mine that Lac Minerals had operated. Barrick Gold, who had acquired Lac Minerals, sold the property to McWatters Mining and Osisko acquired it from creditors after McWatters Mining went bankrupt. As favourable exploration, feasibility and economic assessment results came in, re-development of the Malartic mine became the focus of the company. The Canadian Malartic mine was expected to be the biggest gold mine ever in Quebec and one of the biggest gold mines in Canada. In 2009, the Company's management received the Northern Miner's Mining Persons of the Year award and in December 2009, the Company and Robert Wares, Osisko's COO, together donated 4.1 million dollars' worth of shares in the company to the Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences at McGill University. On July 3, 2009 Osisko purchased 49.1% of Bowmore Exploration Ltd. a month before Goldcorp acquired a 3.2% interest in Osisko (at the time Goldcorp owned 12.9% of company shares); On February 9, 2011 Goldcorp sold its 10.1% equity interest in Osisko for $530 million. Later that year in December, in a joint venture with Clifton Star Resources Osisko acquired Quebec's Duparquet mining project, an area that produced of gold between 1931 and 1957, when it was operated by Beattie Gold Mine. So far the Company has infused $66.83 million into the venture. On June 17, 2011, it withdrew from Duparquet. In March 2010 Osisko filed a takeover offer for Brett Resources that proved to be success on May 19, 2010 (initially 77% of the company was purchased, on August 13 it purchased the other 23%). The deal, valued at more than $372 million, enabled Osisko to acquire the Hammond Reef Gold Project in Atikokan near Thunder Bay, Ontario and its of gold. If all regulatory approvals are met, the mine was expected to open in 2015 when it would be capable of producing of gold annually. By March 2011 It owns at least of gold reserves (including 10.71 in malartic and 6.7 at Hammond Reef, malartic reserves up 20% due to higher gold prices) and over of land in the Malartic-Cadillac area. In December 2012 Osisko Mining completed the $550 million takeover of Ontario mining company Queenston Resources. Just three months earlier Queenston announced a 112% increase in gold resource. Queenston's main property is the Upper Beaver project located near Kirkland Lake, Ontario. The Upper Beaver mine will have a mine life of ten years and is projected to start operating in 2016. In April 2014, it was revealed in the media that Yamana Gold and Agnico Eagle Mines Limited could acquire Osisko's flagship Canadian Malartic mine for around $3.5 billion. Exploration projects Among the exploration projects that Osisko were involved in from 2009 to 2014 included the Dunn, Mount Joy, and Goldboro properties. The Dunn property is located NE of Rouyn-Noranda, Quebec; it involves of land in Clericy and La Pause and ownership is shared with Midland Exploration, a tsx venture exchange listed exploration company focused on mining opportunities in Quebec. The stake in the Mount Joy property in Timmins, Ontario is minor however, it has the option of becoming majority owner (up to 70%) by incurring project expenditures of 4-5 million dollars total in installments made on specific dates, by delivering a bankable feasibility study, and by securing additional financing. The project, which covers of land, is controlled by Claim Post Resources, a company that in which Osisko owns stock. Over the last century, of gold have been mined in Timmins, Ontario. The Goldboro property is located in Goldboro, Nova Scotia in the region of Guysborough County. Because of an agreement made in November 2009 with Orex Exploration, which currently controls the project, Osisko can obtain a 50% stake by incurring project expenditures. Gold production in the area goes back to the time period of 1893-1912, when over of gold was recovered. On March 21, 2011 Osisko finalized an agreement with Sparton Resources to acquire 60-70% of a gold property in area, in Atikokan, Ontario. The property is next to Osisko's Hammond Reef project which the company is trying to expand. The deal requires Osisko to spend $1 million on exploration in 2011. Currently there are no gold mining operations in Atikokan but the Hammond Reef project could begin production as early as 2015. On November 22, 2011 Osisko signed an option agreement with Midland Exploration giving Osisko the ability to acquire a 50% interest in Ontario's Casault gold property. The property is just 40 km east of Detour Gold's Detour Lake gold project (one of Canada's largest deposits). See also * Corporation min√®re Osiskorouyn-noranda copper mines.

It was built from the remains of two of Cody's earlier aircraft, and won the 1912 British Military Aeroplane Competition, with two aircraft being purchased for the Royal Flying Corps. It was abandoned after the mid air disintegration of one of the aircraft in April 1913. Development and design In December 1911 the British War Office announced a competition for a Military aeroplane capable of carrying a pilot and observer for the recently established Royal Flying Corps. First prize was ¬£4,000, with the War Office having the option to purchase any of the prize winning machines.Bruce 1982, p.1.Flight 23 December 1911, p. 1109. The American showman and aviation pioneer Samuel Cody, who had developed a system of man-carrying kites from 1901, built his first aircraft, the British Army Aeroplane No 1 at the Army Balloon Factory at Farnborough in 1908, making its first flight, recognised as the first powered controlled flight in the United Kingdom on 16 October 1908.Jarrett 1999, pp. 8‚Äì9. He intended to enter two aircraft into the Military Trials, which were planned to start on 1 August 1912, a monoplane powered by a 120-hp (89 kW) Austro-Daimler engine which had been salvaged from an Etrich Taube which had crashed during the 1911 Daily Mail Circuit of Britain Air Race, and a biplane powered by a 60-hp Green engine, with which Cody had finished fourth in the 1911 Circuit of Britain.Jarrett 1999, pp. 13, 15. However, the aircraft was wrecked hitting a tree when landing on 3 July, and on 8 July Cody crashed the monoplane, badly damaging it and killing a cow. Still keen to enter the competition, Cody used the remains of the two damaged aircraft to build a new biplane, later to be known as the Cody V, using the powerful Austro-Daimler engine.Bruce 1982, pp. 198‚Äì199. This was a pusher canard biplane, with seats for the pilot and three other people in an open cockpit. Lateral control was by wing warping and two vertical tails were carried on bamboo booms behind the engine.Jarrett 1999, p.15.Bruce 1982, p. 199.Flight 7 September 1912, p. 808. Operational history Cody V in flight Cody took the new aircraft for its maiden flight on 23 July 1912, flying it to Salisbury on 27 July to take place in the trials. While Cody's biplane was, even in 1912, outdated, it was declared the winner: Cody was awarded the ¬£4,000 first prize and a further ¬£1,000 for the best British built aircraft. (Although the vastly superior BE.2 took part in the trials, as a product of the Royal Aircraft Factory, it was ineligible for the prizes.Bruce 1982, p. 345.) The War Office purchased the prototype Cody V, together with a second aircraft to be built to the same design. In October, Cody re-engined the biplane with a British-built 100-hp (75 kW) Green engine in order to enter the British Empire Michelin Cup competitions, winning the ¬£600 prize for the fastest time over a 186-mile (299 km) circuit.Jarrett 1999, p.16. Science Museum, Londonthumbleft After re-fitting with the Austro- Daimler engine it was delivered to the Royal Flying Corps on 30 November 1912, being issued to No. 4 Squadron in December that year. The second Cody V flew in January 1913, and was delivered in February. On 28 April 1913, the first prototype broke up in mid-air and the aircraft crashed, killing the pilot. The resulting investigation discovered that the aircraft's structure, which incorporated many parts from the 1911 Circuit of Britain aircraft, had deteriorated badly and was in \\"precarious\\" condition by the time of the crash. The second aircraft, which was awaiting repair of damage that had been received in an accident in March, was never flown again, and in November that year it was given to the Science Museum, London, where it is displayed today.Bruce 1982, p.200.

While the extent to which smoking is viewed as a negative health behavior may vary across different nations, it remains an issue regardless of how it is perceived by different societies. The United States has taken numerous measures, ranging from changes in national policy surrounding youth cigarette access to changes in media campaigns, in attempts to eliminate the use of tobacco products among teenagers. Approximately 90% of smokers begin smoking prior to the age of 18. In efforts to reduce the total number of smokers and negative effects smoking has on society, it is necessary to reduce the number of youth and adolescents who begin smoking. History =Statistics= While the rates of cigarette smoking among adults and adolescentsJohnston, L. D., O‚ÄôMalley, P. M., Bachman, J. G., Schulenberg, J. E., & Miech, R. A. (2016). Monitoring the Future national survey results on drug use, 1975-2015: Volume II, college students and adults ages 19-55. have declined in the past ten years in the United States, a considerable number of adolescents continue to smoke cigarettes. The Surgeon General's Warning released in 1964 was a major impetus for this change. In 1965, approximately 45% of Americans smoked, however the prevalence of tobacco smokers is currently less than 25% of adults. The pattern of smoking among youth has had a slightly different trajectory, such that smoking rates for high school students began to increase in the early 1990s and did not begin to decrease until the end of the decade. If the current smoking trends continue, 5.6 million youths alive today will die prematurely.General, S. (2014). The health consequences of smoking‚Äî50 years of progress: a report of the surgeon general. In US Department of Health and Human Services. According to economist Kenneth Warner, Ph.D., the tobacco industry needs 5,000 new young smokers every day to maintain the total number of smokers. In 2016, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimated that upwards of 4 million middle school and high school students in the United States currently used tobacco products. National epidemiological surveys often deliver key findings on the proportion of youth that are consuming tobacco. The National Youth Tobacco Surveys (NYTS) was designed to provide data on middle school and high school students tobacco behaviors, as well as attitudes, beliefs, and exposure to pro- and anti- tobacco influences. Results from the 2011-2016 NYTS revealed that approximately 20.2% of high school students (grades 9-12) reported current tobacco use, which was defined as having used any tobacco product in the past 30 days.Jamal, A. (2017). Tobacco Use Among Middle and High School Students‚ÄîUnited States, 2011‚Äì2016. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, 66. In further support of these findings, the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) is a prominent epidemiological survey that assesses national and state-level information on alcohol, tobacco, illicit drug use, as well as mental health, in the United States. The NSDUH defines current cigarette smoking as smoking all or part of a cigarette over the past 30 days. The 2012 NSDUH survey revealed that 6.6% of youth between the ages of 12 and 17 were current cigarette smokers. Females and males had similar prevalence estimates, 6.3% and 6.8% respectively. The demographic breakdown was such that Caucasian youth exhibited the greatest prevalence of smoking (8.2%), followed by Hispanic or Latino youth (4.8%) and African-American youth (4.1%). Breakdown by age revealed the age range between 16 and 17 had highest prevalence (13.6%), followed by the 14 to 15 age range (4.6%), and the 12 to 13 age range (1.2%). In terms of socioeconomic status, there was a greater prevalence of youth currently smoking below the poverty level (7.6%) than at or above the poverty level (6.2%). An examination of regional differences across the United States demonstrated the highest prevalence of smoking among adolescents in the Midwest (7.8%) and South (7.2%) regions, followed by the Northeast (5.7%) and West (5.1%) regions. Results from these epidemiological studies underscore the continued prevalence of cigarette smoking among adolescents.

Atlanta, GA: US Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, Office on Smoking and Health, 3. =Tobacco Laws and Regulation= Youth access to cigarettes is determined in large part by national and statewide laws and regulations. The first major step government agencies placed on restricting cigarette smoking came from the first Surgeon General's Report in 1964 which established cigarette smoking causing increased mortality. The year following the release of this report, the Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act was passed requiring a health warning on all cigarette packages. The next major act passed in 1970 was the Public Health Cigarette Smoking Act that banned radio and television cigarettes advertisements. Nearly 15 years later in 1984, the Comprehensive Smoking Education Act was passed requiring the health labels on cigarette packages to rotate between four different health warning labels. Then in 1986, the Comprehensive Smokeless Tobacco Health Education Act was passed further reinforcing the rules in place by the prior acts. The acts passed between 1965 and 1985 primarily aimed to make the public more aware of the health hazards associated with cigarette smoking. Beginning in the late 1980s, acts passed by Congress were oriented around limiting cigarette use and access in public settings. In 1988 an amendment was made to the Federal Aviation Act making domestic flights of less than two hours smoke-free, which was later supported by the Wendell H. Ford Aviation Investment and Reform Act in 2000 prohibiting smoking on all domestic flights and flights to international locations. The next major smoking-related amendment was the Synar Amendment in 1992. This amendment to the Alcohol, Drug Abuse, and Mental Health Administration Reorganization Act requires states to ban selling tobacco products to minors, reduce availability of these products to minors, and allows for the random inspection of tobacco outlets. Four years later, a series of regulations were passed restricting distribution of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco to protect children and adolescents by giving ultimate jurisdiction to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). However, in 2000 the Supreme Court ruled that Congress, as opposed to the FDA, was ruled to have authority in to regulate tobacco. A major act passed more recently in 2009 was the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act. This act exerts many stipulations on cigarette distribution, but specifically for youth it prohibits the sale of flavored cigarettes which may be particularly salient to youth. This act also limits tobacco product advertising to youth and prohibits free samples of cigarettes. An additional act passed was the Prevent All Cigarette Trafficking (PACT) Act of 2010 that has also helped limit youth access to tobacco via the internet. This act uses strict identification tactics, both at the time of purchase and upon delivery of tobacco products, to deter underage youths from purchasing cigarettes. Numerous additional measures at the state and community level to prevent adolescent cigarette use include increasing tobacco excise taxes,Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids. (2011). Raising cigarette taxes reduces smoking, especially among kids.

Stages in Youth Smoking  Youth who begin smoking pass through various stages, each influenced by a variety of factors, before becoming a daily smoker. The stages can progress in any direction and stop or restart any number of times. _Stage 1_ : Pre- contemplation/preparation ‚Äì Youth in this stage have never smoked and most likely have minimal desires to begin smoking. Adolescents in this stage are likely impervious to the effects of social pressures for smoking or do not view smoking in a positive light. _Stage 2_ : Contemplation/Preparation ‚Äì An adolescent's beliefs about smoking are beginning to change as they begin to contemplate smoking. Youth will often develop attitudes or envision what smoking will be like before engaging initiating. Notably, these attitudes towards smoking may often be negative, but are not as salient nor impactful to the adolescent because of either positive media messages or role models (i.e. parents who are smokers). Adolescents in this stage begin to consider the function of smoking, with popular reasons including smoking to be cool or independent, reduce social anxiety, and regulate emotions. _Stage 3_ : Initiation ‚Äì This stage consists of an adolescent trying an initial cigarette(s). Typically, there are stronger peer or familial influences motivating this initial behavior. Adolescents may also desire to improve their self-image if they are receiving minimal approval from their desired peers further increasing the chances of initiation. _Stage 4_ : Experimentation ‚Äì During this stage, there is a steady increase in the frequency of cigarette use, as well as the various situations in which cigarettes are used. There is an imbalance between positive and negative values placed on cigarettes, such that an adolescent adopts increasingly positive views on cigarette smoking. An adolescent smoker in this stage is not guaranteed to be a regular smoker and still has the option of quitting. Among smokers in this category who are likely to become regular smokers, the negative aspects of smoking such as the burning sensation or heat are reduced, and more positive benefits are emphasized. While there can be acute initial positive effects from smoking (i.e. increased heart rate and nervous system stimulation), smoking during this and the subsequent stage may be associated with some of the more severe physiological consequences of smoking. Additionally, youth in this stage may begin to associate themselves with a personal identity of being a smoker as they are learning how to smoke (i.e. how to handle a cigarette, inhale correctly, etc.). _Stage 5_ : Regular Smoking ‚Äì Smoking throughout this stage becomes less infrequent and more regular. Regular smoking in youth can vary from smoking at social gatherings or smoking on a majority of weekdays. Adolescents in this category are not characterized as smoking daily or in high rates. _Stage 6_ : Established/Daily Smoking ‚Äì Not all adolescent smokers from the previous stage move to this stage, although a large proportion do progress to daily smoking. Adolescent smokers in this stage may begin to experience symptoms associated with nicotine dependence such as strong cravings or withdrawal symptoms. At this point, a combination of physiological and biological factors maintains the smoking behavior as part of the adolescent's self-regulation. Previous research has examined the differential effects various influences can have at different stages of smoking. Connectedness to one's family, and being a member of a Hispanic or Asian ethnic group, were found to be protective against smoking across never smokers, experimenters, and regular smokers. Risk factors across all three smoking status‚Äô included maternal smoking or greater depressive symptoms. Maternal smoking may be a greater risk factor among daughters than sons. An additional major risk factor is alcohol use, which has been demonstrated as being more influential during the earlier stages of smoking. Research shows that smoking and alcohol use often co-occur in adolescents. Causes = Demographic Factors = Research has shown that there are certain personal factors that are correlated with higher usage of cigarettes and other tobacco products. Age has been identified as a risk factor, such that older adolescents are more likely to have higher rates of regular cigarette and other tobacco product use than younger adolescents. However, older adolescents have a reduced risk of initiation smoking with reasoning stemming around an older adolescent being less susceptible than a younger adolescent in engaging in the initial smoking process. In terms of gender, males smoke more cigarettes per day, use cigarettes with higher nicotine content, and inhale smoke more deeply.National Institute on Drug Abuse. (2009). Research report series: Tobacco addiction. Washington, DC: National Institutes of Health, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Retrieved February 12, 2016, from http://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/research-reports/tobacco/letter- director. Males have also demonstrated increased satisfaction from their cigarette, as well as shorter latency between the time they wake up in the morning and when they have their first cigarette, which are signs of greater nicotine dependence. Females continue to experience environmental pressure to smoke. In an examination of gender differences in adolescent smoking, Branstetter and colleagues (2012) found that females were more often surrounded by family members and romantic partners that smoked cigarettes. Ethnicity and educational status have also been associated with differential rates of cigarette smoking. Results from the 2014 NSDUH revealed that Caucasian adolescents are more likely to smoke cigarettes than African- American adolescents. These results are consistent with previous results of African-American adolescents having consistently lower rates of smoking initiation and progression to daily smoking. Hispanic youth have also been shown to have an increased risk of smoking onset as well. For educational status, youth who did not endorse pursuing higher education, such as attending college, were more likely than their peers to be smokers. Furthermore, adolescents whose parents with minimal college education were more likely to become smokers. = Psychosocial Factors = Certain interpersonal social factors have been associated with cigarette smoking. Adolescents who are involved in antisocial behaviors, such as fighting, stealing, and using other drugs are more likely to smoke than those who do not engage in antisocial behaviors. Parents exert a highly robust effect on a child's smoking behavior. An examination of parental influences found that youth whose parents smoked cigarettes had a greater likelihood of smoking cigarettes, and this effect increased with the number of smoking parents in the home. The timespan in which a child is exposed to parental smoking has also been associated with increased risk of smoking. A negative association does appear to exist between parental smoking and an adolescent's first cigarette such that parents who smoked had a stronger negative response to a child's first cigarette. Notably, the effect of parental smoking can differ by a few important factors. There was a greater effect of father smoking on boys than girls, the effects of the father smoking depended on if the father lived at home with the adolescent, and there was a greater effect of parental smoking on youth under the age of 13. Extending beyond parents, siblings may also exert an effect on adolescent smoking. An examination over 400 families with at least two adolescents between the ages of 13 and 17 found that adolescents with an older sibling who smoked were more likely begin smoking themselves approximately one year later. However, younger adolescents smoking behavior did not affect older adolescents smoking behavior. If either older or younger sibling had a best friend that smoked, they were more likely to smoke approximately one year later. An additional realm of risk factors falls underneath that of stress. Specifically, youth who experience numerous highly stressful events throughout childhood are at increased risk of beginning to smoke by the age of 14. Particularly important stressors that contribute to this early onset of cigarette smoking include experiencing parental separation, being witness or victim to abuse, or residing in a household with a family member that is incarcerated or has a mental disorder. An adolescent's home environment may also influence the perceptions they have about cigarette use. Since tobacco use among youth reached a peak in the 1990s, perceptions that cigarettes are harmful has increased, which has been a critical contributor the declining rates over the past twenty years. However, many adolescent smokers view themselves as having minimal to no risk from smoking cigarettes throughout the first few years that they are smoking. While many adolescent smokers acknowledge that there are risks to cigarette smoking, they do not seem to understand the imminent risk and thus continue to smoke. The perceived risks associated with smoking that youth often adopt have been associated with various indicators of nicotine dependence. In a study examining the association between perceived tobacco dependence and smoking susceptibility among adolescent who were minimal smokers, perceived mental dependence on tobacco, and not perceived physical dependence, was associated with smoking susceptibility. Thus, adolescents perceived psychological dependence appears to be an important risk factor for vulnerability to smoking. Adolescents place less weight on the physical dependence to nicotine that can develop and perpetuate their smoking behavior. = Biological Factors = While many of these environmental risk factors may exert a strong effect, there are also a series of biological risk factors that may increase the likelihood of an adolescent becoming a cigarette smoker. An examination of adolescents ranging in age from 12 to 19 found that heritability estimates for initiation of smoking ranged from 36% to 56% across varying samples, with similar heritability estimates for regular smoking ranging from 27% to 52%. Genomewide association studies and sequencing are still in progress to examine which relevant genetic variants exert robust contributions to cigarette smoking behavior. These genetic risk factors do not operate in isolation from environmental risk factors, rather they often function synergistically to influence smoking behavior. For example, school environment (i.e. school smoking norms, prevalence of student smoking, etc.) has been shown to moderate the genetic risk factor for smoking in adolescents.  Consequences  Numerous health consequences for cigarette smoking have been thoroughly documented. The top negative health causes that have been causally linked to cigarette smoking include cancers of the upper digestive tract, lung cancer, and chronic diseases including diabetes, coronary heart diseases, pneumonia, and overall poorer immune function. While many of these cancers and diseases can develop when an individual is of an older age, changes in one's physical well being contributing to these diseases may begin during adolescence. In a study examining nearly 10,000 males and females ranging in age from ten to eighteen across the United States, adolescents who smoked cigarettes exhibited impaired pulmonary function. Adolescent smokers exhibited delayed growth in lung function, as well as mild airway obstruction. While heart disease and stroke are consequences more commonly seen in adulthood, early signs of these effects can often be found in adolescent smokers.CDC, Preventing Tobacco Use Among Young People‚ÄîA Report of the Surgeon General, 1994 In addition, resting heart rate of young adult smokers is estimated to beat two to three minutes faster than non-young adult smokers. Youth smokers are also less likely to visit a doctor regularly, and suffer from greater shortness of breath and build up phlegm, than non-youth smokers. In addition to physical negative health consequences, adolescent smoking has also been linked to negative psychological consequences. Heavy cigarette smoking throughout adolescence was associated with increased risk of generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, and agoraphobia in early adulthood. They are also less likely to visit a mental health care provider for emotional or psychological concerns that may arise. In addition to psychological consequences, adolescent cigarette use has also been linked with subsequent drug use. The Gateway Hypothesis proposes that drug use develops in stages, with early drug use consisting of drugs such as alcohol and tobacco and later dug use consisting of more illicit drug use. Nicotine itself use itself has been shown to be an early ‚Äògateway‚Äô drug that increases risk for subsequent cocaine use. Alternative tobacco products = E-cigarettes = One popular trend among adolescent cigarette smokers is the recent rise of e-cigarettes. This phenomena is also known as vaping but has many other names as well. In 2020, approximately, 1.3 million of kids in America smoke. For the first time in 2014, e-cigarette use was higher among adolescents than smoking traditional cigarettes. The most common reasons for using e-cigarettes was to experiment, followed by others reporting e-cigarettes taste good and e-cigarettes to aid in quitting smoking conventional cigarettes. Less students associate e-cigarette with serious risk in comparison to smoking conventional cigarettes. In a nationwide examination as part of the National Youth Tobacco Survey 2011 and 2012 cohort, e-cigarette use was associated with a greater likelihood of having a history or currently being an active cigarette smoker. For individuals that were current smokers, e-cigarette use was associated with higher odds of planning to quit smoking. Among cigarette experimenters, defined in this particular study as having less than one puff of a cigarette, e-cigarette use was associated with lower odds of remaining abstinent from conventional cigarettes. A study of nearly 2,000 high school students found that students who used both e-cigarettes and regular cigarettes had a significantly greater amount of risk factors associated with smoking. In comparison to students who did not smoke, students who used e-cigarettes only or used both e-cigarettes and regular cigarettes more often viewed e-cigarettes as healthier than regular cigarettes. Additionally, there is little disapproval for the use of e-cigarettes among adolescents. The role of e-cigarettes as being primarily a risk or protective factor for traditional cigarette smoking is debatable, however adolescents are very susceptible to the lure that accompanies e-cigarettes. E-cigarettes companies design flavors that make their products seem less harmful than they appear to be. They also associate these products with everyday food items. In 2019, Juul, another e-cigarette company, stopped selling their best-selling flavor pods amid the Trump administration decision on the sale of flavored e-cigarettes. Ultimately, e-cigarettes may play the role of a ‚Äògateway drug‚Äô to smoking traditional cigarettes. A new trend among youth is using e-cigarettes to vaporize liquid marijuana which can increase the potency of strain of THC increasing the potential consequences to adolescent brain development. = Cigars = Following e-cigarettes, the next most commonly used tobacco product among youth are cigars. In 2016 it was estimated that 7.7% of high school students smoked cigars. From 2000 to 2012 there was a surge in adolescent cigar use, with total consumption of cigars nearly doubling among youth. National estimates of current cigar use revealed that while traditional cigarette use is on the decline, cigar use remains as high as 13% among high school students. Co-use between cigarettes and cigars is very common. One study found that of youth who experimented with cigarettes and cigars, approximately 40% of adolescents smoked cigarettes and cigars regularly. Furthermore, cigar use was higher among individuals who smoked multiple tobacco products in comparison to adolescents who only smoked cigars. In terms of individual differences, African-American youth are more likely to use cigars than Caucasian youth. Cigar uses are also more likely to be male and use other tobacco and alcohol products. While many adolescents may suspect cigars to be less harmful than cigarettes, cigars may be more harmful than cigarettes because they contain more tar, a higher level of toxins since cigar wrappers less permeable than cigarette wrappers, and contain a higher level of cancer-causing substances. Cigar use is associated with a range of negative health consequences including oral, lung, and esophageal cancer. = Smokeless Tobacco Products = Snus is a smokeless tobacco product that was first distributed in Sweden decades ago. There is evidence that shows Swedish snus has successfully emerged as healthier alternative to cigarettes. In Sweden, use of snus is proposed to have lowered the rates of smoking as more individuals are using snus as opposed to traditional cigarettes. This product is only recently coming to market in the United States as the cigarette company Camel launched their Camel Snus product in 2009. Snus use among adolescent groups has worried many leading public health officials. Snus may aid youth in cessation of smoking or in harm reduction, but it can also be used in conjunction with cigarettes and thus increase risk for disease. While snus is often advertised as having less harm than cigarettes, the most significant health effects snus can have include maintaining dependence to cigarettes and using snus as an initial tobacco product before trying other tobacco products.McMillen, R., Maduka, J., & Winickoff, J. (2012). Use of emerging tobacco products in the United States. Journal of Environmental and Public Health, 2012. Attractive qualities of snus products to adolescents include that they come in flavors, is a form of spitless tobacco, and they are often advertised as being able to use in public places where traditional cigarette smoking is not allowed. An additional smokeless tobacco product are orbs. They are one of the newest tobacco products currently being tested on the market is Camel's Orbs. Orbs are dissolvable tobacco pills that come in a variety of flavors such as cinnamon or citrus that resemble breath mints. Similar to snus, they are criticized for their allure to children, imitating candy. With this new product, youth populations have been targeted in a new fashion. Taken together, smokeless tobacco has increased in use from 2008 to 2010 and rates have remained steady from 2010 to 2015. However, older adolescents have decreased their use of smokeless tobacco products between 2008 and 2011. Thus, while smokeless tobacco is used less commonly than e-cigarettes, traditional cigarettes, or cigars, the lack of decline in smokeless tobacco rates is a public health concern. Advertisements =Media= Numerous concerns have been raised regarding how smoking is portrayed by tobacco companies. Smoking is often portrayed in the media as ‚Äòcool‚Äô and is associated with images of relaxation, success, and freedom. One study examining adolescents‚Äô perceptions of smoking in the media found that students are more likely to identify with the stress-relieving and pleasurable effects of cigarette smoking, even when they are aware of the negative consequences of smoking. An additional study found that adolescents who were exposed to movies with a large amount of smoking were nearly three times as likely to experiment with or become regular smokers. For smoking initiation, this effect was most prominent for individuals who were at the lowest risk for becoming a smoker (i.e. adolescents low in sensation seeking). The Master Settlement Agreement (MSA) aimed to limit the promotional activities of tobacco companies, however since its passing there has been minimal change in advertising. Tobacco brand appearance in R-rated movies decreased by 55.4%, however, PG-13 movies only decreased from 15% to 11.8%. It has been suggested that to decrease exposure, parents should not allow their children to wear anything or place anything in their rooms like posters of celebrities smoking or other things that promote tobacco companies. =Tobacco Company Advertisements= Children are more sensitive to tobacco advertisements than adults.Bonnie, R. J., & Lynch, B. S. (Eds.). (1994). Growing up tobacco free: preventing nicotine addiction in children and youths. National Academies Press. The three most heavily advertised cigarette brands are Marlboro, Newport, and Camel. A recent report concluded that most youth smokers prefer one of these three brands. Tobacco companies have a history of advertisement campaigns that have been highly scrutinized by the public. In 1999, Philip Morris ran a series of full-page advertisements in news magazines, which were aimed at parents and conveyed the \\"forbidden fruit\\" message. They featured a bowl of fruit or a glass of milk with cookies and then had the questions \\"What else are you leaving for your kids?\\" and \\"What else is within your kids‚Äô reach?\\". In 2000, Philip Morris took a different approach and distributed book covers with the phrase \\"Think. Don't Smoke.\\" These book covers were distributed to schools in California and had not been authorized previously. These covers, which were meant to make students aware of the potential dangers of smoking while at the same time enticing them to defy parental authority, failed as a result of the intervention of the California Department of Education and Justice. The California Department of Education and Justice sent out a memorandum warning schools about Philip Morris' intent and demanding that Philip Morris recall all of its book covers. There is some controversy about what is the most effective element of advertisements designed to promote youth tobacco prevention and cessation. One study found that advertisements of normative messages showing that smoking will bring about social disapproval are the best to decrease young adults‚Äô intentions of smoking in the future. Other studies have found that advertisements, which are high in sensation valued, based on their \\"ability to elicit sensory, affective, and arousal responses\\", are best for getting messages across to youths who are highly susceptible to drug use. Still, other research suggests that personal testimonies, including those of people who have dealt with addiction themselves or have had family members die from tobacco related illnesses are the most effective in deterring youths from initiating tobacco use. Researchers have attributed these discrepancies in what is the most effective method to differences in methods, as well as extraneous variables that are not being controlled for in each experiment, including the emotionality of the advertisement, the quality of production, and how the advertisement was sponsored.  Prevention  While laws passed at the national and state level have reduced the opportunities adolescents have for accessing cigarettes, prevention programs at the school level have proven less effective. A review of school based curriculum for adolescent smoking revealed these curricula as being highly ineffective in reducing cigarette smoking initiation. Although, when these curricula are combined with some other anti-smoking method, specifically media or smoke-free policies, then these curricula demonstrate slight efficacy. A systematic review of the National Cancer Institute's (NCI) Research-Tested Intervention Programs revealed that targeting specific high- risk demographic groups, and utilizing mental-health professional and community members, is one way to improve the overall efficacy of these prevention programs. While there are many components that contribute to developing an effective anti-smoking campaign, an effective strategy may be to take advantage of components of various other anti-smoking campaigns. One of the major anti-smoking campaigns in existence is the Truth campaign. The age demographic this campaign targets are adolescents between the ages of twelve and seventeen.Allen, J. A., Vallone, D., Vargyas, E., & Healton, C. G. (2009). The truth campaign: Using counter marketing to reduce youth smoking. The new world of health promotion, New program development, implementation and evaluation, 195-215. The primary method through which the Truth campaign works is to attract adolescents via eye-catching television advertisements. The Truth campaign makes use of the mass-media communication strategy known as counter-marketing which previous research has shown to be an effective method of reducing smoking prevalence among youth. A primary selling point of the Truth campaign is how it is now synonymous to that of a brand. Adolescents can view brands as a form of self-expression and thus feel a sense of connection to the Truth campaign.

It exists as pale yellow crystals, which are soluble in organic solvents but decompose when in solution. It has been examined as a catalyst and reagent. Synthesis (Mesitylene)molybdenum tricarbonyl arises from the reaction of molybdenum hexacarbonyl with hot mesitylene: :Mo(CO) + (CH)CH ‚Üí Mo(CO)[(CH)CH] + 3 CO It can also be synthesized, with good yields by displacement of pyridine ligands of the trispyridine complex Mo(CO)(pyridine) in the presence of Lewis acids. This reaction proceeds at lower temperatures of the compound than the direct method :PyMo(CO) + (CH)CH + 3BF¬∑O(CH) ‚Üí [(CH)CH]Mo(CO) + 3PyBF Structure and properties The mesitylene group is bonded to the molybdenum centre through delocalized œÄ - electron ring. The aromaticity of the ligand is indicated by its ability to undergo Friedel- Crafts reactions, e.g. with acetyl chloride. Such reactions are slower on the tricarbonyl(mesitylene)molybdenum than benzene, which suggests that the electron density contributes to the bonding to the molybdenum. The tricarbonyl(mesitylene)molybdenum complex adopts a near C symmetry with the three carbonyl groups occupying an eclipsed arrangement relative to the three methyl groups. The mesityl group is Œ∑ to the molybdenum central metal atom, which lies 0.009 √Ö away from the ring centre and the methyl groups on the benzene are bent out of plane by 0.035 √Ö due to steric interaction with the carbonyl groups. Reactions The arene can be displaced by the trimethylphosphite via a S2 type mechanism to give the fac- tricarbonyltris(trimethyl phosphite)molybdenum. :(CHO)P + [(CH)CH]Mo(CO) ‚Üí fac-[(CHO)P)]Mo(CO) + (CH)CH The tricarbonyl(mesitylene)molybdenum complex can be used an electron donor.

Early life Osman was born in the Boulaq district of Cairo in 1931. Ahmad Shukry, his fourth grade art instructor, discovered Osman's talent and was one of his first supporters until he moved to the secondary school where he met his first mentor Yusuf Raafat. He later enter the College of Fine Arts in Cairo where he studied sculpture. Soon after graduation, Osman worked as an art instructor in the district of Al-Mansoura. Politics During the 1960s and 1970s, Osman was a political cartoonist. He sought exile in Kuwait from the regime of Anwar Sadat. He returned to Cairo soon after Sadat's assassination in 1981. Work While working at the private school of Mansoura, Osman drew caricatures. These caricatures were promptly rejected when Osman offered them first to Dar El- Hilal due to their political content. However, Rose al-Y≈´suf published his works in the belief that, in the words of the magazine's editor-in-chief, \\"if they were refused by Dar El-Hilal, then they must be very good.\\" In 1957, the newspaper Al Messa hired him full-time for two years. Subsequently, Osman returned to Rose al-Y≈´suf to join a team that then contributed in the success of their weekly publication Sabah El-Kheir. In the early 1980s Bahgat returned from exile to Egypt to work with the opposition newspaper, Al Ahali. In addition to the publication of daily and weekly caricatures, Osman contributed in publishing over 20 children's books and comics and illustrated UNICEF's Convention on the Rights of the Child, as well as book covers and entire politically opinionated books such as \\"Bagatos - President of Great Bahgatia\\", \\"Hokouma wa Ahali\\" (Government and People), and \\"Diwan Bahagigo\\" in an attempt to criticize the Egyptian status quo. =Publications where he worked= * Rose al-Y≈´suf * Sabah el Kheir * Al Ahali * Al Messa * Al Mesawer * Al Kawakib * Hawaa * Al Hilal * Sameer (children's comic) * Majed (children's comic) * Ala'ddin (children's comic) * Al Arabi Al Sagheer (children's comic) =Published books= * Diktatorya lil Mubtadeen (Dictatorship for beginners) * Bahgatos Ra'ees Bahgatia Alozma (Bahgatos President of Bahgatia The Greatest) * Hokuma wa Ahali (Government and People) * Dehkaat Majnoona Jiddan (Very Crazy Laughs) * Sadaka Bela Hudood (Friendship without Boundaries) * Kunto Hemaran (I was a Donkey) Political opinion and withdrawal After the Camp David Accords of 1978, Osman stopped drawing adult comics and instead started drawing for children's books and comics. He dedicated much of his work to women. He and his wife Badr Hamada traveled around the Arab world to draw attention to children's rights and education, as well as contributing to children's artistic education in Yemen. Osman died at home at the age of 69, on June 3, 2001, a few months after his wife.

He previously served as the MP for Liverpool Walton from 2010 to 2017. Rotheram was born in Liverpool and left school to become a bricklayer, setting up his own company at the age of 22. He started a Masters in Contemporary Urban Renaissance at Liverpool Hope University. He worked as a Business Manager for the Learning and Skills Council and represented Fazakerley as a councillor on Liverpool City Council. Rotheram was the Member of Parliament for Liverpool Walton from 2010 to 2017. As an MP, he campaigned for the release of all government papers relating to the Hillsborough disaster. He also served as the Lord Mayor of Liverpool from 2008 to 2009 and a Councillor for Fazakerley from 2002 to 2011. Rotheram was the Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn's Parliamentary Private Secretary. Rotheram won a majority vote in the Liverpool City Region mayoral election 2017. Early life Rotheram was born in Liverpool in 1961, the son of Harry Rotheram, a Kirkby factory forklift driver and Labour councillor, and Dorothy, n√©e Phillips. He was one of eight children. His parents‚Äô marriage broke up when Rotheram was in his teens, with Rotheram citing his father's absences due to politics as part of the cause. His secondary education was at Ruffwood School in Kirkby. Career Rotheram left school at 16 to become a bricklayer, setting up his own company at the age of 22. He spent eight months rebuilding war-torn infrastructure in the Falkland Islands in 1983, an experience that Rotheram did not enjoy. On his return, disillusioned by what he saw as exploitation of employees on UK building sites, he was determined not to work for anyone else again, and set up his own company Rotheram Builders. Alongside his work in the construction industry, he studied part- time in order to gain admittance to Liverpool John Moores University where he studied full-time before starting a Masters in Contemporary Urban Renaissance at Liverpool Hope University. He worked as a Business Manager for the Learning and Skills Council for many years after graduating, and was elected to represent Fazakerley as a Labour Councillor on Liverpool City Council in the 2002 election. He later served as Lord Mayor of Liverpool from 2008 to 2009, which coincided with Liverpool's period as European Capital of Culture. Member of Parliament After incumbent Labour MP Peter Kilfoyle announced that he would be standing down as MP for Liverpool Walton in 2010, Rotheram was overwhelmingly selected to be the Labour candidate securing 101 out of 113 votes cast. At the 2010 general election, Rotheram retained the seat with a comfortable majority of 19,818. Shortly after becoming an MP, he was elected to serve on the Communities and Local Government Committee where he was influential in challenging Eric Pickles and Grant Shapps on a number of key cuts that they were making. In October 2011, Rotheram joined the Culture, Media and Sport Committee where he asked James Murdoch if he would close The Sun newspaper following the News International phone hacking scandal in 2011.

In September of the same year, he was named at Number 73 in 'The 100 Most Influential People on the Left' by LBC. Hillsborough disaster In a speech whilst Lord Mayor of Liverpool on the twentieth anniversary of the Hillsborough disaster, he said, \\"I'm one of the fortunate ones, as I swapped my Leppings Lane ticket for a stand seat 15 minutes before kick-off...if I can go from being a brickie in Kirkby to the Lord Mayor, who knows what these ninety-six people may have achieved in their lives\\". In October 2011, he gave an emotional speech to the House of Commons where he read out the names of all ninety-six victims in the Hillsborough disaster so they would be recorded in Hansard, and called for the release of all government papers relating to the disaster.

In September 2012, along with members of The Farm, Mick Jones, and former Liverpool manager Kenny Dalglish, Rotheram arranged for a number of artists to record a cover of \\"He Ain't Heavy, He's My Brother\\" as \\"The Justice Collective\\", in an attempt to reach the coveted Christmas number one. The cover included contributions from artists such as Paul McCartney, Robbie Williams, Holly Johnson and Melanie C, as well as featuring Rotheram himself. On 23 December 2012, it was confirmed that the cover had become Christmas number one, which Rotheram called \\"an honour\\".

He was a recipient of the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross of Nazi Germany. Biography Born in 1892, Apell joined the army of Imperial Germany as an Fahnen-junker (officer cadet) in 1910. He was commissioned in the light infantry and fought in World War I. In the interwar period, he served in the Reichsheer and then the Wehrmacht. He led the 11th Cavalry Rifle Regiment of the 4th Light Division from 1938 to 1940, fighting in the Invasion of Poland. The 4th Light Division converted to armour in early 1940 and then, designated the 9th Panzer Division, it served in the campaign in the Netherlands and the Battle of France. It was also involved in the Invasion of Yugoslavia and Battle of Greece the following year. By now, Apell, still with the division, was commander of the 9th Sch√ºtzen (Rifle) Brigade. During his period in command of the 9th Sch√ºtzen Brigade, he was awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross. In September 1941 and now a generalmajor, Apell was appointed commander of the newly raised 22nd Panzer Division. Formed in France, much of the division's equipment was captured and foreign equipment with relatively few modern tanks. With its training completed, the division was transferred to the Eastern Front in February 1942. Apell led the division through the Battle of the Kerch Peninsula until July 1942, when he became ill and was replaced. Not returned to his command upon recovering his health, Apell was placed in the F√ºhrerreserve (Leader's Reserve) until March 1943. He was made the Replacement Army Inspector in Vienna and, having received a promotion to generalleutnant, served in this role for the remainder of the war. He died in the village of Varnhalt, near Baden-Baden, on 7 March 1969.

It is one of only 20 other restaurants in the world to have maintained the award for such a length of time. Reality show star Curtis Stone once served as the head chef. Architecture The building is a replica of an earlier structure originally located in San Francisco. Murphy House was constructed as a large home in 1884 by the builder architects Samuel and Joseph Cather Newsom. These 19th-century Victorian architects also built the Carson Mansion at virtually the same time in Eureka. However, the Murphy home was completely destroyed by the fire resulting from the 1906 San Francisco earthquake. Mark Carter found the blueprints for the home in an antique store and rebuilt the structure but in Eureka. The building was originally intended to be a private residence but, due to construction cost overruns, it was opened as a bed and breakfast to recoup the losses.

Notable students Among those educated at the Academy, include Dr. Henry Howard, who established Howard County, and William Edward Magruder, great-grandson of Colonel Zadok Magruder. In 1869, the Brookeville Academy relocated to Merrywood, located on nearby farmland outside of town. Present day In 1868, the Brookeville Academy moved north to Merryville. After the move, the building had many uses. In the 1870s, the building served as Odd Fellows Hall. In the mid 1900s, it served as the American Legion Hall and also housed functions of Saint John's Church. The town of Brookeville purchased the house from the St. John's Church for its historical significance and began to renovate it for wider public use.

Despite the arms embargo, a number of violations were still reported with arms and materiel being sold to former Rwandan government forces. An inquiry had concluded its investigation, but it was noted that some countries had not fully co-operated with the investigation. The committee had concluded that Rwandan elements had received military training for the purposes of conducting destabilising raids into Rwanda, and there was strong evidence that arms deliveries had taken place. In one instance, there was a sale of weapons from the Seychelles in June 1994 and two subsequent shipments to Goma in the Democratic Republic of the Congo destined for Rwandan government forces. Aircraft were still continuing to land at Goma and Bukavu with arms for former Rwandan government forces and senior figures in those forces were raising funds for an armed struggle against Rwanda. These and continuing allegations had not been thoroughly investigated. Finally, radio broadcasts which spread hate and fear in the region needed to be terminated. The ban on arms supplies to Rwandan government forces had not been effectively implemented. The countries in the Great Lakes region were asked to ensure that their territory was not used as a base for incursions or providing weapons into Rwanda. The Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali was asked to consult with the neighboring countries of Rwanda and Zaire in particular, on measures which could include the stationing of United Nations observers at airports and at border crossings. Countries whose citizens were accused of involvement were prompted to conduct further investigations and make all information available to the committee. Finally, the Secretary-General was requested by 1 October 1996 to report on the implementation of the current resolution.

Sometimes multiple individuals with the title of God are present, or the term may even be applied to all administrative and development staff, but it is usual for the term to refer to the most senior administrator. A similar term, mostly used in DikuMUDs, is implementer, or \\"imp\\". Where the term is used in this sense, the God or Gods will most often be supervising staffers referred to as wizards or immortals. The appearance of entities referred to as \\"gods\\" in a MUD does not necessarily mean that this usage of the word is being applied; the word's ordinary usage is also frequently in evidence, referring to non-player character gods or even non- administrative player character gods. History Historically the term God was not the original usage for either the player end game or sysadmin status in MUDs with Rob Roy Trubshaw and Richard Bartles seminal 1978 and 1985 MUD1 & 2 using Wizard (MUD). many contemporary games of the era such as Shades (1985), Mirrorworld (1986) also using Wizard or Arch Wizard. The first apparent use was in the 1988 Lap of the Gods authored by Ben Laurie although its original non commercial version was released in 1985. Avalon: The Legend Lives in 1989 evolved this concept even further pioneering the introduction of player Gods associated with stylised spheres (Stars, War, Fire etc.) with fully developed structural religious systems including player priests, followers and methods of prayer and offering. The gods are appointed not by amassing treasure or points but via either competitive ordination, often player vs player ordination or through dominance or merit within the game- world. Importantly as noted by Richard Bartle Avalon was the first to pioneer this concept of player gods in that they remained within the fiction of the world rather than as sysadmins. To date Avalon has competitively Ordained ten gods and appointed a variety of others, the first in 1989 and the last in 2015. Power dynamics Discussion of MUD Gods frequently touches on the absolute power individuals assuming this title typically have over the virtual environment. A common conflict in MUDs occurs between an administrator who uses this power in an arbitrary and capricious fashion and others who believe standards of fairness should be upheld. MUD-related works often warn prospective players against annoying a God, citing the lack of behavioral constraint on this sort of figure.

TVM uses high-resolution land surface data to calculate the effects of microscale terrain features, near- surface roughness features, and other terrain blocking effects typically left unresolved by coarser mesoscale NWP models. Microscale terrain features are resolved using a kinematic terrain adjustment, near-surface roughness features are resolved using a log-profile surface roughness adjustment, and a Froude number adjustment is applied to calculate terrain-blocking effects on wind flow. All of these effects are computed at each time-step in the study period and based not only on wind speed and elevation, but on quantities such as wind direction and thermodynamic properties of the lower atmosphere.

Early life Turcott went to the University of Saskatchewan and graduated in 1956. Political career Turcott ran for a seat to the Alberta legislature in a by-election held on October 6, 1966 in the electoral district of Pincher Creek-Crowsnest. The by-election was hotly contested by all four candidates. Turcott ended up winning by just over 100 voters over Social Credit candidate J.H. Hanrahan. This was the first election won by a candidate running under the Alberta NDP banner, although members of the NDP's predecessor, the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation sat in the legislature continuously from 1942 to 1959. During the by-election and continuing after he took his seat Turcott along with NDP Leader Neil Reimer leveled accusations of corruption against the Social Credit government, specifically that Edgar Hinman and Alfred Hooke used their offices for personal gain.

The Atlantic Shore Line (ASL) was an electric trolley line providing passenger and freight service to many towns in York County, Maine, in the United States. The ASL was the second-longest trolley line in Maine, encompassing over of track. Beginnings A charter for the Atlantic Shore Line Electric Railroad was first issued in March 1893 by the Maine legislature. The charter allowed for the building of an electric railroad from Biddeford, through the towns of Kennebunkport and Wells, to York Beach. In October 1899, articles of association were filed for the Atlantic Shore Line Railway by a group which included officers of the Mousam River Railroad and the Sanford & Cape Porpoise Railway. The charter of the railroad was approved on February 9, 1900, following a hearing at the State House in Augusta.  Route  From the Town House Square carbarn in Kennebunkport (the site currently across the street from the Kennebunkport Historical Society), ASL trolley service connected Cape Porpoise, Kennebunkport, Biddeford, Kennebunk, Alfred, Sanford, Springvale, Wells, Ogunquit, York, York Beach, Kittery, Eliot and South Berwick. The line also connected with Dover, New Hampshire, through South Berwick and with Portsmouth, New Hampshire, via ferry service from Kittery (the ASL ferry \\"Kittery\\" was built in Kennebunkport in 1900). Electricity was provided from a power plant at Kittery Point, which was originally built by the Sanford Power Company. Operations Electric freight service continued until June 1949, when a small diesel locomotive replaced the electric locomotives. In 1939 the Seashore Electric Railway was formed with the intent to preserve electric cars for future operation. of the ASL right- of-way between Town House Square and Biddeford off Log Cabin Road in Kennebunkport have been preserved by the Seashore Trolley Museum. The museum has developed its demonstration railway upon of the old right of way. The museum has also completed the restoration of electric locomotive ASL #100, the only remaining original piece of rolling stock from the Atlantic Shore Line Railway system.

The Security Council expressed its alarm at the assassination attempt and was convinced that those responsible be brought to justice. The OAU considered the attack to be an attack on all of Africa, and not just on the President of Egypt or the sovereignty of Ethiopia. It was noted that Sudan had failed to comply with OAU requests, which constituted a threat to international peace and security. Acting under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter, the Council demanded that Sudan immediately extraditable the three suspects to Ethiopia and desist from supporting terrorist activities or sheltering terrorists in its territory. The following provisions would come into effect at 00:01 EST on 10 May 1996 unless Sudan complied with the resolution. All countries were to: :(a) reduce staff at their diplomatic missions in Sudan and impose travel restrictions on members of the Sudanese government or military; :(b) refrain from holding international conferences in Sudan; :(c) report to the Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali within 60 days on measures they had taken to give effect to the resolution. Only 40 states complied with this provision. The Secretary-General was requested within 60 days to report on the implementation of this resolution and the Council would then determine whether Sudan had complied with the requirements. China and Russia abstained from the vote on Resolution 1054, which was approved by the other 13 members of the Council.

The tradition dates back to the time when most buildings had earthen floors and rushes were used as a form of renewable floor covering for cleanliness and insulation. The festival was widespread in Britain from the Middle Ages and well established by the time of Shakespeare, but had fallen into decline by the beginning of the 19th century, as church floors were flagged with stone. The custom was revived later in the 19th century and is kept alive today as an annual event in a number of towns and villages in the north of England.  History  In 601 AD Pope Gregory I wrote a letter to Mellitus (a member of the Gregorian mission sent to England to convert the Anglo-Saxons from their native paganism to Christianity) which read: > When, therefore, Almighty God shall bring you to the most reverend man our > brother bishop, St Augustine, tell him what I have, upon mature deliberation > on the affair of the English, thought of; namely, that the temples of the > idols in that nation ought not to be destroyed. Let holy water be made, and > sprinkled in the said temples; let altars be erected, and let relics be > deposited in them. For since those temples are built, it is requisite that > they be converted from the worship of the devils to the service of the true > God; that the nation, not seeing those temples destroyed, may remove error > from their hearts, and knowing and adoring the true God, may the more > familiarly resort to the same places to which they have been accustomed. And > because they are wont to sacrifice many oxen in honour of the devils, let > them celebrate a religious and solemn festival, not slaughtering the beasts > for devils, but to be consumed by themselves, to the praise of God... Every church at its consecration was given the name of a patron saint and either the day of its consecration or the saint's feast day became the church's festival. Church services began at sunset on Saturday and the night of prayer was called a vigil, eve or, due to the late hour, wake - from the Old English waecan. Each village had a wake with quasi-religious celebrations followed by church services then sports, games, dancing and drinking. During the Middle Ages the floors of most churches and dwellings consisted of compacted earth, and rushes (commonly \\"sweet flag\\" Acorus calamus) or other herbs and grasses were strewn over them to provide a sweet smelling, renewable covering for insulation. The Household roll of Edward II (1307‚Äì1327) shows a payment to a John de Carlford for \\"a supply of rushes for strewing the Kings chamber\\". In the Churchwardens' accounts for St Mary-at-Hill, London, payments of 3d for rushes are shown for 1493 and 1504, and in the parish register of the church at Kirkham, Lancashire, disbursements for rushes are found in 1604 and 1631 for 9s 6d, but not after 1634 when the church floor was flagged. At Saddleworth (then in Yorkshire) the church floor was covered with rushes until 1826. The churches allocated a particular day in the calendar for the rushbearing and, by the 16th century, it was customary to ring the church bells and provide wine, ale and cakes for the rushbearers. Some festivals were more elaborate with mimetic and representational elements. An account from Cawthorne in Yorkshire from 1596 said that the people \\"did arm and disguyse themselves some of them putting on womens aparrell, other some of them putting on longe haire & visardes, and others arminge them with the furnyture of souldiers, and being there thus armed and disguysed did that day goe from the Churche, and so went up and downe the towne showinge themselves\\". The festival often attracted unsavoury characters, such as pedlars, cutpurses and pickpockets, and became a pretext for heavy drinking in otherwise quiet communities, such that even pillars of the community would occasionally disgrace themselves: > Tristram Tyldedesly, the minister at Rufford and Marsden on Sundays and > hollidaies hath danced emongst light and youthful companie both men and > women at weddings, drynkings and rishbearings; and in his dancing and after > wantonlye and dissolutely he kissed a mayd...whereat divers persons were > offended and so sore grieved that there was weapons drawn and great > dissenssion arose. Puritan magistrates and ministers opposed Sunday rushbearing, probably because of the intemperance and indecorum which attended the occasion. Consequently, when James I issued the Declaration of Sports in 1617, which listed the forms of recreation permitted on Sundays and Holy days, rushbearing was listed, along with other pursuits, such as archery, Whitsun Ales, Morris dancing and the setting up of Maypoles. Indeed, when James I visited Sir Richard Hoghton in Lancashire in 1617, the first entertainment offered was a rushbearing. In the 18th century the ceremony usually formed part of the annual feast or wake, held on the Sunday closest to the feast day of the saint to which the church was dedicated. The rushes were brought to the church in a procession, accompanied by music and Morris dancing. In some areas the rushes were carried in individual bundles and in others on a rushcart. Where a rushcart was used it became the main focus and was decorated with garlands and flowers, tinsel, and 'all the silver plate that can be borrowed in the neighbourhood'. When the procession reached the parish church the rushes were strewn on the floor and the garlands used to adorn the church. It is not known how long rushcarts have been a feature of the festivities, but an account by the Hon. H. Egerton from 1726 implies that the one he saw in use in Prestwich was of long standing. By the early 19th century the tradition had died out in many parts of the country but it evolved and survived in industrial parts of Lancashire. The History of the county of Derby (1829) gives descriptions of the rushbearings at Chapel- en-le-Frith: Uppermill rushbearing 1880 > It usually takes place at the latter end of August, on public notice from > the churchwardens, of the rushes being mown and properly dried, in some > marshy part of the parish, where the young people assemble: the carts are > loaded with rushes and with flowers and ribands; and are attended to the > church by the populous, many huzzaing and cracking whips by the side of the > rush-cart, on their way thither, where everyone lends a hand in carrying in > and spreading the rushes. At Whitwell, instead of rushes, the hay of a piece > of grass-land called the church close, is annually, on Midsummer eve, carted > and spread in the church. and Glossop: > Previously to our leaving Glossop we visited the village church...Here we > observed the remains of some garlands hung up near to the entrance into the > chancel. They were mementos of a custom of a rather singular nature, that > lingers about this part of Derbyshire, after having been lost in nearly > every other. It is denominated rush-bearing; and the ceremonies of this > truly rural f√™te take place annually, on one of the days appropriated to the > wake or village festival. A car or wagon is on this occasion decorated with > rushes. A pyramid of rushes, ornamented with wreaths of flowers, and > surmounted with a garland, occupies the centre of the car, which is usually > bestrewed with the choicest flowers that the meadows of Glossop Dale can > produce, and liberally furnished with flags and streamers. Thus prepared, it > is drawn through the different parts of the village, preceded by groups of > dancers and a band of music. All the ribands in the place may be said to be > in requisition on this festive day, and he who is the greatest favourite > amongst the lasses is generally the gayest personage in the cavalcade. After > parading the village, the car stops at the church gates, where it is > dismantled of its honours. The rushes and flowers are then taken into the > church and strewed amongst the pews and along the floors, and the garlands > are hung up near the entrance into the chancel, in remembrance of the day. > The ceremony being ended, the various parties who made up the procession > retire, amidst music and dancing, to the village inn, where they spend the > remainder of the day in joyous festivity. At this time there were some attempts to revive the custom, as it appealed to the Romanticism of the period. In Cumbria, the ceremony was revived in Warcop and Musgrave at the wish of the Rev. Septimus Collinson, Provost of Queen's College, Oxford and a native of the village, after being extinct for about thirty years, but an attempt to revive it at Great Langdale proved unsuccessful. At Grasmere the rushbearing took a different form. In Clarke's Survey of the Lakes (1770) the bearers were said to be women and girls but by 1887, when the romantic poet William Wordsworth became involved, the rushbearings were described as \\"tall poles decked with rushes and flowers\\" carried by boys and girls up to the age of fifteen. Rural Ceremony Closing the sacred Book which long has fed Our meditations, give we to a day Of annual joy one tributary lay; This day, when, forth by rustic music led, The village Children, while the sky is red With evening lights, advance in long array Through the still churchyard, each with garland gay, That, carried sceptre- like, o'ertops the head Of the proud Bearer. To the wide church-door, Charged with these offerings which their fathers bore For decoration in the Papal time, The innocent procession softly moves:-- The spirit of Laud is pleased in heaven's pure clime, And Hooker's voice the spectacle approves! ‚Äì William Wordsworth In many places there was much competition between towns and villages to provide the best decked rushcarts and in the early 19th century it was said that the Lancashire town of Rochdale could assemble at least eight, and sometimes a dozen rushcarts from the surrounding villages for the festival. ...The green rush, the green rush, we bear it along, To the church of our village with triumph and song, We strew the cold chancel and kneel on it there, While its fresh odours rise with our voices in prayer. Hark the peal from the old tower in praise of it rings, Let us seek the green rush by the green woodland springs. \\\\- Letitia Elizabeth Landon (1802-1838)  Rushbearing today  Rushbearing ceremonies have survived, or been revived, in a number of towns and villages in northwest England including: Lymm and Forest Chapel in Cheshire, Gorton, Littleborough, and Saddleworth in Greater Manchester, Newchurch in Pendle in Lancashire, Sowerby Bridge in Yorkshire, and Ambleside, Great Musgrave, Grasmere, Urswick and Warcop in Cumbria.

Its mission is to improve the health and well-being of patients by performing innovative research in blood and blood-related processes. The CBR is home to more than 40 research groups that employ a broad range of basic science, biotechnological, engineering and clinical investigative methods to address blood and blood-related science and health-related questions. CBR research groups are led by chemists, biologists, biochemists, pathologists, immunologists, geneticists, engineers, psychologists, sociologists, dentists, pediatricians, hematologists, oncologists, virologists and microbiologists, who are based in the Faculties of Medicine, Applied Science and Engineering, Arts, Sociology, Dentistry, Pharmaceutical Science and Science. History Dr. Ross MacGillivray, founding Director of the CBR The reason for creating a multidisciplinary research institute with a focus on blood emanated from a Royal Commission of Inquiry on the Blood System in Canada in the 1980s when HIV and hepatitis entered the Canadian blood supply. Among many recommendations, Judge Krever called for a renewed emphasis on research excellence in the broad area of blood and blood transfusion. In 2002, a group of professors from the University of British Columbia (UBC) led by the founding director of the CBR, Dr. Ross MacGillivray, gathered a team of scientists, engineers, social scientists and clinicians with expertise in a range of disciplines who could in combination address blood-related issues and health problems more effectively than they could individually. Financial support for CBR research infrastructure and training and education programs was provided by the Universities of British Columbia, Victoria and Northern British Columbia, the Canadian Blood Services (CBS), the Michael Smith Foundation for Health Research, the Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada, the Province of British Columbia, the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR), the Canada Foundation for Innovation (CFI), and several industrial partners.

The battle resulted in capture of L'Insurgente, after an intense firefight in which both sides exchanged heavy broadsides and musket fire. French privateering attacks against American vessels, begun a year prior, caused the conflict between the United States and France. An American squadron under Commodore Thomas Truxtun had been sent to patrol the Caribbean waters between Puerto Rico and Saint Kitts with orders to engage any French forces they found in the area. While Truxtun was sailing independently of his squadron in Constellation, his flagship, he met and engaged L'Insurgente. After chasing the French ship through a storm, Constellation forced L'Insurgente into an engagement that lasted an hour and fourteen minutes before the French frigate surrendered. The French sustained heavy casualties in the action, while the numbers of American dead and wounded were low. After the action, L'Insurgente was taken to Saint Kitts and commissioned into the United States Navy as . With this and later victories, American morale soared, and Truxtun returned home to honor and praise from the American government and the public at large. Background In 1798, an undeclared war between the United States and France began due to French privateering attacks against American vessels. These attacks were sanctioned due to the failure of the United States to repay its considerable debts to France, incurred during the American War of Independence. In response to the attacks, the United States government decided to go on the offensive by sending four naval squadrons to the Caribbean with orders to seize armed French vessels and prevent privateers from attacking American ships.Palmer 1987, p. 81. One of the squadrons, under the command of Commodore Thomas Truxtun, was dispatched to cruise between Puerto Rico and Saint Kitts. Truxtun's squadron consisted of his flagship, the frigate , the 20-gun , the brigs and , and the revenue cutter .Allen 1909, p. 83. Opposing Truxtun were several French vessels based in Guadeloupe, among them a number of privateers as well as two French naval frigates and a smaller, 20-gun corvette.Palmer 1987, p. 97. One of the French frigates, L'Insurgente, sortied from Guadeloupe on 8 February, commanded by Michel- Pierre Barreaut.Cutler 2005, p. 25.Palmer 1987, p. 98. Though the 1,265-ton Constellation was officially classified by the United States Navy as a 36-gun frigate, during the Quasi-War she carried a heavier armament of 38 guns.Bauer 1991, p. 9. Consisting of twenty-eight 24-pounders on her main deck and ten 12-pounders on her spar deck, Constellation main armament had a combined throwing weight of .Allen 1909, p. 99. In contrast, L'Insurgente, rated a 32-gun , was armed with 40 cannons. The armament of Barreaut's 950-ton ship consisted of twenty-four 12-pounders, two 18-pounders, eight 6-pounders, four 32-pounder carronades, and two 24-pounder carronades, totalling a combined throwing weight of only . Thus, although Barreaut's vessel carried two more guns in total, Truxtun's frigate had a more powerful armament due to shot weight. In a boarding action, the French frigate's crew of 409 men would have had an advantage over the American ship's 309, but in a gunnery duel the Americans were superior. Battle alt=A black and white map shows the frigate Constellation crossing the bow of the frigate L'Insurgente three times while the time of each event of the battle is shown above. At noon on 9 February, while cruising independently, Truxtun's men sighted a frigate off the coast of Nevis. Upon approach it was evident that the vessel was flying American colors, and Constellation attempted to move closer to investigate. Unknown to Truxtun, the frigate was the French L'Insurgente under Michel- Pierre Barreaut. Nearing the still-unidentified L'Insurgente, Truxtun attempted to signal her to discern her nationality by displaying first British signals and then American signals. Unable to send the correct reply, L'Insurgente replaced the American colors with French and fired a gun. Upon sighting Constellation at 12:30 pm, Barreaut mistook the ship for a British corvette and began to flee toward the Dutch islands of Saba and Sint Eustatius to evade his assailant. Truxtun gave chase, but was hampered at 1:30 p.m. when the two vessels ran into a gale.Allen 1909, p. 96. As a result of the storm, L'Insurgente lost her main topmast and was severely damaged, while Constellation managed to avoid significant damage and was able to close in on Barreaut.Palmer 1987, p. 99. Though Truxtun's ship initially held an advantageous position in the wind known as the weather gauge, she was over- armed, and as a result her leeward side heeled so much that the gunports on that side of the vessel could not be opened. Truxtun decided to cede the weather gauge to the French by sailing around L'Insurgentes leeward side and bringing Constellation near the French frigate's port side. In such a position Constellation was disadvantaged by the wind, but was able to avoid some of the heeling effect on her guns.Toll 2006, p. 117. With Constellation approaching his frigate fast, Barreaut tried to communicate with the Americans in order to avoid a fight. The American frigate ignored the French attempt at hailing her and closed to within fifty yards of L'Insurgente before opening up on her with a broadside. The double-shotted American salvo severely damaged the French frigate's quarterdeck.Allen 1909, p. 97. Barreaut's vessel replied with her own broadsides that damaged Constellation's fore topmast. Midshipman David Porter, stationed in the rigging of Constellations damaged mast, managed to relieve pressure from it and prevented its collapse. L'Insurgente attempted to close on the American frigate to board her. With less damage to her rigging, Constellation was easily able to avoid Barreaut's attempts at boarding.Spears 1897, p. 320. Constellation crossed L'Insurgentes bow and raked her with a broadside. Truxtun then maneuvered Constellation to L'Insurgentes starboard side and fired further broadsides into the French frigate, but received damage to her rigging in return.Roberts 1942, p. 47. Constellation slipped ahead of L'Insurgente, again crossing her bow and raking her. Once more Constellation slipped next to L'Insurgentes leeward side and fired into her, disabling the French vessel's 18-pounder guns.Spears 1897, p. 321. Constellation crossed the frigate's bow a third time, but the French ship had by then sustained massive damage. Attempts by Barreaut's crew to repair L'Insurgentes rigging were fruitless and the French captain struck his colors to surrender the vessel.Allen 1909, p. 98. The engagement had lasted 74 minutes.Spears 1897, p. 322. Aftermath alt=In black and white, the frigate USS Constellation pursues the fleeing French frigate L'Insurgente in the open sea as storm clouds loom overhead. John Rogers David Porter The end of the action signaled the first victory over an enemy warship for the newly formed United States Navy.Sweetman 2002, p. 16.The first capture was on 7 July 1798 when the captured without resistance the French privateer Le Croyable. After Barreaut had struck his colors, Truxtun sent a boat over to board, identify, and take possession of the French vessel. It was only upon boarding L'Insurgente that the Americans learned the identity of their opponents. The storm and the battle had caused immense damage to the French frigate. In comparison, Constellation had suffered moderate damage to her rigging, but was otherwise still intact. French casualties included 29 killed and 41 wounded, while the Americans suffered two dead and two wounded. One American died shortly after the action ended, of wounds received from French fire; another was executed for cowardice by Constellations Lieutenant Andrew Sterett after the man deserted his gun at the start of the action.Allen 1909, p. 100. Constellation began taking on prisoners of war from L'Insurgente, but by nightfall the two ships had become separated in a storm. Left aboard L'Insurgente were Constellations First Lieutenant John Rodgers, Midshipman David Porter, and 11 enlisted men, along with 170 French prisoners. The Americans were forced to sail the vessel short-handed while guarding the French prisoners. As the prisoners outnumbered their captors and no gear to secure them could be found aboard, the Frenchmen were driven into L'Insurgentes lower holds. Finally, after three nights, L'Insurgente was brought in to Saint Kitts where Constellation was waiting for her.Spears 1897, p. 323. While at the American naval depot at Saint Kitts, Constellations troublesome 24-pounder guns were removed and replaced with 18-pounder cannons.Martin 2006, p. 29. At the American prize court in Norfolk, Virginia, L'Insurgente was condemned to be sold as a war prize, with the proceeds distributed to the crew of Constellation.Palmer 1987, p. 133. Secretary of the Navy Benjamin Stoddert managed to negotiate the prize award down from $120,000 to $84,000 before purchasing L'Insurgente and commissioning her in the United States Navy as USS Insurgent.Palmer 1987, p. 134 For his victory over L'Insurgente, Truxtun received honors both at home and abroad. When accounts of the action reached London, Truxtun was f√™ted by the merchants there who sent him a piece of silver plate to commemorate his victory.James 2004, p. 32. In the United States, morale soared upon hearing of the first American victory over the French. Truxtun was cited by Stoddert for his excellent conduct during the action, and songs and poems such as Brave Yankee Boys were later written about the event.Cutler 2005, p. 22. In contrast, when Barreaut returned to France he was accused of failing to put up sufficient resistance in the engagement and was given a court-martial. Despite the accusations, he had been praised by Truxtun after the action for his bravery and was acquitted during the court- martial.Troude 1867, pp. 169‚Äì170.Bonnel 1961, p. 98. The French were infuriated upon hearing the results of the action because the two countries were not officially at war; Governor Edme √âtienne Borne Desfourneaux of Guadeloupe demanded that Insurgent be returned to French control. Upon learning of the American refusal to repatriate Insurgent, Desfourneaux was outraged and ordered all American vessels and property to be seized, while also declaring that a state of war existed between the United States and Guadeloupe.Allen 1909, p. 103. After continuing their cruise for a few weeks, both Insurgent and Constellation were forced to return to Norfolk by the end of March due to the expiration of the terms of enlistment of their crews.Allen 1909, p. 104. On her next cruise Constellation prevailed in another action against La Vengeance, although her own casualties were heavy this time, and that French frigate escaped L'Insurgentes fate.

The dynasty was founded by a series of dukes listed by the chronicler Gallus Anonymous in the early 12th century: Siemowit, Lestek and Siemomys≈Ç. It was Mieszko I, the son of Siemomys≈Ç, who is now considered the proper founder of the Polish state at about 960 AD. The ruling house then remained in power in the Polish lands until 1370. Mieszko converted to Christianity of the Western Latin Rite in an event known as the Baptism of Poland in 966, which established a major cultural boundary in Europe based on religion. He also completed a unification of the Lechitic tribal lands that was fundamental to the existence of the new country of Poland. Following the emergence of the Polish state, a series of rulers converted the population to Christianity, created a kingdom of Poland in 1025 and integrated Poland into the prevailing culture of Europe. Mieszko's son Boles≈Çaw I the Brave established a Roman Catholic Archdiocese in Gniezno, pursued territorial conquests and was officially crowned in 1025 as the first king of Poland. The first Piast monarchy collapsed with the death of Mieszko II Lambert in 1034, followed by its restoration under Casimir I in 1042. In the process, the royal dignity for Polish rulers was forfeited, and the state reverted to the status of a duchy. Duke Casimir's son Boles≈Çaw II the Bold revived the military assertiveness of Boles≈Çaw I, but became fatally involved in a conflict with Bishop Stanislaus of Szczepan√≥w and was expelled from the country. Boles≈Çaw III, the last duke of the early period, succeeded in defending his country and recovering territories previously lost. Upon his death in 1138, Poland was divided among his sons. The resulting internal fragmentation eroded the initial Piast monarchical structure in the 12th and 13th centuries and caused fundamental and lasting changes. Konrad I of Masovia invited the Teutonic Knights to help him fight the Baltic Prussian pagans, which led to centuries of Poland's warfare with the Knights and the German Prussian state. In 1320, the kingdom was restored under W≈Çadys≈Çaw I the Elbow- high, then strengthened and expanded by his son Casimir III the Great. The western provinces of Silesia and Pomerania were lost after the fragmentation, and Poland began expanding to the east. The period ended with the reigns of two members of the Capetian House of Anjou between 1370 and 1384. The consolidation in the 14th century laid the base for the new powerful kingdom of Poland that was to follow.  10th‚Äì12th century  = Mieszko I and the adoption of Christianity in Poland (ca. 960‚Äì992) = Ostr√≥w Tumski. Remnants of the original palatium‚Äìchapel complex of Poland's first Christian ruling couple have been found beneath the church in the foreground. The Pozna≈Ñ Cathedral is located on the right. The tribe of the Polans (Polanie, lit. \\"people of the fields\\") in what is now Greater Poland gave rise to a tribal predecessor of the Polish state in the early part of the 10th century, with the Polans settling in the flatlands around the emerging strongholds of Giecz, Pozna≈Ñ, Gniezno and Ostr√≥w Lednicki. Accelerated rebuilding of old tribal fortified settlements, construction of massive new ones and territorial expansion took place during the period ca. 920‚Äì950.Various authors, ed. Marek Derwich and Adam ≈ªurek, U ≈∫r√≥de≈Ç Polski (do roku 1038) (Foundations of Poland (until year 1038)), Wydawnictwo Dolno≈õlƒÖskie, Wroc≈Çaw 2002, , Zofia Kurnatowska, pp. 147‚Äì149, Adam ≈ªurek and Wojciech Mrozowicz, p. 226 The Polish state developed from these tribal roots in the second half of the century. According to the 12th-century chronicler Gallus Anonymus, the Polans were ruled at this time by the Piast dynasty. In existing sources from the 10th century, Piast ruler Mieszko I was first mentioned by Widukind of Corvey in his Res gestae saxonicae, a chronicle of events in Germany. Widukind reported that Mieszko's forces were twice defeated in 963 by the Veleti tribes acting in cooperation with the Saxon exile Wichmann the Younger. Under Mieszko's rule (ca. 960 to 992), his tribal state accepted Christianity and became the Polish state.Various authors, ed. Marek Derwich and Adam ≈ªurek, U ≈∫r√≥de≈Ç Polski (do roku 1038) (Foundations of Poland (until year 1038)), pp. 144‚Äì159 The viability of the Mieszko's emerging state was assured by the persistent territorial expansion of the early Piast rulers. Beginning with a very small area around Gniezno (before the town itself existed), the Piast expansion lasted throughout most of the 10th century and resulted in a territory approximating that of present-day Poland. The Polanie tribe conquered and merged with other Slavic tribes and first formed a tribal federation, then later a centralized state. After the addition of Lesser Poland, the country of the Vistulans, and of Silesia (both taken by Mieszko from the Czech state during the later part of the 10th century), Mieszko's state reached its mature form, including the main regions regarded as ethnically Polish. The Piast lands totaled about in area,Francis W. Carter, Trade and urban development in Poland, Cambridge University Press, 1993, , Google Print, p.47 with an approximate population of under one million.Jerzy Lukowski, Hubert Zawadzki, A Concise History of Poland, Cambridge University Press, 2001, , Google Print, p.6 Roma, Gallia, Germania and Sclavinia (Slavic province of Europe) bring offerings to Emperor Otto III, approaching him in that order. However, they appear to be given equal rank (size), which is a reflection of imperial policies at that time. Initially a pagan, Mieszko I was the first ruler of the Polans tribal union known from contemporary written sources. A detailed account of aspects of Mieszko's early reign was given by Ibr√¢h√Æm ibn Ya\`q√ªb, a Jewish traveler, according to whom Mieszko was one of four Slavic \\"kings\\" established in central and southern Europe in the 960s.Jerzy Wyrozumski, Dzieje Polski piastowskiej (VIII w. ‚Äì 1370) (History of Piast Poland (8th century ‚Äì 1370)), p. 77, Fogra, Krak√≥w 1999, Norman Davies, Europe: A History, p. 325, 1998 New York, HarperPerennial, In 965, Mieszko, who was allied with Boleslaus I, Duke of Bohemia at the time, married the duke's daughter Doubravka, a Christian princess. Mieszko's conversion to Christianity in its Western Latin Rite followed on 14 April 966, an event known as the Baptism of Poland that is considered to be the founding event of the Polish state. In the aftermath of Mieszko's victory over a force of the Velunzani in 967, which was led by Wichmann, the first missionary bishop was appointed: Jordan, bishop of Poland. The action counteracted the intended eastern expansion of the Magdeburg Archdiocese, which was established at about the same time. Mieszko's state had a complex political relationship with the German Holy Roman Empire, as Mieszko was a \\"friend\\", ally and vassal of Holy Roman Emperor Otto I and paid him tribute from the western part of his lands. Mieszko fought wars with the Polabian Slavs, the Czechs, Margrave Gero of the Saxon Eastern March in 963‚Äì964 and Margrave Odo I of the Saxon Eastern March in 972 in the Battle of Cedynia. The victories over Wichmann and Odo allowed Mieszko to extend his Pomeranian possessions west to the vicinity of the Oder River and its mouth. After the death of Otto I, and then again after the death of Holy Roman Emperor Otto II, Mieszko supported Henry the Quarrelsome, a pretender to the imperial crown. After the death of Doubravka in 977, Mieszko married Oda von Haldensleben, daughter of Dietrich, Margrave of the Northern March, ca. 980. When fighting the Czechs in 990, Mieszko was helped by the Holy Roman Empire. By about the year 990, when Mieszko I officially submitted his country to the authority of the Holy See (Dagome iudex), he had transformed Poland into one of the strongest powers in central-eastern Europe. = The reign of Boles≈Çaw I and establishment of a Kingdom of Poland (992‚Äì1025) = An image on the Gniezno Doors at the entrance to Gniezno Cathedral depicts Boles≈Çaw buying Adalbert's body back from the Prussians When Mieszko I died in 992, he was succeeded by his son Boles≈Çaw contrary to his wishes. In order to ascend the throne, Boles≈Çaw had to contest it with his widowed stepmother Oda, his father's second wife, and her minor sons. Boles≈Çaw was Mieszko's oldest son, born to his first wife Doubravka of Bohemia, who died in 977. His father intended to divide the duchy of Poland between his sons, but Boles≈Çaw succeeded in displacing his stepmother and stepbrothers to become the sole ruler of Poland. Consistent with the intrigues he pursued at the start of his reign to secure his throne, Boles≈Çaw I Chrobry (\\"the Brave\\") proved himself to be a man of high ambition and strong personality. Poland (992‚Äì1025); area within dark pink color represents the borders at the end of the rule of Mieszko I (992); dark red border comprises the area at the end of the reign of Boles≈Çaw I (1025) One of the most important concerns of Boles≈Çaw's early reign was building up the Polish church. Boles≈Çaw cultivated Adalbert of Prague of the Slavn√≠k family, a well-connected Czech bishop in exile and missionary who was killed in 997 while on a mission in Prussia. Boles≈Çaw skillfully took advantage of his death: his martyrdom led to his elevation as patron saint of Poland and resulted in the creation of an independent Polish province of the Church with Radim Gaudentius as Archbishop of Gniezno. In the year 1000, the young Emperor Otto III came as a pilgrim to visit St. Adalbert's grave and lent his support to Boles≈Çaw during the Congress of Gniezno; the Gniezno Archdiocese and several subordinate dioceses were established on this occasion. The Polish ecclesiastical province effectively served as an essential anchor and an institution to fall back on for the Piast state, helping it to survive in the troubled centuries ahead. Boles≈Çaw at first chose to continue his father's policy of cooperation with the Holy Roman Empire but when Emperor Otto III died in 1002, Boles≈Çaw's relationship with his successor Henry II turned out to be much more difficult, and it resulted in a series of wars (1002‚Äì1005, 1007‚Äì1013, 1015‚Äì1018). From 1003‚Äì1004, Boles≈Çaw intervened militarily in Czech dynastic conflicts. After his forces were removed from Bohemia in 1018,Makk, Ferenc (1993). Magyar k√ºlpolitika (896-1196) (\\"The Hungarian External Politics (896-1196)\\"). Szeged: Szegedi K√∂z√©pkor√°sz M≈±hely. pp. 48‚Äì49. . Boles≈Çaw retained Moravia. In 1013, the marriage between Boles≈Çaw's son Mieszko and Richeza of Lotharingia, the niece of Emperor Otto III and future mother of Casimir I the Restorer, took place. The conflicts with Germany ended in 1018 with the Peace of Bautzen on favorable terms for Boles≈Çaw. In the context of the 1018 Kiev expedition, Boles≈Çaw took over the western part of Red Ruthenia. In 1025, shortly before his death, Boles≈Çaw I finally succeeded in obtaining the papal permission to crown himself, and he became the first king of Poland. Boles≈Çaw's expansionist policies were costly to the Polish state and were not always successful. He lost, for example, the economically crucial Farther Pomerania in 1005 together with its new bishopric in Ko≈Çobrzeg; the region had previously been conquered with great effort by Mieszko.Various authors, ed. Marek Derwich and Adam ≈ªurek, U ≈∫r√≥de≈Ç Polski (do roku 1038) (Foundations of Poland (until year 1038)), p. 168‚Äì183, Andrzej Pleszczy≈Ñski = Mieszko II and the collapse of the Piast kingdom (1025‚Äì1039) = Mieszko II shown allegorically with Duchess Matilda of Swabia King Mieszko II Lambert (r. 1025‚Äì1034) tried to continue the expansionist politics of his father. His actions reinforced old resentment and hostility on the part of Poland's neighbors, and his two dispossessed brothers took advantage of it by arranging for invasions from Germany and Kievan Rus' in 1031. Mieszko was defeated and forced to leave Poland. Mieszko's brother Bezprym was murdered in 1032, whereas his brother Otto died in unclear circumstances in 1033, events that permitted Mieszko to recover his authority partially. The first Piast monarchy then collapsed with Mieszko's death in 1034. Deprived of a government, Poland was ravaged by an anti-feudal and pagan rebellion, and in 1039, there was an invasion by the forces of Bretislaus I of Bohemia. The country suffered territorial losses, and the functioning of the Gniezno archdiocese was disrupted.Various authors, ed. Marek Derwich and Adam ≈ªurek, U ≈∫r√≥de≈Ç Polski (do roku 1038) (Foundations of Poland (until year 1038)), pp. 182‚Äì187, Andrzej Pleszczy≈Ñski = Reunification of Poland under Casimir I (1039‚Äì1058) = St. Andrew's Church in Krak√≥w (built in the 11th century) Poland made a recovery under Mieszko's son, Duke Casimir I (r. 1039‚Äì1058), known to history as the Restorer. After returning from exile in 1039, Casimir rebuilt the Polish monarchy and the country's territorial integrity through several military campaigns: in 1047, Masovia was taken back from Miec≈Çaw, a Polish noble who tried to detach the region from the rule of the Polish monarch, and in 1054 Silesia was recovered from the Czechs. Casimir was aided by recent adversaries of Poland, the Holy Roman Empire and Kievan Rus', both of whom disliked the chaos in Poland left after the dismemberment of the country beginning in the reign of Mieszko II. Casimir introduced a more mature form of feudalism and relieved the burden of financing large army units from the duke's treasury by settling his warriors on feudal estates. Faced with the widespread destruction of Greater Poland after the Czech incursion, Casimir moved his court to Krak√≥w and replaced the old Piast capitals of Pozna≈Ñ and Gniezno; Krak√≥w would function as the nation's capital for several centuries. = Boles≈Çaw II and the conflict with Bishop Stanis≈Çaw (1058‚Äì1079) = St. Leonard's Crypt is all that remains of the second Romanesque Wawel Cathedral of W≈Çadys≈Çaw Herman Casimir's son Boles≈Çaw II the Bold, also known as the Generous (r. 1058‚Äì1079), developed Polish military strength and waged several foreign campaigns between 1058 and 1077. As an active supporter of the pope in its Investiture Controversy with the German emperor, Boles≈Çaw crowned himself king in 1076 with the blessing of Pope Gregory VII. In 1079, there was an anti-Boles≈Çaw conspiracy or conflict that involved the Bishop of Krak√≥w. Boles≈Çaw had Bishop Stanis≈Çaw of Szczepan√≥w executed; subsequently Boles≈Çaw was forced to abdicate the Polish throne due to pressure from the Catholic Church and the pro-imperial faction of the nobility. Stanis≈Çaw would become the second martyr and patron saint of Poland (known in English as St. Stanislav), canonized in 1253. = Reign of W≈Çadys≈Çaw I Herman (1079‚Äì1102) = P≈Çock Cathedral is the burial place of W≈Çadys≈Çaw I Herman and Boles≈Çaw III Wrymouth After Boles≈Çaw's exile, the country found itself under the unstable rule of his younger brother W≈Çadys≈Çaw I Herman (r. 1079‚Äì1102). W≈Çadys≈Çaw was strongly dependent on Count Palatine Sieciech, an advisor from the ranks of the Polish nobility who acted much as the power behind the throne. When W≈Çadys≈Çaw's two sons, Zbigniew and Boles≈Çaw, finally forced W≈Çadys≈Çaw to remove his hated prot√©g√©, Poland was divided among the three of them from 1098, and after the father's death, from 1102 to 1106, it was divided between the two brothers. = Reign of Boles≈Çaw III (1102‚Äì1138) = Poland during the rule of Boles≈Çaw III Wrymouth After a power struggle, Boles≈Çaw III Wrymouth (r. 1102‚Äì1138) became the duke of Poland by defeating his half-brother Zbigniew in 1106‚Äì1107. Zbigniew had to leave the country, but received support from Holy Roman Emperor Henry V, who attacked Boles≈Çaw's Poland in 1109. Boles≈Çaw was able to defend his country due to his military abilities, determination and alliances, and also because of a national mobilization across the social spectrum (see Battle of G≈Çog√≥w). Zbigniew, who later returned, died in mysterious circumstances, perhaps in the summer of 1113. Boles≈Çaw's other major achievement was the conquest of all of Mieszko I's Pomerania (of which the remaining eastern part had been lost by Poland from after the death of Mieszko II), a task begun by his father W≈Çadys≈Çaw I Herman and completed by Boles≈Çaw around 1123. Szczecin was subdued in a bloody takeover and Western Pomerania up to R√ºgen, except for the directly incorporated southern part, became Boles≈Çaw's fief,Atlas historyczny Polski (Atlas of Polish History), 14th edition, , PPWK Warszawa‚ÄìWroc≈Çaw 1998, p. 5 to be ruled locally by Wartislaw I, the first duke of the Griffin dynasty. At this time, Christianization of the region was initiated in earnest, an effort crowned by the establishment of the Pomeranian Wolin Diocese after Boles≈Çaw's death in 1140. = Fragmentation of the realm (1138‚Äì1320)= Collegiate church in Tum Before he died, Boles≈Çaw III Wrymouth divided the country, in a limited sense, among four of his sons. He made complex arrangements intended to prevent fratricidal warfare and preserve the Polish state's formal unity, but after Boles≈Çaw's death, the implementation of the plan failed and a long period of fragmentation was ushered in. For nearly two centuries, the Piasts would spar with each other, the clergy, and the nobility for the control over the divided kingdom. The stability of the system was supposedly assured by the institution of the senior or high duke of Poland, based in Krak√≥w and assigned to the special Seniorate Province that was not to be subdivided. Following his concept of seniorate, Boles≈Çaw divided the country into five principalities: Silesia, Greater Poland, Masovia, Sandomierz and Krak√≥w. The first four provinces were given to his four sons, who became independent rulers. The fifth province, the Seniorate Province of Krak√≥w, was to be added to the senior among the princes who, as the Grand Duke of Krak√≥w, was the representative of the whole of Poland. This principle broke down already within the generation of Boles≈Çaw III's sons, when W≈Çadys≈Çaw II the Exile, Boles≈Çaw IV the Curly, Mieszko III the Old and Casimir II the Just fought for power and territory in Poland, and in particular over the throne of Krak√≥w. The external borders left by Boles≈Çaw III at his death closely resembled the borders left by Mieszko I; this original early Piast monarchy configuration had not survived the fragmentation period.Atlas historyczny Polski (Atlas of Polish History), 14th edition, p. 4 and 5 = Culture = Mongol invasion of Poland (late 1240‚Äì1241) culminated in the Battle of Legnica From the time of the conversion of Poland's ruling elite to Christianity in the 10th century, foreign churchmen had been arriving and the culture of early Medieval Poland was developing as a part of European Christendom. However, it would be a few generations from the time of Mieszko's conversion until significant numbers of native clergymen appeared. After the establishment of numerous monasteries in the 12th and 13th centuries, Christianization of the populace was accomplished on a larger scale.Jerzy Lukowski and Hubert Zawadzki, A Concise History of Poland. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2nd edition 2006, , p. 9 Intellectual and artistic activity was concentrated around the institutions of the Church, the courts of the kings and dukes, and emerged around the households of the rising hereditary elite. Written annals began to be generated in the late 10th century; leaders such as Mieszko II and Casimir the Restorer were considered literate and educated. Along with the Dagome iudex act, the most important written document and source of the period is the Gesta principum Polonorum, a chronicle by Gallus Anonymus, a foreign cleric from the court of Boles≈Çaw Wrymouth. Bruno of Querfurt was one of the pioneering Western clergymen spreading Church literacy; some of his prominent writings had been produced in eremitic monasteries in Poland. Among the preeminent early monastic religious orders were the Benedictines (the abbey in Tyniec founded in 1044) and the Cistercians.Various authors, ed. Marek Derwich and Adam ≈ªurek, U ≈∫r√≥de≈Ç Polski (do roku 1038) (Foundations of Poland (until year 1038)), pp. 196‚Äì209 A number of Pre-Romanesque stone churches were built beginning in the 10th century, often accompanied by palatium ruler residencies; Romanesque buildings proper followed. The earliest coins were minted by Boles≈Çaw I around 995. The Gniezno Doors of Gniezno Cathedral in bronze low relief, dating from the 1170s, are the finest examples of Romanesque sculpture in Poland.  13th century  = State and society; German settlement = Ostsiedlung or German settlement in the east, miniature from Sachsenspiegel The 13th century brought fundamental changes to the structure of Polish society and its political system. Because of constant internal conflicts, the Piast dukes were unable to stabilize Poland's external borders. Western Farther Pomerania broke its political ties with Poland in the second half of the 12th century and from 1231 became a fief of the Margraviate of Brandenburg, which in 1307 extended its Pomeranian possessions even further east, taking over the S≈Çawno and S≈Çupsk areas. Pomerelia or Gda≈Ñsk Pomerania became independent of the Polish dukes from 1227. In mid-13th century, Boles≈Çaw II the Bald granted Lubusz Land to the Margraviate, which made possible the creation of the Neumark and had far reaching negative consequences for the integrity of the western border. In the south-east, Leszek the White was unable to preserve Poland's supremacy over the Halych area of Rus', a territory that had changed hands on a number of occasions. The social status was becoming increasingly based on the size of feudal land possessions. Those included the lands controlled by the Piast princes, their rivals the great lay land owners and church entities, and the knightly class. The work force ranged from hired \\"free\\" people to serfs attached to the land, to slaves (either purchased, forced into slavery after capture in war or forced into slavery as prisoners). The upper layer of the feudal lords, first the Church and then others, was able to acquire economic and legal immunity, which it exempt to a significant degree from court jurisdiction and economic obligations such as taxation that had previously been imposed by the ruling dukes. Thorn (Toru≈Ñ), established by the Teutonic Knights became a member of the Hanseatic League Civil strife and foreign invasions, such as the Mongol invasions in 1240/1241, 1259/1260 and 1287/1288, weakened and depopulated many of the small Polish principalities, as the country was becoming progressively more subdivided. Depopulation and increasing demand for labor caused a massive immigration of West European peasants into Poland, mostly German settlers; the early waves from Germany and Flanders occurred in the 1220s.John Radzilowski, A Traveller's History of Poland; Northampton, Massachusetts: Interlink Books, 2007, , p. 260 The German, Polish and other new rural settlements represented a form of feudal tenancy with legal immunity and German town laws were often utilized as its legal bases. German immigrants were also important in the rise of the cities and the establishment of the Polish burgher (city dwelling merchants) class; they brought with them West European laws (Magdeburg rights) and customs that the Poles adopted. From that time, the Germans, who created early strong establishments (led by patriciates) especially in the urban centers of Silesia and other regions of western Poland, were an increasingly influential minority in Poland.Jerzy Lukowski and Hubert Zawadzki, A Concise History of Poland, pp. 14‚Äì16Norman Davies, Europe: A History , p. 366 In 1228, the Acts of Cienia were passed and signed into law by W≈Çadys≈Çaw III Laskonogi. The titular Duke of Poland promised to provide a \\"just and noble law according to the council of bishops and barons.\\" Such legal guarantees and privileges included the lower level land owners and knights, who were evolving into the lower and middle nobility class known later as szlachta. The period of fragmentation weakened the rulers and established a permanent trend in Polish history, whereby the rights and role of the nobility were expanded at the monarch's expense. = Relations with the Teutonic Knights = Henry IV of Wroc≈Çaw in the Codex Manesse, about 1300 In 1226, Duke Konrad I of Masovia invited the Teutonic Knights to help him fight the pagan, Baltic Old Prussians, who lived in a territory adjacent to his lands; substantial border warfare was taking place and Konrad's province was suffering from Prussian invasions. On the other hand, the Old Prussians themselves were at that time being subjected to increasingly forced, but largely ineffective Christianization efforts, including Northern Crusades sponsored by the papacy. The Teutonic Order soon overstepped their authority and moved beyond the area granted them by Konrad (Che≈Çmno Land or Kulmerland). In the following decades, they conquered large areas along the Baltic Sea coast and established their own monastic state. As virtually all of the Western Baltic pagans became converted or exterminated (the Prussian conquests were completed by 1283), the Knights confronted Poland and Lithuania, then the last pagan state in Europe. Teutonic wars with Poland and Lithuania continued for most of the 14th and 15th centuries. The Teutonic state in Prussia, populated by German settlers beginning in the 13th century, had been claimed as a fief and protected by the popes and Holy Roman Emperors.John Radzilowski, A Traveller's History of Poland, pp. 39‚Äì41 = Reunification attempts and the reigns of Przemys≈Ç II and V√°clav II (1232‚Äì1305) = Archbishop Jakub ≈öwinka As the disadvantages of national division were becoming increasingly apparent in various segments of the society, some of the Piast dukes began to make serious efforts aimed at the reunification of the Polish state. Important among the earlier attempts were the activities of the Silesian dukes Henry I the Bearded, his son Henry II the Pious, who was killed in 1241 while fighting the Mongols at the Battle of Legnica, and Henry IV Probus. In 1295, Przemys≈Ç II of Greater Poland became the first Piast duke crowned as King of Poland since Boles≈Çaw II, but he ruled over only a part of the territory of Poland (including Gda≈Ñsk Pomerania from 1294) and was assassinated soon after his coronation. A more extensive unification of Polish lands was accomplished by a foreign ruler, V√°clav II of Bohemia of the P≈ôemyslid dynasty, who married Przemys≈Ç's daughter Richeza and became King of Poland in 1300. V√°clav's heavy-handed policies soon caused him to lose whatever support he had earlier in his reign; he died in 1305. Gothic Cathedral of St. John the Baptist in Wroc≈Çaw An important factor in the unification process was the Polish Church, which remained a single ecclesiastical province throughout the fragmentation period. Archbishop Jakub ≈öwinka of Gniezno was an ardent proponent of Poland's reunification; he performed the crowning ceremonies for both Przemys≈Ç II and Wenceslaus II. ≈öwinka supported W≈Çadys≈Çaw I ≈Åokietek at various stages of the duke's career. = Culture = Culturally, the social impact of the Church was considerably broader in the 13th century, as networks of parishes were established and cathedral-type schools became more common. The Dominicans and the Franciscans were the leading monastic orders at this time, and they interacted closely with the general population. A proliferation of narrative annals characterized the period, as well as other written records, laws and documents. More of the clergy were of local origin; others were expected to know the Polish language. Wincenty Kad≈Çubek, the author of an influential chronicle, was the most recognized representative in the intellectual sphere. Perspectiva, a treatise on optics by Witelo, a Silesian monk, was one of the finest achievements of medieval science. The construction of churches and castles in the Gothic architecture style predominated in the 13th century; native elements in art forms were increasingly important, with significant advances taking place in agriculture, manufacturing and crafts.  14th century  = The reunited kingdom of the last Piast rulers; Jewish settlement = A fragment of a sandstone sarcophagus depicting W≈Çadys≈Çaw I the Elbow-high in Wawel Cathedral, Krak√≥w W≈Çadys≈Çaw I the Elbow-high and his son Casimir III, \\"the Great\\", were the last two rulers of the Piast dynasty of the unified kingdom of Poland of the 14th century. Their rule was not a return to the Polish state as it existed before the period of fragmentation, because of the loss of internal cohesion and territorial integrity. The regional Piast princes remained strong, and for economic and cultural reasons, some of them gravitated toward Poland's neighbors. The kingdom lost Pomerania and Silesia, the most highly developed and economically important regions of the original ethnically Polish lands, which left half of the Polish population outside the kingdom's borders. The western losses had to do with the failure of the unification efforts undertaken by the Silesian Piast dukes and the German expansion processes. These included the Piast principalities developing (or falling into) dependencies in respect to the German political structures, settler colonization and gradual Germanization of the Polish ruling circles. The lower Vistula was controlled by the Teutonic Order. Masovia was not to be fully incorporated into the Polish state in the near future. Casimir stabilized the western and northern borders, tried to regain some of the lost territories, and partially compensated the losses by new eastern expansion that placed within his kingdom regions that were East Slavic, thus ethnically non-Polish. Despite the territorial truncation, 14th-century Poland experienced a period of accelerated economic development and increasing prosperity. This included further expansion and modernization of agricultural settlements, the development of towns and their greater role in briskly growing trade, mining and metallurgy. A great monetary reform was implemented during the reign of Casimir III. Jewish settlement was taking place in Poland since very early times. In 1264, Duke Boles≈Çaw the Pious of Greater Poland granted the privileges of the Statute of Kalisz, which specified a broad range of freedoms of religious practices, movement, and trading for the Jews. It also created a legal precedent for the official protection of Jews from local harassment and exclusion. The act exempted the Jews from enslavement or serfdom and was the foundation of future Jewish prosperity in the Polish kingdom; it was later followed by many other comparable legal pronouncements.Davies, Norman (2005). God's Playground: A History of Poland, Volume I. New York: Columbia University Press. , p. 66 Following a series of expulsions of Jews from Western Europe, Jewish communities were established in Krak√≥w, Kalisz and elsewhere in western and southern Poland in the 13th century. Another series of communities were established at Lviv, Brest-Litovsk and Grodno further east in the 14th century.Richard Overy (2010), The Times Complete History of the World, Eights Edition, pp. 116‚Äì117. London: Times Books. . King Casimir received Jewish refugees from Germany in 1349,Norman Davies, Europe: A History, p. 429 which assisted the acceleration of a Jewish expansion in Poland that was to continue until World War II. German urban and rural settlements were another long- lasting ethnic feature. = The reign of W≈Çadys≈Çaw I the Elbow-high (1305‚Äì1333) = Casimir the Great at Wawel Cathedral W≈Çadys≈Çaw I the Elbow- high (r. 1305‚Äì1333), who began as an obscure Piast duke from Kuyavia, fought a lifelong, uphill battle with powerful adversaries with persistence and determination. When he died as the king of a partially reunited Poland, he left the kingdom in a precarious situation. Although the area under King W≈Çadys≈Çaw's control was limited and many unresolved issues remained, he may have saved Poland's existence as a state. Supported by his ally Charles I of Hungary, W≈Çadys≈Çaw returned from exile and challenged V√°clav II and his successor V√°clav III in the period 1304‚Äì1306. V√°clav III's murder in 1306 terminated the Bohemian P≈ôemyslid dynasty and its involvement in Poland. Afterwards, W≈Çadys≈Çaw completed the takeover of Lesser Poland, entering Krak√≥w, and took the lands north of there, through Kuyavia all the way to Gda≈Ñsk Pomerania. In 1308, Pomerania was conquered by the Brandenburg state. In a recovery effort, W≈Çadys≈Çaw agreed to ask for help from the Teutonic Knights; the Knights brutally took over Gda≈Ñsk Pomerania and kept it for themselves. In 1311‚Äì1312, a rebellion in Krak√≥w instigated by the city's patrician leadership seeking rule by the House of Luxembourg was put down. This event may have had a limiting impact on the emerging political power of towns.Jerzy Lukowski and Hubert Zawadzki, A Concise History of Poland, pp. 23‚Äì24 In 1313‚Äì1314, W≈Çadys≈Çaw conquered Greater Poland. In 1320, he became the first king of Poland crowned in Krak√≥w's Wawel Cathedral instead of Gniezno. The coronation was hesitantly agreed to by Pope John XXII in spite of the opposition of King John of Bohemia, who had also claimed the Polish crown. John undertook an expedition aimed at Krak√≥w in 1327, which he was compelled to abort; in 1328, he waged a crusade against Lithuania, during which he formalized an alliance with the Teutonic Order. The Order was in a state of war with Poland from 1327 to 1332 (see Battle of P≈Çowce). As a result, the Knights captured Dobrzy≈Ñ Land and Kujawy. W≈Çadys≈Çaw was helped by his alliances with Hungary (his daughter Elizabeth was married to King Charles I in 1320) and Lithuania (in a pact of 1325 against the Teutonic State and the marriage of W≈Çadys≈Çaw's son Casimir to Aldona, daughter of the Lithuanian ruler Gediminas). After 1329, a peace agreement with Brandenburg also assisted his efforts. A lasting achievement of King John of Bohemia (and a great loss to Poland) was his success in forcing most of the Piast Silesian principalities, often ambivalent about their loyalties, into allegiance between 1327 and 1329.Jerzy Lukowski and Hubert Zawadzki, A Concise History of Poland, pp. 14‚Äì26 = The reign of Casimir III the Great (1333‚Äì1370) = Casimir III (1370) is shown within the dark red border; Silesia (yellow) was lost, while the kingdom had expanded to the east After the death of W≈Çadys≈Çaw I, the old monarch's 23-year-old son became King Casimir III, later known as Casimir the Great (r. 1333‚Äì1370). Unlike his father, the new king demonstrated no attraction for the hardships of military life. Casimir's contemporaries did not give him much of a chance of overcoming the country's mounting difficulties or succeeding as a ruler. But from the beginning, Casimir acted prudently, and in 1335, he purchased the claims of King John of Bohemia to the Polish throne. In 1343, Casimir settled several high-level arbitration disputes with the Teutonic Order by a territorial compromise that culminated in the Treaty of Kalisz of 1343. Dobrzy≈Ñ Land and Kuyavia were recovered by Casimir. At that time, Poland started to expand to the east and through a series of military campaigns between 1340 and 1366, Casimir annexed the Halych‚ÄìVolodymyr area of Rus'. The town of Lviv there attracted newcomers of several nationalities, was granted municipal rights in 1356, and had thus begun its career as Lw√≥w, the main Polish center in the midst of a Rus' Orthodox population. Supported by Hungary, the Polish king in 1338 promised the Hungarian ruling house the Polish throne in the event he dies without male heirs.Jerzy Lukowski and Hubert Zawadzki, A Concise History of Poland, pp. 26‚Äì34 Foundation of the Collegiate church in Wi≈õlica by Casimir III the Great Casimir, who formally gave up his rights to several Silesian principalities in 1339, unsuccessfully tried to recover the region by conducting military activities against the House of Luxembourg (the rulers of Bohemia) between 1343 and 1348, but then blocked the attempted separation of Silesia from the Gniezno Archdiocese by Holy Roman Emperor Charles IV. Later, until his death, he pursued the Polish claim to Silesia legally by petitioning the pope; his successors did not continue his efforts. Allied with Denmark and Western Pomerania (Gda≈Ñsk Pomerania was granted to the Order as an \\"eternal charity\\"), Casimir was able to impose some corrections on the western border. In 1365, Drezdenko and Santok became Poland's fiefs, while the Wa≈Çcz district was taken outright in 1368. The latter action severed the land connection between Brandenburg and the Teutonic state and connected Poland with Farther Pomerania. Casimir the Great considerably solidified the country's position in both foreign and domestic affairs. Domestically, he integrated and centralized the reunited Polish state and helped develop what was considered the \\"Crown of the Polish Kingdom\\": the state within its actual boundaries, as well as past or potential boundaries. Casimir established or strengthened kingdom-wide institutions (such as the powerful state treasury) independent of the regional, class, or royal court-related interests. Internationally, the Polish king was very active diplomatically; he cultivated close contacts with other European rulers and was a staunch defender of the Polish national interest. In 1364, he sponsored the Congress of Krak√≥w, in which a number of monarchs participated, which was concerned with the promotion of peaceful cooperation and political balance in Central Europe. = The reign of Louis I and Jadwiga (1370‚Äì1399) = Queen Jadwiga was the great-granddaughter of W≈Çadys≈Çaw I the Elbow-high Immediately after Casimir's death in 1370, the heirless king's nephew Louis of Hungary of the Capetian House of Anjou assumed the Polish throne. As Casimir's actual commitment to the Anjou succession seemed problematic from the beginning (in 1368 the Polish king adopted his grandson, Casimir of S≈Çupsk), Louis engaged in succession negotiations with Polish knights and nobility starting in 1351. They supported him, exacting in return further guarantees and privileges for themselves; the formal act was negotiated in Buda in 1355. After his coronation, Louis returned to Hungary; he left his mother and Casimir's sister Elizabeth in Poland as regents. With the death of Casimir the Great, the period of hereditary (Piast) monarchy in Poland came to an end. The land owners and nobles did not want a strong monarchy; a constitutional monarchy was established between 1370 and 1493 that included the beginning of the general sejm, the dominant bicameral parliament of the future. During the reign of Louis I, Poland formed a Polish-Hungarian union. In the pact of 1374 (the Privilege of Koszyce), the Polish nobility was granted extensive concessions and agreed to extend the Anjou succession to Louis's daughters, as Louis had no sons. Louis's neglect of Polish affairs resulted in the loss of Casimir's territorial gains, including Halych Rus', which was recovered by Queen Jadwiga in 1387. In 1396, Jadwiga and her husband Jagie≈Ç≈Ço (Jogaila) forcefully annexed the central Polish lands separating Lesser Poland from Greater Poland, previously granted by King Louis to his Silesian Piast ally Duke W≈Çadys≈Çaw of Opole. St. Mary's Church in Krak√≥w The Hungarian-Polish union lasted for twelve years and ended in war. After Louis's death in 1382 and a power struggle that resulted in the Greater Poland Civil War, the Polish nobility decided that Jadwiga, Louis's youngest daughter, should become the next \\"King of Poland\\"; Jadwiga arrived in 1384 and was crowned at the age of eleven. The failure of the union of Poland and Hungary paved the way for the union of Lithuania and Poland. = Culture = In the 14th century, many large scale brick building projects were undertaken during Casimir's reign, including the construction of Gothic churches, castles, urban fortifications and homes of wealthy city residents. The most notable examples of architecture from the medieval period in Poland are the many churches representing the Polish Gothic style; medieval sculpture, painting and ornamental smithery are best revealed in the furnishings of churches and liturgical items. Polish law was first codified in the Statutes of Casimir the Great (the Piotrk√≥w‚ÄìWi≈õlica Statutes) from 1346‚Äì1362. Accordingly, conflict resolution relied on legal proceedings domestically, while bilateral or multilateral negotiations and treaties were increasingly important in international relations. By this time, the network of cathedral and parish schools had become well developed. In 1364, Casimir the Great established the University of Krak√≥w, the second oldest university in Central Europe. While many still traveled to Southern and Western Europe for university studies, the Polish language, along with the predominant Latin, became increasingly more common in written documents. The Holy Cross Sermons (ca. early 14th century) constitute possibly the oldest extant Polish prose manuscript.

A heathen hof or Germanic pagan temple was a temple building of Germanic religion; a few have also been built for use in modern heathenry. The term hof is taken from Old Norse. Background Etymologically, the Old Norse word hof is the same as the Afrikaans, Dutch and German word hof, which originally meant a hall and later came to refer to a court (originally in the meaning of a royal or aristocratic court) and then also to a farm. In medieval Scandinavian sources, it occurs once as a hall, in the Eddic poem Hymiskvi√∞a, and beginning in the fourteenth century, in the \\"court\\" meaning. Otherwise, it occurs only as a word for a temple.\\"Hof\\", Richard Cleasby and Gu√∞brandur Vigf√∫sson, An Icelandic-English Dictionary, 2nd ed. with supplement by William A. Craigie, Oxford: Clarendon- Oxford University, 1957, repr. 1975, , pp. 277‚Äì78. Hof also occasionally occurs with the meaning \\"temple\\" in Old High German.Jacob Grimm tr. James Steven Stallybrass, Teutonic Mythology, London: Bell, 1883, repr. New York: Dover, 1966, 2004, , p. 1308. In Scandinavia during the Viking Age, it appears to have displaced older terms for a sacred place, v√©, h√∂rgr, lundr, vangr, and vin, particularly in the West Norse linguistic area, namely Norway and Iceland. It is the dominant word for a temple in the Icelandic sagas, but is rare in skaldic poetry.E.O.G. Turville-Petre, Myth and Religion of the North: The Religion of Ancient Scandinavia, London: Weidenfeld, 1964, , pp. 237, 243, 240. Many places in Scandinavia, but especially in West Norse regions,Terry Gunnell, \\"Hof, Halls, Go√∞ar and Dwarves: An Examination of the Ritual Space in the Pagan Icelandic Hall,\\" Cosmos 17 (2001) 3-36, p. 26, note 8 counts over 80 simple Hof placenames in Iceland and 23 in Norway, in addition to those where the word is combined. are named hof or hov, either alone or in combination. These include: * Hov on Su√∞uroy, Faroe Islands * Hof in Vestfold, Norway * Hof, a village in Iceland * , part of B√•stad Municipality in Scania, Sweden Some placenames, often names of farms, combine the word, such as: * Several places in Iceland named Hofsta√∞ir, one the site of a hof excavation. * Hofs√≥s, village in Iceland. * Norderhov, a former municipality in Norway - dedicated to Nj√∂r√∞r. * Torshov, a neighborhood in Oslo and Thors√∏, a farm in Torsnes, Norway - dedicated to Thor.

Changing scholarly views The nature of Germanic places of worship has long been a subject of scholarly debate. Tacitus famously wrote in Germania: > The Germans do not think it in keeping with the divine majesty to confine > gods within walls or to portray them in the likeness of any human > countenance. Their holy places are woods and groves, and they apply the > names of deities to that hidden presence which is seen only by the eye of > reverence.Tacitus, Germania ch. 9 in The Agricola and the Germania, tr. H. > Mattingly, Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1948, rev. S. A. Handford 1970, , p. 109. There are in fact several sites in the historical period at which heathen rites apparently took place in the open, including Hove in Tr√∏ndelag, Norway, where offerings were apparently brought to images of the gods on a row of ten posts, but no trace of buildings was found.Nora Berend, Christianization and the Rise of Christian Monarchy: Scandinavia, Central Europe and Rus' c. 900-1200, Cambridge University Press, 2007, , p. 124.Gunnell, p. 5, points out that outdoor offerings in bogs fall off sharply during the Migration Age, in the 5th and 6th centuries, coinciding with the rise of the institution of the chieftain's hall. Yet Tacitus himself wrote of an image of Nerthus.Tacitus, Germania ch. 40, pp. 134-35. And in his Annals he refers to a temple of Tanfana.Tacitus, The Annals & the Histories, tr. Alfred John Church and William Jackson Brodribb, ed. Moses Hadas, New York: Modern Library, 2003, , Annals Book 1, chapter 51, p. 30. Most older scholars considered that a hof would be a dedicated temple: an independent sacred place, built specifically for ritual proceedings, comparable to a Christian church. By extension, it was also commonly believed that the hofs had been located on the same sites as the churches that had superseded them. This was the dominant theory until in 1966 the Danish archeologist Olaf Olsen published the results of a comprehensive study of archeological investigations in Iceland and Sweden and of a large number of the oldest Danish churches. He was not able to confirm a single case of a heathen hof underlying a Christian church, and concluded in light of this that a hof could not have been an independent building. Particularly in reference to the Hofsta√∞ir building in Iceland (see below), he suggested the model of the temple-farm: that rather than being dedicated exclusively to religious use, the hofs were also dwellings, and that the word hof referred to the great farm in a rural settlement, at which the most powerful man also held sacrifices (bl√≥tar) and feasts.Olaf Olsen, H√∏rg, Hov og Kirke: Historiske og Ark√¶ologiske Vikingetidsstudier, Copenhagen: Gad, 1966, , English summary p. 285: \\"[I] suggest that the building of the pagan hof in Iceland was in fact identical with the veizlusk√°li [feasthall] of the large farm: a building in everyday use which on special occasions became the setting for the ritual gatherings of a large number of people.\\"Hilda Roderick Ellis Davidson, Myths and Symbols in Pagan Europe: Early Scandinavian and Celtic Religions, Manchester University Press, 1988, , p. 32 (referring specifically to Hofsta√∞ir): \\"the hall of a farmhouse used for communal religious feasts, perhaps that of the go√∞i or leading man of the district who would preside over such gatherings.\\" However, new archeological discoveries in the late 20th century revealed several buildings in various parts of Scandinavia that do appear to have functioned purely as cult sites. Some of them, for example the hall at Tiss√∏, Denmark, were associated with the aristocracy, but others, for example Upp√•kra in Scania (formerly in Denmark, now in Sweden) functioned as places of assembly for the local population. The temple found in England, at Yeavering, now appears to be an early example of a hall-associated hof, rather than an anomaly. Gro Steinsland, a historian of Norse paganism, is of the opinion that in effect it was economic resources as much as local tradition that led to the development of dedicated hofs: in the richest areas, actual temples developed, while in poor areas, the spaces that people had were what they used for bl√≥t. Hofs in the written record =Iceland and Norway= Sagas of the Icelanders Chapter 2 of Kjalnesinga saga contains an extended description of Thorgrim Helgason's temple at Hof: > He had a large temple built in his hayfield, a hundred feet long and sixty > wide. Everybody had to pay a temple fee. Thor was the god most honoured > there. It was rounded on the inside, like a vault, and there were windows > and wall-hangings everywhere. The image of Thor stood in the center, with > other gods on both sides. In front of them was an altar made with great > skill and covered with iron on the top. On this there was to be a fire which > would never go out‚Äîthey called it sacred fire. On the altar was to lie a > great armband, made of silver. The temple godi was to wear it on his arm at > all gatherings, and everyone was to swear oaths on it whenever a suit was > brought. A great copper bowl was to stand on the altar, and into it was to > go all the blood which came from animals or men given to Thor. They called > this sacrificial blood [hlaut] and the sacrificial blood bowl [hlautbolli]. > This blood was to be sprinkled over men and animals, and the animals that > were given in sacrifice were to be used for feasting when sacrificial > banquets were held.

John Porter, The > Complete Sagas of Icelanders, ed. Vi√∞ar Hreinsson et al., Reykjav√≠k: Leifur > Eir√≠ksson, 1997, , Volume 3, p. 307. There is a similar passage in Eyrbyggja saga about Thorolf Mostrarskegg's temple at Hofsta√∞ir, which gives more information about the layout of the hof: > There he had a temple built, and it was a sizeable building, with a door on > the side-wall near the gable. The high-seat pillars were placed inside the > door, and nails, that were called holy nails [reginnaglar], were driven into > them. Beyond that point, the temple was a sanctuary.

Jan de Vries considered the 100 by 60 foot dimensions and the eternal flame exaggerated; the human sacrifices in a pool by the door, not so much.Jan de Vries, Altgermanische Religionsgeschichte Volume 1 Einleitung.

Several sagas, including Kjalnesinga saga, also mention hofs being surrounded by a fence.A sk√≠√∞gar√∞r or stafgar√∞r; de Vries, pp. 383-84. =Sweden= Gamla Uppsala A woodcut depicting the Temple at Uppsala as described by Adam of Bremen, including the golden chain around the temple, the well and the tree, from Olaus Magnus' Historia de Gentibus Septentrionalibus (1555). The most famous heathen hof of the Viking Age is that at Gamla Uppsala (\\"Old Uppsala\\") in Sweden, which was described by Adam of Bremen around 1070, likely based on an eyewitness description by King Sweyn Estridsen: > That folk has a very famous temple called Uppsala . . . . In this temple, > entirely decked out in gold, the people worship the statues of three gods in > such wise that the mightiest of them, Thor, occupies a throne in the middle > of the chamber; Wotan and Frikko [presumably Freyr] have places on either > side. The significance of these gods is as follows: Thor, they say, presides > over the air, which governs the thunder and lightning, the winds and rains, > fair weather and crops. The other, Wotan‚Äîthat is, the Furious‚Äîcarries on war > and imparts to man strength against his enemies. The third is Frikko, who > bestows peace and pleasure on mortals. His likeness, too, they fashion with > an immense phallus. But Wotan they chisel armed, as our people are wont to > represent Mars. Thor with his scepter apparently resembles Jove . . . . For > all the gods there are appointed priests to offer sacrifices for the people. > If plague and famine threaten, a libation is poured to the idol Thor; if > war, to Wotan, if marriages are to be celebrated, to Frikko.Adam of Bremen, > History of the archbishops of Hamburg-Bremen, tr. Francis Joseph Tschan, > intro by Timothy Reuter, New York: Columbia, 2002, , pp. 207-08. A note or scholion appended to this passage adds the following description: > A golden chain goes round the temple. It hangs over the gable of the > building and sends its glitter far off to those who approach, because the > shrine stands on level ground with mountains all about it like a > theater.Adam of Bremen, p. 207, note b. Another scholion describes natural features near the hof: > Near this temple stands a very large tree with wide-spreading branches, > always green winter and summer. What kind it is nobody knows. There is also > a spring at which the pagans are accustomed to make their sacrifices, and > into it to plunge a live man. And if he is not found, the people's wish will > be granted.Adam of Bremen, p. 207, note a. Rather than a single tree, the passage that follows on the great sacrifices held every nine years at Uppsala speaks of a sacred grove adjoining the hof, of which each and every tree is sacred and in which the human and animal victims are hanged.Adam of Bremen, p. 208. Adam's presumed source, Sweyn Estridsen, was in service as a young man (from 1026 to 1038) with King Anund Jakob of Sweden, and therefore had the opportunity to personally see the hof at Uppsala. But we do not know how accurately Adam reports what he said. Accuracy concerning heathenry was not his objective in writing his history. =Anglo-Saxon England= Goodmanham In his Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum (Ecclesiastical History of the English People), Bede describes the conversion of King Edwin of Northumbria. His high-priest, Coifi, convinced that Christianity is a better way, volunteers to personally lead the destruction of the temple and its idols, which Bede says was located at Goodmanham, just east of York: > So he . . . asked the king to give him arms and a stallion‚Äîfor hitherto it > had not been lawful for the Chief Priest to carry arms or to ride anything > but a mare. . . . Girded with a sword and with a spear in his hand, he > mounted the king's stallion and rode up to the idols. . . . [W]ithout > hesitation, as soon as he reached the shrine, he cast into it the spear he > carried and thus profaned it. Then . . . he told his companions to set fire > to the shrine and its enclosures and destroy them. . . . Here it was that > the Chief Priest . . . desecrated and destroyed the altars that he had > himself dedicated.Bede, Ecclesiastical History of the English People, tr. > Leo Sherley-Price, rev. R.E. Latham, Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1955, rev. ed. > 1990, , pp. 130-31.  Archaeological record  =Denmark= Tiss√∏ In the 1990s, Danish archaeologists excavated a chieftain's residence on the outskirts of Tiss√∏ in West Zealand County. Among other finds, they uncovered the remains of a large longhouse or hall that was in use between the 6th and 11th centuries C.E. It was apparent from the postholes that the roof had been supported by a few very strong columns and that the building had been tall, possibly two-story. It contained a large central room, where a large number of animal bones, fragments of Frankish glass beakers, and a piece of a string instrument were found.Hvad foregik der i stormandens hal?, Stormandssl√¶gten ved Tiss√∏, National Museum of Denmark. Retrieved April 24, 2010 (Danish). These finds indicate with a high degree of likelihood that the hall was used for ceremonial feasts. In addition, large numbers of offered items were found in the area, among others a huge gold ring, amulets with mythological motifs, and animal bones. These finds all suggest that the entire complex was an important religious center.Charlotte Fabech, \\"Centrality in Old Norse mental landscapes: A dialogue between arranged and natural place?\\" in Anders Andr√©n, Kristin Jennbert, Catharina Raudvere, eds., Old Norse Religion in Long-Term Perspectives: Origins, Changes, and Interactions: an international conference in Lund, Sweden, June 3‚Äì7, 2004, Lund: Nordic Academic Press, 2006, , pp. 26-32, p. 27. Other finds in the area, for example weapons and jewelry, show that the site was associated with the highest strata of society, possibly with the royal family. The entire complex, which also included workshops and a marketplace, may have functioned as a temporary residence for the king when he made periodic visits to that part of the kingdom. Investigations have shown that the complex was only in use for short periods. The king also functioned as a religious leader, and the hof was used for the feasts and bl√≥ts that were held when the king was at the location. Similar complexes of buildings are known from other places in southern Scandinavia, for example J√§rrestad in Scania,Lars Larsson suggests that J√§rrestad may be another hof site, based on multiple entrances and the discovery of a hammer-head and an iron socket axe in a posthole: \\"Ritual building and ritual space: Aspects of investigations at the Iron Age central site Upp√•kra, Scania, Sweden\\" in Andr√©n et al., Old Norse Religion in Long-Term Perspectives, pp. 248-53, p. 248. Lisbjerg in Jutland, and Tofteg√•rd on Zealand. These royal centers, called central places by archeologists, perhaps also constituted a parallel to the royal palaces of the Merovingian, Carolingian, and Holy Roman Emperors, such as Charlemagne's palace complex at Aachen. These also included religious buildings, marketplaces, and workshops that were primarily used when the peripatetic court was in residence.Hvem var stormanden p√• Tiss√∏-g√•rden?, Stormandssl√¶gten ved Tiss√∏, National Museum of Denmark. Retrieved April 24, 2010 (Danish) =Iceland= Hofsta√∞ir The name of the settlement of Hofsta√∞ir, near M√Ωvatn, and local tradition indicate it was the site of a hof.This is a tradition recorded in the 19th century and not the Erbyggja Saga account. Turville-Petre, p. 241, points out there are several places by that name in Iceland. The site was excavated by Daniel Bruun in 1908 and again by Olaf Olsen in 1965. Since 1991, the Icelandic Archeological Institute (Fornleifastofnun √çslands - FSI) has re-investigated it; since 2002, in an international investigation under the Landscape of Settlements program. The excavations have uncovered a large longhouse with a small separate room at the north end, 42 meters long overall and 8 meters wide in the main section. It had three small protruding sections, two near the south end and one on the opposite side.Gavin Lucas and Thomas McGovern, \\"Bloody Slaughter: Ritual Decapitation and Display at the Viking Settlement of Hofsta√∞ir, Iceland,\\" European Journal of Archaeology 10.1 (2007), 7-30, Fig. 2, p. 10; the diagram in De Vries, Fig. 10, p. 383, Turville-Petre, p. 242, and Olsen, Fig. 18, p. 183 is based on the initial excavation and shows only two of the annexes and one of the two entrances: the northwest annex was a second entrance opposite that in the northeast. There was a fireplace in the center and smaller fireplaces at both ends of the main room. Animal bones were found all around the inside of the walls in the main room, and a smaller number in the small room.De Vries, pp. 382-83. Various associated buildings have also been excavated. Olsen used Hofsta√∞ir as a particularly good example of the idea of the temple-farm. Despite its large size, in form the building is identical to other longhouses, the small room at the north end was a later addition, and the 1908 excavation had not fully revealed the entrances, annexes, and ancillary buildings. He considered it primarily a farmhouse and only incidentally a hof.Olsen, p. 193, English summary pp. 284-85.Ellis Davidson, p. 32: \\"[T]here was no indication that it was erected purely for religious purposes.\\" However, in addition to clarifying the relationship between the annexes and the main hall, the re-excavation revealed even more bone fragments, and analysis shows that at least 23 cattle had been sacrificial offerings. They were killed in an unusual manner, by a blow between the eyes, and their skulls displayed outside for years. The horns had not been removed and in age the animals ranged from just full-grown to middle-aged, both of these being unique in Icelandic farming at the time; also the majority appear to have been bulls, which is very surprising in a dairy economy. The dates of the skulls varied, with the last having been slaughtered around 1000 C.E., and one sheep skeleton was found that had been killed in the same manner as the cattle. The bone finds thus indicate the building did indeed serve as a hof.Lucas and McGovern, pp. 8, 10-14; see also Thomas H. McGovern, \\"Report of Cattle and Sheep Skulls Recovered from Hofsta√∞ir, M√Ωvatnssveit N Iceland\\", draft, North Atlantic Biocultural Organization (NABO) NORSEC Laboratory Report No. 5, July 14, 2002 (pdf). So do the surprisingly small size of the main hearth despite the great size of the building; the relatively few finds of valuable objects (and complete lack of weapons), and the location, which is convenient for travel and highly visible, but not good for a farmstead. Hence, the unusual evidence of frequent meat feasting does not simply indicate a particularly wealthy settlement, but a place of frequent ritual gatherings, probably in spring and summer.Lucas and McGovern, pp. 20-22. The unusual method of slaughter was deliberately dramatic and would have produced a fountain of blood.Lucas and McGovern, p. 23. The skulls were found among roof and wall debris, all but one grouped in two places at the south end of the hall: inside the southeast annex and between the southwestern annex and the wall of the main building; it seems plausible that they were on display when the building was in use and that where they were found was storage, whether normal winter storage or concealment after conversion to Christianity caused the abandonment of the building in the mid-eleventh century. The goat sacrifice can be interpreted as a termination ritual.Lucas and McGovern, pp. 16, 24-25. Olsen also regarded as highly significant that only 9 meters from the south door of the building was an oval pit containing ash, charcoal, fragments of animal bone, and sooty stones. He pointed out that Icelandic farms usually disposed of their refuse down a slope, and interpreted this as a very large baking pit.Olsen, pp. 189-93, English summary p. 284. S√¶b√≥l and other reputed square hof sites A number of square ruins in Iceland, above all one at S√¶b√≥l, were interpreted as the remains of hofs, but Olsen demonstrated that they are identical in form and scale with horse stalls still in use in Iceland. He ascribed the hof legends attached to them to romantic nationalism and pointed out that many were called medieval chapels (b√¶nh√∫s) at the beginning of the 19th century and had transformed into ruined hofs by the end of that century.Olsen, pp. 158-65, English summary pp. 283-84; plan and drawing of a square horse stall, Figs. 12, 13, pp. 164-65. The square ruins were given special attention because of the idea that the hof at Gamla Uppsala had been square. =Sweden= Upp√•kra Hof at Upp√•kra. Top: interior as reconstructed by Foteviken Museum; bottom: plan of excavation, showing locations of wall trenches (pink), central columns (brown), hearth (red), and beaker and glass bowl (green). By Sven Rosborn. In 2000‚Äì2004, excavations in Upp√•kra, south of Lund in Scania, revealed that a heathen hof was located there for several hundred years.Kulthuset , Upp√•kra - en forntida centralort, 2007. Retrieved April 21, 2010 (Swedish). Since it was possible to excavate the entire site and since it had not been disturbed, this excavation afforded the first opportunity for a purely archeological study of a heathen hof in its entirety. The remains of the building consist of holes and trenches for the placement of the pillars and walls that once stood there. Various floor levels were discernible, and it was possible to determine that the hof was initially erected in the 3rd century C.E. on the site of an unusually large longhouse, and then rebuilt six times without appreciable changes, the last version of the building dating to the early Viking Age.Lars Larsson, \\"The Iron Age ritual building at Upp√•kra, southern Sweden,\\" Antiquity 81 (2007), 11-25, pp. 14-15. The building material was in all cases wood, which was also sunk into the ground. The building was not large, only 13 meters long and 6.5 meters wide. The walls on the long sides were made of slightly convex, rough-cut oak posts or \\"staves,\\" which were sunk into a trench in the earth more than one meter deep. At each corner of the building stood a pillar or corner-post. The central part of the building, which stood free of the outer walls, was formed by four gigantic wooden columns. The holes for these and for the corner-posts are unusually wide and more than two meters deep, and stone packing found in three of the center holes indicates columns at least 0.7 meters in diameter. The building had three entrances, two in the south and one in the north. Each opening had hefty posts on either side, and the southwestern had a projecting section in addition.Larsson, p. 13. That must therefore have been the main entrance of the hof. This has been interpreted as the men's entrance, the entrance on the north side as the women's entrance, and the southeastern entrance as for the priest, on the model of stone churches.Upp√•kra - Hednatemplet i Upp√•kra, Bengans historiasidor, May 23, 2008. Retrieved April 20, 2010. Two large iron door rings were found, one in the fill around a post, the other about 10 meters from the building.Larsson, p. 17. The hof is near the center of the settlement and there are at least four burial mounds to the west and north of it, probably dating to the early Bronze Age or the early Iron Age.Larsson, p. 21. Lunda At Lunda farm in S√∂dermanland,According to Larsson, p. 22, in Nyk√∂ping Municipality; according to Gunnar Andersson, \\"Among trees, bones and stones: The sacred grove at Lunda\\" in Andr√©n et al., Old Norse Religion in Long-Term Perspectives, pp. 195-99, p. 195, just outside Str√§ngn√§s. excavation revealed a small building parallel to the north side of a longhouse, with three phallic figurines inside, one solid gold, the other two cast in bronze and gilded.Andersson, p. 195. This is thought to have been a hof associated with the longhouse residence.Larsson, p. 22. In addition, a nearby hillside appears to have been a sacred grove: numerous settings of crushed stone and fire sites were found all over it, and evenly distributed on, under, and around them, large amounts of burned and crushed bone, burned and crushed clay fragments, and resin drops, and smaller numbers of beads and blades such as knives and arrowheads. The bone fragments were very worn, indicating they had been left exposed or possibly ground, and the very few that could be identified were from pigs and either sheep or goats.Andersson, pp. 195-97. Borg At Borg in Norrk√∂ping Municipality, √ñsterg√∂tland, a small building was excavated that had two rooms on either side of a central hallway. There was a stone foundation interpreted as a h√∂rgr at the far end of the hallway from the entrance. Two amulet rings were found near this and 98 amulet rings and 75 kg of unburned animal bones, including numerous skulls and jawbones, were found in the paved area in front of the entrance, suggesting the building had been used for ritual feasts.See also Ann-Lili Nielsen's discussion of this site, \\"About a small building and animal bones from the late Iron Age\\" in Andr√©n et al., Old Norse Religion in Long-Term Perspectives, pp. 243-47, in which she adds the detail (p. 244) that the building had been built on sills. However, she terms the building a harg (h√∂rgr) and the stone foundation a stalli and assumes it was the base for display of god-images. In the eleventh century the building and its yard had been covered with a thick layer of gravel and a church erected 100 m away. Gamla Uppsala In a 1926 excavation, Sune Lindqvist found at least three levels of previous occupation under and immediately to the north of the church at Gamla Uppsala. In the layer immediately underlying the church, dated to approximately 900 C.E.,De Vries, p. 381. he found post-holes that he interpreted as the remains of the great hof described by Adam of Bremen. He interpreted them as two concentric rectangles, the remains of an almost square building with a high roof. However, as Olsen demonstrated, the remains are too sparse to support this interpretation, which is in any case based on Carl Schuchhardt's reconstruction of the Wendish temple at Arkona, a later and non- Germanic site. Moreover, Schuchhardt's excavation was rushed and his own data do not certainly support the square plan that he later claimed to have found at two other Baltic sites.Olsen, pp. 127-42, English summary pp. 282-83. Side- by-side drawings by Holger Schmidt of eight interpretations of the Uppsala temple, all but one resembling stave churches in style, are Olsen's Fig. 5, p. 133 and have been reproduced elsewhere. Olsen reproduces the post-holes alone in Fig. 6, p. 141. Further excavations at Gamla Uppsala in the 1990s uncovered remains of a large settlement and a very large hall near the church, which has been identified as a hall hof, either \\"a feasting hall in which pagan festivals took place at certain times\\" or, based on its lack of internal divisions, a ritual space based in overall form on the long house.Richard Bradley, Ritual and Domestic Life in Prehistoric Europe, London/New York: Routledge, 2005, , pp. 43‚Äì44, citing Neil S. Price, The Viking Way: Religion and War in Late Iron Age Scandinavia, Doctoral thesis, Aun 31, Uppsala: Department of Archaeology and Ancient History, 2002, , p. 61; Bradley's interpretation is the latter. =Norway= M√¶re Under the medieval stone church at M√¶re in Nord-Tr√∏ndelag, archeological investigation in the 1960s revealed remnants of a hof, the only one found under a Norwegian church. The building had been of post construction, and gullgubber were found in one post-hole.Berend, p. 124.Ellis Davidson, pp. 31-32.

The as yet unpublished site is identified as a 6th-7th century building that was part of a farm and apparently was never used as a residence, and so far has yielded 29 gullgubber, a half-dozen strike-a-lights, a scramasax dated to approximately 550 C.E., pearls, knives, and a ring-nail.Knut Reidar Andresen, \\"Gullfunn ved Mj√∏sa.\\", NRK February 6, 2009 (Norwegian). Retrieved May 12, 2010. Ranheim In 2011, remains of a site of heathen worship were found at Ranheim on the outskirts of Trondheim, consisting of a stone circle approximately 15 m in diameter and 1 m in height delineating an altar, a ceremonial way marked by standing stones, and a building about 5.3 x 4.5 m in size, consisting of 12 large pillars resting on stone bases and enclosing 4 pillars. The building is thought to have been a shelter for the god-images which were mounted on the inside pillars. The site dates to about 400 CE, during the Nordic Iron Age, and had been covered with earth to conceal it. Several human teeth, a partial skull, and two glass beads were found, but no gullgubber. The site was later bulldozed to make way for housing.Cato Guhnfeldt, \\"Fant hedensk helligdom uten sidestykke: N√• er ett av dem, i sin tid bevisst og omhyggelig skjult, gjenfunnet ‚Äì det f√∏rste av sitt slag i Norge\\", Aftenposten 23 December 2011 =Anglo-Saxon England= Yeavering The only heathen temple site yet found in England is at Yeavering, Northumberland,N.J. Higham, The Kingdom of Northumbria: AD 350‚Äì1100, Phoenix Mill, Gloucestershire/Dover, New Hampshire, Sutton, 1993, , p. 107. which seems to correspond to Bede's Ad Gefrin. Between 1952 and 1962, Brian Hope-Taylor directed an excavation of the site. This was a royal residence of the Anglo-Saxon kings of Northumbria, but Hope-Taylor emphasized that as implied by its Celtic name, its history began far back in the post- Romano-British past; the \\"Great Enclosure\\" on the eastern edge of the site, in his opinion, had most likely been created in the 4th or 5th century C.E., possibly earlier, and only one of the burials on the site could reasonably be claimed to be Anglo-Saxon rather than indigenous Celtic, and that mainly on grounds of the individual's unusual height. In his view the archeological evidence was \\"preponderantly Celtic.\\"Brian Hope-Taylor, Yeavering: An Anglo- British Centre of early Northumbria, Her Majesty's Stationery Office for the Department of the Environment, 1977, reprinted with corrections for English Heritage , 2009, , pp. 268, 270, 281. However, he also identified the buildings he found as the product of a \\"vigorous hybrid culture\\" and regarded the buildings with solid walls in foundation trenches as \\"Saxo-Frisian\\" halls constructed by native [Celtic] craftsmen; in construction they are very early examples of a technique later found widely in important buildings, including churches, in both Anglo-Saxon England and on the Continent, but at this time otherwise only found on Iona and near Yeavering, at Milfield, while in form they closely resemble buildings excavated west of the Weser.Hope-Taylor, pp. 267, 269, 273-74. Among these trench-built solid-walled buildings were three that lay some distance west of the great hall, with the amphitheatrical structure Hope-Taylor referred to as the assembly-structure lying between them: a pair of rectangular buildings placed end to end with what appears to have been a wattle fence between them, and an associated building that Hope- Taylor interpreted as a kitchen. These three were the only buildings on the site oriented north-south rather than east-west, and were constructed at the same time as or shortly before the assembly-structure. They were destroyed along with the Great Enclosure around 633, after which a church was built at the east end of the site.Hope-Taylor's buildings D1 and D2; pp. 95, 96, 159, 165, 268. Figs. 41 and 44, general plans of Area D, are missing in the pdf. Hope-Taylor interpreted D3 as the kitchen, Fig. 75 caption, p. 159. But the Past Perfect site maintained by Durham and Northumberland County Councils refers to D1, the northern one of the pair of buildings, as the kitchen, Yeavering Saxon Royal Palace: The temple and associated buildings. Retrieved April 26, 2010. On the Past Perfect site, a site plan based on Hope-Taylor is an interactive key to the Yeavering section. There is also a site plan on the Ad Gefrin page at the Gefrin Trust. Higham's plan, p. 107, identifies D3 as a butchery. The southern building of the pair Hope-Taylor was convinced was a temple.In the caption to Fig. 75, p. 159, he refers to D2 as \\"presumably a temple\\"; in the caption to Fig. 76, p. 160, as \\"temple-like.\\" No pottery or other indications of normal domestic use were found in this building. Nor were scattered animal bones. The building had been constructed in two stages: the second was constructed around the first (which was one of the few buildings on the site not to have been burned down), using carefully finished carpentry and heavy buttresses similar to those of the great hall. Inside the inner wall, the trench had been left open or opened up to form a pit approximately 6 feet long and more than 1 foot wide, which was full of animal bones; these had been deposited in at least 9 layers and stacked against the wall above the pit after space ran out, and there were half again as many as were found elsewhere on the site. They were mostly bones of oxen, with an extremely high proportion of skulls, and evidently had mostly been slaughtered as young calves, when their meat would be tender, rather than either shortly after birth when male calves would be surplus to dairy farming or after reaching full growth and being usable as draft animals.Hope-Taylor, pp. 97-8, 100; Appendix I, E.S. Higgs and M. Jarman, \\"Yeavering: Faunal Report,\\" pp. 327, 328-31. There were three non-structural postholes from which the posts had been removed before the building was burned and demolished.Hope-Taylor, p. 100. In addition, outside the northwest corner of the building there was a pit 4 feet in depth in which a post had been placed; nothing was found here except unusually clayey soil compared to the rest of the site, and crushed animal teeth, probably from sheep or goats; numerous thin, pointed stakes had been driven into the ground around this feature. And south of the pit, on the west side of the building, were traces of the successive erection of at least four temporary huts. A smaller, similar set of traces lay to the west of the screen between that building and the one to the north.Hope-Taylor, pp. 100, 102. South of the temple building was a rectangular enclosure that appeared to have been unroofed. There was no door out to this area from the building; both buildings had doors on their two long, east and west sides. Finally, of the graves in the western cemetery area of the site, the northernmost 16 were grouped around the temple building; but no burials lay to the east of the enclosure, suggesting that was where the gate was. All but one body, a child who was buried doubled-over, were buried with their heads to the west.Hope- Taylor, p. 102. Hope-Taylor considered the burials associated with free- standing posts beside the building and pointed out that although the form of burial‚Äîstretched out and without grave goods‚Äîwould have been acceptable to Christians, the dating and association with the un-Christian building mean that at least some of the burials must have occurred during heathen times.Hope-Taylor, p. 270. Stave churches View of Urnes stave church by Axel Lindahl, 1880s, with the ancient portal in the north wall Ancient portal of Urnes stave church (photograph by Nina Aldin Thune) The unusual medieval stave churches of Norway and Sweden were constructed using a later version of the upright stave technique seen at Yeavering and Upp√•kra, often have runic graffiti and very old-fashioned decorative carving, and the oldest, at Urnes, has preserved in one wall two ancient door panels featuring the motif of the gripping beast that were evidently felt to be too pagan to continue to be prominently displayed. Many have thought that hofs probably looked like the early stave churches.Turville-Petre, p. 243.Gerda Bo√´thius, Hallar, tempel och stavkyrkor: Studier till k√§nnedomen om √§ldre nordisk monumentalarkitektur, Volume 1: Den nordiska hallen, templet och stavkyrkan, Studier fr√•n Zornska institutet f√∂r nordisk och j√§mf√∂rande konsthistoria vid Stockholms h√∂gskola, Stockholm: Fritze, 1931, , (Swedish).De Vries, p. 384 (German). However, although excavations have found the remains of earlier palisade churches under many medieval Scandinavian churches, including two predecessors under the Urnes church, only under the church at M√¶re have traces of a heathen hof been found. In particular Olsen investigated the notion that the earliest Scandinavian churches were built over the hofs, and found it not substantiated. However, he did see no other source for the main stylistic characteristics of the stave-church ‚Äì \\"the striving for height, the raised central roof and the surrounding gallery at ground level\\" ‚Äì than indigenous Norwegian buildings, since the main influence on early Norwegian Christianity was Anglo-Saxon England, where stave churches were not built.Olsen, p. 221, English summary p. 285. But Olsen believed buildings like the first Urnes church would have been too small to accommodate heathen sacrifice and feasting, and no smaller hofs had yet been discovered, so he believed all hofs were longhouse temple-farms. One Anglo-Saxon church, however, arguably is a stave-church: that at Greensted in Essex. Also, some of the earliest Anglo- Saxon churches consisted only of wooden towers, to which naves were added only later in the Middle Ages,Ernest Arthur Fisher, An Introduction to Anglo-Saxon Architecture and Sculpture, London: Faber, 1959, , p. 58: \\"Some writers regard the turriform church as the original type of small English church as built by the timber-using Anglo-Saxons, especially in areas away from centres of ecclesiastical importance\\". for example at Earls Barton. These have sometimes been compared to stave churches, especially those with a central raised section,Hugh Braun, An Introduction to English Mediaeval Architecture, London: Faber, 1951, , p.225. and many of the stave churches have been elongated or made cruciform from an originally square plan. For example, the reconstructed √òye Stave Church is square, and the traces of the earlier church under Ringebu stave church show an almost square building.See Illustration 2, J√∏rgen H.

Ryan Randazzo and Yvonne Wingett Sanchez, The Arizona Republic azcentral.com February 2, 2016 = Attorney General investigation = As of 2015, the Arizona Attorney General's office began investigating a complaint that seeks to have Bitter Smith removed from the Arizona Corporation Commission due to conflict-of-interest issues. As chair of the commission, Bitter Smith is in charge of regulating the telecommunications industry. However, at the same time, she is working as a lobbyist for the industry. In addition to serving on the Arizona Corporation Commission, Bitter Smith runs her own public relations firm called Technical Solutions. In 2015, she served as a lobbyist for the Scottsdale National Golf Club. The golf club wanted a zoning change that would require the Arizona Public Service Company (APS). to move a half-built electrical substation. APS is regulated by the Arizona Corporation Commission. (Bitter Smith is the chair of the commission). In response to Bitter Smith representing the golf club while simultaneously serving as chair of the Arizona Corporation Commission, Arizona attorney Tom Ryan filed a complaint against her with the Arizona Attorney General's office. The complaint seeks to have her removed from the commission. During her lobbying efforts, Bitter Smith contacted residents in the neighborhood, along with the neighborhood's homeowner's association, near the electrical substation. A member of the homeowner's association told Arizona's NBC Channel 12 news: > She treated us like we were morons. In the Channel 12 TV story, reporter Brahm Resnik said: > This is a very serious allegation. A public official who is elected to > oversee APS is accused of clearing the way for an APS power station‚Äînot for > the public's benefit, but for the benefit of her paying client.

Citing his own real conflict of interest, Andy Tobin, Gov. Doug Ducey's nominee to replace Ms. Bitter Smith on the Commission, will not vote on certain utility issues, having admitted his son-in-law works for Solar City, an electric utility the Commission regulates. Recusals on electric utility issues before the Commission could very well result in deadlocked votes and null decisions. = Bitter Smith's lobbying firm = Bitter Smith and her husband own Technical Solutions.

In 1637 the Dutch West India Company detached 9 ships from the forces attacking the Portuguese in Brazil to send them against the Portuguese in Fort Elmina. They appointed Colonel Hans Coine to command the fleet which consisted of a total of 1,300 men. They landed on July 24 a short distance away from Cape Coast, and proceeded by canoe down the Sweet River towards the Portuguese fort, bringing 800 soldiers and three days worth of provisions.Universal History (1760), p.10 A hill named St. Jago dominated the fort which Coine determined needed be taken if they were to take the fort. However, 1,000 natives allied to the Portuguese were at the base of it, preventing the Dutch from seizing it. Coine sent four companies of Fusiliers after it, but they were annihilated. A second Dutch detachment that attacked the other side fared better, causing the natives to rout.Universal History (1760), p.10 The Portuguese and their native allies made two attempts to take back the position, but both failed. After the second failed attack, the Portuguese fell back into their redoubt at the summit of the hill.Ellis (1893), p.43. The redoubt was protected by a wooden wall on one side, and a river on the other. Coine decided to ford the river to allow a mortar and two cannon to fire upon the fort.Universal History (1760), p.11 After bombarding the fort for two more days, he demanded the surrender of the garrison. The Portuguese governor requested a three-day truce, but Coine refused as he only had provisions for one more day. He brought more of his forces to St. Jago and continued to bombard the fort. The bombardment was ineffective, and by the next morning Coine realized that he would either have to attack the fort that very day or abandon the attempt. He dispatched a group of Grenadiers up the hill, but before they could attack a chamade was sounded and two messengers were sent out by the Portuguese to negotiate a surrender.Ellis (1893), p.45. The surrender allowed the Governor, the Garrison, and all Portuguese citizens to leave, without swords or any other weapons, on a boat to the island of St. Thomas. The Dutch would be allowed take all that was left including gold, silver and slaves.Ellis (1893), p.45.

Action Today) was a public service program aired on DZMM. The program was formerly aired every weekdays from 11:00am-12:00nn with simulcast on The Filipino Channel worldwide. History On August 5, 1991, Aksyon Ngayon, the first ever program on AM radio devoted solely to public service was created. First anchored by Korina Sanchez and Ted Failon, Aksyon Ngayon immediately soared to the top of the ratings list. Because of the thousands of less-fortunate Kapamilyas flocking the station asking help from Aksyon Ngayon, the executives decided to create the DZMM Public Service Center, the first ever separate office exclusively created for public service by a local AM station. In order for the program to reach public service to Filipinos worldwide, it changed its title into Aksyon Ngayon: Global Patrol in 2008. In 2010, for the first time in Philippine radio history, the two stations DZBB and ABS-CBN's DZMM made a historical simulcast when they had two children asked for help to find the missing parents from Bohol on a rival program on DZMM Aksyon Ngayon but reunited through DZBB's program Aksyon Oro Mismo. On January 11, 2011, Julius Babao joined the anchor chair, replacing David Oro. His arrival made the program revert to its d√©but title, which is Aksyon Ngayon and move its timeslot from 1:30pm‚Äì2:30pm to 11:00am-12:00nn. In 2016, Kaye Dacer announced her resignation as anchor of Aksyon Ngayon due to her current political stand and conflict of interests. Her family owned a major controlling stake in 8TriMedia Broadcasting Network, which is a blocktimer of DZRJ 810 AM, leaving Julius to went solo on the final months of the program. On December 30, 2016, Aksyon Ngayon aired its final episode. On January 2, 2017, the show was replaced as ABS-CBN Lingkod Kapamilya sa DZMM and is hosted by Babao and Bernadette Sembrano. However, the Aksyon Ngayon name still continues as a segment of Lingkod Kapamilya as Aksyon Ngayon sa Lingkod Kapamilya. Format Action is what this Catholic Mass Media Awards (CMMA) and KBP Golden Dove Award Best Public Service/Affairs Program recipient gives to the problems and concerns of our less fortunate Kapamilyas through its Aksyon Ngayon Center that operates for eight hours, five days a week. During its broadcast, those in need of immediate government assistance can directly communicate with concerned agencies (like SSS, GSIS, LTO, and others) in person or via telephone. The program also links those who need help and donors while its on-air bulletin, \\"Panawagang Bayan,\\" airs people's concerns‚Äî from lost possessions to finding missing loved ones. Like other DZMM programs, Radyo Patrol reports can interrupt the program when a story breaks. Former anchors *Jake Maderazo *Emiliano R.

Finn (born Michael John Finn; 1889, Rathkeale, County Limerick - 30 March 1921, near Foynes, County Limerick) was a commander of multiple units in the IRA's Irish War of Independence in the early 20th century. He led many attacks on the Black and Tans and the heavily-armed RIC patrols, with his brigade usually armed only with shotguns. Training first with the scouting organisation Fianna √âireann and then being appointed a captain in the Irish Volunteers in 1914 when Ernest Blythe went to Limerick to organise there, Finn organised his west Limerick area, making contacts ranging from impoverished farmers in single-room cottages to the nationalist Anglo-Irish activist Mary Spring Rice, whose boat was at the disposal of his flying columns to cross the River Shannon. He and his flying columns made west Limerick untenable for the British. By spring 1917 he had 80 men in his brigade, and he continued to form companies in surrounding areas. In 1918 the area's Volunteers were organised into a battalion of the new Irish Republican Army, and Finn was soon appointed Brigade O/C. He brought the strength of the brigade up to 2,000 men. Volunteers from the brigade guarded ballot boxes to prevent interference by the RIC; they sheltered Dan Breen, Se√°n Treacy, S√©umas Robinson and Se√°n Hogan after the Soloheadbeg Ambush. They attacked RIC plainclothesmen guarding men buying cattle from boycotted farms. On 7 July 13, 1920, a mixed RIC and Black and Tan patrol was attacked by the IRA under the command of Finn, and RIC Constable Patrick Fahey was killed. Finn smuggled the British General Cuthbert Lucas, O/C of the British forces in the huge garrison of Fermoy, County Cork to the Shannon River while the British were searching Lucas. (After he handed Lucas over to the East Limerick IRA, the general either escaped or was released to Pallaskenry Barracks on 30 July 1920.) On 30 March 1921, Finn was killed in action during a three-hour engagement the Ballyhahill/Athea area near Foynes in Co Limerick when his flying column was attacked late at night by three lorry-loads of Black and Tans. Donnchadh √ì hAnnag√°in, O/C of the West Limerick Flying Column, wrote an account of the battle. In this battle Tom Howard (who was later killed at an ambush at Lakelly) shot dead a Black and Tan who was about to shoot the dying Finn. The attack was witnessed by James Collins, later a TD.

She is best known for her wreck in January 1800 in which all but one of her crew drowned. Capture Invincible General Bonaparte was a French privateer of 20 guns and 170 men under the command of Jean Pierre Lamothe and under the ownership of Salanche, Bordeaux. The frigate Boadicea captured her on 9 December 1798. She was sixteen days out of Bordeaux and reportedly had not made any captures. However, a privateer by the same name had taken and burned Friendship, Smith, master, which had been sailing from St Ube's to Falmouth.Lloyd's List, - accessed 19 December 2013. Boadicea sent Invincible Buonaparte, of \\"18 guns and 175 men\\" into Portsmouth.Lloyd's List. - accessed 19 December 2013. The prize arrived at Spithead on 18 December and in time the Admiralty decided to purchase her. The Admiralty renamed her Brazen and established her as an 18-gun sloop of war. Service Brazen was fitted for service in the Channel and Captain James Hanson, who had sailed with Captain George Vancouver (1791-4), commissioned her on 19 October 1799. Two weeks later, Captain Andrew Sproule, Commander of the Brighton Sea Fencibles wrote to Captain Henry Cromwell drawing attention to the presence of French privateers off the coast. A week later Admiral Milbanke told the Admiralty in London that \\"the Brazen Sloop sailed this morning under orders to cruise till further notice for the protection of the Trade and annoyance of the enemy between Beachy Head and Dunmose.\\" She sailed from Morwellham, a small inland Devon port, and on 25 January 1800, she captured a French vessel off the Isle of Wight that Hanson sent into Portsmouth with a 12-man prize crew. This left Brazen a little short-handed. Wreck Early in the morning on the next day, 26 January 1800, Brazen was wrecked under high cliffs west of Newhaven. Captain Sproule and 20 Sea Fencibles rushed to the site but arrived too late to rescue any of the crew, all but one of whom died. The sole survivor was Jeremiah Hill, a seaman from who had joined the crew of Brazen ten days before the wreck. Hill had been asleep below decks when the ship struck the cliffs on the night of 25 January. On waking he rushed to assist his crew mates, who were engaged in cutting away the main and mizzen masts to lighten the ship and avoid her beating against the rocks. Although they succeeded in cutting away the masts the force of the waves against the hull was too great and Brazen immediately heeled over onto her side. Hill, who could not swim, fell or jumped overboard and managed to grab a part of the main mast that was floating beside the hull. This kept him afloat until he was able to reach some broken timbers from one of Brazens gun carriages. He clutched these and slowly floated to shore.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 3, pp. 147-148. On the following morning, Brazens hull was visible about half a mile from shore. The tide was low and observers could see large numbers of her crew still clinging to the upturned hull. As the hours passed the ship's remains gradually disappeared, until by high tide the waves were \\"breaking nearly fifty feet up the cliff face\\" and it was evident there could be no further survivors. Sproule and his Sea Fencibles rescued what they could from Brazen, including the sternpost, two of her guns, and some timbers from the hull.Anon (1838), pp.65-6. As the bodies of the crew washed ashore the local citizens buried them in the churchyard of St Michael's in Newhaven. In all, they recovered some 95 bodies, out of a crew of about 105. Hanson's body, however, was never retrieved. Postscript Friends of Captain Hanson erected a monument in the form of an obelisk in the churchyard. The text commemorates Hanson, his officers (who are named), and the crew.Public Sculptures of Sussex In 1878 his widow, Louisa, restored the monument. She lived to the age of 103 and is believed to have been the longest recipient of a naval pension on record. The wrecking so shocked the people of Newhaven that they formed a committee to investigate how a similar disaster could be avoided. In May 1803, using funds partly raised locally and partly from Lloyd's of London, they acquired a rescue lifeboat of Henry Greathead's \\"Original\\" design. This was some twenty years before the formation of the Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI). See also *List of ships captured in the 19th century Citations References *Anon.

Watson (July 17, 1871 - January 11, 1948) was the first president of the American University in Cairo. His father was a member of the United Presbyterian Church Of North America African Mission. Watson grew up in Egypt and returned to the United States in 1889 to continue his education at Lawrenceville and then Princeton. He met his wife Maria Elizabeth Powell while attending Ohio State University.Lawrence R. Murphy, The American University in Cairo: 1919 - 1987, (Cairo: American University in Cairo Press, 1987), 2 In 1912, Watson went on a mission with the United Presbyterian Board of Missions, with the primary goal of identifying the possibility of establishing a Christian university in Egypt. He returned from the mission with the strong belief that there should be another Western institution for higher learning in Egypt.Murphy, 5-6 The institution was finally launched in 1919 after enough funding and suitable location could be guaranteed.Murphy, 16 He remained at the AUC until John Badeau succeeded him as president in 1945, although he was still heavily active in AUC activities until his death in 1948.Murphy, 108 Watson's Contribution to the AUC As the founding president, his service as president from 1919 to 1945 greatly shaped the way in which the AUC evolved. For instance, the fact that the AUC was originally tied to the United Presbyterian mission caused some issues throughout the history of the AUC. For instance, during the anti-missionary campaign of the 1930s, Egyptians launched frequent protests against Protestants who they believed to be trying to convert them. Watson was able to overcome these impediments by adopting a more conciliatory and compromising tone. Additionally, Watson led the AUC in a direction which placed less emphasis on religion. According to Heather J. Sharkey this also helped to cast the AUC in a more favorable light.Heather J. Sharkey, American Evangelicals in Egypt, (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2008), 159-67 Watson also was an avid fundraiser and adapted his techniques to target wealthy families who may have an interest in seeing the AUC succeed. By simultaneously creating less of a Christian focus and enhancing his fund-raising techniques, Watson was able to ensure that the university remained prominent despite the tough economic times of the 1930s.Murphy, 66-7 An oral history with Watson in which he discusses his time at AUC is available online.

She is a professor of architecture at Columbia University, also holding appointments in both its departments of history and art history. Besides \\"History Detectives\\", Dr. Wright's specialties are US architectural history and urban history from after the Civil War to the present. She also writes about the exchange across national boundaries of architectural styles, influences, and techniques, particularly examining the colonial and neo-colonial attributes of both modernism and historic preservation. Biography Gwendolyn Wright attended New York University, and in 1969 received a BA in history and art history. She did her graduate work at the University of California, Berkeley, and was awarded her M.Arch in 1974 and her PhD in Architecture in 1978. She published her first book in 1980. Wright was hired by Columbia University in 1983, two years later becoming the first female to gain tenure in its prestigious Graduate School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation. She succeeded founder Robert A. M. Stern as director of the Buell Center for the Study of American Architecture, serving in that capacity from 1988 to 1992. In 2002, she was hired by television producers to be part of what would ultimately become the new TV series \\"History Detectives\\". Back then the working title for the show was ‚ÄúAmerican Attic‚Äù, and the initial concept was to tell stories of history through a focus on houses, hence their interest in adding an experienced architectural historian like Wright. The concept has evolved into solving historical puzzles that use a wide variety of tangible objects to show how historians piece together various kinds of knowledge‚Äîand conflicting evidence and diverse perspectives‚Äîabout what happened, how and why. The show has become one of the most popular and successful programs on PBS. Wright has remained one of the five hosts in front of the camera from its initial broadcast season in 2003 to the present. In the show's publicity, she is held up as the team member most likely to suggest how to proceed when the rest are stymied. She has authored four books, edited two others, and written numerous articles, reviews, and essays. Gwendolyn Wright has been recognized for her achievements on numerous occasions, including a John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation Fellowship, 2004-5, a Fellowship in the Humanities from the Ford Foundation, 1979‚Äì80; a Nina Sutton Weeks Fellowship from the Stanford Humanities Center, 1982‚Äì83; a Fellowship from the University of Michigan Institute for the Humanities, 1991; a Getty Fellowship from the Getty Center for the History of Art and the Humanities, 1992‚Äì93; a Beverly Willis Architecture Foundation Fellowship, 2005-6; and a Graham Foundation Fellowship, 2006. She was elected a fellow in the Society of American Historians in 1985, honoring literary quality in historical writing. Wright is married to the historian Anson Rabinbach.

Seydoux studies Caenorhabditis elegans to examine how embryos choose between soma and germline. She was able to demonstrate that the synthesis of mRNA must be globally inhibited prior to the establishment of the germline.

The game features characters from Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha, Magic Knight Rayearth, Cardcaptor Sakura, Slayers, and Mah≈çjin Guru Guru. Gameplay MBA gameplay in the Vs mode Magical Battle Arena is primarily an arena third- person shooter where the players choose a character and try and defeat everyone else. The game offers the Story, VS, and Survival modes, the Network Play up to four players, and the Mission Mode, where specific requirements are needed in order to succeed in the mission, given the grade of how well one did. Each character has basic attacks (both ranged and melee), a defense power, and a sprint. In addition to each of these basic skills each character has their own special attacks, the effects of which differ greatly between characters. The battlefield where this takes place is in the airspace above a given map. Some places are naught but open area, whereas others may provide cover and obstructions, usually in the form of tall buildings or geological formations. The characters all share a common control scheme, including frequent use of 'charging' attacks. Plot The plot of the Story mode, like many fighting games, is mainly a framing device that serves mostly to explain how such a diverse number of characters would all be brought together. The basic, plot follows, though the specifics differ depending on which character has been chosen to play through, though all tell essentially the same story, if from different points of view. Every millennia, in order to maintain the cosmic balance of magic amongst the multiverse a tournament is held in order to find the greatest, most powerful mage. The participants in this tournament are all kidnapped from their world of origin and transported to a separate dimension. All are told they must fight and win in order to return home. Along the way one competitor the character comes across is their friend (and/or companion). They first must fight, and when the character succeeds in defeating them, they join forces. Once the character and their companion have faced and defeated all the other competitors, they face the apparent host of this tournament, and are told the truth of the fighting. In order to maintain the cosmic balance of magic among the multiverse, the strongest and most powerful mage must be made a teosu - sacrificed to run the \\"magical tuning system Kyrios\\". The last duty of a teosu is to select the next one, and the tournament was the most effective way of finding who would become the next. After these characters fight, it is decided that they will all work together to find an alternate solution to maintain the balance, though the plan is never clarified. =Characters= *From Cardcaptor Sakura: Sakura Kinomoto *From Magic Knight Rayearth: Hikaru, Umi, and Fuu (one character) *From Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha A's: Nanoha Takamachi; Fate Testarossa; Hayate Yagami; Vita *From Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha Strikers: Takamachi Nanoha StS; Fate T.

When appointed in 1990, his deputy governor was Obong Ufot Ekaette, who later became Secretary to the Government of the Federation. The Akwa Ibom Broadcasting Corporation was established by edict in April 1988. Wing Commander Nkanga officially commissioned the station on 27 July 1991. In May 2001, he was a member of the board of the Cooperative Development Bank. In 2002, he was said to seeking to be candidate for the Nigeria Democratic Party (NDP) in the 2003 elections for Governor of Akwa-Ibom State. In 2007, Nkanga was appointed Chairman of the Akwa Ibom Airport Implementation Committee. The International airport was opened on November 26, 2009 Although the primary focus was on cargo traffic and airplane maintenance repair and overhaul, the airport started by serving commercial local passenger flights. In December 2009, as an elder of the Ibibio people he was a strong supporter of Akwa-Ibom Governor Godswill Akpabio. In January 2010, he was a member of the South-South Elders and Leaders' Forum. Discussing the issue of handing over from the ailing President Umaru Yar'Adua to Vice-President Goodluck Jonathan, he said the issue was not a North-South one, but was about following the constitution.

Monogenƒìs may be used as an adjective. For example, monogenƒìs pais means only child, only legitimate child or special child. Monogenƒìs may also be used on its own as a noun. For example, o monogenƒìs means \\"the only one\\", or \\"the only legitimate child\\".Richard Murphy, Background To The Bible, Servant Publications, 1978. The word is used in Hebrews 11:17-19 to describe Isaac, the son of Abraham. However, Isaac was not the only-begotten son of Abraham, but was the chosen, having special virtue.http://www.scripture4all.org/OnlineInterlinear/NTpdf/heb11.pdf Thus Isaac was \\"the only legitimate child\\" of Abraham. That is, Isaac was the only son of Abraham that God acknowledged as the legitimate son of the covenant. It does not mean that Isaac was not literally \\"begotten\\" of Abraham, for he indeed was, but that he alone was acknowledged as the son that God had promised. The term is notable outside normal Greek usage in two special areas: in the cosmology of Plato and in the Gospel of John.

(Latin Vulgate) :*John 3:16 God lufede middan-eard swa √æ√¶t he sealde hys akennedan sune √æ√¶t nan ne for-wur√∞e √æe on hine ge-lef√∞. Ac habbe √æt eche lyf.

It is claimed that Arian arguments that used texts that refer to Christ as God's \\"only begotten Son\\" are based on a misunderstanding of the Greek word monogenƒìsWayne A. Grudem, Jeff Purswell Bible Doctrine: Essential Teachings of the Christian Faith 1999- Page 113 and that the Greek word does not mean \\"begotten\\" in the sense we beget children but means \\"having no peer, unique\\".Richard Abanes Today's Mormonism: Understanding Latter-Day Saints 2007 Page 191Edward L. Dalcour A definitive look at oneness theology: defending the tri-unity of God 2005 Alternatively in favour that the word monogenƒìs does carry some meaning related to begetting is the etymological origin mono- (only) + -genes (born, begotten).Kenneth L. Barker, Edwin H. Palmer The NIV: the making of a contemporary translation 1986 p121 The question is whether the etymological origin was still \\"live\\" as part of the meaning when the New Testament was written, or whether semantic shift has occurred. Limiting the semantic change of monogenes is that the normal word monos is still the default word in New Testament times, and that the terms co-exist in Greek, Latin and English: :Greek monos ‚Üí Latin unicus ‚Üí English \\"only\\" :Greek monogenes ‚Üí Latin unigenitus ‚Üí English \\"only-begotten\\" Also there is a question about how separate from the idea of -genes birth and begetting the cited uses of monogenes in the sense of \\"unique\\" truly are. For example, the ending -genes is arguably not redundant even in the sense of \\"only\\" as per when Clement of Rome (96 AD), and later Origen, Cyril and others, employ monogenes to describe the rebirth of the phoenix. At issue is whether Clement is merely stressing monos unique, or using monogenes to indicate unique in its method of rebirth, or possibly that there is only one single bird born and reborn. Likewise in Plato's Timaeus, the \\"only-begotten and created Heaven\\", is still unique in how it is begotten, in comparison to the begetting of animals and men, just as Earth and Heaven give birth to Ocean and Tethys. Of the Liddell Scott references for \\"unique\\" (monogenes being used purely as monos) that leaves only Parmenides, which (as above) is no longer considered a likely reading of the Greek text. Additionally the New Testament frame of reference for monogenes is established by uses of the main verb \\"beget\\", and readings of complementary verses, for example: :Heb. 1:5 \\"For unto which of the angels said he at any time, \\"Thou art my Son (uios mou ei su), this day have I begotten thee (ego semeron gegenneka se)\\"? And again, I will be to him a Father, and he shall be to me a Son?\\" (citing Ps.2:7, also cited Acts 13:33, Heb.5:5) :1 John 5:18 \\"We know that everyone who is begotten of God does not sin\\" or :1 John 5:18 \\"We know that the One who is begotten of God does not sin\\" Kittel TDNT B√ºchsel on ŒºŒøŒΩŒøŒ≥ŒµŒΩŒÆœÇ Op. cit. \\"It is not wholly clear whether ŒºŒøŒΩŒøŒ≥ŒµŒΩŒÆœÇ in Jn. denotes also the birth or begetting from God; it probably does, Jn. calls Jesus ·ΩÅ Œ≥ŒµŒΩŒΩŒ∑Œ∏Œµ·Ω∂œÇ ·ºêŒ∫ œÑŒø·ø¶ Œ∏ŒµŒø·ø¶, 1 Jn. 5:18. Though many will not accept this, he here understands the concept of sonship in terms of begetting. For him to be the Son of God is not just to be the recipient of God's love. It is to be begotten of God. This is true both of believers and also of Jesus. For this reason ŒºŒøŒΩŒøŒ≥ŒµŒΩŒÆœÇ probably includes also begetting by God. To be sure, Jn. does not lift the veil of mystery which lies over the eternal begetting. But this does not entitle us to assume that he had no awareness of it. Johannine preaching and doctrine is designed to awaken faith, 20:30 f., not to give full and systematic knowledge. Hence it does not have to dispel all mysteries.\\" =Uniqueness= This issue overlaps with, and is interrelated with, the question of begetting above. Interpretation of the uniqueness of monogenes in New Testament usage partly depends on understanding of Hellenistic Jewish ideas about inheritance. Philo stated: *On Abraham 194: \\"In the second place, after he [Abraham] had become the father of this [Isaac] his loved-and-only (agapetos kai monos) son, he, from the moment of his birth, cherished towards him all the genuine feelings of affection, which exceeds all modest love, and all the ties of friendship which have ever been celebrated in the world.\\" Philo On Abraham *On Sacrifice X.(43): \\"And he [Jacob] learnt all these things from Abraham his grandfather, who was the author of his own education, who gave to the all-wise Isaac all that he had, leaving none of his substance to bastards, or to the spurious reasonings of concubines, but he gives them small gifts, as being inconsiderable persons. For the possessions of which he is possessed, namely, the perfect virtues, belong only to the perfect and legitimate son;\\"Philo On Sacrifice In his 1894 translation of Philo Charles Duke Yonge rendered \\"loved-and-only son\\" (agapetos kai monos uios) as \\"only legitimate son\\", which is not unreasonable given Philo's parallel comments in On Sacrifice X.43. It also parallels Josephus' use (see above 20:20) for a legitimate son of the main royal wife. Likewise in the later Jewish Septuagint revisions: * Gen 22:2 of Aquila \\"take your son Isaac, your only-begotten (monogenes) son whom you love\\" * Gen 22:12 of Symmachus \\"now I know that you fear God, seeing you have not withheld your son, your only-begotten (monogenes) son, from me.‚Äù In contrast in Proverbs 4:3 Aquila, Symmachus and Theodotion all have monogenes of a mother's only-begotten son where legitimacy is not an issue. =Textual issues in John 1:18= In textual criticism, opinions are divided on whether Jesus is referred to as \\"only- begotten God\\" or \\"only-begotten Son\\", in John 1:18.Raymond E Brown Introduction to the New Testament Christology 1994 Page 179 According to the majority of modern scholars the external evidence favors monogen√™s theos as the original text. This reading exists primarily in the Alexandrian text- types. Textus Receptus, the manuscript tradition behind the KJV and many other Bibles, reads ho monogen√™s huios. This reading ranks second in terms of the number of manuscripts containing it, and has a wider distribution among text- types.The Apologists Bible Commentary on John 1:18 * monogenes theos P75, P66, Vaticanus, Sinaiticus etc. * o monogenes uios Alexandrinus, Textus Receptus, Peshitta etc. This textual issue is complicated by the scribal abbreviations of nomina sacra where \\"G-d\\" and \\"S-n\\" are abbreviated in the Greek manuscripts by ŒòŒ£ and Œ•Œ£ (theta-sigma vs upsilon-sigma) increasing the likelihood of scribal error.Allen Wikgren footnote in Metzger A Textual Commentary on The Greek New Testament United Bible Societies 2nd ed. p. 170.\\"It is doubtful that the author would have written monogenes theos which may be a primitive transcriptional error in the Alexandrian tradition Œòœπ/Œ•Œ£.

It has been described as a \\"genuinely timeless sketch, ingeniously satirising the British class system\\" and in 2005 was voted number 40 in Channel Four's \\"Britain's 50 Greatest Comedy Sketches\\". It was written by Marty Feldman and John Law, and features John Cleese, Ronnie Barker, and Ronnie Corbett. Synopsis Cleese, Barker, and Corbett in the sketch as broadcast in April 1966 Cleese, tall and patrician in appearance and demeanour, represents the upper class; Barker, of average height, the middle class, and Corbett, short in stature, the working class. Each in turn describes their social advantages and disadvantages, and contrasts them with their neighbours, an effect emphasised by the actors' relative heights as they look downwards or upwards to each other: It is this situation that gives Corbett the pay-off line; as the others describe their advantages in the form of \\"I get ... (e.g. a sense of superiority)\\", his character finally looks up at the others and says \\"I get a pain in the back of my neck.\\" Reception and influence The British Film Institute commented, \\"Its twinning of height and social position, combined with a minimal script, created a classic TV moment.\\" The sketch's influence has persisted to the present day, having been referred to in 21st-century discussions of politics, sociology, and even football. Spinoffs Ronnie Barker wrote scripts for three further \\"Three Classes\\" sketches featuring the same characters, comparing their family life, their leisure activities, and their work. A spinoff sketch was broadcast on the BBC Millennium programme, satirising three eras of English history. Stephen Fry represents Modern Man, Barker a miller from the Renaissance, and Corbett a weaver serf from the Middle Ages. The basic premise of the sketch is no different from the original. The sketch was incorporated into The Nearly Complete and Utter History of Everything. Cleese revisited the concept as well with two new partners in 2017 (as a Wealthy Man, a Newspaper Editor and an Average Joe) for a political PSA. Also, The Counselling Channel on Youtube in 2016 presented \\"I Know My Place\\" by Three Therapists, a sketch \\"inspired by\\" the 1966 original, featuring a psychiatrist, psychotherapist and counsellor.

Although described in a short textual passage, the tale has given rise to theological discussions and has been the subject of a number of artworks. Biblical narrative Bartolom√© Esteban Murillo, Liberation of St. Peter, 1665-1667 says that Peter was put into prison by King Herod, but the night before his trial an angel appeared to him, and told him to leave. Peter's chains fell off, and he followed the angel out of prison, thinking it was a vision (verse 9). The prison doors opened of their own accord, and the angel led Peter into the city. When the angel suddenly left him, Peter came to himself and returned to the house of Mary, the mother of John Mark. A servant girl called Rhoda came to answer the door, and when she heard Peter's voice she was so overjoyed that she rushed to tell the others, and forgot to open the door for Peter (verse 14). Eventually Peter is let in and describes \\"how the Lord had brought him out of prison\\" (verse 17). When his escape is discovered, Herod orders the guards put to death. Apostle Peter Released from Prison, Jacopo di Cione, 1370-1371 (Philadelphia Museum of Art) Theological significance F. F. Bruce argues that \\"direct divine intervention is strongly indicated\\" in this narrative. He contrasts the story of Peter to that of James, who was reported in verse 2 as having been executed by Herod, and notes that why \\"James should die while Peter should escape\\" is a \\"mystery of divine providence.\\"F. F. Bruce, Commentary on the Book of the Acts (Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1964), 251. James B. Jordan suggests that this incident is portrayed as being a type of resurrection for Peter. Noting that one of the major themes of the Book of Acts is that \\"Christ's servants follow in His footsteps,\\" Jordan argues that the events of the chapter \\"recapitulate the resurrection of Jesus.\\"James B. Jordan, The Resurrection of Peter and the Coming of the Kingdom, Biblical Horizons 34. Amy-Jill Levine and Marianne Blickenstaff, like Jordan, relate the disbelief of Rhoda's message to Luke 24:1‚Äì12, where most of the disciples refuse to believe the news of the resurrection brought by a group of women.Amy-Jill Levine and Marianne Blickenstaff , A Feminist Companion to the Acts of the Apostles, Continuum, 2004, , p. 103.

Veneration  Chapel Royal of St. Peter ad Vincula, the parish church of the Tower of London. A number of churches are named after \\"St Peter in Chains\\" (Latin St Peter ad Vincula, Italian San Pietro in Vincoli), including in Rome (which claims to house the very chains that fell from Peter's hands), in Pisa, in London, Bir≈ºebbuƒ°a (Malta), Tollard Royal (UK) and in Cincinnati. The relic of the Chains of St. Peter were kept in Jerusalem, where they were venerated by Christian pilgrims. In the fourth century, the Patriarch of Jerusalem, St. Juvenal, presented them to Eudocia, wife of Emperor Theodosius the Younger, and she took them to Constantinople. Later, Eudocia sent a portion of the chains to Rome with her daughter Licinia Eudoxia, the wife of Valentinian III. Licinia Eudoxia built the church of S. Petrus ad Vincula on the Esquiline Hill to house the relic. Also in Rome was the relic of the chains with which Peter was bound when he was imprisoned by Nero. These latter chains were placed in the same church as the chains from Jerusalem. Festivals The traditional festival of \\"St Peter in Chains\\" was on 1 August, and had the collect: > O God, who didst deliver thy holy Apostle Saint Peter from his bonds and > suffer him to depart unhurt: > vouchsafe, we pray thee; to deliver us from the bonds of our sins, and of > thy mercy preserve us from all evil.Liturgy for 1 August, www.breviary.net . It was included in the pre-1962 General Calendar of the Roman Rite (see the Tridentine Calendar, the General Roman Calendar as in 1954 and the General Roman Calendar of Pope Pius XII). Traditional Roman Catholics continue to celebrate the feast day of \\"St Peter's Chains\\" either as a Greater-Double or a Double Major feast. In the Orthodox Church this feast is celebrated on January 16.The Prologue of Ochrid, by St. Nikolaj Velimiroviƒá, January 16  Other references  Acts 12:7 is referred to in Charles Wesley's hymn And Can It Be:Blair Gilmer Meeks, Expecting the Unexpected: An Advent Devotional Guide (Upper Room Books, 2006), 38. > Long my imprisoned spirit lay, Fast bound in sin and nature's night; Thine > eye diffused a quickening ray; I woke, the dungeon flamed with light; My > chains fell off, my heart was free, I rose, went forth, and followed thee.

Early life  Robert Turnbull Macpherson was born on 27 February 1814 in Dalkeith, Scotland, outside the city of Edinburgh.Crawford 1999, p. 356. The date remains uncertain. Earlier references, for example Munsterberg 1986, often give Macpherson's birth as 1811 and either Inverness or Forfarshire. A family note gives 29 February 1816. Although family friend and author Margaret Oliphant described him as a close relative of Clan Macpherson chief Ewan Macpherson of Cluny and \\"the nearest male relative\\" of poet James Macpherson,Macpherson 1878, p. xiii his exact relations are ambiguous.Crawford 1999, pp. 356‚Äì357, suggests that Macpherson's father John may be the illegitimate son of James Macpherson. Nothing is known of Macpherson's childhood until his study in medicine at the University of Edinburgh between 1831 and 1835.Munsterberg 1986, p. 142 He apparently did not complete his medical studies, and subsequently studied art at the Royal Scottish Academy in Edinburgh, where he exhibited portraits between 1835 and 1839.Crawford 1999, p. 357 His only known surviving work from this period is Templar Knight at Roslin Chapel, an oil painting dated 1836.Nisbet 2010, p. 2. There remains some doubt as to whether this work, signed \\"R T McPHERSON\\", is authentic or was painted by the subject of this article. In 1840 he left Scotland for Rome, Italy.  Early career in Rome  During his initial years in Rome, Macpherson continued to practice as a painter. While records exist of several works between 1840 and 1845, only one is known to survive from Macpherson's time in Rome‚Äîa large oil painting of the Roman Campagna, dated 1842.Munsterberg 1986, p. 143. In addition to painting, he worked as an art dealer. His most notable acquisition was a large, dark panel which he purchased in 1846. After cleaning the piece, it was identified as The Entombment of Christ, an unfinished work by Michelangelo. Macpherson smuggled the painting out of Rome, and in 1868 sold it to the National Gallery in London for ¬£2000.Crawford 1999, pp. 379‚Äì383. In 1847, Macpherson met and fell in love with seventeen-year-old Louisa Gerardine (\\"Geddie\\") Bate, who had travelled from London to Rome in the company of her aunt, art historian Anna Jameson.Gerardine Macpherson would later write Memoirs of the life of Anna Jameson, a biography of Jameson. Macpherson and Bate continued the relationship after Bate's return to England, despite her parents' and aunt's objections, and were married in September 1849, in Ealing.Munsterberg 1986, pp. 145‚Äì146.

In the background on the left is the church of Santa Maria di Loreto, while on the right is the Column of Trajan. Forum of Trajan In 1851, having failed to achieve notice as a painter, Macpherson turned to the new art of photography, using albumin on glass negatives.Macpherson 1863, IntroductionCrawford 1999, pp. 359‚Äì360. By 1856 he had transitioned to collodio-albumin, allowing the easier transport of dry plates.Crawford 1999, p. 360. He typically used large-format negatives and long exposure times to attain exceptional detail of Roman architecture, monuments, ruins, landscapes, and sculptures.Munsterberg 1986, pp. 147‚Äì148. His work emphasised careful composition of scenes to capture three-dimensional architectural relationships on the two-dimensional photographic medium.Crawford 1999, p. 365-368. Macpherson emphasised the artistic aspects of his photography, stating in 1863 that \\"I remain a photographer to this day, without any feeling that by doing so I have abandoned art, or have in any way forfeited my claim to the title of artist.\\" By the early 1860s, Macpherson's photographic career was near its zenith, with exhibitions in Edinburgh and London.Crawford 1999, p. 362. His work received critical acclaim, with \\"subjects chosen with fine taste and the pictures executed with skill and delicacy.\\"The Athenaeum, p. xxxvii, 9 August 1862, 181, as cited in Munsterberg 1986, p. 150. Macpherson was the first photographer permitted to photograph inside the Vatican, and in 1863 published Vatican Sculptures, Selected and Arranged in the Order in which they are Found in the Galleries, a guide book to 125 Vatican sculptures featuring woodcut illustrations carved by his wife from his photographs.Crawford 1999, p. 364. Although resident in Rome, Macpherson remained an active member of the Photographic Society of Scotland. However, The Scotsman newspaper noted in his obituary that he was \\"the father of photography in the Eternal City [Rome].\\"  Later life  By the late 1860s Macpherson's fortunes were in decline. His health had deteriorated due to malaria, and the increasing political instability in Rome reduced the stream of British tourists that made up much of his customer base.Crawford 2008, p. 35. At the same time, technical advances in photography moved the medium from the realm of artists to that of a commodity.Crawford 1999, p. 395. Robert Macpherson died on 17 November 1872. His funeral was held at the artists' church Santa Maria del Popolo in Rome,Crawford 1999, p. 401. and he was buried at Campo VeranoCrawford 2008, p. 46. Freeman 1883, p. 231, gives the burial location San Lorenzo fuori le Mura, which is adjacent to Campo Verano. though his grave has since been lost.Crawford 2008, p. 44. He was survived by his wife Gerardine and children William (who appears in the Italian record as \\"Guglielmo\\"), Joseph (\\"Giuseppe\\"), Ada (\\"Aida\\"), and Francis or Frank (\\"Francesco\\"). Over the course of his photography career, Macpherson catalogued 1,019 photographs. Today, significant numbers may be found at George Eastman House, the J. Paul Getty Museum, the Courtauld Institute of Art, and the British School at Rome. Smaller collections are found worldwide.

The house and castle sit on the north bank of the Whiteadder Water, around north-east of Duns. The castle was the historical seat of the Lumsdaine family for over four centuries. The surviving remains are dated to the 16th century, although the site may have been occupied as far back as the 12th century. The remains include a keep or kitchen block, with a detached guard house to the west. The castle is protected as a Scheduled Ancient Monument. A popular Berwickshire rhyme refers to the medieval strengths of Blanerne and the nearby fortresses of Billie Castle, and Bonkyll Castle referring to their construction in the time of David I and their destruction following the Rough wooing: > Bunkle, Billie and Blanerne > Three castles strong as airn > Built when Davie was a Bairn > Theyll all gang doon, > Wi Scotland's Croon > An ilka ane shall be a cairn Blanerne House Blanerne House was constructed in the 18th century. Around 1830, plans for the house were prepared by the architect William Burn, although these may not have been carried out.

The three upper whorls are three eroded and nearly covered by incrustations, but apparently rather smooth. The penultimate whorl shows oblique wrinkles, crossed by 3 or 4 spiral rows of square granules. Towards the body whorl, about eight irregular tubercles make their appearance. These are also covered by the wrinkles and granules, below the tubercles. The last row of granules runs uninterrupted and is succeeded towards the keel by short plications, which have about the same direction as the wrinkles. Moreover, the upper surface of this whorl is covered by spiral lirae, only visible under a lens. The whorls are inflated at their upper part, concave at the lower portion and are then again broader, thus covering the sutures and even part of the subsequent whorls. The keel is very sharp, with short spines, about 1 to 7 in number, if seen from the base. These spines are compressed, and open in front. The base of the shell is flat, with 8 irregular lirae, with compressed scales. Towards the keel, a few undulating spiral striae appear. This sculpture is crossed by small radiating riblets. The aperture is rhomboidal, very oblique, with sharp edges and an internal nacreous layer, at some distance from the margin, with 10 lirae near this margin, and a groove corresponding to the keel.

Its color pattern is golden yellow or olive. The spire is low-conic and contains five whorls. These are scarcely convex above, and plicate at the sutures. The folds become fainter and frequently, bifurcating toward the periphery. The whorls are spirally lirate, the lirae below rather coarse, beaded, above finer, cutting the folds more or less into granules. The body whorl generally descends toward the aperture, and is compressed toward the periphery, which is subangular except in large specimens. The oblique aperture is rather small and is pearly white. The columellar callus is dilated over the umbilical region, and excavated there, and with an indistinct denticle near its base.G.W.

Description (Original description by R. Tate) The shell has a lenticular-conoid shape, about equally sloping above and below from the angular periphery. The 4¬Ω whorls are flat. The embryonic contains 1¬Ω whorls fimbriated at the suture. The umbilicus is minute. The upper surface of the body whorl shows a stout and a broad lira next to the suture, which is transversely crenulate-ridged. The periphery is bluntly angled by a slightly compressed convex keel, which is obsoletely crenulated. Between the keel and the sutural band are three granulose lirae about equidistant and equal-sized but the anterior one is close to the keel (in older specimens a small lira is interposed next the suture, and there is a tendency in the granules of the lirae to become somewhat confluent). The intervals between the lirae are smooth. The base has four granulose lirae. The umbilical region is bounded by a broad ridge, which is broken up into claviform tubercles obliquely disposed. The colour is greenish-brown in living specimens, flesh-coloured with rufous lirae and darker tinted at the suture and keel in beach examples. The interior of the aperture of living examples is greenish and of a pearly lustre.Transactions of the Royal Society of South Australia v.17 (1892‚Äì1893) Distribution This marine species is endemic to Australia and occurs off South Australia.

Description The size of the shell varies between 15 mm and 40 mm. Its color pattern is creamy yellow with radial dark purple flammules dorsally and ventrally, grading off on the anterior side to crimson and rose pink. The separate tubercles have dark color giving the effect of dots. The rather small shell has a conical shape. It shows long, spirally arranged peripheral spines on all five whorls (about equal to width of shoulder). The whorls are flat- sided. The early whorls show, on the upper surface, five beaded spirals, between which on the later whorls are intercalated one or more much smaller beaded or simple threads. These are crossed obliquely by small, sharp, imbricated lamellae, visible only under a lens. At the periphery the thin keel is produced into narrow, guttered spines with two or three radial threads on each. The body whorl carries 10 to 15 triangular spines. The base is elegantly flammulated with dark purple, sculptured like the upper side, having one strong nodulous and seven or eight smaller spirals and the same imbricate minor sculpture. The peripheral keel should have, when intact, about 20 spines. The shell lacks a sutural channel. The white columella has a very narrow basal, milk-white callus. The aperture is rounded. The outer lip leadis at the suture, which is laid on the prominent basal spiral before mentioned. The aperture is white except where the color markings show through the glaze. This species closely resembles Bolma guttata (A. Adams, 1863) but the spire is relatively shorter and has a less pronounced granular sculpture. The spines when perfect are about 4 mm. long.Smithsonian miscellaneous collections v. 50 (1908) (described as Astraea persica) Distribution This marine species occurs off the Philippines, Japan and Vietnam.

McNeill was recruited by Bill Carson 1984 out of St. Pauls for East Carolina University. He specialized in the 100 metres. McNeill made a name for himself in 1985 when he defeated Olympic gold medalist Carl Lewis in the semifinals of the 100-meter dash at the USA outdoor track and field championships. McNeill placed second in the final, outrunning both the world record holder and the NCAA champion. Later that summer he dropped the baton in a Pan American Games relay, but still managed to bring home three bronze medals from the National Sports Festival and the World University Games. His first gold medal of the summer came in June at the U.S. Olympic Festival in Durham. McNeill also picked up a bronze medal in the 100-meter dash. He won the gold medal in 4 x 100 metres relay at the 1987 World Championships, together with Lee McRae, Harvey Glance and Carl Lewis. His personal best time over 100 metres is 10.09 seconds, achieved on June 17, 1988 in Tampa when finishing 3rd in The Athletics Congress final. McNeill teamed with Carl Lewis, Harvey Glace and Lee McRae to win the 4X100 relay in the Pan American Games. McNeill was a member of the 1988 Olympic team that competed in Seoul, South Korea.

There has been little published on this species. Description This species has a green operculum. The size of the shell varies between 35 mm and 70 mm. The depressed, imperforate, solid shell has a heliciform shape. It is covered with a strong blackish cuticle, beneath which it is green. It is usually eroded at the apex and contains 4 to 5 whorls. The upper ones are spirally sulcate or carinate. The body whorl is large, flattened above, with incremental wrinkles and subobsolete spiral sulci. The large aperture is oblique, rounded, pearly white within. The outer lip is thin and black-edged. The arched columella has a pearly callus. The white umbilico-parietal area is excavated and concave. The common name \\"cat's eye\\" for the synonym Turbo smaragdus is a reference to the attractively colored operculum of this species, which looks somewhat like an eye, and which is sometimes used for decorative purposes. The operculum is flat inside with four whorls. The nucleusis more than one-third the distance across the face. The outside is deep green except on the side of increment which is white. It is very minutely remotely granose.G.W.

Description (Original description by W.H. Dall) The height of the shell attains 4 mm, its diameter 5 mm. The small, white shell has a depressed conic shape. it is polished, externally porcellanous, internally slightly nacreous. The globular nucleus is dextral. The spire contains 5 or more whorls. The radiating sculpture consists of occasional faint impressed incremental lines. The spiral sculpture consists of occasional microscopic striae, and a single strap-like band appressed to the suture. It bears numerous flattish squarish nodules or elevations, which coronate the whorls. The periphery is rounded. The base of the shell is rounded, depressed in the center, which is nearly filled with a mass of white callus having a very finely granular surface. The granular surface of the callus is common to the young of other species, and is lost in the adult. The ovate aperture has a simple, thin, oblique margin.Dall W. H. 1889.
