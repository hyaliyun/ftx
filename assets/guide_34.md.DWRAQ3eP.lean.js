The earlier Irish immigrants gradually assimilated into Montreal society. Irish people arrived in greater numbers as a result of the Great Irish Famine of 1845-49, and although these encountered considerable hostility, many people of Irish descent have continued to live in Montreal. Irish immigration to Canada The first Irish Canadians were settlers sent by France in the 17th century to colonize the Saint Lawrence Valley. Since that time, the Irish have always held a strong presence in Canadian society. Today there are approximately 5,000,000 Irish Canadians, making up about 15% of the population of Canada. New France and Montreal At the beginning of the eighteenth century there were around 100 Irish families living in New France. While they were not the majority, many of the families had little difficulty assimilating into French-Canadian society and culture. Many of these Irish families migrated to Montreal. Because of its geographic placement, downstream in the Saint Lawrence River, Montreal quickly became one of the biggest centres of trade in New France. Montreal, 1800-1847 By the beginning of the 19th century, commercial shipping between Canada, Britain and Ireland, caused a large wave of emigration to Canada beginning in 1815. Many of the Irish who landed in Montreal regarded Lower Canada as a stepping stone towards English speaking Upper Canada and the United States. By 1825, out of its total population of 25,000, Montreal had an Irish population of about 3,000 people, who lived mainly in the western area of the city. This Irish population was very involved in Montreal's political, social, religious, and journalist spheres. Catholics and Protestants began to associate with each other as Irish-Canadians, bonding over their common heritage, language, customs, and celebrations. While Protestants found it difficult to interact with French-Catholic Montreal, the Irish Catholics played an important bridging the gap between the groups. The relationship between the Irish and the French populations in Montreal during the 1830s was reasonably stable. It was with the Great Irish Famine that more than 250,000 Irish immigrants landed in Canada. With this large influx came great animosity directed towards the Irish in Montreal and throughout the rest of Quebec, Canada and the United States. Many Irish people nevertheless remained in Montreal, and today there are around 162,000 people in the city who declare their Irish heritage.

Due to differences in culture, historical contact between other regions, climate, vegetables and other ingredients, Nagoya cuisine has unique features. Although many dishes derived from local tradition, Nagoya cuisine has been inspired by foreign cuisines such as Italian cuisine, Taiwanese cuisine, Indian cuisine, and mainland Chinese cuisine. Nagoya cuisine is typically seasoned with mame miso or tamari, the type of soy sauce made mainly in the Ch≈´bu region. These condiments give strong taste to Nagoya cuisine. Nagoya k≈çchin is traditional ingredient of Nagoya cuisine. Shrimp is another specialty. Dishes inspired by foreign food, like various local spaghetti dishes and \\"Taiwanese\\" noodles has become an increasingly significant part of Nagoya cuisine. Local dishes include: * Tebasaki: chicken wings marinated in a sweet sauce with sesame seeds, basically a type of yakitori. * Kishimen: flat udon noodles with a slippery texture, dipped in a light soy sauce soup and a sliced leek or other flavouring added. It can be eaten cold or hot. * Red miso: various dishes that use red miso, such as miso katsu (pork cutlet with sweet miso sauce), miso nikomi udon (hard udon stewed in miso soup), miso oden (miso taste oden, a type of stew), and dote nabe (miso nabemono with meat and vegetables). * Ogura toast: Toast spread with ogura bean jam and butter that originated in Nagoya and is commonly served in Aichi prefecture caf√©s. * Hitsumabushi: rice dish with unagi in a lidded wooden container. This dish is enjoyed three ways; as unadon, with spice and as chazuke. * Nagoya k≈çchin: a special breed of free-range chicken that has been cross-bred between a Nagoya chicken and a cochin. The time until maturity is 2.5 times that of broiler chicken and its meat is juicy and tender, without a strong scent. ** Toriwasa: Sashimi made of Nagoya k≈çchin, from the flesh, liver, heart and gizzard. * Uir≈ç: rice dumpling made by mixing rice flour with sugar and then steaming the mixture. The name is said to have come from a Chinese medicine that resembled it in colour. It is assumed that the medicine was brought by Chinese medicine vendors to Japan before the 15th century. * Tenmusu: rice ball wrapped in nori with tempura at the centre. This dish originated in Tsu and became popular in Nagoya. * Moriguchi: pickles made of Moriguchi daikon. The radish, about one and a half metres long and two centimetres in diameter, is pickled in barrels of sake and other seasoning. The radish is so long that you have to pack them along the inner wall of the barrel, one on top of the other.

Regarding Oregon Hill, a New York Times critic said Howard Owen is \\"a writer we can't wait to hear again. . . .Owen knows his setting, his dialogue is spot-on, and his grasp of the down-and-dirty work of the police and news reporters lends authenticity to the narrative. This is Southern literature as expected, with a touch of noir and with a touch of Dennis Lehane's Mystic River.\\" Another writer in the New York Times Sunday Book Review said, \\"Owen has recruited his sick, sad and creatively crazy characters from a rough neighborhood cut off from the rest of the city when the expressway was built. If anyone is watching out for the forgotten citizens of Oregon Hill, it's Willie, who grew up there and speaks the local language, a crisp and colorful urban idiom we can't wait to hear again.\\" Littlejohn was nominated for the (American Booksellers Association) Abbey Award and the (Barnes & Noble) Discovery award for best new fiction. Littlejohn has sold more than 50,000 copies and has been printed in Japanese, French and Korean.

Her plays predominantly feature people of color, and often deal with heavier subject matters‚Äîsuch as morality, exploitation, and corruption. She explores themes of race, culture, and identity in her works, and constructs characters that develop unconventional relationships and overcome situations via unique escapist approaches. Hurst-Mendoza has worked with organizations such as Rising Circle Theater Collective, The Public Theater, WP Theater, the claque, Lookingglass Theatre Company, The Kupferberg Center, and The Classical Theatre of Harlem to develop her plays. Hurst-Mendoza dedicates her career to promoting and advocating for greater representation of artists of color and women in theater. In April 2017, she spoke on the Challenging Stigma Through the Arts and Technology panel as part of the Nasty Women Unite Fest. Education Hurst-Mendoza attended Marymount Manhattan College from 2005 to 2009 and graduated with a B.A. in Theatre Arts, with concentrations in playwriting and directing. During her time there, she received the 2009 Gold Key for Excellence in Theatre Arts (Writing for the Stage). From ages eight to eighteen, Hurst-Mendoza's background consisted mostly of acting and musical theater training. At the beginning of her career at Marymount Manhattan College, she was waitlisted for the musical theater program, and thus decided to enroll in the playwriting program instead. She cites the exact moment that she decided she did not want to act anymore as when she was waiting to attend her introduction to acting class, in which she was studying Spike Heels by Theresa Rebeck. While observing the other actors in the class perform a scene, Hurst-Mendoza recalls herself reconfiguring in her mind how the acting teacher had chosen to stage the play. It was then when she realized that she did not have as much of an interest in acting as she did in figuring out \\"how these people are getting to where they are getting and how it looks.\\" Career =WP Theater= WP Theater (Formerly known as Women's Project Theater), is the oldest and largest theater company in the United States that focuses on developing, promoting, and producing the works of female-identifying theatre artists throughout their careers. The company has been an avid advocate of Gender equality since its establishment in 1978, by visionary producer, Julia Miles. Miles was motivated by a desire to address and alleviate the severe under-representation of women in theatre. WP Theater has since cultivated a large, thriving community of female playwrights, directors, and producers in theatre and beyond. From 2014 to 2016, Hurst- Mendoza was a Lab Member at the WP Theater. This is a two-year residency for female-identifying playwrights, directors, and producers. During her residency, she served primarily as a playwright. =The Public Theater= The Public Theater is the sole theater in New York that produces a varied selection of pieces‚Äîfrom Shakespeare to contemporary and experimental‚Äîin equal measure. It has aimed to create theater for vast and diverse audience bases in New York City for almost 60 years. Their Emerging Writers Group is a component of The Public Writers Initiative. It is a long-term program that works to support playwrights at every stage of their careers, by providing guidance and resources. Writers are selected bi-annually to receive a two-year fellowship at The Public, along with a stipend. The program gives writers an opportunity to stage readings of their works, presented in the Spotlight Series at The Public. In December 2015, Hurst-Mendoza was selected to be a member of the 2017 Emerging Writers Group. =Rising Circle Theatre Collective= Based in New York City, Rising Circle Theater Collective is a theater collective that works exclusively to expand the range of narratives portrayed on the American stage by prioritizing the stories of people of color. They run four active programs, including INKtank, PlayRISE, The Refinery, and Spectrum Series, each of which provide artists of color and members of the theater community opportunities to create and develop their work as well as foster strong collaborations and networks. INKtank is an intensive twelve-week play development lab geared towards playwrights of color, through which Rising Circle provides structure and resources for playwrights to generate and develop fresh work every week. The program is a largely collaborative process and focuses on providing playwrights of color with a solid support system. PlayRISE is an annual reading series for the INKtank writers. It is an annual opportunity for the current year's INKtank writers to work with professional actors and directors to showcase staged readings of their new plays. Hurst- Mendoza plays, Veil‚Äôd: A Fairytale and Lilia, have each been staged twice through Rising Circle's PlayRISE and The Refinery programs. Since September 2011, Hurst-Mendoza has served as a Collective Member, and INKtank/PlayRISE Producer. She and Raquel Almazan are current co-facilitators of INKtank. =New Dramatists= In 2016, Hurst-Mendoza was selected for the 2016-2018 round of the Van Lier Playwriting Fellowship Program. The program is based in New York City, and lasts for a period of two-years. It aims to aid young, economically disadvantaged playwrights of color to hone and develop their skills and become bigger names in the professional theater community. Themes and influences When asked about the type of theatre that she finds exciting, Hurst-Mendoza responded, ‚Äúvariety excites me. I like seeing atypical stories told from various perspectives.‚Äù Much of her work today reflects this line of thinking, as her plays involve a variety of genres and themes. The only commonality that can be drawn from play-to-play is the often heavy subject- matters that she deals with, usually explored through idiosyncratic characters with complex, and sometimes problematic relationships. These subject-matters include sexual violence, religion, identity politics, Mass incarceration, sexism, and racism. Hurst-Mendoza attempts to engage with and confront such themes in her work that have become increasingly relevant in the socio- political discourse of 21st century United States. She has described the aesthetic of her plays and stage directions as being very visual, as she often has very specific visions of what pictures should be created in her mind. One of her favorite ways of positioning her actors are either on the floor or sitting down, or back-to-back. Hurst-Mendoza has expressed an admiration for many members of and contributors to the theatre community, including Migdalia Cruz, Katori Hall, Lynn Nottage, JoAnne Akalaitis, Deborah Warner, Naomi Iizuka, Anne Bogart, Nilo Cruz, Jules Feiffer, Jean-Paul Sartre, and Paula Vogel.

It discusses the participation of the German Wehrmacht in the Holocaust and other crimes against humanity during the course of the early stages of the German-Soviet War (1941‚Äì45). The book has received positive reviews for its thorough and convincing analysis of the complicity of the German armed forces in the crimes of the Nazi regime. One reviewer praised Beorn's work as (to date) \\"the most important to this crucial area of the Holocaust history, of military history, and of Germany history\\" in the English language. Themes Marching into Darkness examines the complicity of the German Wehrmacht in the crimes committed against Jews and other civilians in Belarus, from autumn 1941 to early in the subsequent winter. The author looks at several military formations and how they responded to orders to commit genocide and other crimes against humanity. Beorn finds that those who refused were only lightly punished (or not punished at all), debunking the claims of German veterans that they had to participate under threat of death. The author investigates how so-called anti-partisan warfare was connected to the Holocaust via its ideological targeting of \\"Jewish-Bolsheviks\\". Beorn concludes that, because anti-semitic sentiment was lower in Belarus compared to the territories of Army Group North and Army Group South Rear Areas, the army troops played a significantly larger role in direct persecution of Jews during the period that he studied. Beorn addresses other aspects of Wehrmacht crimes, such as murder of Soviet prisoners of war and support for Nazi Germany's starvation policy, the Hunger Plan. He examines what he calls \\"the progressive complicity\\" of the Wehrmacht, highlighting the main developments that led to the escalation of violence, such as the Mogilev conference in September 1941. Organised by the commander of the Army Group Centre Rear Area, it brought together the Army, the SS and the Order Police commanders for a so- called exchange of experiences, and marked a dramatic escalation of violence against the civilian population. Reception The historian Ben H. Shepherd comments in The English Historical Review that Beorn \\"has produced a highly impressive, engagingly written work that significantly advances the understanding of the dynamics that shaped the murderous anti-Semitic actions of Wehrmacht units down to the level of companies and battalions\\". Commenting on Beorn's research into Wehrmacht complicity in Nazi crimes in a 2015 review in The American Historical Review, historian Thomas K√ºhne calls the book, the \\"most convincing, the most complex, and in the English language certainly the most important to this crucial area of the Holocaust history, of military history, and of Germany history\\". He finds that the book will \\"serve as a model for similar studies\\". Historian Henning Pieper in German History also praises the book for its thorough analysis and concludes: A review in Omaha World-Herald suggests that the book \\"ought to be on the reading list of anyone interested in the German army or battles on the Eastern Front in World War II\\". Although the book is more scholarly than a popular history book, it should be accessible to the general reader. The reviewer finds that \\"one comes away from reading the book with a renewed appreciation for the importance of military ethics, leadership and following the laws of war\\".

These include photographic materials and motion picture.  Film supports  = Cellulose nitrate = Cellulose nitrate (circa 1889 - circa 1950) is the first of film supports. It can be found as roll film, motion picture film, and sheet film. It is difficult to determine the dates when all nitrate film was discontinued, however, Eastman Kodak last manufactured nitrate film in 1951. Cellulose nitrate is cellulose fibers modified with nitric acid to create a nitrocellulose solid. Cellulose nitrate is extremely flammable and capable of burning even in the absence of oxygen and underwater. It has been the cause of many fires and losses of motion picture films, photographic materials, and archival records. = Cellulose acetate = Cellulose acetate is also known as \\"safety\\" film and started to replace nitrate film in still photography in the 1920s. There are several types of acetate that were produced after 1925, which include diacetate (circa 1923-circa 1955), acetate propionate (1927-circa 1949), acetate butyrate (1936-present), and triacetate (circa 1950-present). The earliest, diacetate, was found to be inferior to nitrate because it had high shrinkage rates. Eastman Kodak then worked with mixed esters of cellulose to create acetate butyrate and acetate propionate, which were used for sheet film, X-rays, amateur roll film, and aerial maps, but they were still found to be inferior to nitrate by the motion picture industry. Triacetate was then produced and is still in production for roll film today. = Polyester = Polyester (1955 - present) started to replace acetate as a film support for many types of sheet film; however, due to its rigidity, it cannot be used as roll film. Polyester can also be identified as \\"safety\\" film. It is inherently more stable than both cellulose nitrate and cellulose acetate, because it is a synthetic polymer that is inert (chemically inactive). It shows exceptional chemical stability and physical performance. A polarization test can be used to identify polyester from cellulose acetate or nitrate. When viewed between cross-polarized filters, polyester will exhibit red and green interference colors, similar to a rainbow moir√© pattern. Nitrate and acetate films will not show these interference colors.  Film formats  = Motion picture = Perforated roll films create for sale or theatrical distribution typically found in 35 mm, but also 65 mm, 70 mm, and other gauges. Seen on reels, rolls, strips or frames. Can be nitrate, acetate, or polyester. = Small gauge motion picture = Found in short rolls and may be cut after processing into strips or single images. Includes 35 mm, still-camera negatives, 120 and 220 size roll films and slide (transparency) films. Can be nitrate, acetate, or polyester. = Still photo (roll) = Found in short rolls and may be cut after processing into strips or single images. Includes 35 mm, still-camera negatives, 120 and 220 size roll films and slide (transparency) films. Can be nitrate, acetate, or polyester. = Magnetic soundtrack = Roll film with a ferromagnetic coating. Seen on rolls or reels and a variety of gauges. Can be acetate or polyester. = Aerial = Sheets or roll film in sizes of 4x5, 8x10, and 10x10; can splice together single sheets into larger rolls. Can be nitrate, acetate, or polyester. = Microfilm = Roll film in 35mm and 16mm widths, and 105mm microfiche. Can be reels, rolls, cards, or sheets. Can be acetate or polyester. = Sheet = Single-sheets of film commonly found in sizes of 4x5, 5x7, and 8x10 inches. Also known as flat film. Can be nitrate, acetate, or polyester. = X-Ray = Large format sheet film, 8x10 or larger. Can be nitrate, acetate, or polyester.  Agents of deterioration  = Temperature and humidity = The deterioration of both cellulose nitrate and cellulose acetate negatives is highly dependent on temperature and relative humidity. Storing materials at room temperature or warmer, and with high humidity, will inevitably cause deterioration. Extreme fluctuations in temperature and relative humidity will rapidly increase the rate of deterioration. = Exposure to light = Permanent display of photographs is not recommended; most photographic materials are vulnerable in varying degrees to deterioration caused by light. Damage caused by light is cumulative and depends on the intensity, length of exposure, and the wavelength of the radiation. Visible light in blue part of the spectrum (400 to 500 nanometers), and ultraviolet (UV) radiation (300-to 400 nanometer region) are especially damaging. Sunlight and standard fluorescent light are both strong sources of UV. Color slides are particularly susceptible to fading when exposed to both visible and UV light. = Pollution = Air pollution attacks photographs in the form of oxidant gases, particulate matter, acidic and sulfiding gases, and environmental fumes. Oxidant gases are composed primarily of pollution created by burning fossil fuels such as coal and oil. This can cause photographic images to fade. Particulate matter, such as soot and ash particles from manufacturing processes, exists in abundance outdoors and can enter the library or archives through heating and cooling ducts, doors, and windows. Particulates, which may be greasy, abrasive, and chemically or biologically active, settle on shelves and on collection materials and create dust that is spread to other materials when they are handled. The by-products of combustion combined with moisture in the atmosphere pose another risk to photographic materials. These acids attack all components of photographs and cause silver images to fade and paper and board supports to discolor and become brittle. Environmental fumes can be especially damaging to photographic images even in small quantities. = Poor storage = Poor storage, such as lack of enclosures, can lead to deterioration through exposure to light and pollution. Additionally, materials that are not carefully and safely stored can rub against each other, causing scratching and abrasions. Storing film materials in basements, attics, or garages can cause rapid deterioration through extreme temperature and humidity fluctuations, but also through exposure to insects and rodents. Storing materials on the floor can also increase the risk of damage by water leaks, insects and rodents. = Poor handling and use = Film can be mishandled causing physical damage. Working at dirty workstations or using bad rollers for motion picture film can cause dirt, scratches, and abrasions. Tears can occur when the film is stressed during winding or projection, in addition to improper threading. Repeated use, including the repeated insertion and removal of film from sleeves can also cause scratches and abrasions. Ignorance, neglect, and carelessness account for a significant percentage of damage to photographs. = Improper chemical processing = Major silver deterioration occurs when photographs are not correctly processed and washed. Over time, residual fixer left in the photograph causes the image, binder, and support to turn yellow or brown and the silver image to fade. High temperature and humidity speed this process. Photographs that were not well fixed remain light sensitive and may darken when exposed to light.  Nitrate deterioration  Cellulose nitrate is chemically unstable; decay is irreversible and autocatalytic. When the film deteriorates, it turns yellow, brittle and sticky. The off-gassing of nitrate produces hazardous and corrosive products (nitrogen oxides form nitric acid) along with an acrid smell that cause fading of the silver image, decomposition of the gelatin binder, and the eventual destruction of the plastic support and image material. These products (nitric acid, nitric oxide and nitrogen dioxide) are destructive to other film-based negatives, and especially to photographic prints. Other artifacts, metals for instance, will be harmed by proximity to deteriorated nitrate material. Such gasses can cause skin, eye, and respiratory irritations. Allergic sensitivity has also been noted, as has dizziness and lightheadedness. A cellulose nitrate negative that has reached the later stages of deterioration; there is no image content remaining. = Types of deterioration =  Embrittlement  Caused by the loss of elasticity in the plastic film base over time. The film can snap or break under strain, and will no longer have flexibility.  Shrinkage  The loss of the original dimensionality of the film and is irreversible.  Distortion  Distortion is caused by uneven shrinkage across a film's dimension and starts to warp or curl. This can be due to the difference in shrinkage between the film and emulsion layers, or areas of the film that start to shrink more than other areas. Temporary distortion can be reversed, but permanent distortion cannot.  Gelatin and base decomposition  As the film is exposed to moisture, heat, and acids, nitrogen oxides are produced, which creates nitric acid. These promote silver corrosion and decompose the gelatin emulsion layer. The chemical reactions that occur cause further nitrate decay. Softness and stickiness occur and the image starts to fade away. This is irreversible.  Silver mirroring and fading (black and white)  When exposed to moisture in the environment and various pollutants, the image silver will corrode, creating a reflective metallic sheen on the emulsion side. Typically starts at the edges of the film. Poor quality enclosures and storage can hasten the process.  Redox blemishes  These small pink, orange or yellow spots can found in the image area and are often found in microfilm. These are created by local oxidation of metallic silver due to moisture and pollutants in the environment. Deterioration of a cellulose nitrate negative that has adhered to its enclosure and degenerating. = Levels of deterioration = Deterioration of nitrate film is often categorized in six stages, or levels: * Level 1: No deterioration * Level 2: The film turns yellow. The silver gelatin can begin to mirror * Level 3: The film becomes sticky and emits a strong noxious odor (nitric acid) * Level 4: The film becomes an amber color and the image starts to fade * Level 5: The film is soft, can adhere to adjacent film, enclosures and other materials * Level 6: The film degenerates into a brownish acid powder  Acetate deterioration  While considered \\"safety film\\" as it produces less hazards than nitrate, cellulose acetate still faces stability issues. The deterioration of acetate is autocatalytic just like nitrate: once the deterioration process starts, the degradation products induce further deterioration. If not properly cared for and preserved, cellulose acetate will become acidic, and face many of the same issues that nitrate faces. Deteriorated acetate can also emit a noticeable odor, and can cause the same skin, eye, and respiratory irritations as nitrate does, in addition to dizziness and lightheadedness. = Types of deterioration = AD strips used to monitor the level of acetic acid and negative degradation; testing the level of \\"vinegar syndrome\\"  Vinegar syndrome  Vinegar Syndrome is the release of acetic acid which produces a strong vinegary odor. AD strips are dye-coated paper strips that can detect and measure the severity of vinegar syndrome in film collections. The strips change color, shifting from a blue to green to level, based on the level of acidity found. If the AD strip level remains at blue, the film is in good condition and no deterioration is present. If the AD strip level turns yellow, the film condition is in critical condition, creating a possible handling hazard, and should be frozen immediately.  Embrittlement  Caused by the loss of elasticity in the plastic film base over time. The film can snap or break under strain, and will no longer have flexibility.  Anti-halation  The acetic acid that is released in cellulose acetate negatives can trigger the retrieval of the color dyes in the backing layer, known as the anti-halation layer, giving the negative a blue or pink appearance. This is irreversible.  Plasticizer exudation  Plasticizer additives that move to the surface of the film and form crystals or bubbles as the acetate film deteriorates. This is irreversible.  Shrinkage  The loss of the original dimensionality of the film and is irreversible.  Distortion  Distortion is caused by uneven shrinkage across a film's dimension and starts to warp or curl. This can be due to the difference in shrinkage between the film and emulsion layers, or areas of the film that start to shrink more than other areas. Temporary distortion can be reversed, but permanent distortion cannot.A cellulose acetate negative that is deteriorating; the gelatin layer is separating from the film support (channeling).  Channeling and delamination  As the film decays, acetic acid is released from the film support, which causes the gelatin layer to separate from the film support. This is a form of advanced acetate decay and can be accompanied by embrittlement and the exudation of plasticizers. While delamination is irreversible, skilled professionals can perform conservation treatments to save the image.  Dye fade (color)  Found in color films, dye fading reduces the overall density of the image resulting in loss of contrast and shifts in color balance. This is irreversible, however, digital restoration techniques can be used to approximate the original color balance and information.  Silver mirroring and fading (black and white)  When exposed to moisture in the environment and various pollutants, the image silver will corrode, creating a reflective metallic sheen on the emulsion side. Typically starts at the edges of the film. Poor quality enclosures and storage can hasten the process.  Redox blemishes  These small pink, orange or yellow spots can found in the image area and are often found in microfilm. These are created by local oxidation of metallic silver due to moisture and pollutants in the environment. = Levels of deterioration = Deterioration of cellulose acetate is often categorized into the following levels, or stages: * Level 1: No deterioration * Level 2: Negatives start to curl and anti-halation colors released * Level 3: The onset of vinegar syndrome (vinegar odor) as well as shrinkage and brittleness. * Level 4: Warping * Level 5: Formation of bubbles and crystals * Level 6: Formation of channeling  Polyester deterioration  Because polyester is an inert and stable plastic, it does not possess the same deterioration concerns as celluloid films. Polyester can be stored at room temperature and does not need cold storage for preservation. Polyester is also used as an archival enclosure option for materials, such as Mylar and Melinex brand products. = Types of deterioration =  Dye fade (color)  While polyester film is stable, the chromogenic dyes found in color negatives on polyester supports are not permanent and may fade rapidly at room temperature.  Preventive conservation strategies  Preventive conservation actions such as environmental monitoring, good storage, and promoting proper handling through staff and user education, will have a lasting, positive impact on the preservation of a collection. Data logger used to monitor temperature and relative humidity = Temperature and humidity controls = Keeping film cold and dry is ideal; however, a cool environment (40 to 60 degrees) is better than room temperature or higher as it will slow down the deterioration process. The best storage conditions for both black & white and color cellulose acetate film are cold (-15¬∞ to 4¬∞ C/ 5¬∞ to 39¬∞ F) and dry (30% to 40% relative humidity) environments for cellulose nitrate, cellulose acetate films in both color and black and white, and color on polyester supports. Black and white film on polyester supports may be stored at a temperature of 18¬∫ C (65¬∫ F) or lower and a relative humidity of 30% to 40%.An example of storage cabinets within a large walk-in freezer for cold storage of celluloid film. = Cold storage = Freezing film is the ideal temperature to preserve film for the long-term. At freezing temperatures, the natural decomposition of cellulose nitrate and acetate is slowed down. Cold storage is predicted to extend the life of acetate negatives by a factor of ten or more. Archival housing enclosures for film-based materials In August 2017, Paramount Pictures opened a state-of-the- art frozen vault, constructed by Pro-Tek Vaults, to house approximately 500,000 reels of film that Paramount has produced since the 1950s and store it at 29 degrees Fahrenheit, freezing the film to stop almost all image deterioration. = Storage control = Three layers of protection are recommended for the storage of film base photographic materials. Negatives and positives should be placed in sleeves or envelopes, which are then placed in a box or drawer, and these boxes or drawers on shelves or in a cabinet. Motion picture film and microfilm should be stored in unsealed containers in cabinets or on shelves. Labels such as acid-free, lignin-free, or buffered do not guarantee that a material is safe to use with photographic materials. Chemically inert papers may be harmful to the photographic image; the only way to be certain of the stability of the paper is to purchase materials that have passed the Photographic Activity Test (PAT). There are also considerations to be made regarding paper or plastic enclosures. Factors such as use, handling, and cost should be considered when selecting archival storage materials. There are several resources provided in the external links section below that can assist with the selection of proper storage materials for photographic materials. Film materials should be stored in interior rooms away from exterior walls and places that do not have extreme temperature fluctuations. Furthermore, film materials should not be stored near sources of heat (sunlight, radiators, heaters), water (bathrooms, sprinklers), or near chemical or exhaust fumes. Storage environments should be regularly monitored to check temperature and humidity controls, HVAC systems, and pest-free. Quantities of nitrate film in excess of 25 pounds are subject to storage and handling standards prescribed by the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA). Seriously deteriorated negatives of any type should be isolated from those in good condition. = Light control = Photographic materials should always be covered when not in use. Storing film-based materials in containers and boxes will keep light away from the materials. When exhibiting or using these materials, a low light level should be used. The installation of low-UV- emitting bulbs or UV-absorbing fluorescent bulb sleeves can help eliminate this problem. UV filtering window glazing or the installation of window shades may also help. Low- UV-emitting bulbs and sleeves are available from several manufacturers. Light levels in storage areas can also be controlled by the use of timed shut-off switches. Dark cloths or sheets of folder stock (heavyweight paper) or mat board should be available in reading rooms for covering objects when not in use by readers. = Pollution control = Air entering the storage area should be filtered and purified to remove particulate and gaseous matter. A well-designed filtration system includes cellulose or fiberglass filters that remove particulate matter, and chemical absorption system that filters out gaseous pollutants. Air filters must be changed regularly to be effective. Air circulation should also be checked periodically. = Handling control = When handling film, the user should always have clean hands and wear gloves (cotton or nitrile) to avoid fingerprints or scratches. Always handle the film by the edge to avoid touching the image surface. Users must be careful when removing film from enclosures to avoid scratches or abrasions. Never force rolled film flat if it is brittle, as it can snap or break. Always work in an uncluttered and clean environment that is well-lit and ventilated. It's also beneficial to avoid wearing jewelry, such as long necklaces, that can accidentally scratch the film when being examined. Food and drinks should be kept in a separate room or a safe distance from the film materials. It is also advisable to limit exposure times to celluloid film, wear googles and a respirator. = Digitization = Any negatives that show signs of deterioration should be digitized as soon as possible. Without immediate restoration followed by a change to proper long-term storage, the environmental factors that caused the early signs of damage will continue, leading eventually to irreparable damage and permanent loss of the film‚Äôs content. Nitrate and safety negatives that need to be handled but are in good condition should still generally be digitized. The digital image can then be used as an access copy while the original remains in cold storage. A wide array of digital systems are available for capturing and storing photographic images, and an institution should have a digital preservation policy in place. Digitization requires active management to ensure the digitized copies are not corrupted or lost. There are many factors to consider when digitizing photographic materials. The Northeast Document Conservation Center provides information and resources on Digital Preservation. = Duplication = Transferring negatives to a more stable support such as polyester is the best way to preserve the longevity of the images.  Conservation treatments  Deteriorated film that requires conservation work should be conducted by a photograph conservator. There are several resources available to aid in finding a conservator for your needs, including the American Institute for Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works (AIC), the Northeast Document Conservation Center (NEDCC), and the Conservation Center for Art and Historic Artifacts (CCAHA). = Conservation treatments for nitrate = It is not recommended to perform conservation treatments on nitrate. The best options are cold storage to prevent further deterioration (especially if the film is found to be in the lower levels of deterioration), digitize the nitrate film, or duplicate the nitrate film onto a more stable support like polyester. If the nitrate is found to be at the higher levels of deterioration, it is recommended that the original nitrate film be destroyed due to the health and safety hazards. = Conservation treatments for acetate = Cold storage is the best option for preventive conservation of cellulose acetate film as it slows down the deterioration process. As with nitrate, it is also suggested that digitization and duplication efforts are useful in providing access copies. However, it is possible to perform some conservation treatments on acetate film. \\"Stripping\\" is a technique that is used by trained conservators on channeled acetate film. This process allows the conservator to separate the gelatin emulsion layer from the deteriorating acetate film base in a bath and then reattach or duplicate the gelatin emulsion layer onto another sheet of film. This process is quite tedious and expensive, and not always successful, therefore it is not always a viable option for everyone.  Obstacles in conservation and restoration  = Irreversible damage or deterioration = As described above, celluloid materials are chemically unstable and will naturally deteriorate over time. Once the materials have reached high levels of deterioration, the film often faces irreversible damage, including image loss. It's important to digitize or duplicate these materials before they face irreversible damage. = Cost = Cold storage (freezers) can be costly and prohibitive for many institutions. Digitization can also be costly; factors that need to be considered are size and use of collection, space available for storage, and financial resources. Deteriorated photographs may require specialized conservation treatment by a professional photograph conservator, often a costly, skill-demanding, and time-consuming procedure. For the majority of photographs in research collections, single-item conservation of deteriorated photographs is probably not a feasible or a cost-effective preservation solution. = Access = Cold storage can be prohibitive for access due to the acclimation periods required to use the film.

The main conservation Code of Ethics is the American Institute for Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works (AIC) Code of Ethics and Guidelines for Practice. However, many of the professional organizations have their own codes, such as the Society of American Archivists Core Values Statement and Code of Ethics.

It is found around the world in intertidal zones and shallow water. The genus has folding frond-like blades which are either red, brown or green. Some Pyropia species are used to create nori, and are thus important subjects for aquaculture.  Taxonomy  Pyropia was originally erected by Jacob Georg Agardh, a botanist and professor at Lund University. Before this, and sometimes after, many species of Pyropia were placed in Porphyra, a different genus of red alga. New species of Pyropia are still being discovered, for example in 2013 research done on New Zealand plants was able to move Pyropia plicata from Porphyra.  Description  Pyropia species are red algae with a discoid holdfast and short stipe. They have folded blades, which are membranous and monostromatic, coming in red, brown, and dark green colorations. These folded blades may also look like fronds until unfolded. These blades reach up to one meter in length in some species, but are generally around 20 centimeters in diameter.  Distribution  Pyropia grows in intertidal zones and down to 10 meters in some bodies of water based on clarity and substrate. It grows in large swaths, attaching itself to stones and shells, covering most of the bottom. Pyropia can be found globally in warm-temperate and extratropical [cool] waters. = Ecology = Pyropia species, which reside in the upper intertidal zone, endure many stresses, including intense direct light, temperature fluctuation, osmotic stress, salinity fluctuation, and desiccation. They are especially able to handle heat stress; some Pyropia species will halt metabolic systems that are not essential to homeostasis, such as photosynthesis. Other species will use increased lipid production to fight desiccation. The ability of Pyropia species to adapt to deal with these stresses makes them heavily studied organisms. One of the threats to Pyropia is fungal infections by Alternaria sp. ZL-1, which has been observed in farming environments on Pyropia yezoensis . The fungus kills Pyropia cells and leaves brown rust-like spots on the outside of the blades. Use Within the genus Pyropia multiple species are used for nori (edible seaweed), Pyropia yezoensis and P. haitanensis being most popular. It is a two-billion-dollar industry with most major growers located in China, Korea, and Japan. Nori contains substantial amounts of Vitamin B12 according to a 2014 paper. However, the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics considers this source unreliable for vegans.

Rabbinical literature describes Jehoiakim as a godless tyrant who committed atrocious sins and crimes. He is portrayed as living in incestuous relations with his mother, daughter-in-law, and stepmother, and was in the habit of murdering men, whose wives he then violated and whose property he seized. He also had tattooed his body. Jeremiah criticised the king's policies, insisting on repentance and strict adherence to the law. Another prophet, Uriah ben Shemaiah, proclaimed a similar message and Jehoiakim ordered his execution ().James Maxwell Miller, John Haralson Hayes, A History of Ancient Israel and Judah (Westminster John Knox Press, 1986) page 404-405. His despicable character earned him no respect from the people, as in 598 BC to end the siege of Jerusalem, the priests of Sanhedrin delivered him to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon who \\"bound him in fetters, to carry him to Babylon.\\" and he died without proper funeral, described by Jeremiah that \\"he shall be buried with the burial of a donkey, dragged and cast out beyond the gates of Jerusalem\\" () \\"and his dead body shall be cast out to the heat of the day and the frost of the night\\" ().

The storm cancelled flights east out of Toronto, Ottawa and Montreal. This impacted Queen's who had scheduled to leave on Tuesday by bus to Toronto where they would fly to Fredericton. They were informed their flight was cancelled and they instead booked a bus to Fredericton leaving Tuesday afternoon. They got as far as Quebec City where they stayed the night. McGill had also started their journey by bus on Tuesday and got as far as Riviere-du-Loup. Poor road conditions and road closures stranded both teams for the entire day on Wednesday in their respective locations. As such they were not able to attend the UCup Gala on Wednesday night. They continued their journeys on Thursday and both arrive mid-day on Thursday. This had the biggest impact on Queen's who was scheduled to play UNB that night at 7pm local (AST). The game was delayed by 1 hour to 8pm to provide Queen's some additional time to prepare. The travel impact was less for McGill whose first game wasn't until Friday. Saskatchewan Huskies arrived on Monday but not all of their equipment did - they had to purchase a sizable amount of equipment from a local sporting goods store to outfit the team for their first practice on Tuesday. The missing bags did arrive late Wednesday. =Tournament format= The tournament is a traditional 8 team, single elimination ladder with Bronze Medal game between the two semi-final losers. Games that are tied after regulation play a 10-minute overtime period following the 3rd period. If there is no score after the first overtime, the ice is cleaned and they would play 20 minute periods (with ice cleaned between periods) until there is a winner. The higher seed is the 'Home' team for each game (the home team must wear their 'white' jerseys and will get the last change during stoppages of play).

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1986. History In the 1850s, both a Presbyterian and a Catholic mission were established near modern-day Petoskey to minister to the Odawa residents of the area. By the 1860s, more European residents moved into Petoskey, and pioneer Hazen Ingalls constructed a dock for shipping and built the first store in what is now downtown Petoskey. In 1874, the Grand Rapids and Indiana Railroad began service to Petoskey, and the area soon grew immensely. The area already had three hotels by 1875. The village of Petoskey was incorporated in 1879; at that time a number of brick commercial structures began to be constructed in the downtown area. Construction continued through the turn of the century, and construction of small scale commercial structures continued into the 1940s. Description The Petoskey Downtown Historic District consists of 102 commercial properties and two institutional structures, located along 10 blocks in Petoskey's business district, primarily along East Mitchell and Howard streets. The contributing structures range in date from 1879 to the 1920s. The old tracks from the Grand Rapids and Indiana Railroad run diagonally through the district, and open land bordering the track is landscaped as a park. At its north end, the district includes the old Grand Rapids and Indiana Railroad Depot and the Perry Hotel, both reminders of the early tourism history of the city. The majority of the structures in the district are commercial in nature, and can be grouped by significant uses and architectural styles: *Residential-type commercial properties (319‚Äì331 Bay and 110‚Äì121 Howard): The two blocks at the northwestern edge of the district (the 300 block of Bay and 100 block of Howard) contain small residential-type commercial structures. Some serve as boarding houses, and others have been converted from residential to commercial use. *Classical Revival structures (300 & 415 Howard; 307‚Äì09, 407, and 452 East Lake; 100 Lewis; 307, 408, & 447 East Mitchell): A number of structures exhibit Classical Revival architectural styling. The most distinctive is the c. 1890 First State Bank at 300 Howard, in part because of its prominent corner location and its cohesive facade with a prominent Doric portico. Other Classical Revival buildings include the 1902 Matthew Pietrowitcz building at 415 Howard, the 1907 G&A; building at 307-09 East Lake, and the c. 1917 Petoskey Cigar Company building at 407 East Lake. Each of these buildings have upper story arches unifying the Classical design.

Founded in 1906, it was the second junior league in the world.Diamant, Anita. ‚ÄúThe Changing Face of the Junior League.‚Äù The Boston Globe. 8 April 1984. The Boston League currently has over 800 members who together provide over 16,000 service hours each year. It is a member of the Association of Junior Leagues. The Junior League of Boston‚Äôs official mission statement is: \\"The Junior League of Boston is an organization of women committed to promoting voluntarism, developing the potential of women and improving communities through the effective action and leadership of trained volunteers. Its purpose is exclusively educational and charitable.\\" The organization‚Äôs primary goal is to improve the communities of the greater Boston area. Since its founding, it has provided both money and manpower to causes including increasing unemployment funds during the Great Depression and advocating for disability issues and child abuse during the 1960s and 1970s.‚ÄúHistory.‚Äù The Junior League of Boston, Inc. 2017. https://www.jlboston.org/history/. In recent decades, it has focused its efforts on the empowerment of girls and women with service projects, including one-on-one mentoring and arts education for elementary school girls. Beyond its primary purpose of service, the Junior League has also been a central piece of Boston society. Particularly in its early years, the League held some of Boston‚Äôs most prominent women as members. Speakers who have visited the organization include Booker T. Washington, William Howard Taft, and John F. Kennedy.Stoll, Ira. JFK, Conservative. Boston: Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 2013. 18.  History  In 1906, former debutante Sarah Lawrence Slattery established the Sewing Circle League, a charity group based from her sewing circle of upper-class Boston women.Finding Aid for the Junior League of Boston Records, 1897-1994. Schlesinger Library, Radcliffe Institute, Harvard University, Cambridge, Mass. She modeled the group after the Junior League of New York, founded in 1901, and aimed to provide young women opportunities to do stimulating work, to help their communities, and to form female friendships. In these early years, the group aimed its charitable efforts primarily towards poor children, the sick, and the elderly, but also expanded its reach to settlement houses. From the beginning, the group emphasized the training of its members. Training mainly consisted of field trips to various Boston charitable and municipal agencies, lectures on Boston‚Äôs social problems, and group workshops for the women. By 1912, the Sewing Circle League had 160 members and was engaged with over 50 charitable organizations. On October 25, 1916, the group voted to change its name to ‚ÄúThe Junior League of Boston‚Äù and became the second Junior League in the United States. Over the years, the Junior League adapted its efforts to changing times. During the Great Depression, the League raised money to supplement relief funds and unemployment assistance in Boston. During the World War II, the League helped other organizations that aided soldiers, including the American Red Cross. After the war, as awareness of limitations caused by disabilities increase, the League engaged in more related projects. In 1950, they released The Guide to Boston for the Handicapped. In the 1960s, the League produced several documentaries with WGBH-TV, including ‚ÄúThe Innocents,‚Äù which examined establishments for people with disabilities.Jackson, Nancy Beth. The Junior League : 100 Years of Volunteer Service. New York: Association of Junior Leagues International, 2001. In the 1970s, the League established a child abuse center for the Massachusetts Welfare Department. In 1985, two members of the Junior League testified before Congress in hearing for a bill called ‚ÄúAmendments to the Foster Care and Adoption Assistance Program,‚Äù aiming to establish more transitional houses for homeless youth.‚ÄúAmendments to the Foster Care and Adoption Assistance Program: Hearing Before the Subcommittee on Public Assistance and Unemployment Compensation of the Committee on Ways and Means, House of Representatives, Ninety-ninth Congress, First Session.‚Äù United States Congress: Committee on Ways and Means. Subcommittee on Public Assistance and Unemployment Compensation. 19 September 1985. The League also underwent several demographic changes in the 1970s and 1980s. Originally, membership was only granted to women who were ‚Äúproposed‚Äù by a current member, then ‚Äúendorsed‚Äù by two others. As a result, the League tended to exclude non- WASP, non-elite women. The proposal and endorsement requirement was removed in the 1980s, as part of an increased effort to diversify the membership. The League saw an increase in employed members, meaning that members had fewer hours to spare for volunteering.Allis, Sam. ‚ÄúThe League, Then and Now.‚Äù The Boston Globe. 26 March 2011. In response, the league organized more workshops geared towards the professional world as part of member training. In addition, the average age of members increased from 22 to 31 between the 1970s and 1980s. = Headquarters = The League‚Äôs headquarters were originally at Zero Marlboro st., opposite from the Boston Public Gardens. In 1953, the Katherine Gibbs School took over their building, so the League temporarily met in the Harvard Club of Boston.Arnold, Alison. ‚ÄúLeague Serving People as well as Tea.‚Äù The Boston Globe. 19 January 1975. They purchased a new place for headquarters at 117 Newbury St. in 1958, and remain there today. In 2011, the League began renovation and refurbishment of this space, in part to make it handicap accessible and better suited to the modern needs of the organization.  Noteworthy events  = Notable Speakers Series = The Junior League of Boston began hosting notable speakers soon after their founding. They have hosted Dr. Richard C. Cabot (founder of Social Services), Charles W. Eliot (president of Harvard University), Booker T. Washington, Jane Addams (founder of Hull House), William Howard Taft, and a warden of Sing-Sing. Most notably, the Junior League of Boston hosted President John F. Kennedy on October 23, 1946. President Kennedy gave his famous speech, ‚ÄúWhy I am a Democrat.‚Äù Given shortly before his campaign came to a close, the speech‚Äôs moderate stance helped to center his candidacy. = Show House = Historically, the Junior League of Boston contributed to a greater movement throughout the 1920s to foster the arts among their members. The women of the Boston Junior League were highly involved in a national effort to make the arts available to women and part of a healthy community life. In the 1920s, the Boston Junior League was known for their avant-garde taste, opting for a fresh and modern art deco style for their clubhouse. For many women of the Junior League of Boston, the use of arts in their headquarters was an act of self-expression.Blair, Karen J. The Torchbearers: Women and Their Amateur Arts Associations in America, 1890-1930. Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1994. 190. Their skills in interior decorating were not limited to their headquarters. Since 1970, the Junior League of Boston‚Äôs Show House event has been one of its most noteworthy and well known. Originally held annually and called the Decorator‚Äôs Show House and Garden Tour, the fundraiser brings together numerous designers who redecorate, and at times restore, a historic site to then be toured by the public. In the past, it was the only League-wide event, and all members were expected to contribute to the project. Ticket sales from tours are donated to the Junior League and the community organizations with whom they work.Tarantal, Erika. ‚Äú5 for Good: 45-Year-Old Tradition Benefits Boston-Area Girls.‚Äù WCVB5 ABC. 20 May 2016. Funds raised through the first Show House allowed the League to develop and open the Gilday Center, a daycare facility for abused children. By 1984, the annual event had raised over $1 million. Previous sites have included the 1802 Norfolk Inn and the 1921 Potter Estate.

Goals are to provide economic development and business assistance; encourage historic preservation; reactivate Broadway's historic theaters and long-underutilized commercial buildings; and increase transit and development options by bringing a streetcar back to downtown Los Angeles with Broadway as the spine for the route. Under Bringing Back Broadway initiative the area has experienced a surge in new retail and restaurants and is becoming a focal point for creative office and boutique hotel development. City policies aimed at spurring this revitalization through Bringing Back Broadway include the City's Historic Commercial Reuse Guidelines, Broadway Entertainment Zone policies, a facade lighting grant program, the Historic Broadway Sign District, and the Broadway Streetscape plan, one of the country's largest road diets, which prioritizes people over vehicles and creates a safer and more vibrant pedestrian experience along Broadway.  Location  The historic Broadway corridor, part of an important National Register Historic District, is in the center of Downtown Los Angeles and in the heart of the Historic Core. The initiative is dedicated to revitalizing the historic Broadway district between 2nd street and Olympic Boulevard of Los Angeles.  History  Broadway, constructed as a part of the 1849 plan of Los Angeles by Lieutenant Edward Ord, is one of the oldest streets of the city and is a part of the National Register of Historic Places. For more than 50 years, Broadway from 1st Street to Olympic Boulevard represented the main commercial street of Los Angeles, and one of the premier theater and movie palace districts as well. The entire street is a live display of the grand and marvelous architectural and engineering feats of the 20th century. Despite having such a rich culturally enriched history, the Broadway corridor has not been able to meet up to its potential and expectations in the recent years. Most of the historic buildings are left vacant with a very low occupancy rate, especially on the upper floors. This presented a challenge to the city government of Los Angeles, which found expression through the Bringing Back Broadway initiative, launched in 2008. The Bringing Back Broadway initiative took up the active task to revitalize the historic Broadway corridor over a span of 10 years, through policy making and implementation of economic development strategies and tools.  Organization  The Bringing Back Broadway initiative is led by Councilmember Jos√© Huizar of council district 14. The executive director of the project is Jessica Wethington Mclean. The project is also supported by a group of property owners, residents, business owners and advocates who work in collaboration on committees and with other stakeholders.  Projects  The Bringing Back Broadway initiative is a multifaceted preservation and renovation initiative, which spearheads numerous projects. The individual projects are as follows: = Broadway Theatre and Entertainment District Design Guide = The Broadway Theater and Entertainment District Design Guide (CDO) provides guidelines and standards for development projects along Broadway between 2nd Street and Olympic Boulevard in Broadway. The intent of the Broadway Design Guide is to provide guidance and direction in the rehabilitation of existing structures and the design of new buildings to improve the appearance, enhance the identity, and promote walkability of the Broadway corridor and to encourage the development of a regional entertainment district, centered around its twelve historic theaters. The document was created through Bringing Back Broadway, with input from a wide range of stakeholders, including historians, architects and planners in cooperation with the Los Angeles Department of City Planning. It was adopted by the Planning Commission in July 2009. = Broadway Streetscape Master Plan = The Broadway Streetscape Master Plan is an approach to a multimodal, pedestrian oriented development plan that will contribute towards supporting a thriving environment along the Broadway corridor. Council member Jos√© Huizar has said, ‚ÄúThe streetscape plan boldly prioritizes people over vehicles, provides much- needed infrastructure support and major improvements to a street that has been neglected for far too long, while providing a showcase for the Downtown L.A. Streetcar and the revitalization of the Historic Broadway Theatre District.‚Äù The Broadway Streetscape Master Plan is a 2 phase process. The first phase, a $1.5 million-dollar project, opened in August 2014, includes an innovative ‚Äúdress rehearsal‚Äù installation of sidewalk extensions delineated from the roadway with bollards, planters, and special paving. This groundbreaking approach allowed significant changes to be implemented in the short term in a cost-effective way, influencing future planning in Los Angeles. Phase One of the plan features a ‚Äúroad diet‚Äù where Broadway from 3rd Street to just past 11th Street was reconfigured from four lanes to three, reclaiming more sidewalk space for pedestrians and allowing 24-hour parking and loading, which did not previously exist. The Bringing back initiative partnered with LADOT for this project. LADOT was tasked with implementing the first phase of the project over a time span of 6months. The first phase of the process has already earned national attention for its effort at urban place making. Gizmodo named the Bringing Back Broadway initiative as one of the ‚Äú5 Big New Projects Remaking Cities into Havens for Pedestrians ‚Äò‚Äô. The initiative also received awards from the American Planning Association for merits for plan implementation. ‚ÄúThis is the city‚Äôs first real complete streets project, and it‚Äôs one of the country‚Äôs most significant urban corridor projects,‚Äù said Jessica Wethington McLean, executive director of Bringing Back Broadway. Phase 2 of the plan will include new pedestrian lighting, street furniture, wayfinding signage, plants and street trees, decorative paving materials, water drainage and filtration system and more. The city has secured $4.6 million through two grants from the Metropolitan Transportation Authority for the phase two work. = Downtown Los Angeles Streetcar = The Downtown Los Angeles Streetcar project aspires to bring the beloved historic streetcar back into the city. In May 2011, the Bringing Back Initiative along with LA Metro, Los Angeles Department of Transportation and several other stakeholders, for the first time started conducting feasibility studies regarding the restoration of the historic streetcar service in downtown Los Angeles. After a lot of analysis, a preferred route was selected in January 2011. \\"We wanted to give people an alternative to getting downtown that was enjoyable, instead of sitting behind the wheel and hating yourself,\\" said Shane Phillips, the project director of LA Streetcar Inc., a nonprofit working with the government on the project. Los Angeles Streetcar Inc was founded in January 2009 with an inaugural fundraiser hosted by Eli Broad, Tim Leiweke and Rick Caruso. The planning portion of the project was supported with seed funding from the former Community Redevelopment Agency of the City of Los Angeles, which allowed the project to undergo environmental review and other preliminary steps. Jessica Wethington Mclean, executive Director of Bringing Back Broadway said, ‚ÄúThe streetcar is going to deliver thousands of people on the sidewalks of downtown LA, thousands of people that would otherwise be in their cars, driving by, not looking at the businesses, not stopping at the storefronts.‚Äù The streetcar is projected to be running around a 3.8mile one way loop system, 7days a week, and up to hours a day. It will run in the same lane as vehicular traffic and at the same speed, which is typical for modern streetcar systems in the United States. The DTLA Streetcar is planned to offer the most frequent streetcar service in the entire country, with a 7-minute headways during peak hours and frequencies of 10 to 15 minutes during off-hours. The DTLA Streetcar aims to connect and support the revitalization of Downtown LA districts and its historic core, and will function as an access point, allowing patrons to make easier connections to the existing regional network. It would serve areas including Historic Broadway and the Historic Core, South Park, L.A. LIVE and the Los Angeles Convention Center, with an optional spur that would serve Bunker Hill, Grand Avenue and the Music Center. Streetcars are an environmentally friendly alternative and a much needed ‚Äúlast mile‚Äù solution. The DTLA Streetcar project is currently backed by a voter-approved $85 million special tax measure; is funded through LA County's Measure M with $200 million. Operations will be funded by a $282 million council-adopted operational plan. Once completed, the ridership is projected at up to 6000 riders per day, which in turn is projected to result in 8500 new jobs in Los Angeles, development of 784,000 square feet of new and renovated office space valued at $259 million and $87 million in unrestricted tax revenuee. Construction of the DTLA Streetcar is scheduled to commence by 2018-19. After construction and testing, the streetcar is expected to start operating for revenue service by 2020-2021. = Night on Broadway = ‚ÄúNight on Broadway‚Äù held thus far in 2015, 2016 and 2017 celebrates the accomplishments of The Bringing Back Initiative. The Night on Broadway event is one of the largest one-day music & arts festivals in the United States. A mile-long stretch of Broadway between 3rd St. and Olympic Blvd. becomes closed off and transformed for the free event, offering music, games and activities for kids and adults, art installations and one-of-a-kind experiences featuring hundreds of acts, including performances on 10 stages in the street and in six of Broadway's historic theaters. = Broadway Historic Sign District = The Broadway Historic Sign District encourages and acknowledges the usage of signage to promote the distinctive aesthetic of the historic Broadway district. It also acts as an important measure to control blight created by poorly placed and badly designed signage. On January 20, 2016, the city council approved the Historic Broadway Sign District ordinance. The Broadway Sign District was adopted by L.A. City Council after five years of development and is now in effect. As part of the Broadway Sign district, neon signs, kinetic signs, and open panel roof signs are allowed. Revenue generating signs on buildings that meet minimum occupancy in the upper floors are permitted. = Broadway Historic Commercial Reuse guidelines = The Broadway Historic Commercial Reuse guidelines aim to assist in the commercial reuse of historical building along the Broadway corridor. All buildings are not suited for housing and it is estimated that there are about 1 million square feet of vacant spaces, which could be put into use through commercial reuse. Beginning in 2008 and after 5 years of collaborating effort between the Bringing Back Broadway community, L.A Fire Department, L.A Department of Building & Safety, and a dedicated group of architects and code reviewers, led by executive director Jessica Wethington McLean with architects Karin Liljegren and Rocky Rockefeller, the Broadway Historic Commercial Reuse guidelines were announced on December 12, 2013. = Broadway Fa√ßade Lighting Program = The Broadway Fa√ßade Lighting program of Bringing Back Broadway and is being implemented by the LA Neighborhood Initiative, LANI. The Broadway Fa√ßade Lighting Program offers $750,000 grant funding to property and business owners on Broadway Street. The fund is aimed specifically towards historic buildings, and buildings which have already invested a sum towards renovation and restoration. The program is devised to accentuate the aesthetic and architectural marvel of the historic Broadway corridor through fa√ßade lighting. It also supports public safety by enhancing the visual factor, especially at night. On March 25, 2014, grant recipients will include: * Bradbury Building (304 S Broadway) * Million Dollar Theatre (307 S Broadway) * Victor Clothing Company Building (242 S. Broadway) * Zobel Building (353 S. Broadway) * Bumiller/Campbell Blake Building (430 S. Broadway) * Metropolitan Building (449 S. Broadway) * Shulte United Building (529 S. Broadway) * Broadway Spring Arcade (541 S. Spring St.) * Clifton's Brookdale Cafeteria (648 S. Broadway) * Wurlitzer Music Building (818 S. Broadway) * Eastern Columbia Building (849 S. Broadway) * LL Burns Western Costume Building (908 S. Broadway) Noted theatrical lighting designer Tom Ruzika, famous for his work at the Hollywood Bowl, the Los Angeles Theatre Centre, etc. is creating the lighting designs for each of the individual properties. Ruzika said, ‚ÄúBroadway is like a large stage setting with the building facades as the featured performers. I look forward to helping bring them back into focus through this grant program.‚Äù Keeping up with the standards of sustainability, each lighting equipment for the historic facades will be energy efficient, Title 24 and Cal green compliant.  Impact  The past few years have seen some major changes in the Broadway corridor after the launch of the Bringing Back Broadway initiative. The initiative has incentivized nearly $1 billion in investment, new retail, hotel and commercial development; and residential units on a previously struggling street. The commission has been improving the major boulevards by widening sidewalks, eliminating traffic lanes, constructing new parking structures which have found expression in the arrival of all kinds of stores and restaurants. The initiative is considered a major trendsetter in the field of progressive urban place making. The new policies, which are aimed at adaptive reuse of the historic buildings have also found major success.

Village is closely related with neighboring village of Antin. Mlaka Antinska is faced with the challenge of population decline caused by the post-Croatian War of Independence economic situation. Population decline intensified in the aftermath of the 2013 enlargement of the European Union with number of people emigrating to the United Kingdom, Ireland and Germany. Some local inhabitants compared the issue with the depopulation of the Great Plains in the United States. Geography Mlaka Antinska is located on the left northern bank of the Vuka River and the Vuka-Vuka Canal which is dividing the settlement on two parts. Settlement is located on the main road between villages Antin and Tordinci. Culture Already in 2013 there was not a single registered cultural organization or activity which was taking place in Mlaka Antinska. While Tordinci Municipality is defining official usage of Hungarian language, ethnic Hungarian flag and proportional representation in municipal institutions for Hungarian community centered in the village of Koroƒë, Municipal Statute do not contain similar provisions for much smaller Serb community living primarily in Mlaka Antinska.

Violacein shows increasing commercially interesting uses, especially for industrial applications in cosmetics, medicines and fabrics. Biosynthesis Violacein is formed by enzymatic condensation of two tryptophan molecules, requiring the action of five proteins. The genes required for its production, vioABCDE, and the regulatory mechanisms employed have been studied within a small number of violacein-producing strains. Antibiotic activity Violacein is known to have diverse biological activities, including as a cytotoxic anticancer agent and antibacterial action against Staphylococcus aureus and other gram-positive pathogens. Determining the biological roles of this pigmented molecule has been of particular interest to researchers, and understanding violacein's function and mechanism of action is relevant to potential applications. Commercial production of violacein and related compounds has proven difficult so improving fermentative yields of violacein is being pursued through genetic engineering and synthetic biology.

Like the Fugger and Welser families from Augsburg, their company run trading branches across Europe between the 15th and 17th centuries, although on a somewhat smaller scale. The Protestant family played an import part in the economical and cultural development as well as in local politics. They were admitted to the governing council of the free imperial city since 1340, a hereditary privilege.https://museums.nuernberg.de/museum-tucher-mansion/the-tucher- merchant-dynasty/ After the acquisiton of Simmelsdorf Castle in 1598, the family was named Tucher von Simmelsdorf and ennobled in 1697. In 1815, they became Bavarian barons.  German Branch  Tucherschloss, N√ºrnberg The first known member is Berthold Tucher who became a citizen of Nuremberg in 1309. The Tuchers gained considerable importance in the economic golden age of Nuremberg and spread to Lyon, Antwerp, Geneva and Venice. Although they founded their own commercial branches relatively late in comparison to other patrician families, they became one of the richest merchant families in the city due to their trade connections throughout Europe. They were also engaged in mining in Tyrol, Austria, like the Fuggers. In the 17th century, the Tuchers, along with the Imhoff family, operated the last big trading companies of the Nuremberg patriciate; both families especially competed in the European saffron trade. They were among the most important patrons of the golden age of Nuremberg art around 1500. Their main residence was the Tucherschloss (Tucher castle) at Nuremberg, still today owned by the family and housing a museum on the history of the Tuchers and the Nuremberg trading businesses of the Renaissance age. The family also still owns the castles of Simmelsdorf, Behringersdorf and Schoppershof. Three members of the family were portrayed by Albrecht D√ºrer, among them Elsbeth Tucher (1473-1517), whose image was depicetd on the older 20 Deutsche Mark banknote. A branch moved to Antwerp in the late 15th century, for six generations, providing three mayors to the city, and remaining catholic. Like most ruling patricians of German free imperial cities, the Nuremberg Tuchers became Lutheran protestants with the reformation. During the 19th and 20th centuries the family continued to brew a locally famed beer, Tucher Br√§u. Their heraldic crest shows a black moor in gold, with the motto: Sincere et Constanter (sincere and steadfast).  Images  Of all trading families of Nuremberg, the Tucher family was probably among the most important patrons for works of art of the Golden Age.

Gender recognition In the Republic of Ireland, it was not possible for a transgender person to alter their birth certificate until 2015. Lydia Foy took a case in the High Court in 2002 that was turned down, as a birth certificate was deemed to be a historical document. Foy took new proceedings to the High Court relying on the decisions of the European Court of Human Rights in the Goodwin and \\"I\\" cases. Her application was heard between 17 and 26 April 2007, and judgment was reserved. Judgment was given in the High Court on 19 October 2007. The Judge held that the Irish State had failed to respect Foy's rights under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights by not providing any mechanism for her to obtain a new birth certificate in her female gender. He indicated that he would grant a declaration that Irish law in this area was incompatible with the Convention. He also said he would have found her right to marry under Article 12 of the Convention had been infringed as well if that had been relevant. On 14 February 2008, the Judge granted a declaration that sections of the Civil Registration Act 2004 were incompatible with Article 8 of the Convention. This was the first declaration of incompatibility made under the European Convention on Human Rights Act passed in 2003.\\"Foy v.

He was resident choreographer with the Dutch National Ballet in Amsterdam from 2003 to 2017, director of the Polish National Ballet in Teatr Wielki ‚Äì Polish National Opera in Warsaw since 2009 and at the same time from 2011 until 2020 was the artistic director of the ballet of the Lithuanian National Opera and Ballet Theatre in Vilnius. Origins in Poland Krzysztof Pastor was born in Gda≈Ñsk to a family of doctors - Jan and Leokadia Pastor. He trained with State Ballet School in Gda≈Ñsk 1966-1975. After his training, he joined the Polish Dance Theatre in Pozna≈Ñ, under direction of the Polish choreographer Conrad Drzewiecki, where in 1977 became a soloist and performed many roles in the company‚Äôs repertoire. Between 1979 and 1982 was first soloist of the ballet of the Grand Theater in ≈Å√≥d≈∫, where his repertoire included: Albrecht in Giselle, Prince in The Nutcracker, Armen in Boris Eifman‚Äôs Gayane, Vaslav w The Fountain of Bakhchisarai and Prince in Snow White. After imposition of martial law in Poland, he emigrated to the West in February 1982. Overseas achievements In 1983, he became a soloist with Ballet de l'Op√©ra de Lyon, where he danced in ballets created by: Gray Veredon, Kurt Jooss, Antony Tudor, Hans van Manen, Maguy Marin, Nils Christe or Nacho Duato. From 1985 to 1995 was engaged with the Dutch National Ballet, under direction of Rudi van Dantzig. He danced many parts in his ballets (e.g. Mercutio in his Romeo and Juliet), but also in ballets by: George Balanchine, Bronislava Nijinska, Frederick Ashton, Hans van Manen, Toer van Schayk, Jan Linkens, Carolyn Carlson, Nina Wiener, Ted Brandsen or Ashley Page. He also danced in major classical ballets like The Sleeping Beauty (Bluebird) and Giselle (Hilarion) staged by Peter Wright or Swan Lake (Von Rothbart) choreographed by Rudi van Dantzig. Choreographer In this period, he also took up an interest in choreographic work and since 1987 he was creating his pieces during choreographic workshops and on other occasions. Having some chamber achievements, in 1992 he received an offer to create his first major choreography for the Dutch National Ballet‚Äôs repertoire. Then, he created Shostakovich Chamber Symphony, which was his official debut as a choreographer. In 1994, he made his Warsaw‚Äôs debut on the stage of Teate Wielki ‚Äì Polish National Opera choreographing Henryk Miko≈Çaj G√≥recki‚Äôs Symphony No. 3. In 1995, he gained wider recognition during International Ballet Competition in Helsinki, Finland, where he received Gold Choreography Prize for his duet Detail IV to the music by Zolt√°n Kod√°ly. Between 1997 and 1999 he was a resident choreographer with The Washington Ballet, and then he returned to the Dutch National Ballet, but this time as associate choreographer. In 2000, his Dutch achievements was awarded with Dansersfonds'79 Choreography Prize, and in 2002 his full-length ballet Kurt Weill received three nominations to international Prix Benois de la Danse (Moscow). Since 2003, he took over a prestigious position of the resident choreographer with the Dutch National Ballet. Ever since he shares this position with outstanding Dutch choreographer Hans van Manen. Most of Pastor‚Äôs ballets were created in Netherlands, but he was also invited by other ballet companies worldwide like: Australia, Belgium, Czech Republic, Hong Kong, Israel, Lithuania, Latvia, New Zealand, Germany, Sweden, Turkey, USA, Hungary, Great Britain and Italy. His works were successfully presented during Holland Festival, Holland Dance Festival, Edinburgh International Festival, Dance Salad Festival in Houston or International Ballet Festival \\"Dance Open\\" in St. Petersburg. 280x280px 280x280px 280x280px 280x280px 280x280px 280x280px 280x280px 280x280px 280x280px Back to Poland In Autumn 2008, Pastor came to Poland to discuss restaging his ballet Tristan, in Warsaw‚Äôs Teatr Wielki. Production to the music of Richard Wagner was originally created for the Royal Swedish Ballet. At the time, Waldemar DƒÖbrowski ‚Äì Teatr Wielki‚Äôs general director, offered Pastor to take over the direction of the ballet in Warsaw. Being interested in this proposal, Pastor decided to return to Poland after 26 years of emigration, setting the conditions of ballet‚Äôs artistic independence and autonomic operating conditions in the theatre structure, which would be analogous to other major ballet companies worldwide. Thanks to the efforts of director DƒÖbrowski, Minister of Culture and National Heritage Bogdan Zdrojewski agreed to appropriate changes in the theater‚Äôs by-law. On 18 March 2009 Pastor took over the position of director of the ballet of Warsaw‚Äôs Teatr Wielki, and in the same year by the decision of Minister Zdrojewski on 29 April it was separated in the structure of the theatre as Polish National Ballet and became equal to Polish National Opera. In addition to the new duties in Warsaw, Pastor still holds the position of resident choreographer in the Dutch National Ballet, and from 2011 until 2020 he shared his experience with the Lithuanian National Opera and Ballet Theatre in Vilnius, as ballet's artistic director.

From 1940 till 1949 he attended the Christian Rauch School at nearby Arolsen. Between 1949 and 1955 he studied Jurisprudence at Marburg, Frankfurt and Cologne. He passed his national law exams in 1955 (Part I) at the Cologne district High court and 1961 (Part II) at D√ºsseldorf. During this period he received his doctorate in 1957 from Cologne University. For his dissertation he was supervised by Gotthold Bohne. Instead of pursuing a career based on his law qualifications, in 1961 he embarked on the study of Psychology, Sociology and Pedagogy at Basel and Freiburg, emerging in 1967 with a degree in Psychology from Freiburg University. Between 1967 and 1971 he worked with Rudolf Sieverts at the Faculty of Jurisprudence at Hamburg University, where he received his Habilitation (higher academic qualification) in 1971 for work on Criminology, Youth justice and Punishment strategy. It was also in 1971 that Schneider transferred to the University of M√ºnster where he was appointed Professor for Criminology, Legal psychology and Criminal law. He himself would later describe the post in English, slightly more succinctly, as a professorship in criminology and victimology. He remained at the university till his retirement from it in 1994, working as a researcher and a teacher, also travelling widely and employed as a visiting professor at various universities abroad. Between 1979 and 1985 he served as the founding president of the World Society of Victimology, the focus of his work being on causes and prevention of crime.

It uses a fly on the wall format to show the everyday lives of the staff and pupils of Passmores Academy, a secondary school in Harlow, Essex, interspersed with interviews of those involved and featuring narration from the director and interviewer, David Clews. The series received mixed media coverage: it was largely praised for its insight into the lives and behaviour of teenagers and the education system, but was also criticised for its depiction of pupils and teachers using profanity, as well as bullying and teenage pregnancy. The show received numerous awards, including director David Clews's British Academy Television Craft Award for his work on the programme in 2012; in the same year, the show was nominated for a Grierson Award for \\"Best Documentary Series\\". In 2013, Channel 4 and Twofour announced that the next series of the programme would be filmed in a different school, Thornhill Community Academy in Dewsbury, and that it would accordingly be titled Educating Yorkshire.  Episodes   Production  Educating Essex was commissioned by Channel 4's commissioning editor for documentaries, Mark Raphael, after the channel pledged an extra ¬£6.7 million to documentary programming in 2011. It is similar to other fly- on-the-wall series broadcast by Channel 4 such as One Born Every Minute, 24 Hours in A&E;, The Hotel and The Family, the last of which both director David Clews and series producer Beejal-Maya Patel had previously worked on. After seeing a \\"quite dull\\" programme about schools on the BBC, Raphael was inspired to create a series which captured school the way \\"[he] remembered it\\". He chose Clews after watching The Family, which he found funny, an attribute he wanted his series to have. Clews was initially not keen on the school idea, as he thought it would be boring. However, he came round after visiting some, describing in particular how one pupil tried to pass off his mobile phone use as checking for testicular cancer. Passmores Academy in Essex was chosen as the series' setting after the production team approached around 20 schools with good or outstanding Ofsted reports. This was eventually narrowed down to three after many denied or governors blocked the proposals. One of the schools that denied was Houghton Kepier School in Durham which had been given bad press in years previous after misconduct from staff member Adam Walker. David Clews stated that, \\"Passmores was always my favourite\\" as he hoped for \\"stories unfolding within the school\\". Regarding his decision to allow cameras into the school, Goddard said that upon receiving the phone call about the show, he had just given an assembly which encouraged pupils to take opportunities after the death of a classmate, and thought it would be \\"disingenuous\\" not to do so himself. Goddard received the support of the majority of Passmores governors, in particular by Community Governor Michael Hardware who, with previous documentary experience, provided some reassurance. Teacher Stephen Drew has described how he was initially very distrustful of the crew, and thought they were all \\"bastards\\" with \\"no morals\\" and \\"no sense of ethics\\", only wanting to make money. He did, however, begin to trust the team when they were honest with him and did not \\"cut any corners\\". In order to make the series, over 60 cameras were installed on the school's premises during the October half-term and filmed for a period of seven weeks, monitored by crew members in on-site prefabricated buildings. Staff and pupils were also allocated 22 radio microphones, based on whomever the crew thought would provide the most interesting material. When the speech of those not wearing a microphone was included, it was often barely audible and was written out and overlaid on the screen. In all, the fixed cameras filmed over 1,000 hours of footage. In addition, the crew interviewed pupils in prefabricated classrooms, mainly at lunchtime and in groups to capture the \\"group dynamic feel\\" of school life. Members of the production team were also charged with gaining the trust of around 20 to 25 pupils by liaising and going home with them. The autumn period was chosen as the production team thought it the most \\"normal\\" part of the year because the syllabus was being taught and pupils were not revising for their GCSE exams. As for fears that the presence of cameras would impact on pupils' behaviour, Clews said that pupils \\"mucked about\\" for the first few days, but soon forgot about the unobtrusive cameras. However, Goddard did not want to have cameras back, in case pupils began to misbehave because they were there; he said, \\"There's no media interest better than one young person's education\\". Channel 4 sought a new school to be filmed for a second series, and chose Thornhill Community Academy in Dewsbury to be the setting for Educating Yorkshire, to be filmed and broadcast in 2013.  Themes  The series covers a wide range of heavy themes, including a false accusation of assault against teacher Mr Drew by Camelita in the first episode, a case of bullying which moves on to cyberbullying against Gabby in the second, Vinni being taken into foster care in episode three and episode four focusing on Sky's teenage pregnancy with her boyfriend Liam. Episode five concentrated on the power of gossip and rumours, as Carrie's and Ashleigh's friendship breaks up and they reconcile. The sixth episode returns to Mr Drew as he attempts to get Mollie and her sister Charlotte back on the right academic track. The final episode features Ryan, a new arrival at the school, who has Asperger syndrome and the Year 11 leaving and their GCSE results.  Reception  According to BARB, Educating Essex averaged around 2 million viewers for each episode. This included a peak of 2.11 million for episode 4, and episode 2 being the lowest with only 1.79 million viewers. (It is necessary to input the relevant dates.) The series received generally positive reviews from critics: Sam Wollaston of The Guardian praised the show, calling it \\"a lot more interesting than Jamie's Dream School\\", and commenting that Mr Drew's history class is better than that of famous historian David Starkey; Wollaston also compared the series to the structured reality show The Only Way Is Essex, calling Educating Essex a \\"pure, observational, unobtrusive documentary [...] kind of what you want in reality TV\\". Rachel Tarley of Metro praised the first episode in particular due to its depiction of Mr Drew, calling it \\"giddily enjoyable\\", and said the show was \\"the best thing on Channel 4 this year\\". However, the series and participating Passmores Academy were criticised by The Telegraph, who said that those involved were portrayed in \\"an unflattering light\\", and criticised incidents in which teacher Mr King calls his pupils \\"scumbags\\", head teacher Mr Goddard uses an offensive hand gesture towards Mr Drew, and staff use profane language with one another. Nick Seaton, a spokesman for the Campaign for Real Education, criticised Passmores and its Ofsted rating, saying \\"If this is an outstanding school then it doesn't say much for the rest\\". Awards In 2012 Educating Essex was shortlisted for the Broadcasting Press Guild Award for \\"Best Documentary Series\\", and director David Clews won a British Academy Television Craft Award in the \\"Director: Factual\\" category for his work on the programme; the show was also nominated for the BAFTA for \\"Factual Series\\" and the \\"Audience Award\\". Also in 2012, the show was awarded \\"Best New Television Series\\" at the Freesat Awards. Later on that year, senior producer‚Äìdirector Grace Reynolds won the award for \\"Producer or Director Debut\\" at the Guardian Edinburgh International Television Festival. In 2013, the programme won \\"Best Documentary Series\\" at the Broadcast Awards, and was also nominated for the Grierson Award for \\"Best Documentary Series\\". Recent news In March 2019, Vinni Hunter, a former student of Passmores who starred in two episodes of Educating Essex was arrested by Essex Police suspected to be supplying Class A drugs and confirmed Class B drugs. He was jailed for a sentence of 6 years and 6 months.https://www.yourharlow.com/2019/03/06/educating-essex-star-vinni- hunter-jailed-for-six-years-for-drug-dealing/  References   External links  * Educating Essex at Channel 4 * Educating Essex at Twofour * 2010s British documentary television series 2011 British television seasons Channel 4 documentary series English- language television shows * British high school television series Television shows set in Essex Television series by ITV Studios ","title":"Educating Essex"},{"id":"53587321","text":"Educating Yorkshire is the second series of the British documentary television programme Educating broadcast on Channel 4. The eight-episode first series was first broadcast on 5 September 2013. Its format is based on the BAFTA Award- winning 2011 series Educating Essex. It follows the everyday lives of the staff and pupils of Thornhill Community Academy, a secondary school in Dewsbury, West Yorkshire. A Christmas special entitled Educating Yorkshire at Christmas was aired on 19 December 2013. An episode titled Educating Yorkshire: One Year On was broadcast on 21 August 2014. This episode concentrated on some of the key pupils that the audience met throughout the original series, showing what had been going on in their lives over the past year. The show also included previous year 10 (now year 11) pupils opening their summer 2014 GCSE results. Episodes Production Educating Yorkshire was commissioned by Channel 4 after the success of Educating Essex two years previously. There was interest from about 100 schools in starring in the new series after the production team put a call out to all schools classed as \\"good\\" or \\"outstanding\\" by Ofsted. David Brindley, producer and director of the series, said \\"it was undoubtedly easier to find a school this time around\\". In January 2012, Jonny Mitchell, the headmaster of Thornhill Community Academy in Dewsbury accepted an offer to be a part of a new series based in his school. The school had had a bad reputation and was among the 6% of the worst performing schools in England, with a 2007 Ofsted report describing it as \\"below average\\". Mitchell became headmaster in September 2011 and in 2012 it became the most improved school in the Yorkshire area and reached the top 6% of schools nationally. That year, 63% of pupils attained five GCSEs grade A* to C, up 7% since 2011 and only one of the 2012 graduates is not in education, employment or training. This improvement was one of the reasons it was chosen for the series with Mitchell saying \\"I was proud of what we‚Äôd achieved and felt we had a story to tell\\". Mitchell also said \\"Dewsbury has suffered quite a lot in the last ten or 15 years with some adverse press. I thought this was an opportunity for us to show the positive side of the town as well\\". The show was recorded with 64 cameras rigged up across the school and turned on from 7 am to 5 pm. These were backed up by several handheld cameras and 22 radio microphones. It took six months of preparation before filming began. Parents and pupils were consulted and production staff and psychologists carried out 100 home visits as well as holding parents' evenings and special assemblies. Taking part was not compulsory and 16 pupils out of the school's 747 asked not to appear in the series, with another 30‚Äì40 parents requesting that their children feature only in the background. Before filming began Twofour advised Mitchell to get into contact with Vic Goddard, headmaster of Passmores Academy, the school in which Educating Essex was set. He gave Mitchell advice on handling the attention and stayed in contact throughout the filming process. Mitchell had several concerns about the project such as putting the pupils in a situation where they were going to be laughed at, ridiculed or mocked. Many faculty members also had reservations about taking part, fearing they would be made to look stupid. Deputy head Dale Barrowclough said the turning point was speaking to Goddard. Two thousand hours of footage was recorded over seven weeks. Mitchell and the staff have said during the first few days of having cameras in their offices and classrooms they were mindful of what they did or said, but after they had got used to them they forget they were there, only occasionally remembering when they moved suddenly. David Brindley, one of the directors, said he was surprised how quickly the pupils forgot they were being filmed \\"for a day everyone was waving at the cameras, but we were surprised how little people played up after that. I thought we would be confronted by chewing gum on cameras every day, but no\\". Mitchell also warned pupils who might have been tempted to show off that the production staff would not put them in the final cut of the programme. Brindley said \\"he told them they had the best chance of getting on TV by being normal\\". Mitchell also claims there was no deterioration of behaviour across the Academy and based on the behaviour trawl, data, teaching and the pupils' results over the period the behaviour improved while the cameras were there. Mitchell and Twofour met at least once a day to talk about the things the cameras has been following and ask Mitchell if he had any concerns or comments. He did not have any editorial control but the relationship with Twofour and Channel 4 enabled him to talk openly about things that might concern Mitchell and the staff, and their comments were taken into consideration when the final cut was made. It was confirmed on 6 November 2013, that a Christmas special of Educating Yorkshire was to be broadcast which followed up on some of the featured pupils and how they are getting on after filming had finished. This later aired on 19 December 2013. Additionally on 1 August 2014, Channel 4 announced that a new episode titled One Year On would be transmitted on 21 August 2014 that would see some of the pupils collect their GCSE results. Reception According to BARB, Educating Yorkshire's first episode achieved over 4 million viewers, double the average audience of Educating Essex. (It is necessary to input the relevant dates.) The series was well received by critics. Benjamin Secher of The Telegraph gave the show four out of five stars. Helen Pidd of The Guardian said \\"rather than making them look daft, Educating Yorkshire is a great advert for some truly excellent and inspirational teachers\\". Emily Jupp of The Independent reviewed the first episode saying \\"although this was not ground-breaking, it was occasionally funny and heart-warming\\". Huffington Post UK called the teachers \\"heroes\\" and the pupils \\"pretty endearing\\" while Metro News gave the show four out of five stars. Terry Payne of Radio Times was more critical of the series, claiming it was exploiting the pupils and was too focused on Georgia in the second episode, saying \\"the argument is not whether she should be featured, but whether an entire episode should be structured around her misbehaviour\\", adding that it had turned the documentary into a soap opera. The final episode received critical acclaim, with social media raising the pupils featured in the episode as well as the inspirational teachers and head of years. The Metro stated: \\"Not a dry eye in the house as Educating Yorkshire draws to a close\\" in an article for the newspapers entertainment section. In January 2014, the show won Most Popular Documentary Series at the National Television Awards.

With her feet firmly grounded in her ruby slippers, Dorothy tackles her royal duties with enthusiasm, bravery, kindness and farm girl feistiness. And whether it's magic, Munchkins, flying monkeys or her nemesis Wilhelmina, the wicked witch- in-training and niece of the Wicked Witch of the West, Dorothy is ready to track down and put a stop to any problem that comes Oz's way with help from her dog Toto and their friends Scarecrow, Tin Man and Cowardly Lion. At the start of the second season, the Wizard of Oz ends up back in Oz after getting mixed up in another tornado. Now that he has returned at last, he plots to make himself into a real wizard by getting actual magic powers. When he finds out about the Wicked Witch's spirit being trapped in her crystal ball, he decides to help resurrect her in exchange for powers (not knowing that it takes years to get powers), but it backfired and Dorothy accidentally resurrects the Wicked Witch without her powers. Regardless on the outcome, this puts the Land of Oz in serious danger now. Characters * Dorothy Gale (voiced by Kari Wahlgren) ‚Äì She now lives in Oz and is the new Princess of Emerald City.

Sixteen Mile Creek flows through the settlement. History The settlement was founded as a lumber mill in 1847 by Thomas Easterbrook. The mill was purchased in 1877 by Henry Cargill. At that time, the property contained five buildings, a pond, and the mill. The property was later sold to Peter Sayers, namesake of the settlement, who operated the mill and built a family home there. In 1895, Sayers installed steam power at the mill. The mill was the largest in Nassagaweya Township, with two saws capable of turning out 25,000 to 30,000 board feet per day. During its busy season, the mill employed between 10 and 12 workers, who lived in a bunkhouse on site. The milled lumber was taken to Guelph by horse-drawn wagons and sleighs until 1890, when a railway was built through nearby Moffat. The wood was purchased by manufacturer Massey-Harris, and was used on farm machinery. The mill also produced shingles. In 1902, the mill burned down, and was rebuilt the following year. The mill closed in 1922, and a dam located there broke during the 1940s. The Sayers Mill property is recognized as a \\"significant heritage resource\\" by the Town of Milton.

Hojan was the co-founder of the Tiergartenstrasse4 Association in 2005 (together with Cameron Munro) devoted to Aktion T4 history, with emphasis on the Ko≈õcian psychiatric hospital located where he lived. Hojan, age of 40, left home in the evening of 1 December 2013 at 8 p.m. for a walk around town and disappeared. His body was found two months later on 9 February 2014 floating in the Obra canal near the town of Kie≈Çczewo, and identified later. The cause of death has not been determined. He was buried at the Ko≈õcian cemetery on 15 February 2014. He left behind a wife and young daughter. The monograph Treblinka Death Camp: History, Biographies, Remembrance by Chris Webb, the co-founder of H.E.A.R.T (also known as the HolocaustResearchProject.org), is dedicated to his memory. Life Hojan was born in G≈Çog√≥w, Lower Silesia, and lived in Ko≈õcian (69 km distance). He graduated from the Pozna≈Ñ University department of Geology. After graduation, Hojan worked as a journalist, and in the course of his research, became interested in the war crimes committed in occupied Poland during World War II. In 2002 Hojan published Terra Incognita, his first expanded essay about the history of a Jewish community from a small-town in Wielkopolska, Poland. His book was adapted for the stage in the same year by Teatr 112 of the Ko≈õcian Community Centre. In 2004, Hojan published a monograph about the extermination of Polish hospital patients by the SS, titled Nazistowska pseudoeutanazja w Krajowym Zak≈Çadzie Psychiatrycznym w Ko≈õcianie (1939-1940) or The Nazi pseudo-euthanasia at the Psychiatric Hospital in Ko≈õcian (1939-1940) about the forced euthanasia in the newly- formed Warthegau district, which led to the murder of 3,282 patients of the local psychiatric hospital in his hometown between November 1939 and March 1940. In 2005 Hojan co-founded the Tiergartenstrasse4 Association with British researcher Cameron Munro, to further research and document the subject of Nazi euthanasia leading to the Holocaust. He was instrumental in creating the Associations website. He worked closely with the Auschwitz-Birkenau State Museum, researching and photographing Auschwitz subcamps. After several years of fieldwork in December 2011 Hojan and Munro organized an exhibition on the extermination camp Kulmhof at the Centrum Judaicum in Berlin, titled \\"The unknown extermination camp Kulmhof am Ner ‚Äì history and remembrance\\" documenting the development and history of the camp. The exhibition revealed that traces of murder can still be found at the site seventy years after the fact.

The former water castle is still lived in and may only be viewed from the outside.  History  Nassenfels was already an important market village (known as Vicus Scutarensium) in the hinterland of the Rhaetian Limes in the 2nd century AD and was protected by a small castellum. The Roman camp was probably abandoned after the establishment of nearby Pf√ºnz Roman Fort (Vetoniana). During the Hungarian invasions of the 10th century, the ramparts of the old fortification were probably expanded to form a refuge castle. From the High Middle Ages the village belonged to the Bishopric of Eichst√§tt. The castle first appears in the records in 1245 in a deed, when Count Gebhard of Hirschberg was murdered by his court jester during the siege of the fortress. Episcopal vassals with the surname von Nassenfels are, however, recorded from 1198 onwards, but disappear again from literary sources in the mid-14th century. The present castle goes back mainly to its expansion under Bishops Conrad II of Pfeffenhausen (1297‚Äì1305) and Frederick IV of Oettingen (c. 1400). In 1699, the prince-bishop's court architect, Jakob Engel, built the Kastenhaus in the southeastern corner as an office building for the episcopal steward (Kastner). Until 1804, the castle served as the seat of Eichst√§tt officials (Amtm√§nner and pfleger. In the wake of secularisation, a revenue office (Rentamt) was created in the rooms for 2 years. In 1806, the Bavarian state sold the complex to private buyers, who built their own houses against the enceinte and demolished several buildings. In 1867, stone taken away to be used to build the stations of Adelschlag and Tauberfeld. In 1932, the Kastenhaus, with its stuccoed ceilings, was razed by a lightning strike. Plans to rebuild it came to nothing. In 1990, part of the chemin de ronde was reconstructed. Since the 1980s, the four Jura houses in the castle grounds have been restored. Today the interior of the castle is only open to the public on special occasions, because the structures of the late 18th and early 19th centuries are still used as residences and for trade (some holiday apartments and restoration workshop).  Description  The rectangular castle lies on the southern edge of the market village. The former wide moat has been largely filled in or has silted up. The western part of the mediaeval enceinte was pulled down in the 19th century and replaced by domestic buildings. On the other sides, the walls are still up to five metres high and there is a narrow zwinger in front of them. The original chemin de rondes have all disappeared, and the palas and the pfleger's house were demolished in the early 19th century. Since the fire in 1932, only the enclosing wall of the Kastnerhaus is left. The remaining structures in the interior date mostly to the 19th century. Despite the demolitions and losses, the former water castle is still one of the most important and impressive castle systems in Bavaria. In addition to the partially preserved enceinte, three wall towers and the high bergfried have survived. The four towers are capped by steeply pitched gable roofs. The gable walls are made of brick. The bergfried and East Tower have stepped gables. The unusually high bergfried was built over an older tower whose lower storeys form part of its walls. The inventories record this tower as an older bergfried. The ground floor of this old structure was converted into a castle chapel with a chancel arch and used to have a - largely hewn out - cross vault ceiling. In the south, there is a doorway in the walls. A small nave must have existed adjacent to the chancel arch. Apparently a small Romanesque chancel tower church was converted in 1300 into a massive bergfried. Later, a new chapel was built to replace it. This later chapel was secularised in 1808 and eventually demolished. The site of this second castle chapel is not precisely known. The bergfried is about 37 metres high to the roof ridge. Its circular arched elevated entrance is on the east side on the second floor. In front of it is a wall structure that used to carry the passageway from the demolished pfleger house to the entranceway. The tower is made of regular limestone ashlars, most of the rest of the castle is made of irregular rubble stone walls. Little research or investigation had been carried out into this large castle site until archaeological excavations took place in 1982. Within the castle area were discovered finds from the period from 70,000 BC to the Celtic era around 2,000 BC. At a depth of around a metre was found an old coral reef, 145 million years old, the so-called Speckberg.

Menon, 581 U.S. _ (2017), is a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court decided that the Hague Service Convention permits service of judicial process abroad by mail, provided that the country in which the service takes place has not objected to service by mail, and service by mail is authorized in the country where the litigation is pending., 137 S. Ct. 1504 (2017).  Background of the legal question  The Hague Service Convention (formally called the Convention on the Service Abroad of Judicial and Extrajudicial Documents in Civil or Commercial Matters) is an international treaty promulgated by the Hague Conference on Private International Law. The United States, along with dozens of other countries, is a party to the convention. The convention establishes procedures for the service of process in one country relating to civil or commercial litigation pending in another where both countries are parties to the convention. The default procedure authorized by the convention is to effectuate service through a \\"central authority\\" to be established by the government of each member country. Certain alternative methods (called article 8 or article 10 methods, based on their source in the convention) may also be allowed provided that the country where the litigation is pending allows that method of service, and the country where service is to be made has not objected to that method. Article 10 of the convention states (in its English version) that legal documents may be \\"sent\\" by mail. International review commissions of the Hague Service Convention and many countries that are party to the convention understood this provision as authorizing service of process by mail (unless the receiving country filed an objection to this method of service, which Canada had not done). In the United States, however, there was a split of opinions on this question among state and federal courts throughout the country.  Background of the case  This case arose Water Splash, Inc.‚Äìa water playground equipment manufacturer based in New York‚Äìsued Tara Menon‚Äìa Canadian citizen living in Quebec‚Äìin a Texas state court located in Galveston, Texas. The lawsuit claimed that while Menon was working as a sales representative for Water Splash, she also worked for competitor company South Pool and misused Water Splash's designs and drawings for the competitor's benefit. Menon maintained she never worked for a company called Water Splash Inc. but that she was an independent contractor and that the owner of Water Splash misrepresented himself and his company to her. The owner of Water Splash was a Canadian/Turkish citizen living in Montreal Canada. She was owed substantial monies for numerous contracts for which she was never paid by his Canadian company ABC Waterplay Inc., based in Montreal Canada. She claimed the lawsuit was an attempt to intimidate and avoid payments she was owed. She sued the owner of ABC Waterplay and Water Splash, Gokan Celik, in Montreal Superior court and had been paid a settlement in 2015. Water Splash had to serve process (the summons and complaint) upon Menon in order for its case to proceed. The Texas trial court judge signed an order allowing Water Splash to serve Menon in Canada through several means, including by certified mail. Service was made as the court directed, but Menon failed to answer or appear, and the court granted a default judgment in favor of Water Splash enjoining her from a variety of business activities and ordering her to pay $60,000 in damages, $60,000 in punitive damages, $32,000 in attorney's fees, interest, and costs of court. Menon then filed an answer in the case and a motion to set aside the default judgment against her, arguing that the service of process by mail was not authorized by the Hague Service Convention or by Texas state law; the trial court denied the motion and allowed the default judgment to remain. Menon appealed to the 14th Texas Court of Appeals in Houston, which reversed the trial court's default judgment by a 2-1 split decision. The majority opinion held that Article 10 of the Hague Convention does not authorize service of process by mail in cases covered by the convention. The dissenting opinion would have held that the Hague Service Convention does authorize service of process by mail in cases covered by the convention. The United States Supreme Court granted certiorari to resolve the question, because of the inconsistency of lower court decisions. Water Splash argued in the United States Supreme Court that the Hague Service Convention itself authorized service of process by mail making Texas service of process law irrelevant as to whether the default judgment was valid. In contrast, Menon argued that the convention did not authorize service of process by mail and that even if the convention permitted signatory countries under their local law to authorize service of process by mail, Texas law did not authorize service by mail and therefore no matter how the convention was interpreted the default judgment was invalid because it was based on improper service of process by mail which was authorized neither by the convention nor by Texas law. The Hague Conference and the Solicitor General filed amicus curiae briefs arguing that the Hague Service Convention permits signatory countries to authorize, under the signatories countries' local laws, service of process by mail. That is, the amicus curiae briefs argued that the convention does not itself authorize service of process between signatory countries by mail but permits signatory countries to adopt laws allowing for service of process, pursuant to the local laws, by mail. Oral argument was held on March 22, 2017. Jeremy Gaston of Houston, Texas, argued for Water Splash. Timothy A. Hootman of Houston, Texas, argued for Menon. Elaine J. Goldenberg of Washington D.C. argued for amicus curiae. Opinion of the court Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr. delivered the opinion of the court, which was unanimous (except that Justice Neil Gorsuch, who joined the court after this case was orally argued, did not participate). The Supreme Court vacated the Texas Court of Appeals' decision and held that international service of process by mail in a Hague Convention signatory country is permitted (but not authorized) by the convention, as long as the receiving country has not objected to that method of service. In holding that Article 10(a) allows service of process by mail, the court reasoned that \\"the scope of the Convention is limited to service of documents\\" and that Article 10's reference to \\"sending\\" documents by mail must, therefore, refer to a method of service.Water Splash, Inc. v. Menon, 137 S. Ct. at 1508-11. The opinion also relied on the drafting history of the convention, the executive branch's understanding of the treaty when it was negotiated, and the current views of the United States Department of State, as well as the understandings of other countries party to the treaty, all of which supported the court's interpretation.Water Splash, Inc. v. Menon, 137 S. Ct. at 1511-13. As for the important distinction between ‚Äúauthorizing‚Äù and ‚Äúpermitting‚Äù service of process by mail, the opinion states: ‚ÄúIn short, the traditional tools of treaty interpretation unmistakably demonstrate that Article 10(a) encompasses service by mail. To be clear, this does not mean that the convention affirmatively authorizes service by mail. Article 10(a) simply provides that, as long as the receiving state does not object, the convention does not ‚Äòinterfere with ‚Ä¶ the freedom‚Äô to serve documents through postal channels. In other words, in cases governed by the Hague Service Convention, service by mail is permissible if two conditions are met: first, the receiving state has not objected to service by mail; and second, service by mail is authorized under otherwise-applicable law.‚Äù The authorize/permit distinction thus puts the focus on whether the local law where a lawsuit is pending (in this case, Texas) authorizes service of process by mail; if it does, then service of process by mail is permitted under the convention although the convention itself does not authorize service by mail. Because of this, the court‚Äôs opinion did not resolve whether the default judgment against Menon should be set aside, and therefore, the case was remanded to the Texas 14th Court of Appeals to determine that state-law question.Water Splash, Inc. v. Menon, 137 S. Ct. at 1513. On remand, the Texas 14th Court of Appeals concluded that Texas law does not authorize service of process by mail and in a unanimous opinion reversed the trial court and set aside the default judgment.

The State of the World‚Äôs Children Report, Special Edition. New York, UNICEF. Where violent conflicts are the norm, the lives of young children are significantly disrupted and their families have great difficulty in offering the sensitive and consistent care that young children need for their healthy development. Studies on the effect of emergencies and conflict on the physical and mental health of children between birth and 8 years old show that where the disaster is natural, the rate of PTSD occurs in anywhere from 3 to 87 per cent of affected children.Garrison, C.

Child Abuse Neglect, Vol. 31, pp. 719-729.One or more of the preceding sentences incorporates text from the free content work  Impact of emergency and conflict experiences  In sum, emergency and conflict may impact on children's development in the following manner: * Physical: exacerbation of medical problems, headaches, fatigue, unexplained physical complaints. * Cognitive: trouble concentrating, preoccupation with the traumatic event, recurring dreams or nightmares, questioning spiritual beliefs, inability to process the event. * Emotional: depression or sadness, irritability, anger, resentfulness, despair, hopelessness, feelings of guilt, phobias, health concerns, anxiety or fearfulness. * Social: increased conflicts with family and friends, sleep problems, crying, changes in appetite, social withdrawal, talking repeatedly about the traumatic event, refusal to go to school, repetitive play. = Impact on pregnancy = Research shows that environmental factors and experiences can alter the genetic make-up of a developing child. Exposure to prolonged stress, environmental toxins or nutritional deficits chemically alter genes in the foetus or young child and may shape the individual's development temporarily or permanently. Violence and maternal depression may also impair child development and mental health.Walker, S. P., Wachs, T. D. et al. 2007. Child development: risk factors for adverse outcomes in developing countries. The Lancet, Vol. 369(9556), pp. 145-157. When trauma occurs at critical times of development for the foetus or young child, the impact on specialized cells for organs such as the brain, heart, or kidney can result in underdevelopment with lifetime implications for physical and mental health. For instance, a study on Iraq showed the rate of heart defects at birth in Fallujah to be 13 times the rate found in Europe. And for birth defects involving the nervous system the rate was calculated to be 33 times that found in Europe for the same number of births.Alaani, S., Adsfahani, M. S., Tafash, M., and Manduca, P. 2008. Four polygamous families with congenital birth defects from Fallujah, Iraq. In Save the Children, Protecting Children in a Time of Crisis. Annual Report. Prolonged stress during pregnancy or early childhood can be particularly toxic and, in the absence of protective relationships, may also result in permanent genetic changes in developing brain cells. Evidence has shown that toxins and stress from the mother cross the placenta into the umbilical cord,Balakrishnan, B., Henare, K., Thorstensen, E. B., Ponnampalam, A. P., Mitchell DPhil, M. D. 2010. Transfer of bisphenol A across the human placenta. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Vol. 202, pp. 393-395. leading to premature and low birth weight babies.Shonkoff, J. P., Boyce, W.

JAMA, Vol. 301(21), pp. 2252-2259. Likewise, conflict trauma can affect pregnant women and the subsequent emotional health of their children. In addition, babies of severely stressed and worried mothers are at higher risk to be born small or prematurely. = Impact on child development = Children's reactions to emergencies fluctuate depending on age, temperament, genetics, pre-existing problems, coping skills and cognitive competencies, and the dose of the emergency. Although most children are said to recover over time, if emergency reactions are left untreated, they can have a significant adverse impact on children's social, emotional, behavioural and physical development.Zubenko, W. N. and Capozzoli, J. 2002. Children in Disasters: A Practical Guide to Healing and Recovery, New York, Oxford University Press.  Age 6 and younger  In conflict-affected countries, the average mortality rate for children under 5 is more than double the rate in other countries. On the average, twelve children out of a hundred die before their fth birthday, compared with six out of a hundred. Common reactions among this age group are severe separation distress, crying, clinging, immobility and/or aimless motion, whimpering, screaming, sleeping and eating disorders, nightmares, fearfulness, regressive behaviours such as thumb-sucking, bed-wetting, loss of bowel/bladder control, inability to dress or eat without assistance, and fear of darkness, crowds and being left alone. During an investigation of the relationship between exposure to day raids and shelling and behavioural and emotional problems among Palestinian children, aged 3‚Äì6, in the Gaza Strip, children demonstrated sleeping problems, poor concentration, attention-seeking behaviour, dependency, temper tantrums and increased fear. Mothers of Palestinian kindergarten children reported severely impaired psychosocial and emotional functioning in their children.Massad, S., Nieto, F.

American Journal of Orthopsychiatry, Vol. 66, pp. 401-408. in a study on the effect of war on Lebanese pre-school children, found more problems in children aged 3‚Äì6 years exposed to heavy shelling over a 2-year period than in a control group living without this threat. According to Yaktine,Yaktine, U. 1978. Effect of war on Lebanese children: New trends in children‚Äôs culture. The Arabic Cultural Club, 119-121. (Arabic language) 40 mothers of different socio- economic backgrounds during the civil war in Beirut reported that their pre- school children became more anxious and fearful about bombardments and explosions. After Scud missile attacks, displaced Israeli pre-school children demonstrated aggression, hyperactivity and oppositional behaviour and stress. This was compared with non-displaced children and, despite a continuous decrease in symptom severity, risk factors identified shortly after the Gulf War continued to exert their influence on children five years after the traumatic exposure.Laor, N., Wolmer, L., Cohen, D. J. 2001. Mothers‚Äô functioning and children‚Äôs symptoms 5 years after a SCUD missile attack. American Journal of Psychiatry, Vol. 158, No. 7, pp. 1020-1026.  Ages 6 to 11  Common symptoms in this age bracket include disturbing thoughts and images, nightmares, eating and sleeping disorders, noncompliance, irritability, extreme withdrawal, outbursts of anger and fighting, disruptive behaviour, inability to pay attention, irrational fears, regressive behaviour, depression and anxiety, feeling of guilt and emotional numbing, excessive clinging, headaches, nausea and visual or hearing problems. Traumatic events experienced before the age of 11 are three times more likely to result in serious emotional and behavioural difficulties than those experienced later in life.Goodman, G.

Child Abuse and Neglect, Vol. 26(8), pp. 849-884. According to the Palestinian Counseling Centre, Save the Children, even six months after the demolition of their homes, young Palestinian children suffered from withdrawal, somatic complaints, depression/anxiety, unexplained pain, breathing problems, attention difficulties and violent behaviour. They were afraid to go to school, had problems relating to other children and greater attachment to caregivers. As a result, parents reported deterioration in educational achievement and ability to study. Al-Amine and Liabre Al Amine, A. and Llabre, M. 2008. The psychological conditions of children and youth in Lebanon after July 2006 War. Lebanese Association for Educational Studies, Kuwait Society for the Advancement of Arab Children. revealed that 27.7 per cent of Lebanese children aged between 6 and 12 suffered from symptoms of PTSD, as well as from problems sleeping, agitation, difficulties in concentrating and excessive awareness of events related to the 2006 Lebanese-Israeli war. Many children in Sudan and northern Uganda who were forced to witness family members being tortured and murdered exhibited stunting, PTSD and other trauma-related disorders. = Disabilities = Children with disabilities are disproportionately affected by emergencies, and many become disabled during disasters. Children with disabilities may suffer due to loss of their assistive devices, loss of access to medicines or rehabilitative services and, in some cases, loss of their caregiver. In addition, disabled children tend to be more vulnerable to abuse and violence. UNICEF research indicates that violence against children with disabilities occurs at annual rates at least 1.7 times greater than their able-bodied peers.UNICEF, 2005. Violence against Children with Disabilities: UN Secretary General‚Äôs Study on Violence against Children. New York, UNICEF. Young children with disabilities living in conflict are more vulnerable and the consequent physical, psychological or emotional problems are higher. They are also more likely to develop emotional and mental health problems during emergencies because of lack of mobility, treatment, and medication or through starvation.Miles, S. and Medi, E. 1994. Community based support for disabled children in post-war Mozambique. Disasters, Vol. 18, pp. 284-291. The Inter- Agency Standing Committee (IASC) recognizes that children with pre-existing disabilities are more vulnerable to mistreatment, discrimination, abuse and destitution. Children with mobility, visual and hearing disabilities or intellectual impairments may feel particularly vulnerable if an emergency leads to the relocation of school and the learning of new daily routines. During emergencies, long unsafe distances to school, the lack of buildings with adequate facilities and equipment and teachers with minimum qualifications, are likely to be overwhelming challenges for young children with disabilities to be enrolled in day care and early education. = Gender differences = Some research shows that girls exhibit higher levels of distress than boys in relation to stressful situations and are considered at higher risk in situations of war and terror. Other research has found that girls express more worry,Lengua, L. J., Long, A. C., Smith, K. I., and Meltzo, A. N. 2005. Pre-attack symptomatology and temperament as predictors of children‚Äôs responses to the September 11 terrorist attacks.

Children and disaster: age, gender, and parental e ects on PTSD symptoms. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Vol. 30, pp. 945-951. while boys show more behavioural problems in the aftermath of a disaster. However, pre-school girls exposed to earthquakes in Sultandagi (Turkey) displayed more problematic behaviours than boys in the same educational category. Additionally, Wiest, Mocellin, and MotsisiWiest, R. D., Mocellin, J. and Thandiwe Motsisi, D. 1992. The Needs of Women and Children in Emergencies. Winnipeg, University of Manitoba. contend that young children, especially girls, may be vulnerable to sexual abuse and exploitation. Garbarino and Kostelny reported that Palestinian boys suffered more than girls from psychological problems when exposed to chronic conflict. In another study, Palestinian boys were more susceptible to effects of violence during early childhood and girls during adolescence.Leavitt, L. A. and Fox, N. A. 1993. Psychological Effects of War and Violence on Children. Hillsdale, NJ, Lawrence Erlbaum Associates. In general it appears that boys take longer to recover, displaying more aggressive, antisocial and violent behaviour while girls may be more distressed but are more verbally expressive about their emotions. = Educational consequences = In all conflict- affected countries, 21.5 million children of primary school age are out of school. Over the past decade, the problem of out-of- school children has been increasingly concentrated in conflict-affected countries, where the proportion increased from 29% in 2000 to 35% in 2014; in Northern Africa and Western Asia, it increased from 63% to 91%.One or more of the preceding sentences incorporates text from the free content work Quality education alleviates the psychosocial impact of conflict and disasters by giving a sense of normalcy, stability, structure and hope for the future. However, emergency and conflict situations often undermine the quality of educational services. They result in shortages of materials, resources and personnel, thereby depriving young children of the opportunity to receive quality early education. In most conflicts, education infrastructure is usually a target. Pre-schools and schools are often destroyed or closed due to hazardous conditions depriving young children of the opportunity to learn and socialize in a safe place that provides a sense of routine.Obel, C. 2003. Epidemiological Studies of Stress during Pregnancy and Fetal Brain Development. Arhus, Denmark, University of Aarhus. Young children living under emergencies are less likely to be in primary school and more likely to drop out. Primary school completion in poorer conflict-affected countries is 65 per cent while it is 86 per cent in other poor countries. According to the 2000 UNICEF MICS report, information from Iraq, for example, confirms the lack of Early Childhood Development programmes within the formal educational system. Only 3.7 per cent of children aged from 36 to 59 months were enrolled in nurseries or kindergartens. Low enrollment rates in early education programmes decrease the opportunity for young children to find a safe space where they flourish and release the stress and tension resulting from the emergency. In countries with ongoing emergencies, researchers have found a full range of symptoms that may be co- morbid with trauma, including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, poor academic performance, behavioural problems, bullying and abuse, oppositional defiant disorder, conduct disorder, phobic disorder and negative relationships (Terr, 1991; Streeck-Fischer and van der Kolk, 2000).Terr, L. 1991.

Down will come baby, cradle and all: Diagnostic and therapeutic implications of chronic trauma on child development. Australian and New Zealand Journal of Psychiatry, Vol. 34, pp. 903-918. A study using the Young Lives data in Ethiopia found that young children whose mothers had died were 20 per cent less likely to enroll in school, 21 per cent less likely to be able to write, and 27 per cent less likely to be able to read.Himaz, Rozana.2009.

Vol. 72 (4), pp. 1214-1230. found that 5- to 6-year-old war-traumatized Bosnian children showed lower levels of cognitive competence. Pre-school and school age Palestinian children exposed to severe losses, wounding and home destruction suffered impaired cognitive capacity for attention and concentration.Qouta, S., Punamaki, R.L. and El Sarraj, E. 2005. Mother-child expression of psychological distress in acute war trauma. Clinical Child Psychology and Psychiatry, 2005, Vol. 10, pp. 135-156. Severe trauma has been found to be associated with inexcitable and narrowed attention and problem- solving strategies.Quota, S., Punam√§ki, R. L., and El Sarraj, E. 2008. Child development and family mental health in war and military violence: the Palestinian experience. International Journal of Behavioral Development, Vol. 32 (4), pp. 310-321. Since both physical and mental health are linked to language and cognitive development, it is reasonable to assume that violent conflict has a negative effect on these areas of development.  Supporting young children during emergency and conflict situations  Early childhood care and education (ECCE) is a multisectoral field that holistically addresses children's multiple needs. During emergencies ECCE supportive services may address a range of issues including prenatal care, immunization, nutrition, education, psychosocial support and community engagement. Coordinated services of health and nutrition, water sanitation and hygiene, early learning, mental health and protection are considered essential in supporting young children living under emergencies and conflicts. Many programmes and strategies, whether in the formal or non-formal education sector, have proved to be very supportive to the well-being and recovery of young children living in areas of conflict. Child Friendly Spaces (CFS) programmes have been found valuable in creating a sense of normality and providing coping skills and resilience to children affected by emergencies. Child Friendly Spaces help children develop social skills and competencies such as sharing and cooperation through interaction with other children. They also offer opportunities to learn about risks in their environment and build life skills, such as literacy and non- violent conflict resolution, and provide a useful means of mobilizing communities around children's needs. In an effort to strengthen community systems of child protection, Christian Children's Fund (CCF) established three centres for internally displaced young children in Unyama (Uganda) camp that provided a safe, adult-supervised place for young children between 3 and 6 years of age. War Child established six ‚Äòsafe spaces‚Äô in schools in northern Lebanon for displaced Syrian children where counsellors used art and music therapy to help young children express their emotions in a healthy way. Several studies show that children who have participated in quality education programmes within schools tend to have better knowledge of hazards, reduced levels of fear and more realistic risk perceptions than their peers.Llewellyn, D. 2010. Early Childhood Development Centre Curriculum Guide for Plan Indonesia. In such contexts, psychosocial intervention programmes for young children and their families are considered to be vital. Interventions such as storytelling, singing, jumping rope, role-play activities, team sports and writing and drawing exercises helped to reduce psychological distress associated with exposure to conflict-related violence in Sierra Leone for children aged 8 to 18. Studies in Eritrea and Sierra Leone revealed that children's psychosocial well-being was improved by well-designed educational interventions. In Afghanistan, young children and adolescents gained a sense of stability and security after their involvement in constructive activities (e.g. art, narrative, sports) which took place in neutral safe places within their communities.Dawes, A. and Flisher, A. 2009.

History George Wilcox (3 October 1838 ‚Äì 5 September 1917) was born in St Neots, Huntingdonshire, England, a son of master tailor and draper Joseph Wilcox, sen. He emigrated to South Australia, travelling to Melbourne by steamer SS Great Britain then arriving by coaster Admella in Adelaide in early 1859; his brother Joseph had emigrated in 1856 to join William Barker as a business partner. Soon after arriving, George opened a drapery and general store in Gawler as J. & G. Wilcox 1862‚Äì1872 with his father Joseph Wilcox handling the London end of the business. He also dealt in honey, beeswax, gum, bark, tallow and, later, wool. Joseph Wilcox, William Barker and George Wilcox traded in Gawler as Wilcox, Barker and Wilcox 1861‚Äì1862 then as J & G Wilcox 1862‚Äì1872. Joseph, sen., acted as London agent for some or all of this time. The drapery business was bought out by Joseph Wilcox & Co. in April 1872; Joseph Wilcox & Co. took over the Gawler produce store in October 1872. Joseph Wilcox & Co. became J. & J. Wilcox that same year. Joseph would later sell his business to Edward Lucas, with partners Hunt and Corry. William Barker (c. 1817 ‚Äì 29 August 1890) and George's brother Emery Wilcox traded as Barker and Wilcox in Gawler 1862‚Äì1864. Barker purchased Thomas Good's business at Mount Barker, and Emery Wilcox, whose fondness for alcohol made him unreliable, took to the roads as a hawker. In 1864 George returned to England, where he married Annie Fuller (or Fuller Caldecot) of Eynesbury, and returned to South Australia that same year by the City of Adelaide on her first voyage to the antipodes. In 1874 George moved to Adelaide, where he set up a business dealing in wool, hides, skins and other produce, and soon had branches in other States. He was in 1882 appointed general manager of the Apollo Soap and Stearine's new Thebarton factory, which however closed after a few years, then in 1887 was taken over by W. H. Burford & Sons. Sidney Wilcox began working for his father around 1880, and in 1889 was, with G. Glen Legoe, brought into the business as a partner. They founded a Sydney business operating at 136 Kent Street with local partners Henry Samuel Rickards and Frederick William Kugelmann, dissolved in November 1889. In January 1894 George retired, though maintaining an interest in the business until his last years, and brothers George Seaborn Wilcox and Murray Wilcox joined Sidney Wilcox and Legoe, retaining the business name of George Wilcox & Co. In 1917 George Wilcox & Co. and Mofflin & Co. of Sydney combined to become Wilcox, Mofflin Limited, with Murray Wilcox as the founding chairman of directors. Other directors were Sidney Wilcox, Legoe, L. M. Triggs, G. G. C. Millard and G. P. Sayers.

Darue Engineering & Mfg., 545 U.S. 308 (2005), was a United States Supreme Court decision. involving the jurisdiction of the federal district courts under 28 U.S.C. ¬ß 1331 (federal question jurisdiction).. Background In 1994, the Internal Revenue Service seized real property belonging to Grable & Sons Metal Products, Inc., to satisfy Grable's federal tax delinquency. The IRS sent notice of the tax sale by certified mail. At the tax sale the IRS sold the property to Darue Engineering and Manufacturing. Grable later brought a quiet title action in state court, alleging that the IRS sale was invalid. Grable argued that, under 26 U.S.C. ¬ß 6335, the IRS was required to give notice to Grable by personal service, not certified mail. Darue attempted to remove the case to Federal District Court. Darue argued that the federal district court had jurisdiction, because the claim of title depended on the interpretation of the notice statute in the federal tax law. Issue The question raised was whether the federal district courts have original federal question jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. ¬ß 1331 when a claim arises out of a federal statute that has not specifically granted a private right to a cause of action. Majority opinion The Court affirmed the Sixth Circuit and ruled that there was federal question jurisdiction. Justice Souter, writing for a unanimous court, held that the federal court had jurisdiction for the following reasons: *Whether Grable was given notice within the meaning of the federal statute was an essential element of the claim. This was the only legal or factual issue contested in the case. *The federal government had a strong interest in the prompt and certain collection of delinquent taxes. *The ability of the IRS to satisfy its claims from the property of delinquents required clear terms of notice to allow buyers like Darue to satisfy themselves that the IRS has touched the bases necessary for good title. *The Government thus had a direct interest in the availability of a federal forum to vindicate its own administrative action. *Because it will be the rare quiet title action that raises a contested matter of federal law, federal jurisdiction to resolve genuine disagreement over federal tax title provisions will portend only a microscopic effect on the federal-state division of labor.

The church is a Grade I listed building. History The church is dedicated to Botolph, a seventh-century abbot in East Anglia, who is a patron saint of travellers. The church was built by the south gate of medieval Cambridge, through which travellers from the south and west entered the town. The present building mostly dates from the fourteenth century and is built of flint and rubble with Barnack stone dressing. The octagonal font of 1637 has a splendid Laudian wooden cover. The tower was built in the fifteenth century. It is surmounted by stone figures representing the four evangelists (restored 1971) and has a sundial on the south-west buttress. The four bells were cast in 1460 and are still in use. The elaborate chancel was rebuilt in 1872 by the Victorian architect George Frederick Bodley and worked on by local artists Frederick Leach and G. Gray. It is a fine example of high Victorian decoration and was conserved and restored in 2008 with help from the Heritage Lottery Fund. Bodley also designed the lectern. The church has the only medieval rood screen remaining in a Cambridge parish church; its paintings date from the late 19th-century restoration. The South Chapel was refurbished in memory of those who died in the First World War. The war memorial window in the South Chapel was one of the earliest commissions of Rachel Tancock (later Rachel de Montmorency). The two-light window depicts St George and St Michael. The chapel also commemorates the First Eastern General Hospital, built at the outbreak of the First World War on what is now the Cambridge University Library site. There are memorials to Thomas Playfere (1609, Lady Margaret's Professor of Divinity), James Essex (architect), members of the Darwin family, and Sir Ernest Barker. On 26 April 1950, the church was designated a Grade I listed building. In the early hours of 4 February 2020 the church was broken into resulting in the destruction of an 1870 stained glass window by Charles Kempe, depicting Boltoph and Margaret of Antioch. In the first week of the church's online fundraiser over ¬£3,000 was raised to repair the window and secure the church against further incidents, alongside repairs to the church's roof which had been stripped of its lead by thieves several months prior. Present day The church is located at the intersection of Trumpington Street and Silver Street; the narrow Botolph Lane runs alongside the churchyard to the south and Corpus Christi College is to the north. The parish extends west, over the River Cam, into Newnham and includes several colleges.

Jackson was raised in a family of sharecroppers and obtained little formal education as a child. When he was sixteen years old, he left home and took work as a farmhand in Dale County, Alabama, where he settled and eventually earned enough to become a farmer and landowner on his own. He took an interest in the Sacred Harp tradition around the time he moved to Dale County, but his new employer would not allow him to attend the local singing schools, so he learned the technique from his peers instead. He was baptized into Christianity in 1902 and also married that year, and in 1904 began composing lyrics to shape note songs. By the early 1920s he had moved on to teaching and composing Sacred Harp music, in addition to organizing conventions for the music in the southeast United States. In 1934, in the midst of the Great Depression, Jackson self-published a 77-song compilation titled The Colored Sacred Harp, which included 18 of his own compositions (17 both words and music, and one music only) and 24 pieces he altered or arranged. Among the pieces in this collection is the Jackson composition \\"My Mother's Gone\\", which was eventually adopted into the Cooper revision in the late twentieth century. To finance the publication of The Colored Sacred Harp, Jackson and an associate, Bishop J.D. Walker, paid out of pocket to print 1,000 copies of the text; Jackson then sold the book door-to-door and via singing conventions and educational programs.

H√¥tel Mansencal History The Hotel Mansencal is a mansion located at 1 rue Espinasse, in the historic center of Toulouse. Constructed in the second quarter of the 16th century, between 1527 and 1547, for an important Toulouse parliamentarian, Jean de Mansencal, it was deeply altered in the following centuries. The fa√ßade on the garden in particular was mutilated by the destruction of three spans out of five. Description The street fa√ßade is pierced with rectangular windows with stone frames. The porte cochere, with its portal decorated with fluted pilasters, opens onto a courtyard formed by two buildings. The left wing consists of a staircase tower with a corner turret attached to it. This high tower of 30 meters has the shape of a regular square which nevertheless contains a circular staircase. The latter ends with a Corinthian pillar from which eight ribs support a cylindrical arch. The fa√ßade on the garden was the most impressive of the hotel and, although it retains only two spans out of the five that had been built, it retains its 16th century Renaissance elevation. The spans offer an example of superposition of orders on three levels, the pilasters actually develop in a traditional way: Doric, Ionic, Corinthian. The windows are inscribed in semicircular arches and have wide double-sided doorframes.

Description Ammonites of this genus had large shells. At the beginning of this evolutionary lineage, cross sectio. of shell was highly oval with rounded venter. Later, it has changed into subtriangular, or keeled. Ribs are curved sinusoidally and they are bending on the venter. During ontogeny, ribs are beginning to disappear from the sides. They are lasting the longest on the venter, mostly in the case of keeled specimens. Evolution Genus Funiferites is a single evolutionary lineage. Its predecessor is Longaeviceras alpha. This gave rise to F. allae that evolved into F. patruus. Descendant of that one is F. funiferi. Validity In 2002, few months before this genus has been erected, Ammonites funiferus, a type of Funiferites has been added into a new subgenus Chamousettia (Platychamousettia). Because of this, there is an opinion that Funiferites is only a junior synonym of subgenus Platychamousettia.Mitta, V. V. \\"On the phylogeny of Early Cardioceratidae (Ammonoidea) and Cadoceratinae from Central Russia at the Bathonian‚ÄìCallovian boundary.\\" Paleontological Journal 50.4 (2016): 358-368. This opinion is opposed by another one (which one is debated even in a paper in which Funiferites has been described), that Platychamousettia is not a valid taxon and that there are identification and stratigraphic problems in its establishing and it is only a synonym of genus Chamousettia.

It is also innovative: a central double staircase is substituted for the traditional spiral staircase included in a tower of the courtyard. The whole organization of the house, now thought around a median axis, is modified. This modern and probably pioneering distribution in Toulouse was somewhat disturbed by the opening of the access passage to the garden (18th or 19th century).

History The Bishopric of Chur was first founded in 451, when Asinio was made Bishop of Chur. In 1170, Emperor Frederick I raised the Bishopric of Chur to the title of Prince- Bishopric of Chur. In October 1621, Colonel Baldiron of Austria attacked the Prince-Bishopric of Chur, and the League of God's House as a whole, with 8,000 men. On November 22 of the same year, Baldiron and his soldiers captured Chur. In the ensuing peace deal, Austria took the Lower Engadine from Chur, and retained the right to station troops in Chur, and use their roads. On October 27, 1624, an army of 8,000 French and Swiss soldiers attacked the Austrians stationed at Chur, lead by the marquis de Coeuvres. Because Austria had pulled much of her garrison back during spring, the 8,000 strong army quickly overtook the Austrian skeleton garrison, and seized Chur and the surrounding land. During the time of the Transalpine campaigns of the Old Swiss Confederacy, the Prince-Bishopric of Chur took control of Valtellina, Bormio, and Chiavenna. Religion As an ecclesiastical state, their leader was appointed by the Pope. It is, however, known that at least once, in 1440, the Bishop-elect requested confirmation from the Archbishop of Mainz, rather than the current pope, Eugenius IV. In 1441 Heinrich von H√∂wen, who was already the Bishop of Constance, became the Bishop of Chur as well. On 12 January 1447, Pope Eugenius IV issued a papal bull to Emperor Frederick III, allowing him to nominate bishops for Chur, for the rest of his life.

In 1998, Naval Academy Preparatory School (NAPS) student Jay Rodriguez was assigned to create a chant to be used by his platoon and came up with \\"I believe that we will win!\\". It was first used during a NAPS basketball game against the United States Military Academy Preparatory School in Newport, Rhode Island. A year later, now a Naval Academy student, Rodriguez taught it to his classmate, cheerleader Corey Strong, who began using it during the 1999 Army‚ÄìNavy Game; in the fourth quarter of the 19‚Äì9 Navy victory, Strong led the 4,000-student Brigade of Midshipmen in the chant. In 2003, the Midshipmen team showed marked improvement over their 3‚Äì30 record in the last three years; during a game against the No. 25-ranked Air Force Falcons at FedExField, Navy students began reciting the chant as the Midshipmen won 28‚Äì25. In preparation for the Army‚ÄìNavy Game later that year, Navy sold T-shirts with the phrase written on them. The chant is currently performed by midshipmen in the closing stages of a victory. The chant eventually spread to other college sports, with fans of the Utah State Aggies men's basketball team adopting its usage in 2009. The Show of San Diego State University and Harvard Crimson students also performed it during games. Fans of various soccer clubs have also recited it, including the New York Red Bulls of Major League Soccer and French team FC Nantes. During the 2016 Ryder Cup, \\"U-S-A!\\" chants by American fans interspersed with calls of \\"I believe that we will win!\\" =United States soccer= According to Justin Brunken, co-founder of the U.S. soccer supporters' group The American Outlaws, he first heard the chant during a 2011 U.S. soccer game in Kansas City. He described it as \\"a chant that just grew from there and caught on and on. It resonated with the crowds across the country and became synonymous with what we believe in.\\" It eventually became a rallying call by fans of the United States national men's soccer team (USMNT). For the 2014 FIFA World Cup, ESPN used the chant in two commercials promoting the Cup, one depicting The American Outlaws and the other featuring figures like Kevin Costner, Ice Cube and Barry Sanders. The cheer was also acknowledged by members of the USMNT, with goalkeeper Tim Howard posting it on his Twitter and receiving almost 60,000 retweets during the 2014 World Cup, Alejandro Bedoya leading FC Nantes fans in it after home games, and former captain Landon Donovan doing so prior to the 2015 FIFA Women's World Cup final. The United States women's national soccer team went on to win the Cup after defeating Japan. During the 2015 World Cup victory parade for the United States women's national soccer team (USWNT), forward Abby Wambach led fans in a modified call of \\"I believe that we just won!\\" =San Diego State University trademark= Strong, who was taught the chant by Rodriguez, was later stationed in San Diego and earned his Master of Business Administration at San Diego State. In 2011, San Diego State clothing store Aztec Shops Ltd. attempted to trademark the phrase. Strong opposed the trademark, stating \\"everybody would be best served if they removed their attempt to trademark the cheer\\" and that the Naval Academy would be resisting it. In 2017, the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board rejected the trademark, saying it had been \\"widely used over a long period of time by various groups.\\" =Other sports= In 2014, Oakland Athletics fans regaled first baseman Stephen Vogt with a chant inspired by \\"I believe that we will win!\\", titled \\"I believe in Stephen Vogt!\\" In 2018, FiveThirtyEight referenced the chant in the title of an article about American's success in recent golf tournaments. =Non-sports usage= After the death of Osama bin Laden in 2011, the Naval Academy celebrated with Commandant Robert E. Clark II. Clark led the midshipmen in a modified chant of \\"I believe that we have won!\\" The chant has also seen use in protest, such as during the Occupy Wall Street march in 2011. The Florida- based organization Dream Defenders adopted the phrase for protests following the 2012 shooting of Trayvon Martin, used during a protest at the Florida state capital in 2012. Phil Agnew of the Dream Defenders also led the chant during the 50th anniversary of the \\"March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom\\" in 2013, leading to its nationwide prominence during Black Lives Matter protests between 2012‚Äì2016. On April 13, 2020, Pitbull released a promotional single titled \\"I Believe That We Will Win (World Anthem)\\" (which samples the \\"I believe that we will win!\\" chant) in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The song inspires those affected by the COVID-19 outbreak to lift themselves up and rise above the situation. The promotional single was premiered in full on April 12 on the virtual TrillerFest, and made its TV debut on April 13 on Good Morning America. An accompanying music video was also released.

Learners are called Robbies . History  The school is named after the late Mr. Rob Ferreira, then L.U.R. In the old Transvaal Province government. Uncle Rob, as he was well-known, was a community man who strived to establish facilities for the community. Through his vision and mediation, Rob Ferreira High School was established. At that time, the grounds on which the school building, the sports ground and the hostel were situated was part of a farm belonging to Oom Rob. He then cut 28 hectares from the farm and donated to the then Department of Education for the establishment of the new school Rob Ferreira High School grew like a loot from the old Witrivier Primary School, which changed status to a Junior High School in 1948. Thus, the school developed into an independent high school in 1954 with Mr. P. H. Cat as acting head. The school building was completed in 1954 and the residence in 1959.  Symbolism of Crest  The school colors as compiled in 1954 are GREEN, ORANGE and WHITE. Green: In the rehearsal symbolizes youth and hope. Orange: Symbolizes power and endurance. White: Symbolizes faith and purity. The Tree The High School has grown from the Primary School. The tree is anchored in our own soil. The Wild Fig on the crest is characteristic of the Lowveld. The Circle The orange background is symbolic of endurance as well as a reminder of the orange farms surrounding our town and school. Furthermore it refers to the never-ending cycle of a school. Year after year and generation after generation the task of a school is to prepare young people to make a significant contribution to society. The Hill LEGOGOTE - the pride of the White River escarpment has a significant place in our crest. The Sky This white element of the crest reminds that faith should always be placed above anything else. The White Lines These lines have been placed under LEGOGOTE and pays homage to the White River after which our town was named. Mascot Since the time of Langenhoven, the elephant became the symbol of the wonder of Afrikaans. In the square of the school is a small elephant replica mounted for decades. This elephant is an inseparable part of Rob tradition. He regularly changes color because he is regularly painted by the Robbies. Six of Rob's previous heads tried their best to stop this painting. Of course without success. A few years ago, Mr van Rensburg saw that this was not a fight he would ever win. It's a piece of tradition at Rob that could not be eradicated. He allowed the elephant to be painted. If it's Valentine's Day, he is pink painted with hearts. If the Blue Bulls play against the Lions, one day he is blue and the next day red and white. And so it goes on and on. But one thing is certain: his blood is definitely orange!

The school is subdivided into the Department of Ethnomusicology, the Department of Music, and the Department of Musicology. History With the creation in 1919 of an art gallery and music department, the UCLA leadership committed to offer the study of the arts in a liberal arts research university context. The College of Applied Arts was established in 1939 with the inclusion of an art department. In 1960, the college was renamed the College of Fine Arts, which carried departments of art, dance, music, and theater arts. In 1988, several big changes occurred in departments throughout the school: Ethnomusicology and Musicology separated from Music, while Design and Art History separated from Art. Art History and Musicology entered the umbrella of the Humanities division of the college while Design and Ethnomusicology remained in Fine Arts. UCLA Herb Alpert School of Music logo Then in 1991, the College of Fine Arts was disestablished, giving rise to two separate schools: the School of the Arts and the School of Theater, Film and Television. With the conjoining of architecture to the School of Fine Arts in UCLA's Professional School Restructuring Initiative in 1994, the school was then renamed the School of the Arts and Architecture. In 2014, a proposal was made for the creation of a School of Music for the college. The new school, called the Herb Alpert School of Music, created in 2016, would join the trio of ‚Äúindependence but complementary arts-centered‚Äù schools: the current School of Theater, Film, Television, a redefined School of the Arts and Architecture, and the new School of Music. In 2017, UCLA announced the Herb Alpert School of Music would establish the Lowell Milken Fund for American Jewish Music to support research and performance of American Jewish music. The name Herb Alpert School of Music was approved by the Board of Regents after the acceptance of a generous gift of $30 million from the Herb Alpert Foundation in 2007.  Facilities  The entire school is housed in either the Schoenberg Music Building, established in 1955 and 1965, and the Evelyn and Mo Ostin Music Center, a pair of buildings completed in 2014.[5] Schoenberg Music Building The Ostin Music Center at UCLA. Named in honor of former UCLA faculty member and composer Arnold Schoenberg, this facility houses the Dean's office, administrative offices for the three departments, most faculty offices, as well as two large theaters. Schoenberg Hall, which seats about 520, is the main auditorium of the Schoenberg building. The Jan Popper theater is a 140 seat house intended mainly for small performance groups and lectures, although it has been used for many other types of events.‚Äù Aside from the performance venues, Schoenberg Hall also contains the Henry Mancini Media Lab as well as the World Music Center. The World Music Center acts like a composing studio, a recording studio, and a classroom. The World Music Center includes the Ethnomusicology Archives, the World Musical Instrument Collection, and is home to publications by the Ethnomusicology department. Additionally, the building contains a keyboard lab, a computer lab, six classrooms, 36 practice rooms, an orchestra room, a band room, a choral room, the headquarters office of the UCLA Thelonious Monk Institute of Jazz Performance as well as the Music Library. Evelyn and Mo Ostin Music Center The Evelyn and Mo Ostin Music Center, completed in 2014, ‚Äúincludes a high-tech recording studio, spaces for rehearsal and teaching, a caf√© and social space for students, and an Internet- based music production center.‚Äù[10] Paid for in part by a $10 million donation by Music Industry Executive and Philanthropist Morris ‚ÄúMo‚Äù Ostin and his late wife, Evelyn Ostin, to his alma mater, the center was designed by LA-based architects Daly Genik Architects under the direction of principal Kevin Daly. The center was honored in 2016 at the 46th Annual Los Angeles Architectural Awards by Los Angeles Business Council.  Ensembles  The Herb Alpert School of Music has 45 active ensembles that perform classical, contemporary, jazz, popular and world music. Under the direction of performance faculty, students also premiere new works, including those by established composers, students, faculty and alumni. = Chamber Ensembles = Chamber ensembles at UCLA include Brass Ensemble, Camarades, Early Music Ensemble, FLUX Contemporary Ensemble, Guitar Ensemble, Percussion Ensemble, and Woodwind Chamber Ensemble. = World Music Ensembles = World Music Ensembles include Afro-Cuban Ensemble, Irish Music Ensemble, Klezmer Music Ensemble, Mariachi de Uclat√†n, Music of Bali, Music of China, Music of India, and many others.  Sister Institutes  Institute Of Ethnomusicology Founded in 1960, the Institute of Ethnomusicology was established under the supervision of Dr. Mantle Hood by UCLA Chancellor Gene D. Block. Mantle Hood brought to the program a belief that ‚Äúethnomusicology includes the musical practice, and \\"instrument\\" is interpreted in its literal meaning.

After beginning a dentistry career in Australia and New Zealand, Hunt traveled to the United States where she earned her A.M. in Physical Anthropology at Radcliffe College and began researching public health and radiation biology. In 1964, Hunt discovered that polonium 210 is a natural contaminant of tobacco, providing additional evidence for the link between smoking and bronchial cancer. In 1974, she wrote a 121-page report on workplace hazards for pregnant women, which made the front page of the New York Times. She published a book, Work and the Health of Women, in 1979. From 1979 to 1981, Hunt served as an administrator for the United States Environmental Protection Agency, enacting public health solutions to environmental contamination at sites like Love Canal, New York, and Three Mile Island Nuclear Generating Station, Pennsylvania. Hunt retired in Gloucester in 1985, though she served as an environmental consultant and visiting lecturer until her death. Personal life Vilma Hunt was born in Sydney on November 15, 1926. She is the daughter of Margaret Rose (Lynch) Dalton-Webb and William Dalton-Webb, an electrician. When Vilma was seven years old, the Dalton-Webb family moved to Kempsey, New South Wales. She attended public school and graduated from high school in 1942. After graduation, during World War II, she enlisted in the women's auxiliary branch of the Royal Australian Air Force. In 1952, Vilma travelled to Boston to study dentistry. She met Edward Eyre Hunt, Jr. at the Forsyth Dental Infirmary. They married in 1952, moved to Gloucester, Massachusetts, and had four children: Margaret, William, Louise, Catherine and Martine (a foster daughter). Margaret would later become the chair of the women and gender studies department at Amherst College. Vilma and Edward retired in 1985. Career =Dentistry= Vilma Hunt began her career as a dentist. She earned her Bachelor of Dental Surgery at the University of Sydney in 1950, and served as a Junior Dental Officer with the New Zealand Department of Health from 1950 to 1952. She accepted a scholarship to study dentistry at Harvard University in 1952. =Anthropology and public health= After studying, interning, and lecturing on dentistry for several years, Hunt began studying anthropology. She earned her A.M. in Physical Anthropology from Radcliffe College in 1958 and began to conduct research with the Radcliffe Institute for Independent Study, from 1961 to 1963, and the Harvard School of Public Health, from 1962 to 1966. She received additional training in radiation biology from the Argonne National Laboratory, in Illinois, in the summer of 1963. While at HSPH, Hunt tested a cigarette butt for radiation, on a hunch. She discovered high levels of Polonium-201, a radioactive element, and launched an investigation alongside colleague Edward P. Radford. The pair published their findings, titled \\"Polonium-210: A Volatile Radioelement in Cigarettes\\" in Science. The article came out on January 17, 1964‚Äì‚Äìjust six days after the surgeon general's report on the dangers of smoking was released. In 1964, Hunt was elected to Phi Beta Kappa. =Academia= Hunt taught and lectured for over three decades. From 1967 to 1969, she served as Assistant Professor of Environmental Health at the Yale University School of Medicine. From 1969 to 1972, she served as Assistant and Associate Professor of Environmental Health at Pennsylvania State University, where she was granted tenure in 1972. She would return to become Professor of Environmental Health from 1982 to 1985 before leaving to become a Mellon Research Fellow at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1984. She received the National Endowment for the Humanities award in 1985. =Advocacy for Women= Outside of the classroom, Hunt conducted research into chemical hazards in the workplace, particularly in relation to reproductive health. On April 30, 1974, she published a 121-page report for the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare titled \\"Occupational Problems of Pregnant Women.\\" Within the report, she wrote \\"We are all responsible for the health of future generations and we can no longer ignore a fact of life‚Äì‚Äìreproduction and work are women's lot.\\" Elsewhere, she details the poor working conditions and hazardous exposures present in factories and shows their correlation to high infant mortality rates, birth defects, and miscarriages. Differing from previous research on the subject, she also includes male fertility in her research, demonstrating that high levels of radiation negatively affect male sperm count. Her report was read across the nation, and on March 14, 1976, it made the front page of New York Times. A few years later, in 1979, Hunt published A Brief History of Women Workers and Hazards in the Workplace. In it, she discussed changing attitudes towards women's health concerns and the treatment of women in factories, and called for labor regulations to protect women from benzene, a toxic chemical. She commented on how quickly the presence of women in lead factories declined, after it was revealed that lead had disastrous effects on children and the reproductive system. Hunt attributed the slow-changing pace of laws around benzene factories to the lack of definitive research on whether benzene affects the fetus. Hunt criticized the government's slow action and called for the improvement of factory conditions, rather than the removal of women from the industry. =Environmental protection= Hunt also worked in conservation. She served on the Science Advisory Board of the United States Environmental Protection Agency from 1978 to 1979, where she was tasked with investigating and explaining chemical poisoning and radiation at environmental contamination sites, including the now-infamous Love Canal, NY, and Three Mile, PA. =Retirement= After she retired in 1985, Hunt became active in Gloucester local government, and served as a curator at the Magnolia Historical Society. She researched the history of uranium, and with the help of Harvard student Melissa Inouye, she began a book on the topic. At the time of Hunt's death in 2012, the text was incomplete.

Nowadays it is part of the Oratory of St Joseph. History Originally the chapel was used for Roman Catholic services and was dedicated to St Catherine of Alexandria. The arrival of the Greek population from the island of Rhodes in 1522 brought a need for new places of worship. The Greeks came with the Knights upon expulsion from Rhodes. They settles in Birgu. With agreement from the Bishop of Malta, the chapel of St Catherine, together with the chapels of St George and the Visitation, respectively, were given to the Greeks for their own use of divine services according to the Byzantine tradition. The name of the chapel was changed in 1575 when inquisitor Pietro Dusina officially established the chapel of St Catherine as one of the parish churches of the Greek population of Birgu. The name comes from the icon of Our Lady of Damascus which was brought from Rhodes and put in the chapel as the titular instead that of St Catherine. Nowadays the original icon is found in the Greek Catholic church of Our Lady in Valletta where it was moved in 1587. The chapel continued to be used by the Greek population until 1780. On February 24, 1832 the chapel was bought by the fraternity of St Joseph who adjoined the chapel to their own adjacent oratory church dedicated to St Joseph. However, the chapel was conserved in its original state, with the original altar and icon, the latter was commissioned to replace the original icon which wa transferred to Valletta.

The 48-bed hospital is located south of downtown Arlington on a property; Cascade Valley also operates five medical clinics and a freestanding ambulatory surgery center. History The Arlington General Hospital was built in 1909 as the first hospital-specific building in Snohomish County. A new hospital, named Cascade Valley, was built at the current campus in 1958, and was incorporated into the Snohomish County Public Hospital District No. 3 in 1964. The hospital campus was rebuilt in 1987, and the district later expanded to cover most of northern Snohomish County in 1996. A major $45 million renovation was completed in 2010, adding a new building and remodeling the hospital to expand emergency services to accommodate a growing number of patients. A helipad was built in 2015 to accommodate airlifted patients. In the 2010s, Cascade Valley remained as the last independent hospital in Snohomish County. The hospital announced in 2013 that it would merge with PeaceHealth, but the merger was cancelled by PeaceHealth over issues with electronic records. After evaluating new partners, including UW Medicine and Providence Health & Services, Cascade Valley announced in 2016 that it would merge with Skagit Regional Health, the operator of Skagit Valley Hospital in Mount Vernon. The two hospitals had already partnered in 2011 to build a medical clinic in Smokey Point, near Arlington, and Skagit has run outpatient chemotherapy programs for Cascade in the past.

Hodges decision on marriage equality (2015) The Running of the Interns is a Washington, DC, tradition, sometimes called a race, that involves interns of news outlets running to deliver results of major decisions by the Supreme Court of the United States to the press. Many media outlets have made note of this, including Buzzfeed, Newsweek, NPR and Cosmopolitan. History Since 1946, recording devices have been banned inside the courtroom of the United States Supreme Court Building. Thus, hand-delivered, paper copies remain the fastest way for news organizations to receive a particular landmark ruling. The Supreme Court's decision is printed and delivered to a clerk's office, where it is handed to members of the press. Interns are not credentialed and must therefore wait in the hallway outside the press room. Producers hand the paper copy rulings to their network interns, who sprint to deliver them to their respective organizations. The run itself is approximately , from the courtroom to broadcasters awaiting outside. Supporters and protestors alike cheer on the delivery of the opinions. According to one intern, justices may still be announcing the decision by the time they are back inside. The interns often run wearing sneakers and business casual suits or skirts in heat. In 2015, the interns were briefly removed after a CNN intern was caught by Supreme Court Police recording video footage with a GoPro camera. In 2016, interns relayed 13 decisions over three mornings.

He served as band master of a number of bands in both countries and was a significant composer and arranger of brass band music. He also was an adjudicator at brass band contests. He is also believed to have written vocal music. He is not to be confused with American banjoist and composer H. C. Trussell (of Quincy, Ill.) who was also active in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Biography =Early life= Trussell commenced his musical education in a school boys band in London from the age of 11 playing tenor horn. At 14 he enlisted in the British Army as a band boy and served with the 2nd Battalion of the 14th Regiment of Foot and later the Prince of Wales Regimentp69, Challenging Brass, 100 Years of Brass Band Contests in New Zealand, by S.

During this time he played euphonium and studied musical composition and harmony. =Australia= In 1887, after 13 years service in the army, Trussell followed relatives to Australia and settled in Maryborough, before moving to Tasmania. Shortly thereafter he was appointed conductor of the Latrobe Brass (later Federal) Band. He also became conductor of the Deloraine Band, conducted a church choir, and later on entertained as part of a group called the Federal Minstrels. In 1895 he was married to Minnie Ada Biggins (b.1863 in Tasmania) =New Zealand= In 1895, Trussell moved to New Zealand settling in Auckland where he was appointed band master of the Newton (later Auckland Battalion) Band. He also judged band contests, the first being the 1897 Goldfields Band Contest in Te Aroha.\\"Papers Past\\" Ohinemuri Gazette, Paeroa, 3 February 1897 He was a prominent member of the North Island Brass Band Association.

B. B. A. (1907)), arrangements of operatic selections for contests (including L‚Äô Ebreo (1904) and La Traviata (1906)) and a fantasias Concordia (1903) and The Tournament (1906). He also competed in lawn bowling competitions in the region.\\"Papers Past\\" The New Zealand Herald, Auckland, 17 December 1906. In April 1907 Trussell hosted the prestigious Besses o' th' Barn Band from England as part of their world tour. Shortly after this, in May 1907, he and his wife were farewelled from Waihi where the town presented him with a marble clock in recognition of the contribution made to the town. Silver hair brushes were presented to his wife. In the press and in band circles, Trussell had become known as \\"the New Zealand March King\\".\\"Papers Past\\" Trussell described as New Zealand March King and N. I. B. B. A. as even better than Rimutaka and Mt Egmont Otago Witness, Dunedin, 11 December 1907 Confusion has arisen about a later band master of the Waihi Federal Band. Between 1910 and 1914, and again in 1925, the band master was a Mr. T. Russell. It has been assumed that Trussell and Russell were in fact the same person with Trussell's name being a contraction of T. Russell used for composing purposes. It seems this is a misunderstanding and that Charles Trussell and T. Russell appear to be two different people, as both apparently were conducting different bands in different places at the same time. Mr. T. Russell, like Trussell, appears to have originally come from England, but when he returned in 1925, he is recorded as having come back from England. He also apparently returned to England due to ill health. Charles Trussell would have been both coming from and returning to Australia rather than England at this time. =Return to Australia= In 1907 Trussell moved back to Australia, this time settling in Ipswich, Queensland. He was appointed conductor of the Ipswich Vice-Regal Band, a position he held until his retirement in 1923. His wife died aged 58 in 1925 after an illness. He then moved to live near Bauple, Queensland. He continued playing with bands and was active composing and arranging (mostly contest pieces for brass bands) during this time receiving high praise for the quality of his music, especially his various selections from Verdi operas Charles Trussell died on 23 December 1946 aged 85. He is buried in Maryborough Cemetery. Known works This list is most likely incomplete. All works listed are composed or arranged for brass band unless otherwise stated. Included are works by the pseudonymous Carlile Vernon. These works are indicated and are believed to be composed by Charles Trussell, but it has also been suggested they are works by Welsh composer William Carlile Bawden (b.1857, d.1925).

This is done either exactly for very light nuclei (up to four nucleons) or by employing certain well- controlled approximations for heavier nuclei. Ab initio methods constitute a more fundamental approach compared to e.g. the nuclear shell model. Recent progress has enabled ab initio treatment of heavier nuclei such as nickel. A significant challenge in the ab initio treatment stems from the complexities of the inter-nucleon interaction. The strong nuclear force is believed to emerge from the strong interaction described by quantum chromodynamics (QCD), but QCD is non-perturbative in the low-energy regime relevant to nuclear physics. This makes the direct use of QCD for the description of the inter- nucleon interactions very difficult (see lattice QCD), and a model must be used instead. The most sophisticated models available are based on chiral effective field theory. This effective field theory (EFT) includes all interactions compatible with the symmetries of QCD, ordered by the size of their contributions. The degrees of freedom in this theory are nucleons and pions, as opposed to quarks and gluons as in QCD. The effective theory contains parameters called low-energy constants, which can be determined from scattering data. Chiral EFT implies the existence of many-body forces, most notably the three-nucleon interaction which is known to be an essential ingredient in the nuclear many-body problem. After arriving at a Hamiltonian H (based on chiral EFT or other models) one must solve the Schr√∂dinger equation :H\\\\vert{\\\\Psi}\\\\rangle = E \\\\vert{\\\\Psi}\\\\rangle , where \\\\vert{\\\\Psi}\\\\rangle is the many-body wavefunction of the A nucleons in the nucleus. Various ab initio methods have been devised to numerically find solutions to this equation: * Green's function Monte Carlo (GFMC) * No-core shell model (NCSM) * Coupled cluster (CC) * Self-consistent Green's function (SCGF) * In-medium similarity renormalization group (IM-SRG) Further reading  References  Nuclear physics ","title":"Ab initio methods (nuclear physics)"},{"id":"53589150","text":"is a role-playing video game developed by Pokelabo for Android and iOS.

He graduated from the University of Vienna. After ordination, his served in a parish and the diocesan chancery before being appointed coadjutor bishop in 1950. Consecrated in May 1950 by Cardinal Theodor Innitzer, he served in that office until his retirement in 1983. Biography =Early life and education= J√°chym was born on 3 September 1910 in Vienna, Austria-Hungary. Orphaned at age eight, in 1925 he entered the Knabenseminar Hollabrunn , a minor seminary in Vienna. He passed the matriculation examination on 20 June 1931, and entered the Seminary of Vienna , and also studied theology at the University of Vienna. In the late 1930s he returned to the University of Vienna to study moral theology, earning his Doctor of Divinity on 3 December 1941. =Priesthood= J√°chym was ordained a priest on 19 July 1936. Three months after ordination, he was sent to Purkersdorf, where he served as parochial vicar of the parish there until returning to work in the chancery of the Archdiocese of Vienna soon after. On 7 October 1938, he participated in the Rosary demonstration , a demonstration in which 6,000 Catholics came together for a rosary devotion in protest of the Nazi occupation of Austria. The next day, Nazi soldiers stormed and vandalized the Episcopal Palace in Vienna, and Jachym was injured in the violence that ensued. On 10 May 1947, J√°chym earned habilitation, and in 1949 he was appointed professor of Catholic moral theology at the University of Vienna. =Episcopacy= On 20 January 1950, J√°chym was appointed Coadjutor Bishop of Vienna and Titular Archbishop of Vienna. He arrived at St. Stephen's Cathedral for what was supposed to be his episcopal consecration on 23 April 1950. However, before the ceremony could take place, he stood up and addressed the congregation, saying that he did not \\"feel worthy of such an honor\\", before leaving the cathedral, where a car was waiting for him, and returning to his apartment. Later, canons of the cathedral recalled that the purple robe, the biretta, and shoes he was wearing were not even his, but were borrowed from the cathedral sacristy. J√°chym firmly declined to become a bishop, but Pope Pius XII refused to accept his decision. His consecration was rescheduled to 19 May 1950, and took place in Rome and the church of Santa Maria dell'Anima. Archbishop of Vienna Cardinal Theodor Innitzer was principal consecrator, with bishops Michael Keller and Alois Hudal serving as co-consecrators. While there are varying accounts as to why J√°chym chose to reject his episcopal consecration in the first place, he did remain loyal to his office and to the archbishop, both Innitzer and his successor, Cardinal Franz K√∂nig. As coadjutor bishop, he led the building department of the Archdiocese of Vienna, building new churches and commissioning artwork. From 1952-56, he served as Chairman of the Austrian Bishops' Conference. In 1956, he took over leadership of the archdiocesan offices. From 1963-65, he took part in the Second Vatican Council. From 1 September 1969 to 31 December 1980, he was vicar general of the archdiocese, succeeding Jakob Weinbach. On 30 September 1972, he became dean of St. Stephen's Cathedral and Chancellor of the Faculty of Catholic Theology at the University of Vienna. On 15 September 1983, he resigned from his positions, aged 73.

He died on 29 November 1984 of heart failure in an open-air market in Vienna, aged 74. He was buried in a tomb in St. Stephen's Cathedral in Vienna. In 1992, the Franz-J√°chym-Platz (Franz J√°chym Place) in Vienna was named for him and a monument erected in his honor.

As the first African American woman to receive a doctorate in religious education, Stokes was a pioneer in her field dedicated to empowering disenfranchised and underrepresented groups. A majority of her work reflects her primary role as a religious educator, her commitment to develop leadership training, and her efforts to eliminate negative stereotypes of women and African Americans. She was also an avid student of African cultures, and developed programs to promote understanding of African civilizations.  Early life  Olivia Pearl Stokes was born in Middlesex, North Carolina, on January 11, 1916, on the Stokes Place‚Äîa collection of farmland owned by the Stokes family, known across the county as one of the few upper middle-class black property owning families in North Carolina.Keely, Barbara Anne. (1997). Faith of Our Foremothers: Women Changing Religious Education. Westminster John Knox Press. P. 100 She was the second eldest and the first daughter of four children to Bessie Thomas Stokes Vann, a schoolteacher (b. 1893) and William Harmon Stokes (d. 1923) and one child to Bessie Thomas Stokes Vann and Lester Lee Vann. Her siblings are Clarence (d. 1970), Bernice (d. 1943), Beatrice, and Lester (d. 1946). After the death of Olivia's father when Olivia was 7, Bessie Thomas Stokes Vann sold their land and moved the family to Harlem, New York in 1925 for the goal of educating her children, where they joined the Abyssinian Baptist Church. From an early age, Stokes grew up educated and immersed in both Christian Baptist and African culture and values, impressed upon by her mother, who wanted a religious experience for children and emphasized leadership in the community.Black Women Oral History Project.

Fordham University p. 20 Bessie Thomas Stokes was remarried in New York to Lester Lee Van, a deacon at Union Baptist in New York. Olivia's childhood outside of school was spent at Abyssinian Baptist, the first black church in America with a master's degree educated director of religious education as well as at the Young Women's Christian Association (YWCA), both blocks away from Olivia's family home.Black Women Oral History Project.

Schlesinger Library, Radcliffe Institute, Harvard University, Cambridge, Mass. p. 6  Education  Stokes started elementary school in New York at Public School 89, during the time period when the school had welcomed its first black woman principal, Gertrude Ayers. Stokes and Ayres remained close friends after Stokes had matriculated. She was greatly influenced by writers, scholars, missionaries, and community activists starting from an early age including W. E. B. DuBois, Walter White, Lester Granger, and Mattie Mae Davis, and she wrote, \\"In the black community, the average person had always been fearful of approaching great leaders. But we were taught as children that we were as great as anybody.\\" Black Women Oral History Project. Interviews, 1976‚Äì1981. Olivia Pearl Stokes. OH-31. Schlesinger Library, Radcliffe Institute, Harvard University, Cambridge, Mass. p. 11 She went on to attend Junior High 136, where her white English teacher, a Mrs. Wright, encouraged her to apply to Hunter College High School, a school for gifted scholars. She matriculated to Hunter College in the 10th grade, where she and Barbara Watson (daughter of Judge James S. Watson, one of the first two Black Americans elected as a judge in New York) were the only two Black students. After her stepfather's death, Olivia transferred to Wadleigh High School without telling her mother, given the changing financial situation that would befall the family. After graduating from Wadleigh, Olivia went to City College for the next 12 years, taking night classes while working full-time first at the YWCA and then at the Baptist Educational Center. She graduated from her undergraduate work after shifting to New York University (NYU) for her final year in 1947 with a degree in Presocial Work and Education. She finished her master's degree in Religious Education in 1948. After receiving her master's degree, Stokes was offered a fellowship (Ed.D. in Religious Education) at Columbia University's Teachers College and graduated at the highest grade level after defending her dissertation in 1952 and became the first African American woman to earn a doctorate in Religious Education from Columbia University. Her dissertation analyzed and made recommendations on the leadership education of Protestant churches across the city of New York. The research focused primarily on the Baptist Education Center and its training programs, given her close working relationship with the Center throughout her educational career.Black Women Oral History Project.

Westminster John Knox Press. p. 103  Family background and social life  Olivia Pearl Stokes was born into the Stokes family, a free upper-middle-class Black family that greatly valued education, community involvement, and the Christian faith. These tenets shaped her upbringing, and from an early age, Olivia's identity and values were tied to her family.Keely, Barbara Anne. (1997). Faith of Our Foremothers: Women Changing Religious Education. Westminster John Knox Press. p. 100 She spent her early childhood on Stokes Place, a collection of hundreds of acres that belonged to the Stokes family‚Äîone of the only Black property owning families in North Carolina. Though their initial acquisition of land is unclear, the Stokes grew their landholding significantly over the years. The Stokeses were well known in the county as employers, employing a number of both white and Black employees throughout the seasons. After Olivia's paternal grandfather, T.O. Stokes, died, he gave land to erect the Stokes Chapel (now a federal landmark on Route 64). Furthermore, Olivia is 5th cousins with Bishop Anson Phelps Stokes, who was head of the Episcopal church in Massachusetts. As for her maternal heritage, Olivia's great-great-grandfather, William Allen Thomas, was the first and only white Chief of the Cherokee Indians, making Olivia ‚Öõ Cherokee Indian. Thomas also served as a member of the North Carolina state legislature and Congress.Black Women Oral History Project. Interviews, 1976‚Äì1981. Olivia Pearl Stokes. OH-31. Schlesinger Library, Radcliffe Institute, Harvard University, Cambridge, Mass. pp. 5‚Äì10 Throughout her childhood growing up in the Black church (Abyssinian Baptist Church), Olivia and her siblings were taught to understand the contribution that Africa has in the world, as well as the African patterns of life, the rules, culture, crafts, and governments. Out of her siblings, Olivia was closest to her sister Beatrice. The two girls shared common interests and spent a great deal of time together despite their differences in personality: even as a child, Olivia was strong-minded and outspoken while her sister was considered more \\"gentle\\". The sisters' friendly history contrasts with Olivia's strained relationship to her brother, Clarence. In her writings, Olivia has little compassion for her brother's struggles with alcoholism and seems disappointed in how he lived his life. Very little is said about Olivia's relationship with her other siblings, Bernice and Lester.Dease Lee, Violet L. (2012). A Model of Leadership for Black/ African American Women In Religious Education: A Study of the Legacy of Olivia Pearl Stokes. Fordham University. pp. 21‚Äì23 Despite never getting married, Olivia spent her life immersed in her work both in the ministry and in education, deriving much joy from nurturing learning and curiosity in her students and peers.Hill, R.E. (Ed.). (1991). Black women oral history project (Vol. 9). Westport: Meckler. p. 114  Early career  Stokes began her career in 1935, as director of the information desk at YWCA. She worked there until 1941, when she was offered the position of associate director of the Baptist Educational Center, a school that provided training programs for ministers and the parishes of 157 churches. The school trained over 500 Baptists‚Äîwho were mostly black‚Äîacross Harlem every week. During this period of time, she also acted as president of the New York State Christian Youth Conference, and became secretary of the Youth Movement in 1941.Black Women Oral History Project. Interviews, 1976‚Äì1981. Olivia Pearl Stokes. OH-31. Schlesinger Library, Radcliffe Institute, Harvard University, Cambridge, Mass. = Notable connections = Through Olivia's long-time work in the Christian community and network, Stokes befriended a number of influential academics, activists, and artists in the New York area. These acquaintances included, but were not limited to: Benjamin Mays, the former leader of the academic community in Atlanta, who authored a number of papers and columns about the Black community Fred Patterson, the former head of the United Negro College Fund Marian Anderson, the first African-American soloist in 1941 to sing at the New York Metropolitan Opera Langston Hughes, the renowned poet, novelist, and activist Jackie Robinson, the first African American baseball player to play in the MLB Ella Fitzgerald, the American jazz singer.Black Women Oral History Project. Interviews, 1976‚Äì1981. Olivia Pearl Stokes. OH-31. Schlesinger Library, Radcliffe Institute, Harvard University, Cambridge, Mass. pp. 17‚Äì18  Massachusetts Council of Churches and National Council of Churches  In 1953, Stokes became Director of the Department of Religious Education of the Massachusetts Council of Churches. She was the only black staff member on the Massachusetts Council, and she held a position generally held by white men. Upon taking this position, she noted that people thought they had to give up their religion and values in order to work during the summer months. She also faced other problems, including miseducation of religious teachings by clergy, under-educated clergy, and black middle class Protestants who hadn't given up on the faith but who had given up on the institutional church. To address these issues, she designed and directed an education program for Protestants at resort center churches. These programs held classes at hours staggered from workers' schedules to allow workers to not have to give up the religion because of work. She also worked with the well-educated and religiously diverse staff‚Äîincluding Greeks, fundamentalist Christians, Pentecostals, liberal Christians, and more‚Äîto produce education books to be used in churches. During her time working in the Massachusetts Council of Churches, Stokes taught four courses in the Christian ministry program at Harvard, as well as taught as a guest lecturer at Andover Newton Theological School and Boston University. Additionally, she acted as guest consultant in early childhood programs at Tufts University. When the president of the Urban League asked her to speak about her work to his board, she saw this opportunity as a chance to prove that black leadership can be as effective as white leadership. She pushed for more speaking time to the board, which eventually won her the opportunity to minister in the Massachusetts Senate. This marked the first time that a woman had led the prayers at the opening of the senate. In 1966, Stokes accepted ordination in the American Baptist Church, after over two decades of refusing ordination invitations because she felt that she had more influence as an educator than as a female minister who would be discriminated against by male clergy. After ordination, she resigned her position in the Massachusetts Council of Churches to become the associate director of Urban Education, in the Department of Educational Development at the National Council of Churches. In this position, which she held until 1973, Stokes was instrumental in developing the Black Curriculum Resource Center. She also organized religious educators across the United States, working with 42 national denominations. Last but not least, during the Civil Rights Movement, she assisted both white and black civil rights leaders to connect with each other and with their Christian faith.Smith, Yolanda Y. \\"Olivia Pearl Stokes.\\" Talbot School of Theology, Biola University. Retrieved at http://www.talbot.edu/ce20/educators/protestant/olivia_stokes/  Study of African culture  Stokes grew up immersed in African culture: her mother, Bessie Stokes Vann, worked frequently with Christian missionaries who traveled to Africa. By the time Mrs. Vann was in her mid-twenties, she possessed extensive knowledge of African culture and history. Meanwhile, farther back in Olivia's family tree, her great-aunt Alberta Thomas was involved in Marcus Garvey's Back-to-Africa movement. As Olivia grew older, she took after her family, becoming known for her in-depth study of African culture‚Äî particularly the role of women and families. Part of her work involved creating educational materials that she hoped would change the way American schoolchildren understood Africa through their textbooks. She similarly attempted to improve American understanding of African culture through her own fictional children's stories: she authored Why the Spider Lives in Corners: African Facts and Fun and The Beauty of Being Black: Folktales, Poems, and Art From Africa, two children's books that incorporate African culture and relied on African co- authors. These books placed particular emphasis on African art and expression, as well as the variety of cultures present in different African countries. Meanwhile, in her work with the Christian community, Olivia pushed churches to include lessons about Africa in their ministry, encouraging pastors to emphasize the importance of African heritage and history. Stokes began traveling to Africa herself in 1958, continuing to visit the continent throughout the remainder of her life. Stokes' initial trip to Africa was inspired by her own desire to learn more about the country, as well as for the sake of \\"personal growth and significant research.\\"Stokes, Olivia Pearl. \\"History Vault - ProQuest.\\" Accessed March 24, 2017. p 62. http://hv.proquest.com.ezp- prod1.hul.harvard.edu/historyvault/docview.jsp?folderId=001445-012-0493&q;=nofulltext%3AOlivia%20nofulltext%3APearl%20nofulltext%3AStokes%20AND%20%20module%3A28990%20OR%2023138%20OR%2022789%20OR%2047846%20OR%2092064%20OR%2014309%20OR%2091549%20OR%2085489&position;=4&numResults;=0&numTotalResults;=#. Two years later, in 1960, she approached publishing company Houghton Mifflin with a book idea that incorporated discussions on the ability of African women to rise quickly through the social ranks of society. After her initial travel to Africa, Stokes began leading tours of Africa for graduate students, spearheading twenty separate trips between the years of 1958 and 1981. Stokes' work also extended to improving the education system of Africa: From 1973 to 1976, she worked on building a graduate program to train educators in Nigeria, ultimately partnering with 5 different Nigerian universities.  Other community involvement and employment  Outside of her work in the church community and the education advocacy world, Stokes was a teacher herself. Between 1973 and 1976, she taught as associate professor of education at the Herbert H. Lehman College of the City University of New York. There, she also served as chairperson of the development of a multi-ethnic, multi-cultural teacher education program. Later, she taught part-time at New York University's School of Education while serving as interim pastor at the Emmanuel Baptist Church in Brooklyn. She was also a member of the American Association of University Professors. Her extensive experience in religious education allowed her to serve as trustee of Berea College between 1976 and 1988, educational consultant at various theological schools, and other influential roles. In 1955, 1960 and 1979, she led White House Conferences on Education. In 1976, Stokes, with a group of other professionals, founded the Harlem Guidance Center, which provides a family-focused guidance service for underachieving children in Harlem. Her talents also extended beyond teaching and into writing: in 1952, Jackie Robinson offered her a job as an NBC sports writer. Stokes' passion for service outweighed his generously salaried offer, however, and she opted instead to continue working at the community center where she was previously employed.  Awards  Stokes was a member of Delta Kappa Delta, the National Association for the Study of Afro-American Life and History, the Adult Education Association, the American Association of University Professors. In 1957, she was the recipient of the Negro Business and Professional Women's Clubs' Sojourner Truth Award. In 1976, she received the National Council of Negro Women's Bethune Achievement Award.

It was first identified in the S. aureus V8 strain as a papain-like cysteine protease. The protease distinguishes itself from the other major proteases of S. aureus in its very broad specificity and its ability to degrade elastin.  Genetics  Staphopain A expressed from the gene scpA within the scp operon. The operon also contains the gene scpB for staphostatin A (specific inhibitor of staphopain A), downstream of scpA. Staphopain A is largely co-expressed with the other three major proteases of S. aureus: aureolysin, glutamyl endopeptidase, and staphopain B. The transcription of scp occurs via a promoter controlled by \\"housekeeping\\" sigma factor œÉA and up-regulated by accessory gene regulator agr. It is at also repressed by staphylococcal accessory regulator sarA and by alternative sigma factor œÉB (a stress response modulator of Gram-positive bacteria). ssp expression is highly expressed in post-exponential growth phase. A more complex network of modulators and of environmental conditions affecting ssp expression have been suggested, however. Up-regulation of aureolysin during phagocytosis have also been observed. The scpA gene has a high prevalence in the genome of both commensal- and pathogenic-type S. aureus strains.  Activation & inhibition  Staphopain A is expressed as an inactive zymogen. In contrast to the other proteases, however, it appears to undergo rapid autocatalytic activation. It is thus also independent of the activation cascade of the three other proteases. S. aureus expresses the intracellular inhibitor staphostatin A, specific against staphopain A. As the activation of staphopain A could occur before it has been secreted by the bacteria, the staphostatin acts as prevention against harmful intracellular activity of the protease.  Function  Staphopain A is elastinolytic to a degree fairly equal to that of neutrophil elastase, and has a very broad specificity proteolysis. Staphopain A is inhibited by phosphorylated cystatin Œ± and Œ±2-macroglobulin. Staphopain A can cleave and lower the activity Œ±1-antitrypsin, and inactivate several complement system components.  Biological significance  Staphopain A was shown to inhibit activation of the complement system activation by cleaving components that are part of all three pathways (the classical, alternative, and lectin pathways) of activation. It shows a duplex role in affecting chemotaxis; while inactivating neutrophil CXCR2 receptor, generates an active C5a fragment of C5 (although inactivating C5b). However, it has yet to prove any significant impact on the outcome of infection. Inhibition of staphopain A by phosphorylated cystatin Œ± did prevent colony formation in skin tissue, but the effect could also be attributed to staphopain B. Mutation of scpA did not show any impact on the outcome of a skin abscess nor a septic arthritis model. Overlapping activity with the other proteases, plus the complexity of virulence determinants and the infection site environment makes it difficult to determine the impact of the protease in pathogenesis. The elastinolytic properties of the protease could assist in spread of bacteria and also symptomatically to connective tissue destruction. Staphopain A participates in S. aureus self-regulatory events, by altering the phenotype of the bacteria via cleavage of surface proteins and by preventing biofilm formation.

It is from the desert mountains and hills of Persia (which is now Iran) and has long grey-green leaves with cream, pale yellow or yellow flowers, which have purple or dark brown patches and yellow beards. Description Iris meda has small, about long,British Iris Society (1997) thin, stoloniferous-like rhizomes, and long secondary roots underneath the rhizome. It has upright, narrow, blade-shaped foliage, which are grey- green and long, and wide. The plant in total can reach between tall, with straight stems reaching high. It blooms between April and May, and has small flowers, that have a range of colour variations, that come in shades from cream or whitish ground color, lemon yellow to creamy straw-yellow ground colours. It is similar in form to Iris sari, which does not grow in Iran and does not have folded falls. Like other irises, it has 2 pairs of petals, 3 large sepals (outer petals), known as the 'falls' and 3 inner, smaller petals (or tepals), known as the 'standards'. The standards are oblanceolate, long and wide. The falls are long, thin and either undulating, or curled over. They have a large chestnut-maroon-black, or dark brown or purplish signal patch in the centre of the petal. Also they have a dense, narrow 'beard' of long yellow hairs. They also have greenish yellow style arms which are veined near apex. After it has flowered it produces a seed capsule and seeds that have not been described. =Biochemistry= As most irises are diploid, having two sets of chromosomes. This can be used to identify hybrids and classification of groupings. It has a chromosome count of 2n=20. Taxonomy Iris meda, botanical illustration drawn by Matilda Smith and lithographed by J.N. Fitch The Latin specific epithet meda refers to Media (a region of Persia). Similar to Apis mellifera meda (the Persian honey bee or Iranian honey bee). It was first found in Persia, and then described and published by Austrian born botanist Otto Stapf in Denkschr. Acad. Wein (Denkschriften der Akademie der Wissenschaften = Memoranda of the Academy of Sciences) vol.50 on page 20, (collected on the Bot. Ergeb. Polak. Exped. Pers.) in 1885. It is listed in the Encyclopedia of Life as Iris meda, and it is a RHS accepted name of iris. It was verified by United States Department of Agriculture and the Agricultural Research Service on 15 November 2002, then updated on 4 April 2003. Distribution and habitat It is native to temperate Asia. =Range= It is found in Iran. Within the regions of Mianeh, East Azerbaijan and Chal, Zanjan. =Habitat= It grows on either stony clay, or sandy or gravelly soils, of dry hills, desert mountains, and Kurdish steppes. At altitudes of between above sea level. Cultivation In the UK, it does not survive in cultivation as it needs dry conditions and very dry summers. Hybrids Iris meda has the following two crosses; 'Amboy Agate' (Iris samariae X I. meda) and 'Moleskin'. Culture In 1991, the government of Iran issued a set of postage stamps with the flora of Iran on them, which included \\"Iris meda\\". Toxicity Like many other irises, most parts of the plant are poisonous (including rhizome and leaves), and if mistakenly ingested can cause stomach pains and vomiting.

The birth of Herculine Barbin, a nineteenth-century intersex woman, is marked in Intersex Day of Remembrance. Barbin may have been the first intersex person to write a memoir, later published by Michel Foucault. In response to pressure from intersex activists and recommendations by United Nations Treaty Bodies, the Senate published an inquiry into the treatment of intersex people in February 2017. It calls for significant changes to some medical practices, and compensation for individuals subjected to medical treatment deemed to be medically unnecessary or done without informed consent. An individual, Ga√´tan Schmitt, has taken legal action to obtain civil status as \\"neutral sex\\" (\\"sexe neutre\\") but, in May 2017, this was rejected by the Court of Cassation. History The 12th-century canon law collection known as the Decretum Gratiani states that \\"Whether an hermaphrodite may witness a testament, depends on which sex prevails\\" (\\"Hermafroditus an ad testamentum adhiberi possit, qualitas sexus incalescentis ostendit.\\")Decretum Gratiani, C. 4, q. 2 et 3, c. 3 On ordainment, Raming, Macy and Cook found that the Decretum Gratiani states, \\"item Hermafroditus. If therefore the person is drawn to the feminine more than the male, the person does not receive the order. If the reverse, the person is able to receive but ought not to be ordained on account of deformity and monstrosity.\\" Herculine Barbin was raised in a convent in the early nineteenth century. From puberty, her body began to exhibit more masculine traits. In line with early legal practices, she was reassigned as male following an affair. She subsequently took her own life. She may have been the earliest intersex person to write a memoir, and these were later published by Michel Foucault, accompanied by a commentary and other materials. In his commentary to Barbin's memoirs, Foucault presented Barbin as an example of the \\"happy limbo of a non-identity\\", but whose masculinity marked her from her contemporaries. Morgan Holmes states that Barbin's own writings showed that she saw herself as an \\"exceptional female\\", but female nonetheless. Barbin's birth is now marked as Intersex Day of Remembrance. One of the earliest international gatherings of intersex people took place in 2006 in Paris, a summer school organized by OII-France. The summer school is memorialized in a book, A qui appartiennent nos corps? F√©minisme et luttes intersexes.  Physical integrity and bodily autonomy  thumbright260px In February 2016, the United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child published recommendations calling for an end to unnecessary surgery or treatment on children, and development of a \\"rights-based health care protocol for intersex children\\". In May 2016, the United Nations Committee Against Torture urged the French government to ensure respect for the physical integrity of intersex people, stating: In 2017, the French Senate published the second parliamentary inquiry into the wellbeing and rights of intersex people (after Australia in 2013). Vincent Guillot of Organisation Intersex International states that the document illuminates the absurdity of clinical practices, but is problematic where it distinguishes infants with congenital adrenal hyperplasia and ambiguous genitalia from intersex persons, describing women with congenital adrenal hyperplasia as \\"failed women\\". On 17 March 2017, the president of the Republic, Fran√ßois Hollande, described medical interventions to make the bodies of intersex children more typically male or female as increasingly considered to be mutilations. Claims for compensation In response to recommendations by the United Nations Committee Against Torture, a February 2017 report by the Senate delegation on the rights of women has called for compensation for intersex people who suffer the consequences of medical interventions. Protection from discrimination thumbright260px =Sport= French medical practitioners have been responsible for implementing policies of the International Association of Athletics Federations regarding sex verification in sports. In 2013, it was reported by Patrick F√©nichel, St√©phane Bermon and others that four elite female athletes from developing countries were subjected to partial clitoridectomies and gonadectomies (sterilization) after testosterone testing revealed that they had an intersex condition. Members of the same clinical hormone evaluation team report there is no evidence that innate hyperandrogenism in elite women athletes confers an advantage in sport. The case has been criticized as showing vulnerability of women athletes to unnecessary medical interventions under duress, with no evidence of cheating and no evidence of athletic advantage. Associated Press reported during the Rio Olympics on an anonymous African athlete subjected to medical investigations and treatments in Nice, France, in order to compete. Sex verification policies are currently suspended following the case of Dutee Chand v. Athletics Federation of India (AFI) & The International Association of Athletics Federations, in the Court of Arbitration for Sport, decided in July 2015. Identification documents Article 57 of the Civil Code requires that birth certificates must state the sex of a child, though it does not specify any further details about the meaning or limits of the requirement. Ga√´tan Schmitt, a psychotherapist born in 1951 in Tours with ambiguous genitalia (micropenis and a \\"rudimentary vagina\\") sought recognition of \\"neutral sex\\" civil status. In a judgement on August 20, 2015, the Tribunal de Grande Instance in Tours supported this status, a first for France. On appeal, the decision was overturned by the Court of Appeal in Orleans in March 2016. A judgement by the Court of Cassation (Cour de cassation) is expected on May 4, 2017. Schmitt's legal team described an initial male assignment as \\"fictive\\", and called for the government to recognize and adapt to human diversity. The team acting for the government argued that creating new civil status categories should be a matter of legislation, not the courts. On May 4, 2017, the Court of Cassation refused to recognize \\"neutral sex\\", stating that the existing two sexes were necessary for social and legal organization, and change would have profound implications for French law. Prior to the Court of Cassation decision, Vincent Guillot, a founder of Organisation Intersex International, described Schmitt as a friend, and Schmitt's lawyer's reasoning excellent, but also described third gender recognition as stigmatizing. Citing the Malta declaration, Guillot called for respect for fundamental rights and abolition mention of sex as a legal status, as with race and religion.

Koch developed nursery school teacher training programs during World War II and she researched the differences between sets of fraternal twins, identical twins and non-twin siblings. A graduate of the University of Chicago, Koch was credited with research work that improved the accuracy of investigations into sibling order. She was the co-winner of the first G. Stanley Hall Award for Distinguished Contribution to Developmental Psychology. She helped to found Delta Kappa Gamma, a professional society for women educators. Early life Born in Blue Island, Illinois, Koch had an interest in the piano from the age of eight, and she continued to play through her college years. She attended the University of Chicago, where she pursued psychology studies with a minor in German. She earned an undergraduate degree (1918) and a Ph.D. (1921) at the university. Teaching career In 1922, Koch went to the University of Texas to teach psychology. There she became associated with A. Caswell Ellis, who headed the university's program in the philosophy of education. In 1928, she was named a full professor at Texas. The next year, Ellis took a position at Western Reserve University as director of its adult education department. Koch considered following Ellis, but she accepted a post as an associate professor at the University of Chicago because she had family in the area. When Koch joined the University of Chicago faculty, courses in child care, preschool education and developmental psychology were taught in the home economics department, and Koch taught the child development courses. She also had responsibility over nursery school education, and she became the director of the University Cooperative Nursery School (later known as the University of Chicago Nursery School). During World War II, Koch developed nursery school teacher training programs to meet the demands of war nurseries. By the late 1940s, Koch was released from her nursery school obligations so that she could focus on research. Psychologist Judith Torney-Purta, a graduate student at the University of Chicago in the 1960s, recalled Koch's unique teaching style, saying, \\"I learned about Piagetian theory from Helen Koch, who stood ramrod straight and lectured without notes for 50 minutes.\\" Research work In the mid-1950s, Koch examined the effects of sibling order, and she defined several variables that had to be held constant in order to minimize error in this type of research. Later child development literature said that Koch's work \\"refined research in the area of sibship variables by a precision of at least one significant figure.\\" Later, she focused on the differences between twins and non-twins, and between identical and fraternal twins. In a large study of five- and six-year-old children, she found that identical twins were similar to fraternal twins and matched pairs of non-twin siblings in almost all of the measured variables. In 1966, Koch authored a book based on her work, Twins and Twin Relations. Geneticist Steven G. Vandenberg said that the book was \\"an unexpected boost for heredity\\", because previous researchers had been working under the untested assumption that fraternal and identical twins were interchangeable for the purposes of twin developmental studies. However, Vanderburg criticized Koch's work because she did not use blood typing to definitively determine whether her subjects were fraternal or identical twins. Koch later said that the nature versus nurture debates raised questions that were not usually feasible to answer. For example, even in the case of identical twins who were thought to share the same environment from fetal life, one twin may have had an unrecognized developmental advantage because of the position of the fetuses. In other cases, she said that some fraternal twins seem much more physically and emotionally similar than some identical twins. Awards and service In 1967, Koch was the co-winner (with Harold M. Skeels) of the first G. Stanley Hall Award for Distinguished Contribution to Developmental Psychology, presented by Division 7 of the American Psychological Association. Koch was one of the founders of the Delta Kappa Gamma sorority for women educators when she taught at Texas. After moving to the University of Chicago, she helped to start a chapter there. Later life In a 1971 interview, a retired Koch said that the situation for women in academia had improved since her days as a student and early-career academic. \\"I was in school during suffrage time. I even did a little parading and I don't think much of parades,\\" she said. \\"I don't believe in name-calling and rock-throwing but sometimes it takes vigorous action of organized women to get something accomplished... it takes a long time to realize how persistent you must be to get what you're after.\\" Koch died in Chicago in 1977.

She patrolled the Delaware River until destroyed during the British conquest of Philadelphia led by the Howe brothers and completed by them in October 1777. DANFS has identified this ship as a sloop, yet records from the period which are believed to refer to the ship have consistently identified her as being a schooner. These records also provide a bit more detail of her fate, indicating she was burned after capture in July 1777 during Royal Navy operations along the Delaware River.  Confusion concerning the ship's actual type  It is possible that there was a second ship with the same or similar name operating in American waters at the same time that has led to confusion. However, the government records described in detail below indicate that the ship with this name (often referred to with different spellings to include Musquito, or Musqueto, or Muskeito yet always with Lt. Albertson in command) was the only one with this name in Continental service at that time. Only later records, starting at least with the 1850 The Navy of the United States, From the Commencement, 1775 to 1853 is the ship in Continental service specifically referred to as a \\"sloop\\" and her destruction along with other elements of the fleet in October 1777 stated (and then with the word \\"supposed\\".) The statements and descriptions concerning the ship in this text are carried over almost exactly into the DANFS entry and in Silverstone's work. Emmon's 1850 book does make mention of a ship under the name \\"Musketo\\" later and names her a schooner under the command of Albertson. Given Albertson's listing on the Marine Committee's formal list of ranks and precedence, it is clear this is the vessel in Continental service with that name. Summary of known available materials On 1 October 1776, the Continental Marine Committee ordered Lieutenant Thomas Albertson to sail the schooner Muskeito to North Carolina with letters, and to bring back such naval stores as he could gather. Then on 10 October the Marine Committee formally established the ranks and precedence of the commanders of vessels in the Continental Navy. Lieutenant Thomas Albertson, as commander of the smallest vessel, Musquito, of four guns, ranked 26th out of 26. The next (implicit) mention of Mosquito occurs on 20 December 1776 when Robert Morris lists the schooner Musquito among the ships that are in public service in a letter to Silas Deane. It is interesting to note that in this same listing, the Fly is listed as a sloop while in most other records she is referred to as a schooner, indicating that Mosquito is not the only ship for which her type may be in question. Mosquito is again mentioned by name by being station in Delaware Bay with Fly watching six British ships that have effectively bottled up the fleet in a letter dated 30 December 1776. Next on 22 April 1777 the Navy Board of the Middle Department asked to borrow 70 shot for 2-pounder guns. Thomas Albertson carried the request, which he needed for his vessel, which was almost ready for sea. On 6 July 1777 Captain John Linzee, of , sent the schooner Endeavour, a longboat, and a sloop and yawl, prizes to , up Duck Creek, which empties into Delaware Bay, some five to six miles SEE from Bombay Hook. The expedition was under the command of Pearls sailing master. The expedition returned the next day. The British captured Mosquitto, Captain Thomas Albertson, at 3 in the morning, without any opposition as the only people aboard were her master and gunner. She was armed with six 3-pounder guns and four swivel guns; the expedition burned her after taking their two prisoners off. Later that day Linzee had the prize sloop burnt. As with many ships and actions of the period of the American Revolution, there is some question as to the true nature of this vessel and its history. At the time of the Emmon's work and the DANFS entry, the volumes of the Naval Documents of the American Revolution that mention her later history were not yet compiled. Even after their compilation, until the work of organizations like archive.org, their availability was rather limited. The identification of a ship or ships with the same name in service at the same time in the same area yet of different types has added to the confusion. With DANFS being the best available authority at the time, William Nowland Van Powell's 1974 painting of the ship with the USS Fly shows her as a sloop rather than a schooner as this is how DANFS has identified her. Hopefully, as more records come to light and are more thoroughly examined, the true nature of the situation will become more clear and defined.

The group recorded one studio album, In the Beginning, in 1969 which included their song \\"Joe Cool\\", a moderate hit on the Canadian charts. Although the album languished in obscurity for many years, retrospectively it fetches high asking prices and has been reissued.  History  Adopting the name of the British statute which created Canada in 1867, the band came together with Andy Bator (keyboards), Bob Allen (lead guitar), Dave McCall (drums), Rick Elger (rhythm guitar), and Kirk Armstrong (bass guitar). Formed in Montreal, the group members were not all native Canadians, but actually a majority of immigrants: Allen and Elger were from England, while Bator hailed from Hungary. After performing on the local music scene for about a year, infusing light folk with psychedelic rock, the British North American Act was signed by Now Records. Label executives arranged for the group to dress itself in revolutionary uniforms, hopefully to duplicate the success of the attire enjoyed by Paul Revere and the Raiders. The band recorded their only studio album, In the Beginning..., later in the year. Clocking in at under 30 minutes, the album featured soft rock songs while experimenting with distortion and raw garage music. A single taken from the album, \\"Joe Cool\\", became a moderate success in Canada, peaking just outside the Top 40 of the music charts. In the early 1970s, Now Records went bankrupt; the British North American Act disbanded soon after. The group's music began to resurface in 1987 when In the Beginning... was reissued for the first time. Original copies of the album, a rarity to find, garnered as much as $1,000 asking prices. In 2004, the album was released on CD for the first time by Akarma Records.

It was played on November 25, 2018, between the Ottawa Redblacks and the Calgary Stampeders at Commonwealth Stadium in Edmonton, Alberta. In a rematch of the 104th Grey Cup, the Stampeders won 27‚Äì16, claiming their eighth Grey Cup Championship. Host city = Selection process = On March 24, 2017, it was reported by several news outlets that the Calgary Stampeders and Edmonton Eskimos were bidding to host the 2018 Grey Cup game. In previous years, the games would be awarded based on regional preference or ownership changes (such as Toronto hosting the 104th Grey Cup four years after hosting their previous one). However, beginning with the 2018 game, the League announced it would conduct a formal bidding process based on the merits of the application to determine a host. Calgary last hosted the Grey Cup in 2009 while Edmonton last hosted in 2010. Both cities had previously hosted the Grey Cup game four times. Edmonton was awarded the 106th Grey Cup on June 5, 2017, and Calgary was awarded the 107th Grey Cup on April 25, 2018. Despite having a new stadium, and not having hosted the Grey Cup game since 1996, it was reported that the Hamilton Tiger-Cats would not submit a bid for the 106th Grey Cup due to ongoing lawsuits filed against the construction firms that completed the stadium more than a year behind schedule. Tiger-Cats CEO, Scott Mitchell, relayed that the organization was focused on the lawsuits first and foremost, and once those were completed they would focus on hosting a Grey Cup in the near future. Following the resolution of the lawsuits in 2018, the Tiger-Cats announced they would be bidding for the 108th Grey Cup. =Grey Cup Festival= The Grey Cup Festival took place from November 21 to 25 in downtown Edmonton on Jasper Avenue. In February 2018, it was announced that the planned Festival would be over twice the size of the Festival held for the 98th Grey Cup, which was the last time that Edmonton hosted the event. The increase in the size of the Festival was the result of a new initiative of the CFL to improve the Grey Cup experience and avoid previous situations where hosting teams underbudgeted the Festival. The five-day event included a zipline from Jasper Avenue to Louise McKinney Park, artificial hills for tubing and skiing, as well as Grey Cup traditions like the team parties. A total of fifty unique events and twenty-eight musical acts were scheduled, and the Festival was expected to add over $80 million to the local economy. On October 11, 2018, it was announced that due to the proximity between the annual Santa's Parade of Lights and the Grey Cup Parade, the two would be combined into a single event. The combined parade was held on November 24. On November 8, 2018, Maritime Football Ltd. announced a Name-The- Team drive for its proposed CFL team in Halifax, Nova Scotia. During the East Coast Kitchen Party (an annual Grey Cup party put on by fans from Atlantic Canada) held on November 23, it was announced that the proposed team would be known as the Atlantic Schooners‚Äîreviving the name of a former conditional franchise that was awarded to Halifax in 1984 but which folded without ever playing a game. = Ticket sales = On June 6, 2018 the Eskimos announced they had sold 51,000 tickets in only four days; leaving only a little more than 4,800 seats remaining for the championship game. The game officially sold out in the days leading up to the event. Two weeks before the game, it was announced that numerous Festival events, including the CFL Awards Ceremony, CFLPA Legends Luncheon, and the Grey Cup Gala Dinner, were either sold out or close to selling out. Background This was the first Grey Cup game to feature eight officials. In the wake of a hit to quarterback Brandon Bridge's helmet that went unpenalized, the league added an eighth official for the Eastern and Western finals. Ben Major was assigned to work as the eighth official in the Grey Cup. =Calgary Stampeders= The Stampeders finished first in the West Division for a third straight year with a regular season record of . They became the first team in the league to clinch a playoff spot in Week 13 of the regular season with a 38‚Äì16 victory over the Toronto Argonauts. The Stampeders narrowly beat out the Saskatchewan Roughriders for first in the West and did not clinch the top spot until defeating the BC Lions in the final game of the season. That victory also prevented the Stampeders from entering the playoffs on a losing streak for the second year in a row. As the first place team in the West, the Stampeders received a bye in the first round of the playoffs and hosted the Western Final on November 18 against the third place Winnipeg Blue Bombers. The Stampeders won the game 22‚Äì14 to become the West Division champions for the third straight year. =Ottawa Redblacks= The Redblacks placed first in the East Division with an record, returning to the playoffs for the fourth straight season. Led by quarterback Trevor Harris, the Redblacks clinched first place with a victory over the Hamilton Tiger-Cats in Week 17. During their season, rookie kicker Lewis Ward broke the professional football record for consecutive field goals, surpassing NFL kicker Adam Vinatieri with his 45th consecutive field goal in Week 16. Receiver Brad Sinopoli also set a league record for catches by a Canadian, with 116 worth 1,376 yards. As the first place team in the East, the Redblacks hosted the Hamilton Tiger-Cats in the Eastern Final after the Tiger-Cats defeated the crossover BC Lions in the Semi-Final. The Redblacks handily defeated the Tiger-Cats 46‚Äì27 behind Harris throwing for six touchdowns, a CFL playoff record. With the victory, the Redblacks advanced to the Grey Cup for the third time in four years. =Head-to-head= Calgary and Ottawa met twice in the 2018 regular season, with Calgary winning both games. Their first meeting took place during Week 3 in Calgary and saw the Stampeders win 24‚Äì14. Two weeks later, the teams met in Ottawa, where the Stampeders routed the Redblacks 27‚Äì3. The 106th Grey Cup was the second championship match-up between the two teams, following the 104th Grey Cup which was won by the Redblacks in overtime. Game summary Prior to kickoff, Calgary (CGY) won the coin toss and chose to defer to the second half, with Ottawa (OTT) choosing to kick the ball. Due to the freezing temperatures in Edmonton in the days prior to the event, the turf was slippery throughout the game, with Stampeders defensive lineman Ja'Gared Davis commenting that he had never played on a field with as little traction. The two teams opened the first quarter with quarterbacks Bo Levi Mitchell and Trevor Harris exchanging interceptions. Following their interception of Harris' pass, the Stampeders opened the scoring in the last third of the first quarter with a 21-yard touchdown run by running back Don Jackson and a successful conversion by kicker Rene Paredes to put the Stampeders up 7‚Äì0. The Stampeders would not relinquish the lead for the rest of the game. While the Stampeders began the second quarter with possession, the Redblacks would score on their following possession with a field goal by Lewis Ward, making the score 7‚Äì3. However, four minutes later the Stampeders would respond with another touchdown, this time courtesy a 17-yard pass from Mitchell to Lemar Durant, extending their lead to 14‚Äì3. The Redblacks would finally score their first touchdown of the game at the 12:35 mark of the second quarter with a successful pass from Harris to receiver Julian Feoli-Gudino, who caught the 25-yard pass at the 30-yard line and proceeded to run it into the endzone. The Redblacks opted to go for the two-point conversion rather than the kick to make the score 14‚Äì11. However, two minutes later Stampeders punt returner Terry Williams would score the final touchdown of the first half following a 97-yard punt return, setting a Grey Cup record for longest punt return. The previous record had stood since the 83rd Grey Cup in 1995 and was set by Chris Wright of the Baltimore Stallions. In comparison to the first two quarters, the third quarter was a quiet one offensively, with the two teams both managing a successful field goal to make the score 24‚Äì14 going into the fourth quarter. The Stampeders would kick another field goal three minutes into the fourth to increase their lead to 27‚Äì14. Facing a thirteen-point deficit, the Redblacks make an offensive push and made it to Calgary's seven-yard line before an attempted touchdown pass was knocked down by Stampeders linebacker Jamar Wall, forcing a turnover on downs. Despite conceding a two points to the Redblacks as the result of a safety, the Stampeders managed to hold their opponents scoreless for the remainder of the game, allowing them to win with a final score of 27‚Äì16. With his two successful field goal kicks, Stampeders kicker Rene Paredes became the all-time Grey Cup leader in field goal percentage, having successfully made all 11 of his field goal kicks throughout five career appearances in the Grey Cup. The previous record was 9-for-9 and was held by former Toronto Argonauts kicker Mike Vanderjagt. =Scoring summary= Rally for the 106th Grey Cup, held on 27 November in Calgary, two days after the game.

For the first time, a Spanish-language telecast was provided by ESPN Latin America for ESPN3 in Mexico, with Aaron Soriano on play-by-play and the Toronto Argonauts' Frank Beltre on colour. The move came on the heels of a letter of intent between the CFL and Mexico's Liga de F√∫tbol Americano Profesional, which contained a proposal for partnerships between the two leagues and the possibility of a CFL game played in Mexico as early as 2020. Entertainment On June 28, 2018, the CFL announced that The Reklaws would perform prior to the game as part of the SiriusXM Canada Kickoff Show, after their scheduled week 1 halftime performance at Investors Group Field in Winnipeg was cancelled due to inclement weather. Canadian country singer Brett Kissel sang the national anthem. On September 29, 2018, the CFL announced that Alessia Cara would be the halftime performer.
