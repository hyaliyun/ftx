Obligations also arise in United Nations member states that sign international human rights treaties, such as the People's Republic of China. Intersex people in China suffer discrimination. Issues include both lack of access to health care and coercive genital surgeries.  History  In February 2018, Asian intersex activists published the Statement of Intersex Asia and the Asian Intersex Forum, setting out local demands.  Physical integrity and bodily autonomy  thumbright260px Small Luk (Hong Kong) describes traditional Chinese society as patriarchal, promoting the sex assignment of intersex children as boys wherever possible. She states that the \\"one child policy\\" in mainland China led to the abandonment, neglect and deaths of many intersex infants. Both Luk and Taiwan activist Hiker Chiu have disclosed personal histories involving unwanted medical interventions. Chiu says that surgical \\"normalisation\\" practices began in Taiwan in 1953. Intersex medical interventions are encouraged as early as possible in both Hong Kong and the People's Republic. A 2014 clinical review of 22 infants with congenital adrenal hyperplasia in Hong Kong, for example, shows that all infants in the study received clitorectomies. It also showed a preference for early surgeries when infants are aged 1‚Äì2 years, and an assessment of surgical success focusing on genital appearance and necessity for further cosmetic surgeries. The cost of medical interventions in the People's Republic of China makes medical treatment inaccessible, resulting in fewer coercive interventions but exacerbating health issues for some individuals, and issues of abandonment and violence. In a submission to the United Nations Committee Against Torture in 2015, Beyond the Boundary - Knowing and Concerns Intersex raised concerns about lack of self-determination in Hong Kong and China, forced medical interventions in Hong Kong, lack of government assistance and marriage rights, and problems with violence and discrimination. In a response to submissions for Hong Kong, the United Nations Committee published recommendations calling for the postponement of \\"non-urgent, irreversible medical interventions\\" until children are old enough to provide full, free and informed consent. The committee called for an investigation into forced, involuntary and coercive practices in the People's Republic, along with measures to protect the autonomy and \\"physical and personal integrity of LGBTI persons\\". Protection from discrimination thumbright260px Press reports in 2015 and 2016 have provided examples of abandonment, neglect and even attempted murder. The South China Morning Post reported the abandonment of an intersex baby in a part in Shandong province in mid-2015, followed by allegations of attempts to murder an intersex infant as a \\"monster\\", in Henan province, in mid-2016. In 2017, the Hong Kong Equal Opportunities Commission together with the Gender Research Centre of the Hong Kong Institute of Asia-Pacific Studies at the Chinese University of Hong Kong asked the Hong Kong government to introduce legislation offering protection against discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation, gender identity and intersex status. Claims for compensation The United Nations Committee Against Torture has called for compensation for involuntary and medically unnecessary medical interventions in both the People's Republic of China and Hong Kong. Identification documents Small Luk has campaigned for self-determination of gender identity, and also for third gender recognition in Hong Kong. Rights advocacy in Greater China region The first people to publicly disclose being intersex were Hiker Chiu of Oii-Chinese, based in Taiwan and founded in 2008, and Small Luk of Beyond the Boundary - Knowing and Concerns Intersex, Hong Kong, founded in 2011. Chiu started a \\"free hugs with intersex\\" campaign at Taipei's LGBT Pride Parade in 2010. Oii-Chinese also gives lectures and lobbies government. The aims of Beyond the Boundary - Knowing and Concerns Intersex are to raise public awareness about intersex people and promote the rights of intersex people, including ending forced genital normalising surgery and conversion therapies. Luk urges the Hong Kong government to educate the public about intersex conditions, extend anti-discrimination laws to cover intersex people and stop foisting surgery on intersex children without consulting them.

Along with his wife, Nina Simonovich-Efimova, the couple founded the tradition of Soviet puppet theater. In addition to puppet design, Efimov was noted for his book illustration and sculpture. He created pieces for the Central Museum of Ethnology, the North River Terminal, several metro and railway stations and the Grand Kremlin Palace. Internationally his sculptures were awarded gold medals in 1937 at the Paris World Exhibition and in Russia he was honored as both an Artist of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (RSFSR) and the People‚Äôs Artist of the RSFSR. Early life Ivan Semyonovich Efimov was born on 11 February 1878 in Moscow. His father, Semyon Grigorievich Efimov, was a government official and the illegitimate son of a Ukrainian peasant woman. His mother descended from the Demidov family of whom the forebear, Nikita Demidov, a blacksmith from Tula, pioneered the production of iron ore in the Ural Mountains. Efimov grew up in an aristocratic milieu in the Tambov province on an estate known as \\"Otradnoe\\", to which later he would take his young bride. At a young age, he was sent to a military school, which had a profound effect on him. He felt imprisoned and cut off from nature, which led to his creating handcrafted toy animals. In 1896, Efimov completed his studies at the , which had been founded by , and then took private art lessons with for two years. Between 1898 and 1901, he studied natural science at Moscow University, simultaneously taking painting courses under Valentin Serov and sculpture classes with Anna Golubkina at the art school founded by Elizaveta Nikolaevna Zvantseva. Between 1905 and 1908 he worked in Abramtsevo Colony in the ceramic workshop of Savva Mamontov creating toys, while continuing his studies at the Moscow School of Painting, Sculpture and Architecture () with Serov, and studying sculpture with Sergei Volnukhin. In April 1906, he married fellow student and Serov's cousin, Nina Yakovlevna Simonovicha and in 1909 the couple took a break from their studies at the Moscow School and went to Paris. Between 1909 and 1911, Efimov worked in the studio of Antoine Bourdelle and beginning in 1910 studied sculpture with and mastered the art of etching under the direction of Elizaveta Kruglikova. He joined the circle of Russian artists working in Montparnasse and took inspiration from nature at the Paris Menagerie. In 1911, the couple briefly returned to Moscow, where Simonovich- Efimova completed her studies at the Moscow School before they moved to Lipetsk in 1912, spending several months on the Efimov family estate. By the end of the year, they were back in Moscow and Efimov had returned to his studies at the Moscow School. He graduated with the title of sculptor in 1913 with his presentation pieces, Bison and Passion and almost immediately went into service in World War I. Career After the October Revolution, Efimov was hired to teach at the Second State Free Art Studio in 1918, continuing his affiliation with the school when it was replaced by the Higher Art and Technical Studios until 1930. In 1918, he joined his wife in organizing a puppet theater in Moscow and together with her created puppets, costumes and scenery for their mobile theater, which operated until 1943. Some of his most known works were for their productions of Hans Christian Andersen's The Princess and the Pea (1918) and Shakespeare's Macbeth (1921). They created the first professional puppet theater in Russia and utilized innovative techniques with rods. The pair also worked in shadow theaters using the art of silhouettes. For his own sculptures, Efimov preferred to depict the essence of animals. He was not interested in their portraiture, but rather in capturing the typical characteristics of his subject. He also rejected traditional media like marble and stone, preferring to work with cement, clay, glass, metal or wood, which placed his works in the folk art tradition. He tried to capture the natural movement as well as characteristics. His sculptures \\"Ostrich\\" (1935) forged from copper with spiraling copper plumes and \\"Ram\\" (1938) made with loose curls of copper wire crowned by tightly spiraled wire horns, exemplify his works. Placing them in habitat was also important for Efimov, employing various techniques, as in his copper sculpture \\"Fish\\". The fish is attached via a wire to a copper sheet in the shape of a water lily, which in turn is perched on a three-dimensional piece of glass, representing water. Efimov also worked on book illustrations, in such works as The Cat, the Goat and the Ram (, 1924), Aesop's Fables (, 1925), How the Animal Cart Awoke (, 1927), Mena (, 1929) and Mordovian epic (, 1930). In the early 1930s, he participated in anthropological studies of Bashkiria and Udmurtia for the Central Museum of Ethnology (), which in the early 1930s was located at the adjacent to the . Thereafter, Efimov worked from 1932 to 1933 to create an installation, \\"History of Russia in Mannequins\\" for the same museum. Between 1935 and 1937, he sculpted a fountain, \\"Dolphins\\" for the North River Terminal and between 1936 and 1937 created the sculpture \\"Old and New Moscow\\" for Gorky Central Park of Culture and Leisure. In 1937 two of his sculptures, \\"Fisherman with Fish\\" and \\"Bull\\" received the gold medal at the World Exhibition in Paris. Efimov designed reliefs for two of the Moscow metro stations, Paveletskaya and Avtozavodskaya (1942-1943); two of the Moscow railway stations, Yaroslavl (1946-1947) and Leningrad (1948); and for the winter garden at the Grand Kremlin Palace (1952). In 1955 he was designated as an Honored Artist of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic and three years later, in 1958, Efimov was honored as the People‚Äôs Artist of the RSFSR. Death and legacy Efimov died on 7 January 1959 in Moscow. He has works in the permanent collections of the Pushkin Museum, the State Museum of Ceramics at the \\"XVIII Century Manor of Kuskovo\\", the State Russian Museum, and the State Tretyakov Gallery. Posthumous exhibitions of his work were held in Moscow and Leningrad between 1959 and 1960, in Moscow in 1970, and in Kaluga, Obninsk, and Moscow in 1975.

He is associated with designing railroad locomotives and related equipment. He was the target of a confusing name appropriation by author Mark Twain.  Early life  Sellers was born on November 26, 1808, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. His birthplace was near the Philadelphia Mint in a neighborhood known as Mulberry Court. His parents were Coleman Sellers and Sophonisba Angusciola (Peale) Sellers. He had one older brother Charles, born in 1806; two younger sisters Elizabeth, born in 1810; and Anna, born in 1824; and two younger brothers Harvey, born in 1813; and Coleman II, born in 1827. His paternal grandfather Nathan Sellers (wife Elizabeth Coleman) was known for artwork of wire paper molds. His father and many ancestors had been engineers; his maternal grandfather was Charles Willson Peale. He was educated at public schools and studied for five years with tutor Anthony BolmarSee at his academy in West Chester, Pennsylvania.  Midlife and career  Sellers first obtained employment of his father's and grandfather's firm, Nathan & David Sellers, upon completing his private school education in Philadelphia. The business made machinery for producing wire and paper. The company was the first to use forged frames to build locomotives. They also did work for the United States Mint. Sellers' elder brother Charles was employed there too. It was this work that furnished inspiration for his many engineering writings. When Nathan Sellers died in 1830, the business was reorganized. Coleman Sellers and his two sons then ran the business. As a consequence of the Depression of 1837 the company then became insolvent and closed. Sellers then moved to Cincinnati with his brother Charles and established a factory for making lead pipe from hot fluid lead. He patented his invention of the machinery that was capable of doing this. This business was eventually sold out and merged into a company that was a major producer of lead pipe in the United States. Sellers then partnered with Josiah Lawrence, a Cincinnati businessman, and organized a wire manufacturing company called Globe Rolling Mills. Here he introduced machinery of his own design that was more efficient in producing lead pipe and wire. Eventually he sold his interest in the company by 1850. In 1851 he undertook the manufacture of railroad locomotives for the Panama Railway. He invented a railroad engine for climbing mountains of heavy inclined planes. Sellers was engaged in the manufacture and sale of railroad equipment for several years in the 1850s. Sellers became interested in mining operations in southern Illinois in the 1860s. He spent the remainder of his career pursuing mechanical engineering and design.  Inventions and patents  Railroad locomotive for hill climbing He was an able engineer and mechanic and took out many patents relating to improvements in railroad locomotives, particularly the type he built for the Panama Railway. He also patented various art inventions, in which he was involved with from time to time. He invented a hill climbing railroad locomotive that was defined as an engine boiler with gearing for working heavy grades, patented as US7498A granted July 9, 1850. Sellers invented a process for making paper from vegetable fiber. He designed machinery for the manufacture of pipes continuously from molten lead and was given patent number US1908 A on December 17, 1840, for the machinery.  Hobbies  Sellers had a deep interest in archaeology. He wrote several articles relating to the relics of the mound builders of Illinois. One published by Smithsonian Institution was on the aborigines' method of making earthenware salt pans. He also wrote detailed articles on how the local American Indians made the arrowheads and stone age tools. He had a substantial collection of pottery and implements of the prehistoric tribes of the Ohio valley. He personally became so skilled at making arrowheads that some specimens of his craft were on display at the National Museum of the American Indian in Washington, D.C.  Later life and death  Sellers took up residence to Chattanooga, Tennessee, upon retirement. He lived on Mission Ridge. He particularly indulged his taste for arts and the society of artists all his life. Sellers died at his home in Chattanooga when he was 90 years old on January 1, 1899.  Societies  Sellers had recognized artistic talent. Artist Thomas Sully urged him at an early age to become a portraitist, and offered to teach him. Sellers' grandfather was Charles Wilson Peale and his uncle was Rembrandt Peale. It was Sellers's opinion that Raphaelle Peale was considered to be the most talented of Charles's artist children. With others he organized one of the earliest social organizations of artists in Philadelphia. However, his natural inclination of mechanical interest ruled his vocational life. Legacy  Mark Twain in his novel The Gilded Age has a fictional character a satirical exploitative capitalist rascal without redeeming social value called Colonel Mulberry Sellers. The first edition of that book actually used the name \\"Eschol Sellers.\\" The names were further transmutated when the work became a play. The use of \\"Eschol\\" was a carefully considered decision, with apocryphal descriptions of its antecedents. This is explained further at the beginning of Twain's later novel The American Claimant as being Sellers of Philadelphia, who sued to have his name removed from the novel. While the next editions of Twain's novel removed the name \\"Eschol\\" name, he ultimately put in the name \\"Mulberry Sellers.\\" Mulberry just happens to be the name of the neighborhood in Philadelphia where Sellers was born and raised. In fact, this unwanted connection continued to be repeated, even unto Sellers's obituaries.

His son, Ebrahim, and his brothers, Muhammad and Musa Shahawat were also poets. Al-Nasa'i was born and lived in Medina as a client (mawlƒÅ) of Taym b. Morra. He was a descendant of a Persian prisoner of war from Adharbayjan. He initially supported the Zubayrid's cause, but when the cause was crushed and Abd Allah ibn al-Zubayr was killed in 73AH/692CE, Al-Nasa'i attached himself to the court of the Umayyad Caliphate, despite his strong Anti-Arab sentiments. When he recited a poem for Hisham ibn Abd al-Malik in which he glorified his Persian ancestors without praising the caliph, Hisham punished and exiled him to Hejaz. Al-Nasa'i died before 132AH/750CE at a very old age and shortly before the fall of the Umayyad dynasty.

It contains vegetation in the transition between the Amazon rainforest to the north and the cerrado savanna to the south. The opening of highways through the region has caused rapid population growth, deforestation and pollution. Location The Mato Grosso tropical dry forests ecoregion covers . The forests are mainly in the north of the state of Mato Grosso, but extend into the southeast of Amazonas, the south of Par√° and parts of Tocantins and Maranh√£o. Some sources include the ecoregion in the Amazon biome. In the northwest it adjoins the Madeira-Tapaj√≥s moist forests and Tapaj√≥s-Xingu moist forests ecoregions, and extends north for some distance between them. In the east patches of the Mato Grosso seasonal forests are interspersed with the Xingu-Tocantins-Araguaia moist forests and extend as far as the Tocantins/Pindare moist forests. In the south and east the Mato Grosso seasonal forests meet the cerrado ecoregion. Physical In the north the slopes are from 8% to 30%, while in the south they are less than 8%. The northeast of the region is in the Serra do Cachimbo and the eastern part is in the Serra dos Caiabis and Serra Formosa. These three ranges are well-drained savannas. The ecoregion contains part of the Alto-Xingu, the headwaters of the Xingu River. The central and western area cover a river drainage basin between the Serra do Roncador and the Serra do Formosa. In the east and center most of the soils are ultisols. In the western serras they are mainly entisols and oxisols. Ecology The Mato Grosso tropical dry forests ecoregion is in the Neotropical realm and the tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests biome. =Climate= The K√∂ppen climate classification is \\"Aw\\": equatorial, dry winter. There is relatively little temperature variation throughout the year. Average temperatures range from to with a mean of . Rainfall varies considerably from month to month, with little rain in June‚ÄìJuly and in March. Total annual precipitation is around . The serras in the east have wet seasons that last for 6‚Äì8 months. The central body of the ecoregion in Mato Grosso, and the portions to the west, have wet seasons from 8‚Äì9 months. During the rainy season from December to May large areas are flooded. In the dry season the porous soil quickly drains the wetlands and pools, leaving large flats and patches of dry forest, savanna and moist forest. =Flora= The Mato Grosso tropical dry forests ecoregion is a transitional zone between the moist forests of the Amazon basin to the north and the cerrado of the Brazilian Highlands to the south. The annual floods and periodic fires in the dry season form a complex mosaic of forest, grasslands and transitional vegetation. The dominant habitat is dry forest, but the ecoregion also contains savannas, gallery forests and areas of dense thicket. Much of the habitat is found in isolated patches within other ecoregions. The soil of the Serra do Cachimbo is white sand. It has an extensive region of campos rupestres, an open plant formation subject to drought growing on rocks that do not retain water. In appearance the campo ruprestre is similar to savanna, but the flora are different with species such as Calea lutea and others that are found in caatinga forest. The central and western areas hold tropical semi-deciduous seasonal forest. Forests are not as lush as those found further west, and the trees are shorter at . Flora includes Piptadenia incurialis and species of the Bowdichia, Hymenaea and Machaerium genera. Cerrado species include Curatella american, Qualea species, and Kielmeyera coriacea. =Fauna= Blue-and-yellow macaw (Ara ararauna) in Xingu State Park The various seasonal habitats support diverse fauna with many endemic species including cayman lizards and colorful butterflies. In 1967‚Äì69 the British Royal Society and Royal Geographical Society undertook an expedition in the Mato Grosso (upper Xingu River). They found 46 genera of rodents including the large capybara (Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris), 52 genera of bats of which Artibeus and Molossus were most common, 3 of marsupials and 11 of edentates. They recorded 161 species of birds of which 60 occurred only in the cerrado, 33 in gallery forests and 25 in dry forest. The Serra do Cachimbo has an isolated population of caatinga antwren (Herpsilochmus sellowi) and the endemic amphibian Tropidurus insulanus. Endangered mammals include white-cheeked spider monkey (Ateles marginatus), white-nosed saki (Chiropotes albinasus), black bearded saki (Chiropotes satanas) and giant otter (Pteronura brasiliensis). Endangered birds include green-thighed parrot (Pionites leucogaster) and red-necked aracari (Pteroglossus bitorquatus). Status The World Wildlife Fund gives the Mato Grosso tropical dry forests ecoregion the status \\"Vulnerable\\". Construction of highways BR-070 / BR-364 from Bras√≠lia to Acre and of highway BR-163 from Cuiab√° to Santar√©m, Par√°, have caused rapid growth in the human population. The region has experienced a gold rush, which causes mercury pollution, logging and land clearance for cattle ranching and agriculture. During the period from 2004 to 2011 the ecoregion experienced an annual rate of habitat loss of 0.76%. Global warming will force tropical species to migrate uphill to find areas with suitable temperature and rainfall. Ecoregions such as the Mato Grosso seasonal forests are extremely vulnerable since the deforested strips create barriers to species migration. The Xingu Indigenous Park provides protection for several indigenous groups.

Legal case of 1797  Suzanne le Peletier was adopted by the nation of France at the age of 11 after the death of her father Louis-Michel le Peletier. Adoption by the state meant that she was emancipated from her uncles, which later became an issue to them because le Peletier wanted to marry a Dutchman called Jean-Fran√ßois De Witt who was debt- ridden. Due to their lack of legal power over her, they were unable to prevent her marriage. Her uncles brought their concerns to the French legislature and asked the state to fulfill its role as her father and stop le Peletier from denationalizing herself by marrying a Dutchman. This case brought le Peletier into the public light. The public debated upon the powers of national adoption and the defining factors of family and state relations. Her engagement to a foreigner also led to public debates upon citizenship and its significance, especially for women and whether or not marriage impacts their citizenship. Debaters upon the case brought up contradictory points. Those who supported her talked about father-centered families with a subordinate wife and children yet they stated that she did not need parental control. Instead, they supported le Peletier by emphasizing individual rights and the rationality a young woman has. Those who supported her uncles reminded that she was \\"first daughter of the republic\\" and that she was a symbol of being French and revolutionary. Despite that, they still spoke of her incapability of being an independent citizen of France.  Marriage  Le Peletier and De Witt got married and shortly thereafter, on March 22, 1802, were granted a divorce by the justice of the peace. In 1806, she married her cousin L√©on Le Peletier de Mortefontaine.

At that time, galena was the primary ore being mined in the area. The Horn Silver Mine was established in 1875, and was the beginning of the silver mining in the range. The town of Frisco grew up around that mine, and was the nexus of the mining district. On February 12, 1885, the Horn Silver Mine had a massive cave-in. While there were no fatalities and the mine continued to produce for years, workers began to leave for other mining areas. Kilns Smelting is the process of extracting metal from ore. Charcoal-fueled smelting in both pits and kilns had been used in Utah since at least 1872. Overall, there were 36 beehive-shaped smelting kilns operating in the district. The five granite beehive-shaped charcoal smelting kilns that have survived in Frisco were created by the Frisco Mining and Smelting Company under the supervision of Benjamin Y. Hampton, primarily for the Horn Silver Mine, between 1877 and 1880 for $500-$1000 apiece. Each kiln varies in size from the other, anywhere from 16 to 32 feet in diameter. The company was hard-hit by the Horn Silver Mine cave-in, and eventually closed up shop in 1884.

The group is known for a versatile mix of rock and roll, jump blues, swing, country, roots rock and surf music elements.  History  Hillbilly Moon Explosion originated in 1998 as part of the Zurich rockabilly scene. The group was founded by the native English and Swiss citizen Oliver Baroni (vocals, bass, guitar) and Italian-Swiss singer Emanuela Hutter. Oliver Baroni was planning to leave his former band, the Hillbilly Headhunters. Emanuela Hutter worked with the singer/songwriter music project MD Moon at that time. The original formation was completed by drummer Aad Hollander and guitarist Pat Matteo, another former member of the Hillbilly Headhunters. The first demo tape was made in the same year. Emanuela Hutter was at the time bound by solo performances and did not enter the band until the following year. In 2006 after the release of All Grown Up, Englishman Duncan James replaced Patrick Gese on guitar and Swiss Luke Weyermann the new drummer. Frenchman Sylvain Petite later took over drums. In addition to touring and performing in Switzerland, the band have performed in other European countries including Germany, France, Spain, Italy, Finland, Slovenia, Croatia, Hungary, Poland, Austria and the UK. In 2010, Hillbilly Moon Explosion appeared as the opening act for Jeff Beck in Paris Olympia. In both 2018 and 2019, they also toured the west coast of the US. The members of the group live in and around Zurich.  Style and reviews  Although some media outlets rate the band as a very good rockabilly formation from Switzerland, Hillbilly Moon Explosion is still considered an underground band. On the album Buy, Beg or Steal, in the song \\"My Love for Evermore\\", Hutter sang a duet with Mark \\"Sparky\\" Phillips from the British psychobilly group Demented Are Go. Further duets with Sparky appeared on the Damn Right Honey and With Monsters and Gods albums, and a full album of duets, The Sparky Sessions appeared in 2019.

The right to health and a nutritious and sufficient diet are internationally recognized fundamental human rights protected by international treaties and conventions on the right to life, as well as in charters, strategies and declarations. Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) 1, 4, 5 and 6 highlight, respectively, how poverty, hunger, child mortality, maternal health, the eradication of HIV/AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis and other diseases are of particular significance in the context of child health. Despite these commitments and ideals, however, the reality is that high mortality among young children, particularly in Africa, continues to be a cause for concern. Children born in developed countries such as Sweden have a less than 1 per cent risk of dying before the age of 1 year, whereas for children born in developing countries, the risk is closer to 10 per cent or higher. Within developing countries, there are significant disparities between rich and poor and urban and rural areas.UNICEF. 2008. The State of the World‚Äôs Children: Child Survival. New York, UNICEF.  Extent and gravity of child health and nutrition in Africa  Worldwide, substantial progress has been made in the effort to reduce child mortality. The number of under-5 deaths in the world has declined from nearly 12 million in 1990 to 6.9 million in 2011; and the global under-five mortality rate has dropped 41 per cent since 1990 ‚Äì from 87 deaths per 1,000 live births in 1990 to 51 in 2011.UN Inter-agency Group for Child Mortality Estimation. 2012. Levels and Trends in Child Mortality. New York, UNICEF. The leading causes of death among children under age 5 are pneumonia (18 per cent), preterm birth complications (14 per cent), diarrhoea (11 per cent), complications during birth (9 per cent), and malaria (7 per cent). Globally, more than one third of under-5 deaths are attributable to undernutrition. In Africa, some progress has also been registered over the decades. Compared to other regions, sub-Saharan Africa has experienced a faster rate of reduction in under-5 deaths, with the annual rate of decline doubling between 1990‚Äì2000 and 2000‚Äì2011.UNICEF. 2013. The State of the World‚Äôs Children: Children with Disabilities. New York, UNICEF. However, child mortality figures in sub- Saharan Africa are still sobering. The region alone accounts for 3,370,000 deaths of children under 5 in 2011 (WHO, 2012) which corresponds to 9,000 children dying every day, and six children dying every minute. Out of 3 million neonatal deaths worldwide, approximately 1.1 million are found in sub- Saharan Africa (WHO, 2012). The highest rates of child mortality are in sub- Saharan Africa, where 1 in 9 children dies before age 5; and 1 in 16 children in Southern Asia.  Deficiency in essential nutrients and micronutrients  Given that vitamin A is critical for proper functioning of the visual system and for maintaining immune defences, its deficiency remains a public health issue. An estimated 250,000 to 500,000 children deficient in vitamin A become blind every year, half of them dying within 12 months of losing their sight. This deficiency accounts for 350 million cases of blindness and 670,000 deaths globally (WHO, 2001). In Africa alone, it contributes to 23 per cent of child deaths. In 2009, the prevalence of low serum retinol, associated with vitamin A deficiency, was 37.7 per cent in Ethiopia, 49 per cent in the Congo, and 42 per cent in Madagascar. The immediate causes of this deficiency are the low rates of consumption of animal products, the poor bioavailability of vitamin A in cereal-based diets, the consumption of green leaves with low lipid content, and an increased bodily demand for vitamin A owing to the infections that frequently affect African children (Manga, 2011).Manga, L. D. 2011. Evaluation of Vitamin A Status and its Determinants in Senegalese Children aged 12 to 59 Months. Master‚Äôs thesis, Cheikh Anta Diop University, Senegal. There are equally disturbing levels of zinc deficiencies and this has seriously adverse effects on growth, the risk and severity of infections, as well as the level of immune function. Although the actual prevalence is unclear, zinc deficiency is recognized as one of the main risk factors for morbidity and mortality. It contributes to over 450,000 deaths per year among children under 5 years, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. It affected 57 per cent of children under 5 in Senegal, 72 per cent in Burkina Faso, and 41.5 per cent in Nigeria in 2004.Beye, M. F. 2011. Evaluation of the Status of Zinc and its Food and Health Determinants in Boys and Girls aged 12 to 59 Months. Master‚Äôs thesis, Cheikh Anta Diop University, Senegal. The main causes of this deficiency in children are a lack of zinc-rich easily absorbed foodstuffs (such as meat, poultry, seafood) and the over-consumption of foodstuffs that inhibit zinc absorption, such as cereals, roots and tubers, which are among Africa's staples. Inadequacies in iodine intake on the other hand impair the synthesis of thyroid hormones, which are critical for normal development and proper functioning of the brain and nervous system as well as the conservation of body heat and energy. Iodine deficiency causes endemic goitre and cretinism as well as stunting of mental and physical development. Globally, 1.6 million people are at risk of iodine deficiency disorders and 50 million children affected by them. About 100,000 children are born each year with mental retardation, most of them in Africa. This is due to the low consumption of iodine-rich foodstuffs (e.g. marine products) and the over-consumption of foodstuffs causing goitre, particularly bitter cassava, which is a staple in Central Africa.Kupka, R., Ndiaye, B., Sall, M. G., Camara, B. 2012. Senegal Struggles to Control Iodine Deficiency. International Council for Control of Iodine De ciency Disorders (ICCIDD) Newsletter, Vol. 40, No. 40. Anaemia is quite prevalent in Africa especially among young children due mainly to a diet that is low in animal-based foodstuffs and high in fibre-rich cereals, tannins and phytates which inhibit iron absorption. In 2006, about 67.6 per cent of children under 5, and overall 83.5 million children were anaemic.Sy, M. 2011. Evaluation of the Status of Iron and its Determinants in Senegalese Children aged 12 to 59 Months. Master‚Äôs thesis, Cheikh Anta Diop University, Senegal. Through its effects on metabolic processes such as oxygen transport, oxidative metabolism and cell growth, iron deficiency also retards growth and development. It impairs the immune response and increases susceptibility to infection, delays motor development, and diminishes concentration (impairing cognitive and behavioural capacities). It therefore prevents 40-60 per cent of African children from attaining their full mental capacities. Moreover, of the 26 health risks reported by the WHO Global Burden of Disease project, iron deficiency is ranked ninth in terms of years of life lost.  Preventive interventions  = Breastfeeding = Breast milk is the ideal natural food for optimal growth and safe psychomotor development. This is due to its rich nutrients and protective factors, as well as its biospecificity (the kinetics of its composition change during lactation) and impact on mother-child relationships. These key advantages reduce child mortality rate by 13 per cent in areas where over 80 per cent of women breastfeed exclusively.Bellagio Study Group on Child Survival. 2003. Child survival: The unfinished revolution. The Lancet. Child Survival Series.Habimana, Ph. 2009. The Regional Situation regarding Child Health in Africa. Brazzaville, Congo.The Lancet. 2003. Child Survival Series. = Supplementary feeding = Undernourished children have lowered resistance to infection and are at greater risk of common childhood diseases such as diarrhoeal diseases, respiratory infections, recurring sickness and faltering growth, often with irreversible damage to their cognitive and social development. For current and future generations, good nutrition is a cornerstone for survival, health and development. Well- nourished children set off on a better developmental path (both physically and mentally), perform better in school, grow into healthier adults and are able to give their own children a better start in life. Supplementary feeding, when properly implemented, helps to reduce the mortality rate of children under 5 by 6 per cent. = Long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) = The prevention of malaria through the use of LLINs is a key strategy for rolling back malaria in Africa. According to model-generated estimates based on the number of LLINs supplied by the manufacturers, the number distributed by national malaria control programmes and data from household surveys, the percentage of households with at least one LLIN in sub-Saharan Africa increased from 3 per cent in 2000 to 50 per cent in 2011. Coverage rates of more than 80 per cent can reduce Africa's child mortality rate by 7 per cent. = Vaccination against Haemophilusinfluenzae type b (Hib) = Hib, meningitis and respiratory infections are frequent and serious on account of their high mortality rates and potential consequences, which include sensorineural damage. These infections can be prevented by vaccination to reduce child mortality by 4 per cent. Hib vaccination is part of the Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI) together with vaccines against tuberculosis, poliomyelitis, diphtheria, tetanus, hepatitis B, measles and yellow fever. EPI is a key preventive intervention in reducing infant morbidity and mortality; together with the monitoring and promotion of growth, it is a fundamental pillar in child health and development. = Prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV = The 25 per cent prevalence of HIV in some eastern and southern African countries is a matter of concern. African countries that showed more than 20 per cent adult HIV prevalence in 2011 included Botswana (23.4 per cent), Lesotho (23.3 per cent) and Swaziland (26 per cent) (UNICEF, 2013). Globally, the number of new HIV infections continues to fall annually, although there is considerable regional variation. In sub-Saharan Africa, where most of those newly infected with HIV live, it is estimated that 1.9 million (1,700,000 ‚Äì 2,100,000) people were infected in 2010. According to estimates, this represents a 16 per cent decrease compared to the number of new infections with HIV in 2001, which was 2.2 million (2,100,000-2,400,000), and a 27 per cent decrease compared to the number of new infections between 1996 and 1998, when the incidence of HIV infection in the region peaked.WHO, UNAIDS, UNICEF. 2011. Global HIV/AIDS Response: Epidemic Update and Health Sector Progress towards Universal Access - Progress Report. Geneva, WHO. http://www. unaidsrstesa.org/sites/default/ les/who_2011_report_0.pdf The vast majority of children are infected before birth, during pregnancy, labour or breastfeeding (if the mother is seropositive). The course of HIV and AIDS is particularly aggressive in children. Without care and treatment, the virus multiplies and destroys the child's immune system, lowering resistance to infections such as pneumonia and other common childhood diseases. Almost half of all children infected by their mothers die before the age of 2. Thanks to a decrease in the price of drugs, increased awareness, the introduction of fixed-dose combinations of anti- retrovirals (ARVs) and more reliable forecasts of demand for paediatric ARVs, several countries have been able to distribute them for use in children, but the coverage rate remains extremely low in Africa.WHO. 2011. Global HIV-AIDS Response: Epidemic Update and Health Sector Progress towards Universal Access. Geneva, WHO. = Food fortification = Food fortification is a cost-effective way of ensuring that a population receives adequate nutrients without altering their usual dietary practices. WHO recommends mass fortification of salt with iodine to prevent iodine deficiency in both children and adults. Fortification of other foods such as flour and cooking oil has been suggested and implemented in some countries, but salt iodization has been the most successful in terms of implementation and benefits in Sub Saharan Africa. Micronutrient powders (MNPs) for point of use fortification, contain a mixture of vitamins and minerals. They are added on to ready to eat semi solid foods such as porridge, without altering the original taste. This intervention reduces iron deficiency anaemia in children between six and twenty-three months of age = Zinc supplements = The role of zinc in strengthening immune defences cannot be underestimated and in areas where effective preventive supplementation campaigns have been implemented, particularly in Africa, the child mortality rate has been lowered by 4 per cent. = Vitamin A supplement = Biannual vitamin A supplements can help to reduce mortality among young children by 23 per cent.  Curative interventions  = Oral rehydration solutions = Oral rehydration is considered one of the greatest revolutions in improving child health and managing diarrhoea. With new oral rehydration solutions containing zinc, child mortality can be reduced by 15 per cent. = Therapeutic feeds = F75 and F100 are types of therapeutic milk that is used in inpatient management of severe acute malnutrition. They differ in concentrations of ingredients and amount of energy. Ready to use therapeutic foods (RTUF) are semi-solid foods for outpatient management of malnutrition. These may be used as part of a community based food and nutrition program. = Antibiotics to treat pneumonia = The improved availability of antibiotics to treat pneumonia, particularly in remote areas and among deprived populations, has contributed to reducing the child mortality rate by 6 per cent. Other curative interventions which can help to reduce child mortality include antibiotics to treat sepsis (6 per cent), the use of artemisinin-based combination therapies to treat malaria (5 per cent) and antibiotics to treat dysentery (2 per cent). These interventions are highly beneficial to child health and development. However, coverage rates remain low due to underdevelopment and poverty, poor health care systems with limited access to health services (less than 40 per cent in most African countries), a lack of qualified human resources resulting in part from the brain drain to Western and Arab countries, inadequate equipment, an inconsistent supply of medications and basic products with frequent shortages, a poorly structured and barely functioning programme of health promotion, and limited budgets for health (less than the 15 per cent recommended by WHO for most African countries) combined with often unorthodox financial governance.  Main strategies  The strategies outlined below are recommended by WHO and adopted by all African countries as part of a bolder approach to serious child health problems. Their strengths reside in the complementarity of components integrated into strategies, the effectiveness in reducing child mortality and morbidity, and the positive long-term impact generated for children, such as enhanced school performance, well-being and life chances. These strategies offer an immediate return while having a significant impact on the future. = Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI) = IMCI is a strategy that integrates various programmes for the survival of children under 5 with a view to improving the practices that are likely to have the greatest impact on their health, growth and development. This is the overarching strategy for achieving MDG 4 (reduction of child mortality), and it is recommended by WHO and UNICEF, particularly in countries with a high child mortality rate. The strategy is simple and, according to the World Bank, cost-effective. It aims to address the main causes of child mortality in settings characterized by (1) a low level of health coverage, with little or no access to diagnostic equipment and treatment, (2) a low level of health monitoring, and (3) weak links between healthcare facilities and communities. IMCI has three components: (1) improving the skills of health care workers, (2) strengthening the health care system, and (3) improving family and community practices.WHO. 1992. IMCI: A Strategy for Reducing Infant and Child Mortality. Geneva, WHO. = Emergency Obstetric and Neonatal Care (EmONC) = Maternal and neonatal mortality in the Africa region accounts for more than half (51 per cent) of the world's total maternal deaths, with a neonatal mortality rate of approximately 40 per thousand. The causes of these deaths could be prevented or avoided by the proper implementation of strategies for skilled care at birth and emergency obstetric and neonatal care services. With the assistance of WHO, UNICEF, UNFPA and the World Bank, various African countries have developed roadmaps for accelerating the reduction of maternal and neonatal mortality by improving the skills of service providers, standardizing treatment protocols, and developing quality criteria for EmONC. While effective interventions and strategies for improving the health and nutrition status of young children are available, the financial resources required to implement them in Africa are inadequate. It is essential that African governments, their domestic partners (the private sector and civil society) and their partners abroad (bilateral and multilateral cooperation) invest more heavily in mobilizing resources for early childhood development. The focus should be on optimal governance of financial resources with transparent management rules and particular emphasis on equity of care and guaranteed access for the poor.

Initially the novel was called Euclid was an Ass, named thusly for a tract written on Euclidean geometry by one of the characters. The manuscript came to the attention of the Dutch publisher De Harmonie, which had taken over Themerson's own Gaberbocchus Press, through which he had published his and his wife Franciszka's work, on a small scale. In 1985 a Dutch translation by Carol Limonard was published by De Bezige Bij. Through a Dutch-speaking person with connections to the English publisher Faber and Faber, it became published in English in 1986; Faber and Faber subsequently released more of Themerson's writing, including his last, Hobson's Island (1988). The novel was republished by Dalkey Archive Press. A reviewer from Kirkus Reviews was less than impressed: \\"....a book whose best touch unfortunately is the title.... [It has] some political asides and some heavy-handed social comedy, and churn it very slowly into a stringy mass, and you have this book's sour-tasting fudge. Self-conscious to a fault but not even close to compelling\\". Justin Warshaw with the Times Literary Supplement noted that \\"the Mystery of the Sardine is never solved nor is it ever quite clear what it actually entails\\". In an appreciation of the Themersons published in 2015, Michael Caines noted that the TLS earlier praised the novel for its \\"many rum non sequiturs\\". American novelist Jonathan Lethem listed it as his summer reading in August 2015. In 2005, a movie by Dutch filmmaker Erik van Zuylen based on Themerson's novel was released. Variety praised the film's technical qualities, but noted that it was unlikely to gain much traction outside of the Netherlands: \\"A large black dog with a sardine can around his neck is the unlikely suicide bomber apparently directed against philosophy lecturer Tim (Victor Low), who loses both legs in the blast. Trying to make sense of it, Tim obsessively goes over the period leading up to the attack, but nothing adds up. The mystery deepens when his wife, Vera (Renee Fokker), discovers a freshly painted representation of the attack in a local church.

It won the 2017 Pulitzer Prize for Drama. The play premiered at the Oregon Shakespeare Festival in 2015; it was produced Off-Broadway in 2016 and on Broadway in 2017. The play is centered on the working class of Reading, Pennsylvania. Background Lynn Nottage began working on the play in 2011 by interviewing numerous residents of Reading, Pennsylvania, which at the time was, according to the United States Census Bureau, officially one of the poorest cities in America, with a poverty rate of over 40%. Nottage has said that she was particularly influenced by a New York Times article reporting on the city specifically, and by the Occupy Wall Street movement more generally. She explored the effects on residents of the loss of heavy industry and the changing ethnic composition of the city. She has compared her time talking to former steelworkers in Reading with the occasion when she stayed in the town of Mansfield in the English Midlands and interviewed workers during the 1984 miners' strike. Plot The play portrays a meeting between a parole officer and two ex-convicts, and three women who were childhood friends and had worked in the same factory. The action takes place in a fictional barThe Justice Theatre Project in Reading, Pennsylvania. Nottage shifts in time, switching scenes and showing events of eight years earlier. Variety quotes the bartender, Stan, as warning the other characters that \\"You could wake up tomorrow and all your jobs are in Mexico\\", to which the characters respond with lethargy and disbelief. Variety described Nottage as going into \\"the heart of working-class America\\". Reviews of the play have described the characters as representing blue-collar workers who voted in Donald Trump as president. The play also examines the disintegration of a friendship, after two of the women ‚Äì one white, one black ‚Äì apply for the same management job. The latter character gets the position. But soon the company moves jobs to Mexico. The trade union goes on strike, and company management locks out the workers. The management/worker division begins to separate the friends, and racial tensions separate them further. Critical reception The play has been described as \\"a powerful and emotional look at identity, race, economy, and humanity.\\" The play's political context has also been noted. Reviews focused on the similarities between the portrayal of the industrial working class in a Rust Belt town, and that being a significant area and demographic in the 2016 United States presidential election. The Wall Street Journal review suggested the play \\"explained\\" Trump's win. It said that the city was \\"synonymous with deindustrialisation\\", for the effects there of loss of heavy industry and related jobs. The New Yorker said the play was \\"the first theatrical landmark of the Trump era\\". It also suggested that the play was reminiscent of the \\"working-class naturalism\\" of Clifford Odets, a playwright of the 1930s. The characters portrayed were associated with Trump's election campaign phrase of \\"the forgotten people\\".

She pulls her inspiration from ukiyo-e printmaking and contemporary hip-hop. She touches upon African-American culture and Japanese ganguro culture, which appropriates black culture. Background iona rozeal brown is from Washington, DC. She did not begin painting until her twenties. She got her education at the Pratt Institute, Brooklyn, NY. She then went on to get her BFA at the San Francisco Art Institute, Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture, Skowhegan, ME (1999), and got her MFA at Yale University School of Art, New Haven, CT, in 2002. She lives and works in New York, NY. Some time after 2013, the artist began using the name Rozeal in place of her full name. Work Brown's work unites multiple, seemingly irreconcilable cultures. Her fantastical and stylized mixed media paintings combine the style of Japanese prints, hip-hop, and graffiti. While studying in San Francisco, she was introduced to ganguro, a 1990s Japanese movement wherein young women would paint their skin darker and dress as their favorite hip-hop stars. She later traveled to Japan to learn more about this subculture. Brown's work around this topic was titled \\"The Blackface Paintings\\". This series began her quickly growing career. She titled her earliest exhibitions, \\"a3,\\" for \\"Afro-Asiatic Allegories.\\" Brown has also made work about voguing, including paintings and performances that feature performers from the House of Ninja. She created the performance, \\"Battle of Yestermore,\\" for Performa in 2011. She presented paintings inspired by the performers in her exhibition, \\"Introducing...The House of Bando,\\" at Salon 94 in 2013. Brown's experience as a DJ informs her work. Selected exhibitions and collections iona rozeal brown's work has been featured in solo exhibitions at numerous galleries and institutions including: * Spelman College Museum of Fine Art, Atlanta, GA, \\"a3...black on both sides\\" (2004) * Wadsworth Atheneum, Hartford, CT, \\"iona rozeal brown: Matrix 152\\" (2004) * University of Arizona Museum of Art, Tucson, AZ, \\"The Paintings of iona rozeal brown\\" (2007) * Museum of Contemporary Art, Cleveland, OH, \\"iona rozeal brown: all falls down\\" (2010) * Salon 94, New York, NY, \\"Introducing...The House of Bando\\" (2012) * Joslyn Art Museum, Omaha, NE, \\"iROZEALb\\" (2014) iona rozeal brown's work is held in many permanent collections including the Hirshhorn Museum, the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts, the National Gallery of Art, and the North Carolina Museum of Art.

Beginning his career in the famed youth set up at Atl√©tico Madrid, Pusey has gone on to play in Spain and Gibraltar, as well as earning 4 caps for his national side. Club career =Early career= Pusey began his career at Atl√©tico Madrid, spending 2 years at the top level of the club's youth team as well as turning out for the C team. Following his release from the club in 2007, he spent a year playing for C√°diz B followed by two seasons at Atl√©tico Zabal. Pusey left Zabal in 2010 to take a break from football and study in the UK, returning to his native Gibraltar in 2012 to sign for Lions Gibraltar. Pusey was a regular in the first team at Lions but could not prevent the club finishing 5th of 6 teams, finishing above Glacis United on goal difference. =Return to Gibraltar= After Gibraltar was admitted to UEFA in 2013, the Gibraltar Premier Division expanded to 8 teams, and in this new format Pusey left Lions to play for Glacis United. Again, Pusey played a central role in defence as Glacis finished 5th in the table, but the summer saw him move clubs once again, this time to the previous season's runners up Manchester 62. Here he saw first team chances diminish, with only 7 appearances over two disappointing seasons at the club before a move to Gibraltar United in summer 2016. Here, he saw his career get back on track, with 23 games over the course of the season helping Gibraltar United avoid relegation, and attracting the attention of national team coach Jeff Wood. His performances then attracted the attention of Lincoln Red Imps, and he joined the Gibraltar football giants in the summer of 2017. While he was named on the bench for Lincoln's opening qualifiers for the Europa League, he didn't see any action until he appeared in the Pepe Reyes Cup against Europa, picking up his first silverware as Lincoln won 5‚Äì3 on penalties. The consistency of Roy Chipolina and Ryan Casciaro at the heart of the Lincoln defence saw opportunities limited, however, with a 20 minute cameo against former club Glacis United on 27 September being his only action for the first team. In an effort to gain more first team football and remain in contention for the national team, Pusey went out on loan in January 2018 to Gibraltar Phoenix. Although he missed Phoenix's first game after the winter break against his parent club, he made his debut on 16 February 2018, again against Glacis United. He played the full 90 minutes in a 1‚Äì0 victory.Gibraltar Phoenix vs Glacis United match report At the end of the season, he was released by his parent club.

Between 1947 and 1962 she was a member of the regional parliament (\\"Landtag\\") of North Rhine-Westphalia.  Life  = Provenance and early years = K√§the Kr√§mer was born in H√ºttersdorf, a small town in the hills to the north of Saarlouis. Her mother was young and at that time unmarried. In order to support herself and her daughter she worked as a domestic servant, while K√§the spent the early part of her childhood living with her grandparents and with other relatives. After her mother married the machinist, Emil Schaub, K√§the was adopted by her step father, and spent the rest of her childhood as the eldest of her parents' (eventually) twelve children. Emil Schaub's wages from his work with F. K√ºppersbusch & S√∂hne AG (which at that time claimed to be the country's largest supplier of cooking hobs and ovens) at their factory in nearby Schalke were quickly spent as the family grew: hunger and material shortage were, as for the families of many industrial workers in Germany at that time, regular features of K√§the Schaub's childhood. She attended school locally and then, as the eldest child, immediately transferred to work at a textile factory in order to be able to contribute to the family's income. Influenced by her step father, in 1910 she joined a trades union as a textiles worker. Two years later she joined the Social Democratic Party (\\"Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands\\" / SPD). After seven years in the textiles factory, in 1913 she moved to Berlin. In September 1917 she returned to the north-west of Germany, obtaining a job as a housekeeper in Rheydt. She lost her job at the end of the war, and a period of unemployment followed. With help from party colleagues she was now able to participate in a training at the Welfare Academy in Cologne for female welfare workers. From now on she involved herself in issues of welfare, social policy, training and education - themes which became ever more central to her developing social and political engagement. At a one-day party conference in Neuss she was \\"spotted\\" by the ambitious young council official (\\"Landrat\\") from H√∂rde, Wilhelm Hansmann, who encouraged her to apply for a job as a welfare worker in H√∂rde, which at that time was a separate municipality just outside Dortmund. That application came to nothing because of what one source described as bureaucratic and organisational impediments. She may have obtained a posting, briefly, as a welfare worker in Cologne starting in April 1922. Either way, in December 1921 or December 1922 - source differ as to the year - she obtained a job in the welfare sector at another then separate municipality on the edge of Dortmund, L√ºtgendortmund. She moved to L√ºtgendortmund which is where she lived and worked for the rest of her life. After a six-month probationary period her position was made permanent. This was followed by a further training period, and after a national course which she attended at the Women's Spocial Academy at M√ºnster she became a state registered welfare officer. = Politics = She also devoted more of her time, at his stage still on an unpaid basis, to SPD party work locally, during the course of which she won admiration and respect from many party comrades in and around Dortmund. On 4 May 1924 she was elected, for the first time to the L√ºtgendortmund town council. Her name was also placed sufficiently high up on the SPD party list for the Dortmund district elections in November 1924 to ensure her election to the Dortmund district assembly. Here she was elected deputy leader of the chamber. The focus of her work in the assembly was on social issues. She also opposed the local government boundary reforms which would have led to L√ºtgendortmund and other surrounding municipalities being subsumed, for administrative purposes, into a greatly enlarged Dortmund. Despite uncompromising opposition from Schaub and others the reforms were pushed through, with the result that with effect from April 1928 K√§the Schaub ceased to be a L√ºtgendortmund town councillor, becoming instead a city councillor in \\"Greater Dortmund\\" in the ensuing local election. = Nazi years = Change of government in January 1933 was followed by a rapid transition to one-party dictatorship. K√§the Schaub was identified as a Social Democrat which marked her out for state persecution. The government ordered new elections, and in the municipal elections of March 1933 she was re-elected to the city council, although it is not clear if the new city council ever met, and on 20 June 1933 the SPD was formally outlawed. Five days later, while she was out, Nazi paramilitaries searched her apartment and removed various anti-Nazi papers and other documents evidencing \\"left wing thinking\\", along with a list of SPD women in L√ºtgendortmund, an article in support of birth control and a banner clearly intended for use in a demonstration against Clause 218 - Germany's long-standing constitutional anti-abortion provision. The next month the so-called Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service came into force and on 7 April 1933 Dortmund's recently installed Nazi Commissar, Bruno Sch√ºler, removed her from her from her job as a welfare officer. What followed was a period of renewed austerity. Following her enforced retirement Schaub was entitled to a small pension, but this was not enough to live on. She was forced to stop making support payments to relatives and she lost her home. By this time she was in a long-term relationship with Willi Schr√∂der, who with his parents was in the process of building a family home, and she now moved into this half built house with the Schr√∂ders. Despite threats and harassment, during the next few years they were able to use the house as a meeting point for L√ºtgendortmund Social Democrats. Small meetings were held quietly in the garden when outdoor temperatures allowed it. The old banner of the town was kept safely in the house. In 1936/37 they concealed and accommodated the child of friends who were Jewish and had to leave Germany but were not permitted to take the child with them. Later K√§the Schaub was able personally to reunite the child with her parents. In most respects, keeping a low profile, Schr√∂der and Schaub managed to survive the first eleven Nazi years without suffering acute persecution. That changed after the assassination attempt on the leader. Despite failing in its primary objective, the \\"July plot\\" greatly unnerved the government, which feared a further collapse in support for the war on the home front and responded by dusting down lists of political activists from before 1933. The list were not up to date. Many of the names on it belonged to people who had fled abroad or simply died, in some cases from natural causes. Nevertheless, overnight between 22 and 23 August 1944 a \\"mass arrest action\\" by the Gestapo, supported by local police services, took place across Germany. K√§the Schaub was one of approximately 5,000 people arrested in the context of what later came to be known as Aktion Gitter. She was detained in the \\"Dortmund stone keep\\" (\\"Steinwache\\"), the city's by now increasingly infamous prison, informally known, according to one source, as the west German Hell\\" (\\"H√∂lle von Westdeutschland\\"), but she was unexpectedly released after six weeks. = After the war = Military defeat in May 1945 marked the end of the Nazi r√©gime. The central and western two thirds of Germany were now placed under military occupation and divided into four military occupation zones. In Dortmund, now included in the British occupation zone, Schaub quickly resumed her work in the care sector in the L√ºtgendortmund quarter of the city. She had little appetite for any return to politics. It was Wilhelm Hansmann, who had spent the later war years abroad but was now returned to a leading role in regional politics, who persuaded her to return to the political fray. She became a member of the party committee for the sub-district of western Westphalia (Dortmund and the surrounding area) and, from 1947, with only brief interruptions, chaired the regional women's committee. She was also, at one point, a member of the party's national committee. The British, possibly in order to reduce the political importance of what had been Prussia, had reconfigured the state boundaries, creating a new German state of North Rhine- Westphalia. There was a scramble in three of the four allied occupation zones to re-establish democratic institutions, and for the new state a new state parliament (\\"Landtag\\") was set up, convening in D√ºsseldorf. Until elections could be organised seats were allocated, in October 1946, to political parties according to the vote shares received in 1932, which was accepted as the last time free and fair elections had been held. K√§the Schaub was appointed a member of the assembly, representing the SPD (party). When an election was held, in April 1947, she retained her seat, again representing the \\"Dortmund V\\" electoral district. Following the relaunch, in May 1949 of three of the four occupation zones as the US-sponsored German Federal Republic (West Germany), she remained a member of the assembly through several further elections, until 1962 when she turned down the opportunity to put her name forward again. Within the Landtag her party group nominated her to the position of presidium secretary (\\"Schriftf√ºhrerin des Parlamentspr√§sidiums\\"). Reports indicate that she hardly ever addressed the chamber during set piece debates, but behind the scenes contributed fully to committee work. She chaired the parliament's welfare committee and was a member of several other committees covering areas that included De-nazification, Refugees, Budget and Finance. A source indicates that her diplomatic skills and rejection of gratuitous political partisanship caused her to gain the positive soubriquet \\"The Parliament's mother\\" (\\"Mutter des Parlaments\\"). By 1962, when she resigned from Landtag, she had reached the age of 70, and she resigned from most of her other political roles and offices at around the same time. To celebrate her contribution she was awarded the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany, but she rejected the honour, commenting \\"Ich bin nicht f√ºr so etwas\\" (loosely: \\"I'm not a supporter of that sort of thing\\"). However, friends persuaded her to change her mind on this. Regardless of her convictions over the honours system, she was unable to prevent the authorities from naming a street after her in Dortmund-L√ºtgendortmund. K√§the Schaub died towards the end of September 1982 at Dortmund-L√ºtgendortmund.

She continued her studies in Paris at the Acad√©mie Julian, where her teachers included Jean-Paul Laurens, Emile Auguste Carolus-Duran and Jean Jacques Henner. Upon completing her studies, she worked as a portrait painter in Berlin; exhibiting there and in Paris. Eventually, though, she decided to establish herself in Halle. In 1880, she held her first major exhibition at the Prussian Academy of Arts.Ausstellung der K√∂niglichen Akademie der K√ºnste, Die K√∂nigliche Akademie der K√ºnste, Berlin 1880 In 1891, she took part in an exhibition organized by the on the occasion of their fiftieth anniversary.Der Kulturk√§mpfer, Band 2, 1880 Otto Glagau (Ed.), (4.

At the beginning of World War I, she had to abandon her studio in Paris. During the war, she remained in Halle, where she became involved in the \\"National Women's Work\\" program; establishing a sewing room that offered employment opportunities for military wives and widows. Among her best-known works are a series of portraits of Professors at the University of Halle and several military figures, including Gottlieb Graf von Haeseler and her younger brother, . She died after a long stay at a nursing home in Nietleben. She was originally buried near Magdeburg but, when the cemetery there was closed, she was transferred to the family plot in Althaldensleben.

While many organisations use their own mechanisms, increasingly, aggregated digital identities are in use. Many Australian organisations leverage popular ubiquitous Internet identities such as those provided by social login services including Facebook, Google, Twitter and Linked In to perform the following functions: * Single sign-on to help users avoiding creating new user names and passwords for each site. * To provide some basic validation of identity * To provide some integration, especially with social media, e-mail and contacts * To identify the natural person behind a transaction for statutory purposes such as a monetary transfer In addition to these services, in order to validate identities in Australia additional services are used, such as government, and bank digital identities. SIM as Digital identity The use of a mobile phone SIM as a Digital identity in Australia provides some level of validation of the digital identity of the holder. Validation of the holder can be done by sending them an SMS to their phone number. The advantage of this mechanism is: * SIMs are generally unique * The mobile phone number is known to the holder, and often the trusting organisation, and used as the contact of the customer * The mobile phone generally is carried by the person wherever they go * There is a high penetration of mobile phones in Australia, in 2015 covering almost 80% of individuals * There are some identity requirements in obtaining a SIM, so there can be a level of certainty that the holder is a known natural person, and resident (or temporary resident) of Australia even if the plan is Prepaid For this reason the mobile phone is often used as a primary or second-factor validation of identity on Australian digital services. myGov myGov is a service provided by the Government of Australia that provides a strong level of validation of digital identity. It is used primarily for Government (including some state Government) and semi-Government services such as: * Centrelink for social welfare applications and payments * Medicare for health care * Australian Taxation Office to enable online tax returns * Child Support * Victorian Housing Register * My Health Record for Electronic Health Records * National Disability Insurance Scheme * My Aged Care * Department of Veterans' Affairs (Australia) online facilities * Australian Job Search (government job search network) myGov also integrates with Australia Post MyPost Digital Mailbox to facilitate secure electronic document delivery, as most government departments avoid the use of e-mail to directly deliver private documents. myGov logins also support a number of other login services especially in government such as Origination of a myGov account can be done without the use of identity documentation, so it is possible to create an account without a valid natural person. However, as services are added, access to private information, such as documents or identity that should only be known by the individual concerned, is required, making the identity stronger. Many services require a second factor of authentication - SMS via a SIM based mobile phone number as mentioned above. myGovID Separate to myGov, myGovID is a digital ID component, that allows a form of Second Factor Authentication to Government websites through a mobile app. A user attempts a login online using their email, a pin is generated, and the user types the online pin into their mobile app, and online login can be completed. The myGovID application supports government departments building their own websites, and does not require the single portal access of myGov. Australia Post Digital iD Digital iD by Australia Post is a smart phone based app that allows users to create and validate their ID against the Australian Government Document Verification Service (DVS) and then use it as a primary ID system online and in person. Users can use their Passports, Drivers Licenses, Medicare Card to assert and confirm ID online. A photo is taken, and head movement is detected to ensure the holder is real and their face matches. Your passport can be scanned using the phone's NFC reader and used to assert biometrics. The user's image with dynamic security features, and an updating QR code are then displayed to people to verify the ID. The date of birth and full name are displayed on the app. Australia Post claims it is acceptable for use to validate the holder's identity. It can be used instead of KeyPass for holders 18 years and older. The Digital iD website states that it is used by over 50 government and private organisations across a variety of industries and sectors. Launched in 2016, questions were raised as to longevity of the offering after the founder quit, however, continued investment from Australia Post has seen Digital iD become the first industry provider accredited under the federal government‚Äôs Trusted Digital Identity Framework (TDIF). Usage of Digital iD is growing, and Keypass in Digital iD is now accepted as proof of age to enter participating licensed venues and to purchase alcohol in Vic, Tas, Qld, ACT and NT (excluding takeaway alcohol in NT). Online Banking Online Banking in Australia requires digital identification. As in other jurisdictions, access to bank accounts statements and making payments are the primary services available. In addition to these, it is possible to access documents (almost exclusively bills) from other corporations online using BPAY View. Over 300 billers are supported via this mechanism. For some transactions multi-factor authentication is required. Normally this is a password in combination with a code sent via SMS or in some cases, especially for business customers, a bank-issued security token. Most online banking services, especially if accessing an account requires the holder to complete stringent identity requirements sometimes in a bank branch. This ensures the quality of the identity. The four major online banking sites in Australia are: * Commonwealth Bank of Australia * Westpac * National Australia Bank * ANZ Bank State Government Services Some States and territories of Australia offer access points to Government services in those states, and require a digital identity to access these services. Service NSW is an example - an account can be created without any verifiable identity, however as services (such as Roads and Maritime Services) are added, private details need to be accessible, increasing the validity of the identity. The South Australian government has made several digital licences available via the mySA GOV app (Driver's licence, Proof of Age Card etc). NSW also provides some licences online. Queensland's Department of Transport and Main Roads is currently trailing a digital license in the Fraser Coast Region. Tax file number The Australian Tax file number (TFN) is a 9 digit identity document issued to tax payers. There is no card or official identity document in popular use that shows this number and strict rules on its use means that it is not required to be provided, and there is no practical way a non government entity to verify the holder against the number. It is therefore not an effective widespread digital identity (unlike the US Social Security number). However it is used to digitally identify tax paying entities behind transactions via financial institutions when the number has been disclosed. Failure to disclose the tax file number can draw attention to the transaction and/or result in tax being withheld, so it is used for specific purposes. Digital identity verification services Identity and associated information can be verified a number of ways: * The Australian Attorney-General's Department provides a Document Verification Service (DVS) that allows for validation of some licences. * The Australian Attorney-General's Department also provides a bio-metric face verification service *Visas, identity, and right to work status can be checked online through the Department of Immigration and Border Protection's Visa Entitlement Verification Online (VEVO) service. * Some States and territories allow for drivers licences, photo cards and certificates to be validated online e.g. NSW and Victoria. * Electoral enrollment can be verified electronically, and may help to verify an identity. * Private companies offer aggregated online identity checking services e.g. Vix Verify and Equifax * In addition, certain aspects of individuals can be verified digitally - online, such as: ** Working With Children Check to ensure that an individual has cleared the necessary background checks to allow them to work with children. To apply for a check the applicant must physically attend an agency, however the employer can verify the check online, for the duration of employment. ** Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission ACIC allows organisations to provide National Police History Check certificates on ACIC's behalf. Some of these can be obtained online (such as Veritas), and later verified online. ** Some institutions allow the online verification of education qualifications.

Forming as a tropical low on 23 March, the low gradually intensified to a named tropical cyclone on 26 March. After steadily strengthening offshore to a Category 4 system, Debbie eventually made landfall near Airlie Beach, at 12:40 AEST on 28 March. Afterwards, Debbie rapidly weakened into a tropical low by late 28 March, but continued to travel south, causing significant damage and flooding in the populous areas of South East Queensland and Northern Rivers. In total, the storm caused A$3.5 billion (US$2.67 billion) in damage and fourteen deaths across Australia, primarily as a result of extreme flooding. This makes Debbie the deadliest cyclone to hit Australia since Fifi in 1991. Meteorological history On 22 March 2017, a well-defined but weak area of low pressure developed over the Coral Sea, near the Louisiade Archipelago of Papua New Guinea. Strong wind shear aloft kept the accompanying convection poorly organised and displaced west of the surface circulation. With environmental conditions forecast to improve and favour cyclogenesis, the Australian Bureau of Meteorology's (BOM) Tropical Cyclone Warning Centre in Brisbane classified the system as a tropical low. Throughout the following day, decreasing shear enabled convection to wrap around the low; however, convective activity remained largely transient. A mid-level ridge to the east and an approaching trough over the Tasman Sea steered the low generally south. High sea surface temperatures of and excellent dual-channel outflow fuelled rapid consolidation on 24 March. This prompted the United States-based Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) to issue a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert, indicating the system was likely to acquire gale-force winds within 24 hours. A scatterometer pass at 11:56 UTC revealed surface winds of up to 75 km/h (45 mph) and subsequent satellite intensity estimates supported gale-intensity, and the JTWC accordingly classified the system as Tropical Cyclone 13P by 21:00 UTC. With exceptionally favourable environmental conditions ahead of the storm, the agency noted a high probability for rapid deepening before landfall in Queensland. The BOM followed suit soon thereafter, classifying the system as a Category 1 tropical cyclone on the Australian cyclone intensity scale at 00:00 UTC on 25 March. Concurrently, they assigned it the name Debbie. The cyclone continued to track generally southwards, developing into a Category 2 cyclone later that day. After attaining that strength, Debbie assumed a generally southwestwards track‚Äîa track it would maintain, with minor fluctuations, until about 14 hours after landfall. After a day-long period of arrested development, environmental conditions became highly favourable for renewed intensification. Beginning early on 27 March, Debbie strengthened rapidly from Category 2 to a Category 4 severe tropical cyclone in just 12 hours, and achieving peak sustained winds of 175 km/h (110 mph) and a minimum pressure of 949 hPa (28.02 inHg). After that, the Dvorak intensity given that the storm weakened slightly. Debbie passed over the Whitsunday Islands in the morning of 28 March local time with winds of 165 km/h (105 mph), still at Category 4 intensity. Nonetheless, the cyclone weakened to Category 3 before making landfall in Airlie Beach at 02:40 UTC with winds of 150 km/h (90 mph). Following landfall, Debbie began to weaken steadily while interacting with North Queensland's rugged terrain. The cyclone weakened below severe tropical cyclone status while passing Collinsville at 12:00 UTC on 28 March. The system was downgraded to Category 1 in the early hours of 29 March local time, and then weakened further to a tropical low six few hours afterwards. The tropical low then executed a long turn to the southeast, and proceeded towards South East Queensland, moving roughly parallel to the coast. The remnants of Debbie brought heavy rainfall‚Äîtorrential rains in many areas‚Äîthat resulted in flooding in large parts of the land areas across which it tracked, before moving out over the Pacific Ocean on Friday 31 March.  Preparations  An MRH-90 helicopter in 2015, similar to the ones deployed from HMAS Albatross to aid in Operation Queensland Assist Major storm surge was seen as one of the most dangerous factors associated with the approaching cyclone. With the storm potentially coinciding with high tide, it was estimated that water rise in some areas could potentially exceed . Residents in low-lying areas across Bowen, Proserpine and Airlie Beach were ordered to evacuate their homes. Late on 27 March, just over 12 hours prior to landfall, 25,000 residents in low-lying areas of Mackay were ordered to evacuate. Approximately 5,500 people in the Bowen area were also urged to leave. Across Queensland, more than 400 schools and education centres were closed. All flights at Townsville Airport, Proserpine/Whitsunday Coast Airport, Mackay Airport, Hamilton Island Airport and Moranbah Airport were cancelled from 27 March, and Queensland Rail suspended train services between Rockhampton and Townsville. North Queensland Bulk Ports closed the ports at Mackay, Abbot Point and Hay Point. A total of 1,000 emergency personnel and more than 200 Energex workers were deployed to the region to assist with Ergon Energy's preparations and clean up operations. The Australian Defence Force formed Joint Task Force 661, dubbed \\"Operation Queensland Assist\\", to provide assistance with aeromedical evacuation, search and rescue, road clearance, restoration of essential services, emergency accommodation and the delivery of stores if required. The Royal Australian Navy landing ship HMAS Choules set sail from Sydney to Queensland to support post-storm recovery. Normally, HMAS Canberra and HMAS Adelaide would be deployed; however, propulsion issues with the two vessels kept them docked for repairs. Three MRH-90 helicopters from HMAS Albatross were also deployed to Queensland. The Royal Australian Air Force put transport aircraft on standby at Townsville, RAAF Base Amberley and RAAF Base Darwin. The Australian Defence Force's pre-deployment of resources was the largest in the nation's history in advance of a natural disaster; approximately 1,200 personnel were deployed. =Media criticism= There was criticism of the intense coverage of the cyclone by commercial TV media, including some unsafe actions by reporters. Former Deputy Leader of Australian Greens, Adam Bandt, was criticised by the conservative government's Federal Energy Minister for suggesting that construction of new coal plants would cause climate change, and hence increase the intensity of extreme weather events like Cyclone Debbie.  Impact  =Queensland= An unexpected turn to the south during the cyclone's final approach to the Queensland coast brought the storm directly on top of Hamilton Island, where no evacuations took place. Damage was reported on the Whitsunday Islands, as strong winds lifted some roofs from houses; on Hamilton Island, sustained winds reached with gusts up to around 10:28 a.m. local time on 28 March. Winds in excess of battered the island for more than 24 hours. Power outages affected at least 63,000 properties across Queensland, and numerous trees were uprooted during the storm, with some crashing onto homes. Major damage was reported across Bowen, where most homes had been built before stricter building codes were enforced. Approximately 300 people, primarily tourists, on Daydream Island were left stranded and in dire need of supplies. Attempts were made to evacuate residents from the island; however, ships were unable to dock as the jetty was destroyed. Queensland after Debbie on March 31 A flock of cockatoos was caught in the storm near Airlie Beach, and many died while clinging to tree branches. One particular bird, later nicknamed Debbie, was found stripped of its feathers by Townsville Bulletin photographer Alix Sweeney and rescued as the cyclone's eye passed through. The story of Debbie became a viral headline. Although seemingly in good spirits once the storm cleared, the bird died during the overnight of 29‚Äì30 March likely due to internal injuries. Inclement weather and evacuations associated with the cyclone were blamed for a fatal car accident near Proserpine on 27 March, where one person died on-scene whilst two others were hospitalised. A man in Proserpine also suffered an injury and was hospitalised after a wall collapsed on him on 28 March. Torrential rains‚Äîdescribed by the BOM as \\"phenomenal\\"‚Äîaffected large portions of Queensland, particularly in the Pioneer Basin. Forty-eight-hour accumulations in the area exceeded ‚Äîthese areas see an average of of rain per year. West of Mackay, the Kinchant and Middle Creek dams overflowed, prompting additional evacuation of residents. Multiple sections of the Bruce Highway between Townsville and Mackay were submerged by floodwaters, prompting its closure. The ex-tropical cyclone went on to cause damage further south, particularly around the Logan and Albert Rivers, flooding infrastructure such as the Beenleigh railway station and resulting in the death of a 77-year-old man in Eagleby. Damage to Queensland's sugar industry is expected to cost A$150 million (US$114.5 million). The majority of these costs lie in Proserpine and Mackay. 35% of all sugarcane in the Proserpine region and 20% of all sugarcane in the Mackay region were damaged, costing A$50 million (US$38.2 million) and A$81 million (US$61.8 million) respectively. Damage to winter crops in the Bowen‚ÄìGumlu region reached A$100 million (US$76.4 million). Insured losses across Australia reached A$1.65 billion (US$1.26 billion), with 73,000 damage claims being filed. Total economic losses reached A$3.5 billion (US$2.67 billion). In addition, a total of eight deaths were reported throughout Queensland. =New South Wales= Flooding on the Tweed River. View from Terranora on 1 April 2017 Ex-Tropical Cyclone Debbie continued to move south and merged with a cold front moving up the north coast of New South Wales. This triggered heavy rainfall in the Northern Rivers and led to significant flooding in the Tweed, Lismore, Byron, Richmond Valley, Kyogle and Ballina local government areas. A woman drowned in floodwaters at a rural property south of Murwillumbah, while the Pacific Motorway was cut off by floodwaters at Chinderah. New South Wales Premier Gladys Berejiklian declared the regions as disaster zones, thus enabling the residents to access disaster assistance funding. Two more people were confirmed to have drowned in floodwaters on 1 April, another south of Murwillumbah and one at Gungal. On 3 April, a mother and two of her children drowned when their car plunged into the flooded Tweed River at Tumbulgum. In total, Debbie killed six people in New South Wales. =New Zealand= A week after becoming extratropical, the remnants of Cyclone Debbie passed over New Zealand, causing flash flooding over many areas. The township of Edgecumbe in the Bay of Plenty region was evacuated on April 6 due to flooding, and a state of emergency declared. The insurance claims reached NZ$91.5 million (US$63.8 million). Aftermath Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk pledged () to assist the Australian Red Cross Society, Salvation Army, St. Vincent de Paul Society of Queensland, and UnitingCare Community in distributing supplies. Debbie was the only name from the 2016-2017 season to be retired by the Bureau of Meteorology, It was replaced by Dara in mid-2018.

Raised in 1797, the regiment took part in conflicts throughout British India, serving with distinction in the Second Anglo-Maratha War, the First Anglo-Afghan War and the First Anglo-Sikh War, earning various battle honours. In April 1857, 85 men of the regiment refused to accept cartridges for their carbines and were tried by court-martial, convicted, and sentenced to up to 10 years' hard labour. After the men were imprisoned, the regiment freed their jailed comrades and headed to Delhi, where their arrival led to the outbreak of the Indian Mutiny. Following the events of the mutiny, all the Bengal Light Cavalry regiments were disbanded. History On 7 January 1796, the board of directors of the East India Company instructed the Governor-General to raise four 465-strong regiments of Native cavalry for its Bengal Army. Consequently, in 1797, the 3rd Bengal Native Cavalry was raised in Oude by Captain J. P. Pigot. At first, the terms \\"Bengal Native Cavalry\\" and \\"Bengal Light Cavalry\\" were used interchangeably, but by 1857 the regiment was referred to as the 3rd Bengal Light Cavalry in official paperwork. The regiment served with distinction during the Second Anglo-Maratha War, taking part in the Battle of Delhi and the Battle of Laswari in 1803, as part of a force commanded by General Gerard Lake against the forces of Daulat Rao Sindhia; for their service during this campaign, the regiment was awarded an Honorary Standard bearing the inscription \\"Lake and Victory\\" and an extra Jemadar. The regiment earned the \\"Delhi 1803\\", \\"Leswarree\\" and \\"Deig\\" battle honours during this campaign. The 3rd Bengal Light Cavalry was present throughout the Siege of Bharatpur (December 1825 ‚Äì January 1826) as part of a cavalry brigade, taking part in the final assault on the fortress and earning the \\"Bhurtpore\\" battle honour. The regiment also took part in the 1839 First Anglo-Afghan War, participating in the Battle of Ghazni, earning the \\"Affghanistan 1839\\" and \\"Ghuznee 1839\\" battle honours. During the 1845‚Äì1846 First Anglo-Sikh War, the regiment fought in the Battle of Aliwal and the Battle of Sobraon and was awarded battle honours for both. Meerut In 1857, the regiment had been stationed in Meerut for three years, forming part of the Meerut Division under Major General William Hewitt. The East India Company planned to supply its locally recruited \\"Native\\" regiments with the Pattern 1853 Enfield rifle during that year, accompanied by a new type of ammunition that came in the form of a greased paper cartridge. The standard drill (or formal procedure) for loading this ammunition required the user to bite the paper cartridge to open it. Rumours began to circulate within the Bengal Presidency that the grease for the cartridges was made from a mix of lard from pigs and tallow from cows, and was therefore offensive to both Hindu and Muslim sepoy alike. These rumours reached Lieutenant Colonel George M. Carmichael-Smyth, in temporary command of the regiment, while he was on leave in Mussoorie. On his return to Meerut, Carmichael-Smyth received orders for the new drill, which applied to all weapons currently in use including those which did not take the new form of ammunition. Carmichael-Smyth modified the drill so that cartridges would be torn by hand, rather than biting. On 23 April, Carmichael-Smyth announced a parade for the following day, during which the men of the regiment would be taught the new drill, using the muskets and ammunition which they had been using for years, rather than the new rifles or ammunition. During that evening, the men decided that they would not accept the cartridges; some approached a junior officer directly, and when they were told that none of the new cartridges were being used, they stated that using any type of cartridge would \\"lay themselves open to the imputation from their comrades and from other regiments of having fired the objectionable ones.\\" These concerns were communicated to Carmichael-Smyth, who decided that the parade would go ahead as planned; during the night, Carmichael-Smyth's tent and some buildings were destroyed by fire. The following morning, 90 men, the regiment's carabiniers or skirmishers, were lined up to carry out the new parade drill using blank ammunition. When Carmichael-Smyth arrived at the parade ground, he found that no man had taken their ammunition, and he ordered the Havildar Major to carry out the drill. There was then an attempt to distribute the cartridges to the rest of the carabiniers but this was refused, despite a speech from Carmichael-Smyth reminding the men that the cartridges were the type they had been using for years. Out of 90 men, 85 refused the order to accept the ammunition. Hewitt convened a Court of Inquiry, judged by Indian officers, to investigate the events. The inquiry found that the ammunition issued to the men was of the same type the men previously used, and was in fact manufactured under the supervision of one of the five men who had accepted his ammunition during the parade. During the inquiry, only one man expressed a concern regarding the greased cartridges; the wider concerns of the men were based on the perceived stigma that they would face if they had accepted the ammunition. The inquiry found that the men had no reasonable cause, and no religious grounds, to refuse to accept the cartridges. A court martial was ordered, again composed entirely of Indian officers (six Muslim, nine Hindu), and this took place over a three-day period with each of the 85 men giving a plea of \\"not guilty\\". The men were found guilty, by 14 of 15 officers, of disobeying orders, and were sentenced to 10 years' hard labour. The judges asked Hewitt to take into consideration the fact that the men were of good character and had been misled, but this was ignored as Hewitt felt there had been no expression of remorse. Eleven of the men, the youngest, had their sentences reduced from 10 to 5 years, but sentences of the remaining men were confirmed on 8 May. At 05:00 on 9 May 1857, a parade of the entire Meerut Division took place, to announce the sentences of the convicted men. The troops present included the 60th Rifles, 6th Dragoon Guards, and batteries of Bengal Artillery, as well as the 11th Regiment of Bengal Native Infantry, the 20th Regiment of Bengal Native Infantry and, dismounted, the remainder of the men of the 3rd Bengal Light Cavalry. The sentences were read, and the men stripped of their uniforms, then placed in shackles, while the Meerut Division watched. Despite pleas from the condemned men, none of their fellow soldiers came to their assistance. The entire process took around two hours to complete, following which the convicted soldiers were handed over to the civilian authorities and taken to the local jail under armed escort. After the parade, Hewitt communicated to his headquarters that all was calm, but during the night various junior officials received warnings of impending trouble from concerned sepoys or members of their household staff. Mutiny \\"The Sepoy revolt at Meerut,\\" from the Illustrated London News, 1857 The following day, a Sunday, at around 18:00, a general disturbance was reported in the town bazaar and columns of smoke were seen, rising from burning buildings. The 60th Rifles were waiting outside the local church, ready to attend a service, which had been delayed by half an hour on account of unusually warm weather; the sound of gunfire from the town alerted them to trouble. They headed to their own barracks, armed themselves, and were on their parade square awaiting orders when they were attacked by mounted troopers from the 3rd Bengal Light Cavalry. Upon finding the 60th Rifles unexpectedly armed and waiting for them, the troopers rode away, headed directly to the jail and released their comrades with the help of a local blacksmith. At the same time, soldiers from the 11th and 20th Regiments of Bengal Native Infantry were mutinying, killing some of their officers and some civilians (while helping some of their officers and officers' families to escape), and burning a number of buildings within the town. One company of the 60th Rifles was ordered to guard the treasury, a second company was ordered to guard their barracks, and the remainder of the 60th Rifles, joined by the 6th Dragoon Guards, headed to the barracks of the Native Infantry regiments. When they arrived, they found the buildings ablaze and the area deserted. Hewitt, concerned about the possibility of attack, withdrew the troops back toward their barracks and encamped them nearby. Throughout the mutiny and subsequent rioting, one troop consisting of between 80 and 90 members of the 3rd Bengal Light Cavalry remained loyal to their officers. The mutinying soldiers from the 3rd Bengal Light Cavalry, having released their comrades from the jail, returned to Meerut and joined in with the rioting along with members of the local civilian population, and then the mutineers from all three regiments left, heading to Delhi, although the fact that they had left Meerut was not discovered by the military authorities until the following morning and they did not know the direction in which the mutineers had departed. \\"Indian Mutiny: Massacre of officers by insurgent cavalry at Delhi,\\" from the Illustrated London News, 1857 At approximately 09:00 on 11 May, a small body of cavalry, followed by a larger body in the distance, was seen approaching Delhi along the road between that city and Meerut. The East India Company employees immediately noted that this was unusual, and the senior military officers present within the city attempted to contact Meerut by telegraph to enquire about the approaching troops, but the telegraph line between Delhi and Meerut appeared to have been cut. The 54th Regiment of Bengal Native Infantry, one of three Bengal Native Infantry regiments garrisoned within Delhi's Red Fort, was ordered to intercept them. A party of East India Company civil servants went to secure the fort's Calcutta Gate, but when they arrived they found that troopers from the 3rd Bengal Light Cavalry had already taken control of it. A struggle ensued which led to the death of a cavalry trooper and a civilian. A small group of troopers from the regiment headed toward the city's jail and released the inmates, meeting with no resistance. The main body of the regiment then arrived, joining up with the party at the Calcutta Gate, and then collectively they entered the fort and attacked the civilians within. A small group from the advance party gained access to the private courtyard of Bahadur Shah II and told him that he should take command of them. The regiment spread out throughout the fort and the city, and was eventually joined in mutiny by the forces of Bahadur Shah II and members of the Bengal Native Infantry who were based within the fort; a widespread outbreak of looting, burning of buildings and murder of East India Company employees and civilian shopkeepers took place, and the Indian Mutiny began in earnest. The mutineers of the 3rd Bengal Light Cavalry remained at Delhi until the breaking of the Siege of Delhi in September 1857. They withdrew first to Lucknow, then later to Nepal, where the majority of the men died through combat, disease or starvation. Those that eventually managed to make their way back to their homes found themselves shunned by their communities for their part in the mutiny. The regiment itself, in common with every other regiment of Bengal Light Cavalry, was disbanded at the end of the Indian Mutiny. Historical perspective The way the situation had been handled was subject to criticism; firstly, the choice by Carmichael-Smyth to hold the firing drill parade was immediately criticised by his superior, Hewitt, who felt that had the parade not been held, the issue with the cartridges \\"would have blown over.\\" Furthermore, a junior officer from Carmichael-Smyth's regiment, Lieutenant John Campbell MacNabb, felt that the drill parade was unnecessary and stated that the dislike held by the men toward their commanding officer was an aggravating factor in the events that followed. When Hewitt informed the Commander in Chief, Major General George Anson, about the public nature of the men's sentence, and of placing them in irons in front of the entire Meerut Division, on 9 May, Anson confirmed the sentences but did not approve of the \\"unusual procedure\\" that Hewitt had followed. For his conduct on 10 May, Hewitt later faced criticism from Lieutenant General Sir Patrick Grant, (who was the acting Commander in Chief by that point, following Anson's death) and from John Lawrence (who was then Commissioner of Punjab province). Following the mutiny of the troops at Meerut, Hewitt's command of the Meerut Division was taken away. At a subsequent appeal, Hewitt and his immediate subordinate, Brigadier General Archdale Wilson of the Bengal Artillery, blamed each other for the way the situation unfolded; Hewitt said that Wilson was responsible for the tactics on the day, and Wilson stated that as Hewitt was the overall commander, responsibility lay with him; Hewitt lost the appeal. The historian Kim A. Wagner, in his 2010 book The Great Fear of 1857, stated that the senior officers' fear of \\"making a 'wrong decision'\\" led them to make no decision at all, \\"with devastating results\\". Field Marshal Frederick Roberts, in his 1897 book Forty-one Years in India, gave an opposing view; Roberts stated that he doubted \\"whether anything would have been gained\\" by an attempt to pursue the mutineers as the cavalry available (the 6th Dragoon Guards) was at that time composed mainly of recruits with horses that had not yet been broken and it was impractical to follow the mutineers with either infantry or artillery. Roberts went on to say \\"after careful consideration of all the circumstances of the revolt at Meerut, I have come to the conclusion that it would have been futile to have sent the small body of mounted troops available in pursuit of the mutineers on the night of the 10th May, and that, considering the state of feeling throughout the Native army, no action, however prompt, on the part of the Meerut authorities could have arrested the Mutiny. The sepoys had determined to throw off their allegiance to the British Government, and the when and the how were merely questions of time and opportunity.\\" The actions of the 3rd Bengal Light Cavalry themselves were described by Major Agha Amin, writing for Defence Journal, as \\"a coup d'√©tat and an outstanding example of initiative and courage.\\" See also *Causes of the Indian Rebellion of 1857 Citations References    1857 in India 19th-century military history of the United Kingdom Bengal Presidency Indian Rebellion of 1857 Military history of British India Honourable East India Company regiments Military units and formations established in 1797 Military units and formations disestablished in 1857 ","title":"3rd Bengal Light Cavalry"},{"id":"53594990","text":"John Brownrigg may refer to: * John Brownrigg (architect) (1911‚Äì2002), British architect * John Studholme Brownrigg (1786‚Äì1853), English merchant and politician * John Brownrigg (water polo) ","title":"John Brownrigg"},{"id":"53595001","text":"Blood Machine (2001) is the second collaborative album by American ambient musicians Steve Roach and Vir Unis, released in 2001.Blood Machine, Projekt RecordsSteve Roach Official Site, Blood Machine  Reception  AllMusic rated the album a 3 of 5, stating \\"Blood Machine is quite a departure from both Roach's and Vir Unis' work of late, but undoubtedly this is one of the freshest recordings of 2001.\\"  Track listing   Personnel  Adapted from Discogs.Blood Machine, Discogs * Sam Rosenthal ‚Äì layout * Roger King ‚Äì mastering * Steve Roach ‚Äì mixing, performer, mastering, artwork * Vir Unis ‚Äì performer, cover images  References  2001 albums Steve Roach (musician) albums Green House Music albums ","title":"Blood Machine"},{"id":"53595027","text":"Ebchester railway station served the village of Ebchester, County Durham, England from 1867 to 1953 on the Derwent Valley Railway.

It is called Szentl√©lek-templom in Hungarian. The very first church was built in 1717. After the Turkish occupation and the R√°k√≥czi's War of Independence, Rusyn people settled down in the area, and the first church was built up by Rusyns, which they made out of wood. In 1777, a mysterious event was recognised by local people. In the devotional picture, in which Virgin Mary and the Child are painted, bloody tears were rolling down on Mary‚Äôs face on the surface of the painting. This supernatural event is one of the Marian apparations. The painting was delivered to Eger, but in 1973, the original painting was transported back to Saj√≥p√°lfala. Saj√≥p√°lfala belongs to the destinations of The Way of Mary. It is a pilgrimage route, which connects Marian shrines. Other sights can be visited near Saj√≥p√°lfala, for example, in Saj√≥v√°mos, Szirmabeseny≈ë, Miskolc, Sziksz√≥ and Aszal√≥. The previous wooden church was demolished, and in 1779 a church was constructed which can be still admired in the present. It is 26 metres high, more than 7 metres wide, and the walls are between 70 and 140 centimetres thick built of stone. At the end of the 19th century, the tower of the church was constructed which is approximately 30 metres high. In 1933, the very detailed stained glass of the church was created. Today there are three bells inside the church. At the beginning of the 1800s, a bell was made which measures about 400 kilograms. 22 years later a bell of 200 kilograms was made and finally, in 1861, a bell of half the weight of the previous one was constructed. Although in the middle of the 20th century the bell of 200 kilograms had to be taken because of military purposes, it was later substituted with a new one.Papp Faber, Erika. \\"Our Mother's Tears: Ten Weeping Madonnas in Historic Hungary\\", New Bedford. .

He damaged the city's Hindu temples, and looted a large amount of wealth.  Background  Alauddin Khalji was the governor of Kara in Sultan Jalaluddin's Delhi Sultanate. Although he feigned allegiance to the Sultan, he was determined to dethrone Jalaluddin, and sought to raise money for a successful coup. Towards this objective, he decided to target Bhilsa, a wealthy city in the Paramara kingdom of Malwa. By the 1290s, the Paramaras had been weakened by Chahamana, Vaghela, and Yadava invasions. In late 1292 CE, Alauddin Khalji obtained the Sultan's permission to raid Bhilsa.  The raid  In 1293 CE, Alauddin marched towards Bhilsa via the Chanderi-Ujjain road. His sudden attack took the city's residents by surprise. The town had several richly-endowed Hindu temples, from which Alauddin obtained a large amount of wealth, including precious metals and cattle. The residents of Bhilsa concealed their idols in the riverbed of Betwa to prevent Alauddin's army from desecrating them. But Alauddin had these idols hauled out of Betwa. He damaged a number of temples, and plundered a large amount of wealth. According to Badauni's Muntakhab-ut-Tawarikh, Alauddin also brought to Delhi a large Hindu idol, which was placed at the Badaun Gate to be trampled by the people.  Aftermath  At Bhilsa, Alauddin came to know about the immense wealth of the southern Seuna (Yadava) kingdom, and about the routes leading to their capital Devagiri. Therefore, he shrewdly surrendered the loot from Bhilsa to Jalaluddin to gain the Sultan's confidence, while withholding the information on the Yadava kingdom. A pleased Jalaluddin rewarded Alauddin with the office of Ariz-i Mamalik (Ministry of War), which his father once held. Jalaluddin also made him the governor of Awadh, and granted his request to use the revenue surplus for hiring additional troops. Subsequently in 1296, Alauddin raided Devagiri, and used that loot to raise an army and usurp the power from Jalaluddin.

The Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) retained their majority with Sir Basil McFarland continuing as Mayor of Londonderry. The elections were postponed from the original February date due to an unusually large number of objections to the list of electors.  Background  The election was held following the passage of the 1946 Elections and Franchise Act (Northern Ireland) by the Parliament of Northern Ireland which limited the voting franchise to only ratepayers and their wives and granted business owners the rights to cast up to six business votes (depending on the size of their business.) The boundaries for the election had also been reviewed by the Londonderry Corporation and drawn by the Parliament of Northern Ireland.  Campaigns  Controversy arose during the calling of the election. On 20 January 1946, the Londonderry Corporation called the election to be held on 10 February and only gave candidates 11 days to file for candidacy. No reason was given for this by Sir Basil though it was speculated in the United States House of Representatives by the Montana 1st representative Mike Mansfield that it was only called so that the old electoral register with its unionist majority would be used rather than a new one that was due to come into effect six weeks later. This would have had the effect of disenfranchising younger nationalist voters which would have given nationalists a majority. The Taoiseach of the Irish Free State held a meeting at Mansion House, Dublin, with nationalist party leaders from Northern Ireland as well as Irish Free State parties. Collectively, they released a statement condemning the move calling it \\"electoral manipulation\\" and encouraged nationalists in the Londonderry Borough Council area to legally object. Owing to the controversies and challenges to the electors' eligibility, the election was delayed until 16 October. During pre-election hustings, William Henry McLaughlin, who was standing for election for the UUP in Waterside, declared that he had only ever employed one Roman Catholic in forty-eight years and that was only due to a case of mistaken identity. Council results The election was won by the UUP with a majority of 12 seats. The Nationalist Party won 6 seats and the Northern Ireland Labour Party won 2. The UUP won 3 aldermen with the Nationalists and Labour winning 1 each. In the North Ward, the UUP won all 6 available seats while in the South Ward, the Nationalists won 4, Labour won 1 and 1 joint Nationalist and Labour candidate was elected. In Waterside, 3 UUP members were returned in an uncontested election for the ward.

Minorsky highly praised the author for his neutrality. The book is one of the few primary sources on the history of Aq Qoyunlu dynasty and in particular, it contains valuable information about the reigns of Sultan Ya'qub, Sultan Khalil and Uzun Hasan. It seems that Khunji planned to write a second volume, but today there's no evidence of it and other historians also didn't mention anything about a second volume. The Aq Qoyunlu dynasty fell into chaos after the death of Sultan Ya'qub, and Sunni Muslims became the subject of persecution by Ismail I in the subsequent years. For these reasons, it's unlikely that Khunji ever wrote a second volume. Khunji agreed to write a book on the history of Aq Qoyunlu dynasty when he met Sultan Ya'qub near the Sahand mountain.

A common example is 4x4. Formula Configurations The formula is defined as follows: A √ó B / C or A √ó B * C with: * A = number of wheels (twin-mounted tires count as one wheel) * B = number of driven wheels * / = the fore of the rear axles is steered (pusher axle) = the rearmost of the rear axles is steered (tag axle) * C = number of steered wheels Basis is always the standard configuration, meaning a steered front axle and a non-steered driven rear axle. This means: If only the front wheels are steered, the rearmost part of the formula can be left out. The most common example is probably the 4√ó4 configuration. 6√ó4*4 is the chassis configuration for a vehicle with six wheels where four wheels are driven, in addition, the two front wheels as well as the rearmost two wheels are steered. In this case it is a three-axled vehicle. Often the formula A √ó B √ó C is used. Even if the information contained by C is needless, it means that only front axles are steered. This can give information about the distribution of axles.

Orenstein's Reweaving the World is considered a seminal ecofeminist text which has had \\"a crucial role in the development of U.S. ecofeminism as a political position\\". Biography Orenstein received a B.A. in Romance Languages and Literature from Brandeis University in 1959 and an M.A. in Slavic Languages and Literature from Radcliffe Graduate School of Harvard University in 1961. She studied in abroad in 1957 and 1958 completing courses at both the Sorbonne, University of Paris and Ecole du Louvre. Orenstein began her teaching career in 1963, when she accepted a position teaching High school French in Lexington, MA. She returned to New York University to continue her education, completing a Ph.D. in Comparative Literature in 1971. From 1975 to 1981 she was faculty of Rutgers University where she also served as the chair of the Women's Studies Program from 1976 to 1978. She was hired as Professor in the Department of Comparative Literature and Gender Studies at the University of Southern California in 1981 where she taught until she retired. She is a professor emerita of the University of Southern California. Orenstein was the apprentice of the Shaman of Samiland. Orenstein received a Lifetime Achievement award from the Women's Caucus for Art in February 2018 in Los Angeles, CA. Work Orenstein's early work focuses on the women of Surrealism. Her first book The Theater of the Marvelous: Surrealism and The Contemporary Stage (1975) established her as a pioneer of the field. Important writings = Reweaving the World = Reweaving the World, co- edited by Orenstein and Irene Diamond, posits an ecofeminist movement that brings together ‚Äúthe environmental, feminist, and women‚Äôs spirituality movements out of a shared concern for the well-being of the Earth and all forms of life that our Earth supports.‚ÄùDiamond, Irene and Gloria Feman Orenstein, Ed. Reweaving the World: The Emergence of Ecofeminism, San Francisco: Sierra Club Books, 1990. Retrieved March 3, 2018. In the book, Orenstein described ‚Äú‚Äôecofeminist arts‚Äô function [as] ceremonially to connect us with the two powerful worlds from which the Enlightenment severed us‚Äînature and the spirit world.‚ÄùOrenstein, Gloria Feman. ‚ÄúArtists as Healers: Envisioning Life-Giving Culture,‚Äù In Reweaving the World, Irene Diamond and Gloria Feman Orenstein, Ed., San Francisco: Sierra Club Books, 1990, p. 279. She suggested such arts often invoked the symbol of the Great Mother (Goddess) to emphasize three levels of creation ‚Äúimaged as female outside patriarchy: cosmic creation, procreation, and artistic creation.‚Äù Orenstein explored the work of artists, poets and authors such as Hel√®ne Aylon, Ellen Marit Gaup Dunfjeld, Ursula Le Guin, Rachel Rosenthal, Fern Shaffer, Vijali Hamilton, and Mierle Laderman Ukeles, who used ritual, ceremony, performance and writing to enact transformation, reconnection and restoration of harmony. = The Reflowering of the Goddess = Orenstein calls for a reorganization of civilization based on the return to Goddess focused culture. She makes a radical ecofeminist argument which \\"considers the return of the Goddess as a sign of the return to an attitude of reverence for the Earth...and of an ecological as well as a non-sexist consciousness\\" detailing a plan of action which relies less on a Utopian model than on the creative works of visual and literary artists of the era. For her, storytelling is the key to transforming the cosmic mythos, and works created out of \\"the artistic culture inaugurated by the contemporary women's movement\\", reveal an already extant body of \\"feminist matristic\\" mythology providing a path to a new mythic paradigm that will save the planet. = The theater of the marvelous: Surrealism and the contemporary stage = Orenstein joins the formerly disparate theatre and surrealism in articulating her conception of The Theater of the Marvelous. She works to differentiate a neosurrealist theatre from the Dadaist Theater of the Absurd, out of which it grew, exploring a transnational collection of playwrights including: Elena Garro, Teofilo Cid, Octavio Paz, Robert Benayoun, Aim√© C√©saire and Leonora Carrington to combat the tendency to view affiliation with the Bretonist school as the main criteria in defining a work as surrealist. Instead the oneiric vision, the invocation of a dream world, the breaking down of reality to reveal interior imaginative truths, becomes the defining criteria. Orenstein seeks to convince the reader that these works have transcended the traditional goal of theater, to conjure a convincing likeness of the real; that they possess the power to effect inner change, transformative consciousness expansion, in the spectator. Critiques of writings Orenstein's Reweaving the World has received criticism for gender essentialism. Selected bibliography Orenstein has authored and edited several books.

Silmitasertib is in clinical trials for use as an adjunct to chemotherapy in the treatment of cholangiocarcinoma (bile duct cancer), and in preclinical development for other cancers, including hematological and lymphoid malignancies. In January 2017, it was granted orphan drug status by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for advanced cholangiocarcinoma. It is being developed by Senhwa Biosciences of Taiwan. Mechanism of action Silmitasertib interacts competitively with the ATP-binding site of CK2 subunit alpha. This leads to inhibition of several downstream signaling pathways, including PI3K/Akt.  COVID-19 infections  In SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) infected Caco-2 cells, the phosphorylase activity of casein kinase 2 (CK2) is increased resulting in phosphorylation of several cytoskeletal proteins. These infected cells also display CK2-containing filopodia protrusions associated with budding viral particles. Hence the protrusions may assist the virus in infecting adjacent cells. In these same cells, the CK2 inhibitor silmitasertib displayed potent antiviral activity. Senhwa Biosciences and the US National Institutes of Health have announced that they will evaluate the efficacy of silmitasertib in treating COVID-19 infections. History CX-4945 was originated by now-defunct Cylene Pharmaceuticals of San Diego, California, as the culmination of a lengthy process of rational, structure-based molecular modification of a lead compound known to have PARP inhibitor activity. Among a large series of compounds built around a benzo[c]-[2,6]naphthyridine-8-carboxylic acid scaffold, CX-4945 was chosen for its high potency and selectivity as an inhibitor of CK2. Preclinical pharmacokinetics studies conducted in mice, rats, and dogs confirmed that CX-4945 had satisfactory bioavailability when given by mouth and did not block cytochrome P450, while experiments in mice confirmed its inhibition of solid- tumor growth in a dose-dependent manner. Clinical trials in humans began in 2010, making CK-4945 the first CK2 inhibitor to reach this stage of drug development. The International Nonproprietary Name silmitasertib was proposed in 2010 and recommended by the World Health Organization in 2011.

There were three Hollywood options that failed to be realized. Retired actress Juliet Gitterman took an interest in the book and raised money for its production. After a number of false starts, the project was completed. The Ginger Tree, a co-production of the BBC and the NHK network of Japan, was the first High Definition serial to be made for the BBC, although it has never been broadcast in HD by the BBC nor given an HD release. It was produced in 1035 line HD using the Sony HDD 1000 VTR. Reception The New York Times wrote of the series \\"Despite several fine performances, The Ginger Tree turns out to be unabsorbing. The East-meets-West aspects of the story are handled intelligently. The on-location effects are often splendid. But the overall production is plodding and curiously sluggish.\\". Howard Rosenberg, writing for the Los Angeles Times, agreed and wrote the series \\"is a slow-evolving come-on with a disappointing payoff.\\" While he praised the first two episodes, the production, and Samantha Bond's performance, he wrote of the final episodes: \\"As Mary gains assurance, the drop-off in intensity is dramatic. There is simply never any doubt where this part of the story is taking you or how it will arrive there. It's an unsatisfying resolution to a drama that begins so promisingly.\\" Media releases The complete series on DVD in a 2-disc set was released by Simply Media on 25 April 2016.

Only two examples of the four-engined biplane were built. Design and development From 1914 Caproni had produced a series of multi-engined bombers, several of which served in numbers with the Italian Air Force. The Ca.66 originated in reviews of Italian air force requirements post World War I, set down by the new Fascist government of 1922, but as part of a second phase of new designs to succeed a first phase of improved wartime aircraft. Until the appearance of the Ca.66, all Caproni bombers had been twin-boom aircraft but the new model had a conventional layout. It had four engines and was a biplane with a shorter span upper wing, though not formally a sesquiplane as the ratio of the areas of the two wing was about 0.6. Both wings were rectangular in plan but only the lower one carried dihedral (3.5¬∞) and the overhung, balanced ailerons. They were built around pairs of spars and were of mixed wood and metal construction with fabric covering; their thick sections provided internal rigidity and allowed a single-bay structure, with pairs of parallel, inward leaning interplane struts between the spars. Its SPA 6A engines were mounted midway between the wings in push-pull configuration. Each engine had its own cylindrical Lamblin radiator underneath; the tractors had theirs offset outboard and the pushers inboard. The engine pairs were on near-vertical, faired struts between the upper and lower wing spars; more struts to the upper and lower fuselage further strengthened the mountings. The main part of the fuselage of the Ca.66, including the covering, was entirely wooden, rectangular in section and long. Only its projecting, ovoid nose was metal. There were four crew seats: a gunner's position in the extreme nose, side-by-side seating in the pilots' cockpit ahead of the propellers and lower wing leading edge and a dorsal gunner's position half under the trailing edge. Aft, the fuselage tapered in plan to a conventional, straight-tapered fin and a balanced rudder which reached to the keel beyond the end of the fuselage. The Ca.66 had a biplane horizontal tail with curved leading edges, its planes braced to each other with parallel pairs of vertical struts on each side. From the lower attachment points of these struts three more struts braced the tailplane to the lower fuselage longeron, one from the rear point and two more in a forward-reaching V from the forward one. The mainwheels of the Caproni's conventional landing gear were on independent cranked axles from the lower longerons which positioned them under the engines, apart. Each axle end was supported by three steel struts, two from the forward wing spar and one from the rear; the forward pair were elastically sprung within the wing. The undercarriage struts, as well as those mounting the engines, were designed to be faired-in but the few known photographs of the Ca.66, unlike the three-views, do not show fairings in place. The Ca.66 carried ten bombs on a rack controlled by the co-pilot. The front gunner had a machine gun on a flexible mount, as did the dorsal gunner who also had a rearward, downward firing gun. The date of the Ca.66's first flight is uncertain. Despite its origins in the 1922 programme, leading some sources to state that the first flight was in that year, the French journal Les Ailes referred to it as a \\"new Caproni\\" in October 1924. Only two were built, even though the Ca.66 won the Air Ministry contest held at Montecelio.

Danzi was the son of Italian immigrants; his father, Domenico Danzi, had come to the US in 1892. played violin early in his career, including as the leader of an early jazz group called the Red Devils Jazz Band. In 1921, he switched to playing banjo and worked as a vaudeville performer. As a member of Wilbur Sweatman's orchestra in 1924, he played alongside Duke Ellington; later that year he began playing with Alex Hyde's band, which toured Europe in 1924-1925. Instead of returning with the band, he remained in Germany for the next fourteen years, playing with Bernard Ett√©, Harry Revel and Dajos B√©la as well as with his own group, The Virginians, which he founded in 1929 and was formally led by Teddy Kline (de). He worked in Germany through the 1930s, even though the Nazis condemned jazz music and it became less palatable for Italians to live in Germany after Benito Mussolini's rise to power. He played in the orchestra at La Scala under Otto Stenzel (de) in 1935, and worked on German radio and with light-music orchestras; in 1938 he made a few early television appearances with Otto Sachsenhauser. In October 1939, he had an altercation at the doorman of UFA Film Studios when he refused to carry out the Hitler salute, and he left Germany to return to the United States a few days later. He continued his career in the United States, playing at Radio City Music Hall in 1956. References *\\"Mike Danzi\\". The New Grove Dictionary of Jazz. 2nd edition, ed. Barry Kernfeld.

He was a member of No. 88 Squadron RAF and flew anti-ship missions in the Bristol Blenheim and Douglas Boston. Horton also served with and later commanded No. 105 Squadron RAF flying the de Havilland Mosquito in the Pathfinder Force (PFF) that marked targets for destruction by following groups of heavy bombers. After the war, Horton was commissioned with the Royal Air Force and commanded No. 203 Squadron RAF, flying maritime patrol missions in the Neptune MR.1. He served on the United Kingdom's Air Ministry staff and as a liaison officer in the Pentagon to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). Horton retired with the rank of wing commander in 1966. Early years Horton was born on 29 December 1919 in Masterton, New Zealand, the only child of Constance Welch and Thomas Hector 'Bill' Horton. He grew up in Masterton and attended Wairarapa High School. Horton learned to fly in a de Havilland Gipsy Moth biplane at the Wairarapa & Ruahine Aero Club where he was selected in July 1937 for training as part of the civil reserve of pilots. He worked in a law office before joining the Royal New Zealand Air Force on 26 October 1939. Air Force career =No. 88 Squadron= Horton received additional flight training at Blenheim, New Zealand, in the Vickers Vildebeest, and then headed to England at the end of April 1940 aboard the SS Mataroa. At RAF Benson, he trained in the Fairey Battle and was assigned to No. 88 Squadron RAF where he flew anti-ship patrols from RAF Sydenham in Northern Ireland. The squadron moved to RAF Swanton Morley in July 1941 where Horton transitioned to the Bristol Blenheim and flew more anti-ship patrols. In 1942, Flight Lieutenant Horton was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross for his skill and bravery on anti-ship missions including the hazardous low- level attack on shipping at Rotterdam on 28 August 1941. On at least three missions, he successfully returned to base after one of his aircraft's engines had been disabled by anti-aircraft fire. Horton transitioned to the Douglas Boston and flew more anti-ship strikes from RAF Attlebridge northwest of Norwich, Norfolk, England. He participated in a number of Circus missions in which RAF bombers, escorted by friendly fighters, were used to draw out Luftwaffe fighters to their destruction. After completing his first combat tour, Horton spent a year as an instructor teaching instrument flying. =Pathfinder Force= serial DK338 before delivery to 105 Squadron In July 1943, Horton was assigned to No. 105 Squadron RAF where he flew the de Havilland Mosquito light bomber from RAF Marham in Norfolk as part of the Pathfinder Force (PFF). The Pathfinders specialized in locating and marking targets with flares thereby improving the accuracy of the following main bomber force. No. 105 Squadron was part of the No. 8 (Pathfinder Force) Group. For Horton, this meant a change from low-level daylight to high altitude nighttime missions. The squadron utilized precision navigation aids such as the \\"Oboe\\" system that allowed the Pathfinders to accurately mark targets despite the industrial haze and cloud cover that obscured the area by night. Horton also dropped bombs, including the \\"cookie\\", from his Mosquito. He participated in the Battle of the Ruhr in 1943 and protected the Normandy landings in 1944. In 1944, Squadron Leader Horton was awarded a Bar to his Distinguished Flying Cross for demonstrating \\"great courage and determination\\" on his missions with No. 105 Squadron. In June of the following year, he took command of the squadron. On 21 September 1945, Wing Commander Horton received the Distinguished Service Order. The citation recognized his \\"sound judgement and fine leadership as a flight commander\\". FlightGlobal included Horton in their 1945 photo presentation of Pathfinder leaders. Horton completed his World War II service with 111 sorties, 84 of them with the Pathfinders, and returned to New Zealand in 1946. He separated from the RNZAF on 10 April 1947. =RAF career= No 203 Squadron RAF in 1954 The United Kingdom's Air Ministry offered Horton an appointment to a permanent commission with seniority for his wartime service if he would accept a position with the Royal Air Force. Horton left New Zealand and returned to England in late 1947 where he began his RAF service on 1 January 1948. After several staff appointments, including the Air Ministry in London and RAF Coastal Command headquarters, Horton took command of No. 203 squadron RAF from December 1952 to January 1955. The squadron relocated in late 1952 to RAF Topcliffe and re-equipped with the Neptune MR.1 to perform North Atlantic Ocean maritime and anti-submarine patrols during the Cold War with the Eastern Bloc (the Soviet Union and its satellite states). In 1955, Horton returned to the Air Ministry and served with the department of the Chief of the Air Staff. Horton was promoted to RAF wing commander in 1956 and in 1964 was assigned to the staff of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Military Committee at the Pentagon in the United States. From 1959 to 1960, Horton served in a dual capacity as senior air staff officer at RAF Gibraltar and British air attach√© to Rabat, Morocco. Horton retired from the RAF with the rank of wing commander on 29 December 1966 with a total of 27 years of military service. Honours DSO certificate presented by George VI Horton was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross in 1942, and a Bar to his DFC in 1944. In 1945, he was awarded the Distinguished Service Order. King George VI formally presented Horton with this honour at an investiture ceremony at the Court of St James's on 21 September 1945. For his service, Horton received the following campaign and commemorative medals: 1939‚Äì1945 Star, Air Crew Europe Star, Defence Medal, War Medal 1939‚Äì1945, Queen Elizabeth II Coronation Medal, and the New Zealand War Service Medal. In 2013, Horton was recognized for his contributions by Mike Moore, New Zealand's ambassador to the United States, during the 98th anniversary Anzac Day. Horton met with Mr. and Mrs. Moore again in 2014 at the 99th anniversary of Anzac Day. Personal life Ken Chilstrom and Tom Horton at an OBPA luncheon in 2014 Horton married in December 1943 and has one daughter, Gail, and one son, Peter. His wife of 68 years, Beris, died in October 2011. Horton remains interested in aviation and attends luncheons with fellow pilots. During a 2012 interview, he expressed a desire to visit a restored de Havilland Mosquito at the nearby Military Aviation Museum, but age has made travel increasingly difficult for him. , Horton resides with his daughter in Naples, Florida in the United States.

The game was developed, produced, and published by Cinegram Media Inc. in association with the Mystic Seaport museum, as part of Cinegram's Digital Treasures series.  Development  The game became the latest in Cinegram's Digital Treasure series of maritime adventures and tales, after such titles as The Amistad Incident', Tall Ships, and Romancing the Wind, as well as American art video game Norman Rockwell: The Man and His Art. Cinegram's president Hal Denstman served as the creative force behind the title and came up with the original concept, while Fred Van Lente was in charge of writing the script. Interactive 3D scenes were created to showcase life aboard 18th century wooden combat ships with a level of accuracy and immersiveness. A comprehensive resource section and historical timeline were added to the game to offer further contextual information for the player to explore. \\"Cruise of the Declaration\\" was developed as the companion middle-level educational unit for the game and included a teacher resource guide. Due to its historical nature, Peter Stanford, president of the National Maritime Historical Society, offered support and accuracy for the nautical elements of the title. Meanwhile, Captain of HMS Rose Richard Bailey offered a replica of a 1750s era British light frigate.  Plot and gameplay  The game takes place in 1799 and the player plays as a United States Navy Officer with the mission of retrieving U.S.S. Golden Dolphin stolen by pirates. The player must use clues given to them to determine the ship's position, as well as how to retrieve it. The gameplay has a design philosophy of \\"intellectual stimulation\\", requiring the player to use a level of imagination and innovation rather than. This was favoured over a shoot-em-up style of gameplay that sees the player \\"mindlessly clicking a mouse to eliminate the bad guys\\".  Critical reception  Tom Houston of Just Adventure felt that the game's strengths ultimately outweighed its weaknesses, giving it a B+. Inside Mac Games' William Lemmon wrote that the game did contain some bad acting and ill thought out puzzles, and that it would be uninteresting to players who didn't care for the historical setting. Lisa Karen Savignano of Allgame thought that while the game as a whole was \\"really great\\", it was hampered by the \\"extremely annoying and frustrating\\" character interaction interface. Quandary's Steve Ramsey gave the game a mixed review and ultimately awarded it a rating of 1 start out of 5. The Cincinnati Post noted the while the game was \\"intended for youngsters\\", it had appeal to older players too. Computer Times awarded the game with its Editor's Choice award, deeming it \\"one of the most professionally designed CD-ROM adventures we've ever reviewed\\".

It is the historical manor of the former village of Dahlem. The manor has been in service for over 800 years.  History  Dahlem-Dorf U-Bahn station The manor's final owner, Carl Friedrich von Beyme, died in 1838. His daughter, Charlotte Gerlach, sold the manor in 1841 to the Prussian government. The first plans to repurpose the manor lands were made in the middle of the 19th century, but were stalled by Otto von Camphausen and other community leaders. These plans returned to the forefront by the end of the century, as the city rapidly expanded around the manor. The first settlement in the area was the Botanical Garden, in a location now occupied by the Heinrich-von-Kleist Park. The Prussian Landtag finally approved the plans for the manor on June 26, 1897. Beginning in 1901, the surrounding fields and forest lands were converted into building plots. Part of the land was to be used for public projects (science and research), while another part was to be sold as land for villas to private buyers. The converted area began in the northeast (near today's Breitenbachplatz), running along Under den Eichen street up to the village of Zehlendorf. In the west and northwest parts of the royal Grunewald were included in the project as well. With the express aim of boosting property values in the area, a new train line was built linking the area to Berlin (today the U3 line). The new streets in the area were named after various Prussian ministers and forestry officials. The natural science faculty of Humboldt University were also assigned a new location in the area, somewhat relieving the crowded Berlin-Mitte campus. The beginning of World War I brought these plans to a halt. Nearly 40 years later, after the end of World War II, the planned science center was finally built on the campus of the Free University of Berlin. The planned buildings include several institutes of the Kaiser Wilhelm Society (on Van't-Hoff-Stra√üe), the Prussian Privy State Archives, several agricultural research buildings, and the Museum of Asian Art. The Dahlem Museum Center was gradually built out at the same time, in particular because the museum center on the Museum Island was no longer accessible from West Berlin after the war. Some of the facilities have since been relocated to the Kulturforum (e.g., the Gem√§ldegalerie).

The only remaining farmland ‚Äî where the museum stands today ‚Äî is at K√∂nigin-Luise-Stra√üe 49.  Current use  Tractor ride on the manor field Performance at the Berlin Bratwurst Championship (Bratwurstmeisterschaft) After World War II, some of the manor lands were used in the construction of the Free University. A citizens' initiative known as \\"Friends of the Dahlem Manor,\\" first chaired by Martin Quilisch, was founded to support the conversion of the remaining land into an outdoor museum. The museum first established itself by participating in citywide events such as harvest festivals and Christmas markets. In 1995, the operation of the museum was transferred to the Stiftung Stadtmuseum Berlin. Today the museum is operated by the Stiftung Dom√§ne Dahlem as an independent foundation. The museum puts on exhibits related to agriculture and food culture. The manor house contains a shop and meat market from the 1920s. In 2015, the museum extended into another historical building and opened an exhibit named \\"From Farm to Plate.\\" The exhibit depicts the development of food culture from 1850 to the present. The three-story building contains hundreds of multi-media and hands-on exhibits. The attic of the building has special kid-friendly exhibits. The manor is a certified Bioland operation and is the only farm in Germany with a direct U-Bahn connection.

Known for her sculptures and mixed media works that explore our relationship to objects, Channer uses materials ranging from metal and concrete to textiles and paper.  Early life and education  Alice Channer was born in Oxford, UK, in 1977. As a child, her mother handcrafted toys, clothes, bags, curtains and upholstery for the family. Channer has said, \\"I did not have a father who was an architect, I had a mother who was a seamstress.\\" She graduated in 2006 with a BA in Fine Art from Goldsmiths College, London, UK, and in 2008 with an MA in Sculpture from the Royal College of Art, London, UK. She lives and works in London. Work Channer creates sculptures that address the distortion of materials and absence of human bodies within a postindustrial environment, often stretching objects to warp their position within the landscape. She uses items such as rocks, clothing, and shampoo bottles, which she then mutates through casting or expanding to monumental scales. Many of her sculptures and works on paper relate to personal adornment and the wearing and display of clothing. More recently, Channer has been making rock sculptures, and for the last few years, she has been collecting fragments of concrete around her studio in London, left over from construction projects within the urban environment. The artist takes these human-made rocks, all small enough to fit in her backpack, back to her studio to create 3-D scans that are stretched out digitally, up to six feet. The new forms are then carved by a CNC router (computer-controlled cutting machine) into foam in order to create molds for different materials. Exhibitions Channer's work has been shown internationally. Her first museum show in the United States, R o c k f a l l, was at the Aspen Art Museum from 13 February to 31 May 2015, which then traveled to New York as part of a group show organized by the Public Art Fund. Her solo exhibitions include: Soft Shell, Kunstverein Freiburg, Germany, Invertebrates, Out Of Body, The Hepworth Wakefield, West Yorkshire, UK (both 2013); and South London Gallery, London (2012). Select group exhibitions include: In A Dream You Saw A Way To Survive And You Were Full Of Joy, Hayward Gallery (traveling to The Whitworth, Manchester; De La Warr Pavilion, Bexhill-on-Sea; Glynn Vivian Art Gallery, Swansea; 2016‚Äì17); Wer Nicht Denken Will, Fleigt Raus, Museum Kurhaus Kleve, Germany (2016); Chat Jet (Part 2) ‚Äì Sculpture in Reflection, K√ºnstlerhaus, Halle f√ºr Kunst & Medien, Graz, Austria, Nature after Nature, Fridericianum, Kassel, Germany, Pool, Kestnergesellschaft, Hanover, Germany (all 2014); Il Palazzo Enciclopedico / The Encyclopedic Palace, 55th Venice Biennale (2013); and Glasgow International, UK (2010).

Her work explores black life, personal histories, and the political through material explorations. She currently lives and works in Oakland, California.  Early life  Barnette's father Rodney Ellis Barnette, was a member of the Black Panther Party who founded the Compton, California chapter in 1968. After founding the chapter, the FBI put Rodney Barnette on the Counterintelligence Program (COINTELPRO) watchlist. This FBI program \\"had successfully carried out a complex network of operations aimed to discredit, dismantle, and destroy black radical activists, organizations, and movements\\". As a result, his everyday movements and activities were under constant surveillance. He was ultimately fired from his job at the United States Postal Service as a result of his activities. Her father's involvement with the Black Panthers and the FBI files have, and continue to, influence her work. In 2016 her family gained access to her father's 500 page FBI file through the Freedom of Information Act. Since then, Barnette has used the file as raw material for her work. The file includes various family documents including: family trees, names of relatives, birthdays, military awards, and interviews with her father's employers, high school teachers, and his childhood neighbors. Also, > \\"there were pages detailing Barnette‚Äôs movements, his work with fellow > activists Angela Davis, John and Ericka Huggins; there were notes from > former FBI agent James W. McCord, Jr., who was later arrested for his own > role in the Watergate scandal; there was testimony from neighbors, > coworkers, who roundly praised his character; there was family history: the > birthdates of his siblings, the place where his mother was born. As > jarringly intimate as the files sometimes felt, the gulf between the FBI‚Äôs > portrayal of Barnette‚Äôs life and the reality and fullness of it was > staggering.\\" In 2016 Barnette created an installation titled Do Not Destroy which featured selections from the files. This work debuted at the Oakland Museum of California as part of its exhibition All Power to the People: Black Panthers at 50. Do Not Destroy then traveled to the Baxter St at the Camera Club of New York and became the artist's first solo exhibition in New York City.  Education  Sadie Barnette holds a BFA from the California Institute of the Arts (2006) and an MFA in Visual Arts from the University of California, San Diego (2012). Her MFA thesis was titled Everything, All the Time, Always, Forever, Still. The written component of this exhibition was an experimental text which Barnette wrote aimed to \\"use the written word to generate an experience for the reader that functions similarly to one's experience of actually viewing the corresponding art exhibition.\\" She attended the Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture in 2018.  Work  Barnette's work takes various forms and uses a variety of media, including drawing, photography, and large-scale installation to explore the relationship between her personal history, black history, US history, and the political. Through the use of found objects, glitter, gold frames, text, family photographs, and her father's (Rodney Barnette) FBI files, her work links her personal and family story to a national and political history. In E-Flux Journal #79, Sampada Aranke writes, > For Barnette, her father‚Äôs FBI file becomes the source material through > which she materializes the complex politics of inheritance between black > liberation struggles of the long 1960s and their impacts upon her own sense > of self. Barnette mines the FBI file as a personal archive, and in so doing > manipulates the documents therein towards a radical aesthetic > materialization. The exhibition Everything, Everyday at the Studio Museum in Harlem in 2015, showcased work created by Barnette during her year-long residency at the museum. Barnette exhibited, \\"meticulous graphite drawings of words, including names: ‚ÄúUncle Rodney‚Äôs daughter,‚Äù ‚ÄúLuverne and Sadie‚Äôs granddaughter,‚Äù ‚ÄúYoungest niece of: Margaret, Vivian, Luverne, Stanley, Carl, Aubrey, Alvin, Lesley, Irwin and John.‚Äù The results, a family genealogy assembled by first- names only, feels both rigorous and casual, and potentially open-ended.\\" Barnette has an ongoing project titled My Father‚Äôs FBI File, 2016- in which, as reported on by ArtForum, \\"Barnette detourns documents from five hundred pages of surveillance ‚Äì obtained by the Barnette family via the Freedom of Information Act ‚Äì into text-based artworks touched with stains and semitransparent fields of aerosol paint.\\" In 2016, Barnette had her first solo show in New York City at the Baxter St at the Camera Club of New York, titled Do Not Destroy. For this exhibition, Barnette presented many of her father's FBI files that she intervened in with spray paint and glitter. The artist's marks on the files, \\"[resemble] an act of vandalism‚Äîan invaded home, reshuffled and spattered and spilled-on papers‚Äîas much as it does a daughter‚Äôs loving, slightly coy stamp on the typewritten documentation of her father‚Äôs life. [...] This is ours now, this is mine, her embellishments seem to insist; the fierce, rebellious energy of a crayoned wall or a graffiti-tagged billboard, a sort of Pink Panther mark on a Black Panther life. ‚ÄúI wanted to repair some of the trauma,‚Äù Sadie said [...]\\" Barnette's solo show Compland at Fort Gansevoort in New York City in 2017, included a group of five framed COINTELPRO documents, selections from her ongoing project My Father‚Äôs FBI File, 2016-, vinyl lettering, and photocollages. The title of the exhibition, Compland, invoked \\"a fictive space sublating Compton and Oakland, California, '90s hip-hop, and '60s Black Power.\\" In this exhibition, as in all of her work, blackness and the African American identity and experience is explored. Chloe Wyma of ArtForum writes of Barnette's Fort Gansevoort exhibition: > Blackness ‚Äì its social constructions, structures of signification, material > cultures, oppressions, and modes of resistance ‚Äì is pronounced and urgent in > Barnette‚Äôs work. The color pink also presents again and again, from baby to > bubble-gum to hot fuchsia, in the pulsating chevrons of Barnette‚Äôs > tessellated photo-wallpaper that showed a child sitting in a wicker ‚ÄúHuey > Newton‚Äù chair; in the bags of Hello Kitty cotton candy strewn around the > gallery; and in an acrylic glitter bar ‚Äì part object, part sculpture ‚Äì > installed on the third floor. Pink spelled out PRESTO DINERO (I LEND MONEY) > on a Spanish-language payday loan sign, supplied the ground in the abstract > painting Untitled (Black dots on pink), 2016, and popped from behind a > chain-link fence embellished with Swarovski crystals in the photograph > Untitled (Pink fence sparkle), 2017. For her first major traveling exhibition, \\"Sadie Barnette: Dear 1968,...\\" (2018) Barnette pulled from her personal and family history by using family photographs and selections from the FBI files on her father Rodney Barnette, compiled on him after he joined the Black Panther Party in 1968. For this exhibition Barnette, responds to the intimate details of the FBI files by intervening in them by redacting information with stickers, paint splashes, and spray paint, while also embellishing with glitter, vinyl, and rhinestones. As reported on in Hyperallergic, \\"such child-like embellishments are whimsical touches that draw the viewer in, but these add-ons are only playing dress-up on much wilder realities.\\" These interventions are an attempt to reclaim her family history. Included in the exhibition is a black and white wallpapered wall created from signatures and seals found in the file. On this wallpaper hang a pair of photographs of her father, Rodney Barnette, \\"in one photograph, he is in Navy uniform pre-Vietnam era. In another, his black leather jacket, turtleneck, and beret signal his role as founder of the Compton Chapter of the Black Panther party in ‚ÄúUntitled (Dad, 1966 and 1968)‚Äù (2016).\\" Through this exhibition \\"the work proposes changing the conditions of the world, turning the past of racial profiling into a loyal tribute to her dad.\\" \\"Sadie Barnette: Dear 1968,...\\" was organized by the Manetti Shrem Museum of Art at the University of California, Davis and traveled to two other venues, the Museum of Contemporary Art San Diego and Haverford College's Cantor Fitzgerald Gallery. Her work is included in the permanent collections of LACMA, Berkeley Art Museum, the California African American Museum, the Cornell Fine Arts Museum, the P√©rez Art Museum in Miami, Studio Museum in Harlem (where she was also Artist-in-Residence), Brooklyn Museum, and the Guggenheim.

Personal and professional life  Draney was born in Edmonton and raised in Slave Lake, Alberta. Draney is a Cree, from Sawridge First Nation. She graduated from the University of Alberta in 2000 with a Bachelor of Fine Arts in English Literature. In 2004, she completed a Fine Arts Diploma from Grant MacEwan Community College, Alberta. She obtained a second Bachelor of Fine Arts from the University of Alberta in 2006 and a Master of Fine Arts from Emily Carr University of Art and Design in 2010. Draney has participated in several residencies at the Banff Centre for Arts and Creativity, including: What Colour is the Present? led by Duane Linklater (2013); Trading Post led by Candice Hopkins (2012); Towards Language led by Greg Staats (2010); and North led by Sharon Shorty (2007). In 2017 Draney was awarded a commission for a permanent public art project for the main atrium of the Macewan University Centre for the Arts and Culture. In 2019 a number of her pieces were acquired through the Landmark: A New Chapter Acquisition Project by the Art Gallery of Alberta as a part of the Canada Council for the Arts ‚ÄúNew Chapter‚Äù grant. Her paintings can be found in major private and public collections in Canada including, Alberta Foundation for the Arts, Art Gallery of Alberta, RBC collection, Walter Philips Gallery, and National Gallery of Canada.  Style and works  Brenda Draney uses stories, memories and family conversations to make subtle, powerful paintings. Many of these memories are pulled from her childhood, and most centre around Slave Lake, the small town in Northern Alberta where she grew up. What emerges from the canvas are cloud-like pictures, isolated moments and constellations of ambiguous but connected associations. In addition to the strong colours, what is most remarkable about Draney‚Äôs work is the expanse of raw or empty canvas. These blank spaces reflect her (and our) inability to recall everything. Draney subjects her own memory to the test, painting only what she can remember: fleeting flashes of actions and events, glimmers of people and moments. Draney offers the following explanation for this way of working: > It's about the uncertainty of memory, when you remember something one time > and then you remember it another time and other parts get informed and > replaced and changed. I also think it's about things we're not supposed to > talk about, or things that aren't my business to talk about--about a story I > may not have the authority to tell. Those are things that may not > necessarily be available to the viewer but that are part of my process. Part > of my hesitation in answering questions about my paintings is because I > think a lot about how much I should disclose about the specifics of > narrative. It feels a little heavy-handed or dramatic to say this, but I‚Äôm > trying to cultivate desire. If I confirm it for you, you can put it to bed. > And if I tell you you‚Äôre wrong, then I‚Äôve pushed you out and said you don‚Äôt > understand it, you‚Äôre not invited in. While many of her subjects seem banal, they allude to a broader and stronger undercurrent of destruction and loss: the devastating 1988 flood and 2011 fire of Slave Lake, and the effects of the Indian Act, residential schools, band membership, and Bill C-31 on Draney‚Äôs life and work. The image of a tent features in many of her paintings. It is a reference to both the temporary housing that the community of Slave Lake endured following the area‚Äôs recent natural disasters, and to the contemporary political movements to occupy space, such as Idle No More, Chief Theresa Spence‚Äôs encampment in Ottawa, and Edmonton's tent city, to name just a few.  Awards  In 2009 Draney was announced as the first-place winner of the 11th Annual Royal Bank of Canada's (RBC) Canadian Painting Competition for her painting titled Aim is Important, a sparse compelling painting. For her first-place finish, Draney received $25 000 and her piece was added to RBC's private art collection. Honourable Mention's included Martin Golland and Sasha Pierce both from Toronto. In 2013 Draney was on the longlist for the Sobey Art Award, and in 2016 was the finalist representing Prairies and the North As one five regional finalists, her work was presented in an exhibition at National Gallery of Canada, and was featured on CBC radio's IDEAS episode with producer Mary Lynk. In 2014 she won the Eldon and Anne Foote Visual Arts Prize, worth $10,000 for her painting Suspend.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984. Description and history The Winchester Soldiers' Monument is located in a residential area north of the commercial Main Street area of Winsted, at the southern end of Crown Street. The park in which it is set is atop a circular hill, which is grassed down to the park drive, paths and a few trees dotting its interior. A low stone retaining wall lines the parking area on Crown Street. A square entrance arch with crenellated top provides access to one of the paths leading to the main monument. The main structure is a three-level tower built of ashlar granite from a local quarry, and is square in footprint. Its walls slope inward in the lower stage to eventually straighten and are crowned by crenellations. At one corner a circular tourelle projects from the third level, topped by a bronze figure of a soldier holding colors. There is a single entrance on one face, with single windows on each of the other first-floor facades, and two windows on each of the upper levels. The total height of the tower is . The memorial was completed in 1890 to a design by Robert Hill of Waterbury; the bronze figure was designed by George Bissell. The interior was originally to have an iron staircase installed, but this never occurred due a disagreement with the contractor, and a wooden staircase (intended to be temporary) was installed instead. Funds for the memorial's construction were raised by the local chapter of the Grand Army of the Republic. In 1977‚Äì78, a water fountain was installed near the tower, designed by Andrew Coppola, a sculptor from Hartford.

She was named one of the top 10 CNN Heroes in 2012. Life Butts had a fear of water since she was a child. She lost her 16-year-old son to a drowning accident in 2006, when he was rafting with friends on a lake and did not wear a life jacket. Her son did not know how to swim. After this tragedy, Butts was determined to begin activism so other children would not suffer the same fate. Butts now works for the city of Toledo, Ohio full-time, while running her nonprofit organization part-time. Activism After her son's death, Butts founded the nonprofit organization the Josh Project in 2007 in Toledo, Ohio. She partnered with the USA Swimming Foundation's Make-A-Splash initiative to help with her organization, who in turn connected her with her local swimming organization, the Greater Toledo Aquatic Club. The Josh Project provides low-cost swimming lessons for children, and the first swimming safety session for children was held in March 2007. As of 2016, the organization has helped over 1,300 children learn how to swim. The organization primarily helps minority children, as they are at a significantly higher risk of drowning in the United States. Most of the children who learn to swim are the first in their family to do so. Volunteers that are certified lead the classes at a local high school. Children can continue in the program for as long as they choose. She also performs speaking engagements. Her organization model has expanded to create similar organizations in other locations such as Norfolk, Virginia. Butts hopes to expand her organization by training more instructors and gaining their own facility. Awards Butts was named a CNN Hero in 2012. She was named one of The Grio's 100 in 2013.

The project consists of: * A set of very simple algorithmic problems * Various implementations to the above problems in various programming languages * A set of unit tests to verify that the submitted implementations solve the problem statement * A framework for running and timing the implementations * A website to facilitate the interactive comparison of the results Supported languages Due to resource constraints, only a small subset of common programming languages are supported, up to the discretion of the game's operator. Metrics The following aspects of each given implementation are measured: * overall user runtime * peak memory allocation * gzip'ped size of the solution's source code * sum of total CPU time over all threads * individual CPU utilization It is common to see multiple solutions in the same programming language for the same problem. This highlights that within the bounds of a given language, a solution can be given which is either of high abstraction, is memory efficiency, fast, or parallelizes better. Benchmark programs It was a design choice from the start to only include very simple toy problems, each providing a different kind of programming challenge.

Shipman, whose nickname was \\"Ten Percent Ernie,\\" made seven features from 1919‚Äì23. Biography Shipman was educated at the Ryerson School (now Ryerson University) in Toronto and became interested in promotion and publicity. At 26 he was running the Canadian Entertainment Bureau in Toronto and soon after was the president and general manager of the Amalgamated Amusement Company with offices on Broadway in New York City. In 1912, he divorced his third wife, actress Roselle Knott, and married his fourth wife, Nell (born Helen Barham) from Victoria, B.C., who was 18 at the time. Ernest and Nell Shipman travelled to California in 1912, where he promoted films written by and starring his young wife. The couple returned to Canada in 1918, where Shipman produced Back to God's Country again written by and starring Nell. The film became the biggest box-office success of any Canadian feature during the silent era. The Shipmans separated shortly thereafter, and Ernest moved on to produce six other films across the country, although none were profitable as his first. In Canadian film historian Peter Morris‚Äô book Embattled Shadows: A History of Canadian Cinema 1895-1939, Morris describes Shipman thusly: \\"It is difficult in retrospect to decide whether Shipman was a rogue or a genius. Perhaps like all great entrepreneurs he was a little of both.

This enables food and liquids to pass into the stomach, a process that is impaired in achalasia. The tunnel is created, and the myotomy performed, using a flexible endoscope, meaning the entire procedure can be done without external incisions. History & development Achalasia, a disease characterized by impaired esophageal peristalsis and failure of the lower esophageal sphincter to relax, has classically been treated endoscopically by dilation or botulinum toxin injection of the sphincter or surgically by a myotomy in which the muscle fibers are cut through a thoracic or abdominal approach. The principles of an endoscopic surgical myotomy were developed in the 2000s on animal models. The first endoscopic myotomy was performed on human patients by H. Inoue in Tokyo, Japan in 2008 who then coined the acronym POEM.Inoue H, Kudo SE. Per-oral endoscopic myotomy (POEM) for 43 consecutive cases of esophageal achalasia. Nihon Rinsho. 2010 Sep;68(9):1749-52 It has since become increasingly popular internationally as a first-line therapy in patients with achalasia. Procedure POEM is a form of natural orifice translumenal endoscopic surgery, or NOTES. Like the traditional surgical myotomy, the procedure is performed under general endotracheal anesthesia. The remainder of the procedure is performed using a flexible endoscope inserted through the mouth, and no cuts are made on the chest or abdomen. Occasionally, an ‚Äúovertube‚Äù is inserted to facilitate repeated removal & insertion of the endoscope.4 First, a submucosal injection of dyed saline creates a cushion, then a cut is made in the esophageal mucosa using electrocautery roughly 13 centimeters before the lower esophageal sphincter. Then, using hydrostatic dissection and electrocautery, the submucosal tunnel is made. Once the circular fibers of the lower esophageal sphincter are encountered, they are divided using electrocautery all the way down onto the first part of the stomach. This functionally weakens the sphincter, allowing improved passage of food and liquid into the stomach. Finally, the submucosal flap is closed using clips or sutures also placed through the endoscope. The procedure takes roughly 2 hours but can vary on physician and patient characteristics. Patients usually spend 1‚Äì3 days in the hospital before going home, and usually undergo a swallow study prior to resuming oral feeding.Dunst CM, Kurian AA, Swanstrom LL. Endoscopic Myotomy for Achalasia. Advances in Surgery. 2014 Sep:48(1):27-41. Patients may return to work and full activity immediately upon discharge from the hospital. Long-term patient satisfaction is similar following POEM compared to standard laparoscopic Heller myotomy.Bechara R, Onimaru M, Ikeda H, Inoue H. Per-oral endoscopic myotomy, 1000 cases later: pearls, pitfalls, and practical considerations.

Gastrointest Endosc. 2014 Jul;80(1):1-15. Escape of air introduced through the endoscope into the surrounding tissues is a common occurrence and rarely requires additional intervention. The major long term risk after POEM is new or worsened gastroesophageal reflux disease, which arises in 20-46% of patients. This phenomenon is usually mild and manageable with medication alone, and does not occur at a significantly higher rate than in patients undergoing a traditional surgical therapy. Incomplete myotomy resulting in a persistence of symptoms is also described and requires repeating the procedure.

The DCR interchanges with the Norfolk Southern Railway and the Maryland and Delaware Railroad. The railroad was created in 2016 to take over the Norfolk Southern Railway lines on the Delmarva Peninsula. The DCR expanded by taking over part of the Bay Coast Railroad in 2018 and the Delaware Coast Line Railroad in 2019. Operations DCR SD40-2 3506 leads a train northbound in Clayton, Delaware The DCR operates on of trackage on the Delmarva Peninsula in the states of Delaware, Maryland, and Virginia. The DCR's main line runs from Porter, Delaware south to Pocomoke City, Maryland on the Delmarva Subdivision, with the section leading into Pocomoke City called the Pocomoke Industrial Track. The main line trackage continues south from Pocomoke City to Hallwood, Virginia on the Delmarva Industrial Track. A branch line runs from a junction with the Delmarva Subdivision in Harrington, Delaware to Frankford, Delaware on the Indian River Subdivision to Dagsboro, Delaware and then on the Dagsboro Industrial Track to Frankford. From the Indian River Subdivision, the Milton Industrial Track branches east from Ellendale, Delaware to Milton, Delaware and the Lewes Industrial Track branches east from Georgetown, Delaware to Cool Spring, Delaware. Smaller lines operated by the DCR include the Oxford Industrial Track in Clayton, Delaware, the Cambridge Industrial Track in Seaford, Delaware, the Willards Industrial Track in Salisbury, Maryland, the Mardela Industrial Track in Salisbury, the Mill Street Industrial Track in Salisbury, and the Crisfield Industrial Track in Kings Creek, Maryland. The DCR also has trackage rights on Norfolk Southern Railway tracks from Porter to Tasker near New Castle, Delaware. The DCR interchanges with the Norfolk Southern Railway in Clayton for mixed freight and Tasker for unit trains. There are also interchanges with the Maryland and Delaware Railroad in Townsend, Seaford, and Frankford. Products carried by the railroad include grain, propane, building materials, and bulk products. The railroad occasionally hauls coal to the Indian River Power Plant operated by NRG Energy, running as needed. The Delmarva Central Railroad provides freight service to over 50 customers. The Delmarva Central Railroad operates with 12 locomotives, consisting of EMD GP38-2, EMD MP15AC, and EMD SD40-2 models. The DCR had EMD GP11 locomotives on the line temporarily, until operations were well underway, and the October 2018 issue of Railpace magazine noted on page 9 that the last two GP11s on the DCR had departed. DCR 2005 and 2007 were interchanged to Norfolk Southern at Clayton on July 25, 2018 for movement back to the home rails of parent company Carload Express. The magazine added that the DCR now has \\"an adequate number\\" of MP15s and GP38s to handle local chores. The railroad is a subsidiary of Carload Express, a shortline operator based in Oakmont, Pennsylvania that also owns the Allegheny Valley Railroad, the Southwest Pennsylvania Railroad, and the Ohio Terminal Railway. Local management of the DCR is based in Harrington while freight operations are based in Dover, Delaware, Harrington, Seaford, and Delmar, Delaware. The DCR consists of 30 employees. History The mainline of the DCR between Porter and Delmar was originally part of the Delaware Railroad while the mainline south of there was part of the New York, Philadelphia and Norfolk Railroad. These lines were later acquired by the Pennsylvania Railroad and passed to the Penn Central Transportation Company in 1968, Conrail in 1976, and the Norfolk Southern Railway in 1999. On April 1, 2006, the Norfolk Southern Railway established the Delmarva Business Unit as a marketing and business unit to improve customer service and operating efficiency as well as attract customers on its trackage in Delaware and eastern Maryland. The Delmarva Business Unit consisted of of trackage running between Newark, Delaware and Edgemoor Yard in Wilmington, Delaware, Wilmington and Pocomoke City, and Harrington and Frankford. The business unit, which was headquartered in Wilmington, had its own local management team. In October 2016, the Norfolk Southern Railway selected Carload Express to lease and operate its Delmarva Peninsula trackage between Porter and Pocomoke City and Harrington and Frankford in an effort to turn around the underperforming lines. The DCR filed its application to begin operations with the Surface Transportation Board (STB) the following month. As a result of the acquisition, Carload Express purchased 17 additional locomotives. The DCR began operations in December 2016. In December 2016, the Sheet Metal Workers' International Association union filed a protest with the STB over the transaction, claiming that it did not have the resources to safely operate, but the STB dismissed the case in March 2017. In June 2018, the DCR took over operations from the Bay Coast Railroad on trackage owned by the Canonie Atlantic Corporation between Pocomoke City and Hallwood after the Bay Coast Railroad ceased operations on May 18, 2018. The DCR took over the portion of the Bay Coast Railroad between Pocomoke City and Hallwood in order to continue rail service to the remaining customers along the line.

With a particular focus on those who identify or at some point were identified as women, her works use photography, performance, video, drawing and painting to activate the lingering potential of specific events, sites, or biographies. Geyer focus on the themes of gender, class, national identity and how they are constantly negotiated and reinterpreted against a frequent backdrop of cultural meanings and memories. Geyer has exhibited at institutions such as the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (SFMOMA), MOMA, and The Whitney Museum. She has worked with numerous artists such as Wu Tsang, Simon J. Ortiz and Sharon Hayes (artist) Early life and education In 1991, Geyer attended basic study painting at the Independent Art Academy in Stuttgart, Germany. After a year, she pursued studies in photography/film design at Fachhochschule Bielefeld. In 1998 Geyer obtained a diploma in Fine Arts at Academy of Fine Arts in Braunschweig, Germany. She studied at the Whitney Independent Study Program in New York City and graduated in 2000. Geyer has been an assistant professor of Fine Arts at the Parsons School of Design since 2009.  Artwork  Geyer's recent work at SFMOMA is about the legacy of Grace Morley, SFMOMA's founding director. The exhibition is called \\"To Those Who Have Eyes to See\\". The related performance is called \\"Traced: Grace McCann Morley‚Äôs Museum\\". =Revolt, They said and Insistence, 2012= Revolt and Insistence is a two- part mural project that consisted of a video projection. The first part is a moral drawing in graphite drawing (50 x 85 inch). This is her product of Grey's research on cross-cultural, cross-class and cross-generational history. It highlighted the role various women, through their relationships and organization, had on effecting social, cultural and political change. The objective was to draw awareness to the quiet, uncredited women in the industries of labour organization, social entrepreneurs and cultural revolutionaries that were unrecognized for their achievements in positive social change. Emphasis was given to the three women who founded the MoMa in 1929; Abby Aldrich, Lilli P. Bliss, and Mary Quinn Sullivan. Geyer believes the blueprint for effecting social change can be found through the examination of women's work in history. Her second piece, Insistence, features a 15:21 min video shot overhead of black and white photographs with interjections of colour reproduction of the same heroic women stacked on top of a table. This piece visualized the experiences the women in the postcards and their unheard voices as heroes. By exploring the network of 850 women during the modernist movement in 1920 to 1930s in New York City, Insistence captured the social links between these influential women. This was a large undertaking with a big support team, with the backing of the Museum of Modern Art Archives. Geyer sought to draw awareness to the vast linkage of influential women whose intended and unintended work created a network that ultimately aided each other's efforts towards social change. =Criminal Case 40/61: Reverb, 2009= Criminal Case 40/61 is a multimedia installation that was staged at the University of California. It consisted of six channel video installation with six monitors and six stools in High definition video, colour and sound. The duration of the display lasted 42 minutes. It documented an abstract historical trial scene, using the six video projects, one for each; accused, defence, judge, Prosecution, Reporter and Audience. The video narrated Adolf Eichmann's role in the Holocaust. The soundtrack is projected in English and translated into German, Hebrew and Portuguese on headphones for the audience. The six characters were embodied by the same actor name Wu Tsang. This form of performance raised questions regarding the responsibility, truth, justice and the notion of evil and how these themes extend both forward and background in time through the modes of fictionalization. It was an effort to propose terms and strategies with an individual rethinking about the past and present time and have possibility to exceed a mere-restaging. =Spiral Lands, 2007-ongoing= Spiral Lands was an exhibition that was held in Argos Center for Art and Media in Belgium. There is three parts to this showcase, documented as chapter one, two and three. It raised a central issue that addresses the relation of identity and land in North America. Geyer travels the American Southwest with her camera between the years of 1850 and 2007, and through her diary entries noted the lens through which western historiography was understood by conveying them through photographs of the landscape. This project focuses on one of the longest struggles for social justice in North America; such as the dispossession of lands from Native Americans and their struggle for their rights and the return of their land. ‚ÜµIn the first chapter it consists of 19 frames, each combining two or three black and white photographs with a text. Partly paired in double takes of the same land scale they recall the tradition of stereotypes in American landscape photography. Geyer employs the form of doubling to draw attention to the fact that a point of view and narrative are never singular but always needs to be read in relation to their author and context. The text punctuates in the classic pastoral idyll: with her own poetic observations and reflects the philosophical treatises, addressing topics of contemporary history, violence, and expulsion through the works of native American scholars and writers. In chapter two, Geyer examines the role of science and identity. The focus is on the researcher and only focuses on the objective voice of the scholar. The presentation was in a form of slide projection with a sound track. The viewers sit on chairs in front of the screen along with a series of text presented. Chapter three is a collaboration with the writer name Simon J. Ortiz. That shows a dialogue between the means of poetry, prose and photography. Gelatin silver print in wooden frame and with etched glass. Each of them has 55 cm x 69 cm dimensions. =Audrey Munson Project= From the notebooks: Audrey Munson, 2004.

It captured the feminist angle Geyer was captivated in. It is a series of four different works made in different years, from 2004 to 2008. She wrote a book contextualizing Munson's life in parallel with the struggle of New York women finding their voices during their lifetimes. Audrey Munson was one of the most famous models, and most captivating muse for artists during the first quarter of the twentieth century. She also starred in early Hollywood movies. The book traces Munson's life and left behind texts, articles and photographs.

The petals are 50‚Äì75 mm long, 2‚Äì3 mm wide and turn slightly upwards. The labellum is 12‚Äì15 mm long, 7‚Äì9 mm wide and creamy-white with red stripes and blotches with the tip curled downwards. The sides of the labellum are serrated and there are two rows of anvil-shaped, white or creamy-white calli along the mid-line. Flowering occurs from late October to early December, making it one of the last spider orchids to flower each year.  Taxonomy and naming  Caladenia ultima was first formally described in 2001 by Stephen Hopper and Andrew Phillip Brown from a specimen collected in the Stirling Range and the description was published in Nuytsia. The specific epithet (ultima) is a Latin word meaning \\"farthest\\" or \\"last\\" referring to the late flowering of this orchid.  Distribution and habitat  The late spider orchid is found in the Stirling Range National Park and Mount Barker area in the Esperance Plains and Jarrah Forest biogeographic regions where it grows in low-lying areas that are wet in winter. Conservation Caladenia ultima is classified as \\"Priority Two\\" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife, meaning that it is poorly known and known from only one or a few locations.

L. Katz. The screenplay was adapted by Katz and Macon Blair from the novel of the same name by Dave Zeltserman. The film stars Nikolaj Coster-Waldau as Joe Denton, a former cop recently released from prison for attempted murder. The film also stars Gary Cole, Molly Parker, Macon Blair, Pat Healy, Jacki Weaver, and Robert Forster. Small Crimes premiered at South by Southwest on March 11, 2017, and was released by Netflix on April 28, 2017. Plot Joe Denton, a corrupt ex-cop, is released from jail. Six years earlier, while on the mob's payroll, Denton attacked district attorney Phil Coakley, earning him the enmity of the police and the nickname \\"slash cop\\". After finding his ex-wife has left the city with their children, he moves in with his elderly parents. Denton researches his ex-wife on the internet, eventually digging up a phone number. After briefly talking to one of his daughters, his ex-wife takes the phone and threatens to press charges if he ever contacts them again. Denton passes a bar on his way back home. Although a recovering alcoholic, he enters and orders a drink. His friend Scotty, the brother of Denton's slain partner, greets him and offers him any help he needs. A young woman asks Denton for a ride home. Denton is surprised when she reveals herself to be Coakley's daughter and intentionally bloodies herself. Cued by her cries for help, two men drag Denton from his car; Denton beats both men savagely. After Denton is questioned by the police, Coakley admits the evidence backs up his story and reluctantly asks if Denton wants to press charges. Denton declines, saying he wants to leave his history in the past, to the disgust of Coakley and Lieutenant Pleasant, who calls him a disgrace. Pleasant, revealed to also be corrupt, demands Denton kill mob boss Manny Vassey, who has found religion on his deathbed. Pleasant explains Vassey's guilty conscience may lead him to confess to Coakley. Pleasant promises to help Denton renegotiate the terms of the settlement with his ex-wife if he kills Vassey. At his house, Vassey denies the rumors. As Vassey falls asleep, Denton begins to suffocate him, only to be interrupted by Charlotte Boyd, Vassey's hospice nurse. Denton smoothly thanks her for her work and leaves the house, where he encounters Vassey's sadistic son, Junior. Junior threatens to kill Denton, enraged that Vassey would see him while avoiding his own son. Frustrated with his suspicious behavior, Denton's parents demand explanations. When they disbelieve his lies, Denton angrily accuses them of having no faith in his redemption. Denton encounters Boyd again at a diner, and the two soon begin dating. After Pleasant threatens him and his parents, Denton probes Boyd for a way to access Vassey. When this fails, Pleasant suggests he murder Coakley instead. Denton breaks into Coakley's house but can not bring himself to do it. Instead, he bribes Toni, a prostitute Coakley has been seeing, into secretly recording him. Denton sets up a camera in Coakley's hotel room and waits in a nearby room for Coakley to arrive. During Coakley's tryst, Toni's boyfriend, Rooster arrives. Driven by jealousy, Rooster kills Toni and is killed by Coakley in return. Denton witnesses the shooting and waits for Coakley to leave before running into the room to look for the camera. Realizing that Coakley found and took the camera, Denton returns home dejected. After another argument with his parents, in which his father asks him to leave, an unknown assailant fires several shots into Denton's parents' house, wounding his mother. Denton confesses to Boyd, with whom he has grown closer, that the situation has spiraled out of control. She assures him it will work out, and, unknown to Denton, murders Vassey. Junior catches Boyd in the act. Denton is kidnapped by Junior's thugs and Junior reveals he has tortured and presumably killed Boyd. Denton's protests that he was uninvolved with Vassey's death are interrupted by the arrival of Scotty. Denton and Scotty kill Junior and his thugs, but Scotty is shot. Denton attempts to save Scotty but stops when he learns that Scotty was the one who shot his mother. Coakley had revealed to Scotty that it was Denton who killed his brother under Junior's orders. Denton leaves Scotty to die and receives a call from Pleasant informing him that Coakley died in a car accident. Coakley had been distracted, watching the recording of his shooting of Rooster while driving. Denton ransacks his parents' house for dirty money they found and hid from him before kicking him out. After Denton finds the money and indicates his desire to deliver it to his children, Denton's father says he will not allow Denton anywhere near the children, fearing Denton's self-destructive impulses will harm them. When Denton incredulously asks what his father can do to stop him, Denton's father stabs him. In his dying moments, Denton wipes his father's fingerprints off the knife and adds his own, to make the wound appear self- inflicted.

Metacritic, another review aggregator, assigned the film a weighted score of 60 out of 100, based on six critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". In positive reviews, David Ehrlich of IndieWire and Britt Hayes of ScreenCrush particularly praised Nikolaj Coster-Waldau's performance and character, with Ehrlich saying that \\"as much of a chore as [Small Crimes] can be to sift through at times, there‚Äôs a well-conceived method to all of this densely packed madness\\" and Hayes stating that \\"Coster- Waldau is a pro at playing narcissists, but in Small Crimes he brings additional pathos to the role of Joe\\".They gave the film B+ and 8 out of 10 respectively. Brian Tallerico of RogerEbert.com stated that while Small Crimes was \\"similarly clever if a bit less satisfying\\" than Cheap Thrills, he praised the supporting cast (particularly Gary Cole and Pat Healy) and the film's clean conclusion. Michael Roffman of Consequence of Sound similarly praised Coster-Waldau's performance, along with those of Jacki Weaver and Robert Forster, as well as the film's tonal shifts \\"that make each outcome even more jarring\\". He rated the film a B. Jacob Hall of /Film gave the film a 7.5 out of 10, negatively comparing the film to Cheap Thrills but enjoyed it overall. He praised the performances (with the exception of Coster-Waldau's) and plot. Mike D'Angelo of The A.V. Club also praised Forster's performance and the tone of the film, saying \\"If the film came across as jaded and cynical, it might well be hard to take. Instead, it seems weary and defeated, as if some people are simply born to fail.\\" Conversely, Kristy Puchko of The Playlist criticized the film's humor and called it \\"one note\\". While she praised the performances of Daniela Sandiford, Cole, Weaver, Forster, and Healy, Puchko stated that Coster-Waldau's performance \\"keeps us at a distance, unable to connect, empathize, or care\\". She rated the film a C-. Sheila O'Malley, also writing for RogerEbert.com, criticized the script's lack of any exposition, saying that \\"it's hard to figure out what actually happened, who did what to whom\\". While she praised the execution of the characters, she also commented on the presence of \\"a lot of dead air\\". She rated the film two out of four stars.

Then on 10 October the Marine Committee formally established the ranks and precedence of the commanders of vessels in the Continental Navy. Lieutenant Thomas Albertson, as commander of the smallest vessel, Musquito, of four guns, ranked 26th out of 26. The next (implicit) mention of Mosquito occurs on 22 April 1777 when the Navy Board of the Middle Department asked to borrow 70 shot for 2-pounder guns. Thomas Albertson carried the request, which he needed for his vessel, which was almost ready for sea.

Although this barrier effectively protects the brain, it can prevent important medications from entering the CNS. The technique is widely used in biomedical research to introduce drugs, therapeutic RNAs, plasmid DNAs, and viral vectors into the CNS of diseased mice models. It can also be used in human in cases of neurodegenerative disorders like spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), or administering chemotherapy in gliomas as well as delivering neurotrophic factors to CNS.

Lenton is a Canadian academic administrator and professor. She is the 8th and current president and vice-chancellor at York University in Toronto, Canada having succeeded Mamdouh Shoukri on 1 July 2017 for a five- year term. She previously served as Dean of Atkinson College and later as York's Vice President Academic and Provost. Prior to her role in academic administration, Lenton was a Professor of Sociology. During her research career, Lenton led randomized public telephone surveys of social issues such as Internet dating and sexual assault in Canada. Career =Research= Lenton completed her Ph.D in sociology at the University of Toronto in 1989. The title of her dissertation was Parental Discipline and Child Abuse. Before becoming an academic administrator, she published research on a range of topics related to family violence, feminism in academia, and online dating. Her work included a 1999 national telephone survey of randomly selected women, asking them about their experiences with sexual harassment and assault. She has also researched the impact that the inclusion of women's studies within academia has had on feminism, determining that it had made feminism more conservative. She also conducted randomized robocalls regarding Internet dating behaviours of the Canadian public in 2001. In 2018, Lenton began a study of how Jewish Canadians have reared their children and any experience they may have had with prejudice, conducted through surveys of up to eighty questions. As university Provost, Lenton supported male students in their requests to keep them away from female students due to their religious preferences. =York University president= Lenton's appointment as university president became effective on 1 July 2017. As the university's chief spokesperson during a divisive part-time faculty strike in 2015, during which time she was also on the university's negotiating committee, Lenton's anticipated presidential appointment generated widespread opposition from an alliance of university students and faculty members prior to its announcement. In 2018, during her first year, a second strike occurred at the university under her leadership. An undergraduate student occupation of the University Senate took place in support of the strike. The sit-in lasted several months, during which the participants highlighted potential expense account spending issues from Lenton's term as Vice President Academic and President, in addition to various other tuition-oriented concerns. On May 1, 2018 President Lenton and the Chair of the Board of Governors (BoG) both were admonished in an official letter sent by the Canadian Association of University Teachers (CAUT) for their concerted and repeated attempts to undermine academic self- governance at York University. At that time, there were several York University faculty councils and student associations that also carried non- confidence motions in the conduct and leadership of Lenton as president.https://www.yufa.ca/york-u-admin-faces-mounting-criticism-as-summer- term-threatened-by-strike/ On May 11, the union representing the full-time tenured faculty stated the strike had lasted more than two months due to Lenton and the board's desire to break the union.

Since all three of his confirmed victims were female hotel employees, he became known as \\"The London Chambermaid Slayer.\\"  Early life  Gerald Thomas Archer was born in London, Ontario in 1932 and by 1950 had a criminal record for offences which included robbery, breaking and entering, and possession. He began corresponding with a woman named Mary in 1966, and met her in person in December 1967. The two wed eleven days after their initial meeting and lived in Merlin until October 1970, when they moved to Adelaide Street South, Chatham.  Murders  Jane Wooley, 62, was beaten and stabbed to death in her York Street, London apartment on 31 January 1969. Her body was discovered by a friend and the police on 3 February. She worked as a chambermaid at a Dundas Street hotel called the London House. Money was stolen from her purse and most of her clothing had been removed, which led investigators to conclude that she was killed by her assailant while he was in the midst of attempting to rape her. Edith Authier, 57, was beaten and stabbed to death in her William Street, Merlin home on 4 September 1970. Her body was discovered the next day by her neighbor Mary Gray. She worked as a chambermaid at the William Pitt Hotel in Chatham, was sexually assaulted before being killed, and had money stolen from her purse. Merrill Hotel chambermaid Belva Russell, 57, was beaten to death in her Adelaide Street South, Chatham apartment on 23 January 1971. Her body was discovered minutes after her death by her common-law husband Reginald Tomlinson, who bumped into an unfamiliar man running out of the building as he was entering it at around 2:00am. Most of Mrs. Russell's clothing had been removed, which led investigators to assume that she had been killed during a struggle with an assailant who had attempted to rape her.  Arrest and trial  Archer was picked up for questioning over the death of Belva Russell by detectives on 12 February 1971, and was arrested and charged with the non-capital murder of Mrs. Russell after being fingerprinted and identified in a police line-up by Mr. Tomlinson. Archer's trial began in June, was held in Kent County, and was presided over by Mr. Justice W.F. Donahue. When the twelve-man jury finished deliberating and returned with a verdict of guilty, Archer responded to his sentence of life imprisonment by shouting, \\"That's only the first strike against me. The ball game isn't over yet!\\"  Death  Archer was paroled in 1985, became a drifter, died of a heart attack in 1995, and had his unclaimed body buried in a potter's field. After his death, his estranged wife and daughter both came forward and informed the police that Archer had once drunkenly confessed to them that he had killed Edith Aurier. Authorities exhumed Archer's remains in February 2000 to procure DNA samples, which matched DNA extracted from cigarette butts found near Jane Wooley's body.

Once considered the \\"dean of public relations\\", he is best known as the long-time outside publicity counsel to AT&T; and as a founder of the predecessor organizations to the Public Relations Society of America and the Institute for Public Relations. He was the father of the choreographer Jane Dudley and was the husband of the motorist Hermine Jahns. Early life and education Dudley was born in Troy, Missouri, to Peter Dudley and Cornelia Dudley (n√©e Pendleton). The Dudleys had come to Missouri from Kentucky by wagon a few years before the younger Dudley's birth. Peter Dudley operated a general store in Troy. Pendleton Dudley attended Mexico High School in Mexico, Missouri, for two years before he had to drop-out to assist with the family store due to his father's ill health. Dudley began working as a part-time reporter and typesetter for the weekly Troy Free Press while still employed at the family store. This eventually led to a job at The Mexico Ledger. In 1898, inspired by an article he had read in the Saturday Evening Post titled \\"Working Your Way Through College\\", Dudley began putting-away a portion of his earnings to attend university. In 1899, having saved $100, he moved to New York City and enrolled at Columbia University, graduating in 1903. During his time at Columbia he contributed to the campus humor magazine Jester of Columbia. Career After graduating from Columbia Dudley held a variety of odd jobs, including as a retail clerk, a bond salesman, and an occasional stringer for the New York Times. He was eventually hired as a reporter for the Wall Street Journal on the recommendation of his friend Ivy Lee. During his time covering financial news for the Wall Street Journal, Dudley observed that many of the city's most prominent businessmen were essentially \\"inept\\" at dealing with the media. In 1909 he left the Wall Street Journal and opened a publicity firm at 34 Pine Street in Manhattan, Pendleton Dudley and Associates. Historically, the firm has been considered the fifth public relations agency established in the United States. One of Dudley's first large accounts was AT&T;, a client he would keep until his death in 1966. Dudley was also retained to mount a campaign to launch the political career of Woodrow Wilson, then president of Princeton University. Dudley's client in this endeavor is unknown and he would carry the details of the assignment to his grave. He last spoke about the Wilson project in 1959 to say only that it was a \\"highly confidential matter\\", exposure of which would be \\"damaging to our profession\\". Prior to the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire of 1911, Dudley helped organize opposition to the mandatory installation of sprinklers in warehouses at the behest of another client, the Protective League of Property Owners. Following World War II, it was revealed Dudley had worked as a middle-man to funnel payments from DeWitt Wallace to Lawrence Dennis; Wallace had hired Dennis to write \\"smear pieces\\" against Henry A. Wallace for Reader's Digest. In the 1940s, Dudley brought two former newspaper editors on to his firm as partners, changing the company's name to Dudley-Anderson-Yutzy. Dudley was heavily involved with the Public Relations Society of America, founding one of its predecessor groups and serving as the first chairman of the Foundations for Public Relations Research and Education, forerunner to the Institute for Public Relations. Personal life In 1910, Dudley married Hermine Jahns. The following year his wife gave birth to their first child, Jane Dudley. At the time, Dudley wrote that the birth of Jane \\"incidentally solved our problem as to whether or not we should send our boy to Columbia ... neither of us believes in college for girls.\\" With his wife he had a second daughter, Margaret. In 1915 Dudley returned to Mexico, Missouri, where he was feted as one of two guests of honor, along with Jouett Shouse, at the Mexico High School alumni banquet. For a five-year period after they founded Reader's Digest, DeWitt Wallace and Lila Bell Wallace rented and lived in a cottage on Dudley's Pleasantville, New York property, having responded to a newspaper ad Dudley had taken out. In retirement, Dudley lived at his home in Pleasantville and maintained ownership of his firm. In 1965, a year before his death, he moved to the University Club of New York. His memorial service was held at Columbia University's St. Paul's Chapel; Alfred A. Knopf Sr. delivered the eulogy. He had three siblings. Legacy At the time of his 1966 death, Dudley was known as the \\"dean of public relations\\". In a 1970 survey of public relations practitioners undertaken by the University of Michigan, he was voted third in a poll of the \\"most outstanding public relations figures\\" of the 20th century (Ivy Lee was voted first). In 1957 Dudley endowed the Pendleton Dudley Scholarship at Macalester College in response to a scholarship fundraising drive undertaken by Dewitt Wallace.

In 1997, the band became involved in an unprecedented marketing phenomenon, leading to a prolific number of Spice Girls merchandise and sponsorship deals. With the official Spice Girls branding on hundreds of different products, they became the most merchandised group in music history. The Spice Girls brand reportedly produced over ¬£300 million worldwide through merchandise in 1997. Globally, the group's total grosses were estimated to have been $500‚Äì800 million by May 1998. History =1997: Unprecedented merchandising= Off the back of their record-breaking debut album Spice, the Spice Girls began signing many lucrative merchandising and endorsement deals. In February 1997, the Spice Girls were booked to help launch the West McLaren Mercedes MP4/12 at London‚Äôs Alexandra Palace. They performed \\"Wannabe\\", \\"Say You'll Be There\\" and \\"Who Do You Think You Are\\" to an assembled audience of five thousand, comprising media, sponsors, VIP guests and fans. The event was filmed by MTV and presented by Davina McCall. In March, Girl Power!, the Spice Girls' first book was launched at the Virgin Megastore; it sold out its initial print run of 200,000 copies within a day, and was eventually translated into more than 20 languages. Later that month, the group were booked to launch Britain's fifth terrestrial television network, Channel 5, for a reported fee of ¬£500,000. They appeared in promotional print ads,Channel 5 - \\"Spice Girls\\" AdForum.

During this time, the group also launched Spice, the quarterly Spice Girls fanclub magazine. In April, One Hour of Girl Power, an official Spice Girls VHS documentary, was released; it sold almost 500,000 copies in the UK between April and June to become the best-selling pop video ever. In early 1997, the Spice Girls signed a multimillion-dollar endorsement deal with PepsiCo to launch the soft drink company's \\"Generation Next\\" campaign. 92 million promotional Pepsi cans and bottles featuring the Spice Girls individually or as a group were produced worldwide. Promotional giveaways included collectible drinking glasses and two limited edition music singles, \\"Step to Me\\" and \\"Move Over (Generation Next)\\". The group starred in three television adverts for Pepsi, all featuring the song \\"Move Over\\", that were aired on TV and in cinemas worldwide. In October 1997, the group performed two live concerts in Istanbul sponsored by the soft drink company, with tickets available exclusively through a Pepsi offer. The Spice Girls' \\"Generation Next\\" campaign led to a record five percent gain in the cola market share for Pepsi in 1997 and the endorsement deal was extended in November 1997 for an additional ¬£500,000. In a 2014 interview with BBC Radio 2, the group's longtime manager Simon Fuller claimed that Pepsi spent around $100 million on the Spice Girls' endorsement campaign. By June 1997, it was reported that the Spice Girls had applied for more than 100 trademarks. In July 1997, the group began an endorsement deal with Walkers Crisps to launch their \\"Cheese & Chives\\" flavour. The Spice Girls were featured on various crisps packets individually and as a group. They also starred in two television adverts alongside Gary Lineker and a number of promotional photoshoots for the British potato chip maker. Walkers Crisps reported a six percent increase in their brand's volume share of the crisp market within the first eight weeks of the Spice campaign, and had sold 16 million packs of their Spice Girls crisps by October that year. In the summer of 1997, the toy company Magic Box Toys created the first Spice Girls collectible photo album and trading card series. It was estimated by Forbes that 25 million cards had been sold by September 1997. Later, a second photocard series was released, along with an official Spice World: The Movie sticker book. During this time, Polaroid also signed a deal with the group to produce various Spice Girls-branded products including the SpiceCam, a variation on the original Polaroid 600 Instant Camera and Polaroid's first camera to be named after a group or person, that was marketed in the United States, Europe, Asia and Australia.\\"Spice Girls snap up camera deal, Posh Spice pied by anti-fur protesters\\".

During this time, the Spice Girls also signed up for product tie-ins with Benetton, Zeon watches (Spice Girls-themed watches and clocks), British Telecom (Spice Girls-themed phonecards) and Elisabeth the Chef (Spice Girls-themed cakes). In September 1997, British supermarket chain Asda signed a ¬£1 million merchandising deal to launch a wide range of Spice Girls products for the 1997 Christmas season. Over 40 different Spice Girls- branded goods were stocked including food, clothing, gifts, stationary, party supplies, Christmas crackers, individual pizzas with each band member representing a different flavour, homewear, books, videos, platform shoes and even Spice Girls-branded Kids Meals Boxes in the stores' restaurants.

Over 200 separate Spice Girls items were released including stationery, toys, lunch boxes, bags, purses, party goods, clothing, mugs, cosmetics, postcards, picture frames, keyrings and badges, all in the Spice Girls official colours of magenta and white. Upon the release of Spice World, movie memorabilia was also produced, including toy versions of the Spice Bus. In October 1997, Cadbury signed a deal with the band to release a range of Spice Girls-branded chocolate products. The range consisted of 10 chocolate countlines, assorted boxes and holiday confectioneries including Easter eggs, featuring the Spice Girls individually or as a group.

The Spice Girls were also sponsored by shoe brands Shellys London and Buffalo, and launched an official shoe line for adults and children. In December 1997, the first series of official Spice Girls dolls by toy company Galoob (now Hasbro) was released, with subsequent series released in 1998 and 1999. The dolls became a huge hit during the 1997 and 1998 Christmas seasons, selling over 11 million to become the best-selling celebrity dolls of all time.Vintage Celebrity Dolls Collectors Weekly.

By the end of 1997, the Spice Girls had become a \\"formidable money making machine\\", estimated to have earned over ¬£300 million worldwide that year through their marketing efforts. The Spice Girls brand was named one of 1997's best brands in Advertising Ages annual \\"Top Marketing 100\\" list. Some analysts cautioned of a brand \\"overkill\\", with The Independents Paul McCann warning that the \\"endless exploitation of the band's name signals the beginning of the end for the Spice phenomenon.\\" However, the Spice Girls continued to sign more merchandising and sponsorship deals in the following year. =1998‚Äì2000: Continued success and hiatus= In early 1998, the Spice Girls signed a sponsorship deal for their 1998 Spiceworld world tour with Italian scooter maker Aprilia. As part of the deal, five different \\"Spice Sonic\\" scooters--each promoting a Spice Girl--were created and marketed. The group also participated in a promotional photoshoot and filmed a television advert to promote the scooters. However, relations soured between the group and the Italian company after Halliwell's sudden departure in May 1998. In January 2002, after losing a long-running legal dispute, the group was ordered to pay $67,000 for scooters Aprilia supplied to the band members, in addition to damages and legal costs. Spice World, a video game featuring computer- animated cartoons of the Spice Girls, was developed and released by Sony Computer Entertainment Europe for the PlayStation in 1998. The Spice Girls also endorsed the sugar brand Domino Sugar in a promotional photoshoot. By May 1998, the band had become a \\"$500 million merchandising and marketing industry\\" according to CNN. The Spice Girls embarked on the American leg of their Spiceworld world tour in June 1998. During this leg of the tour, commercials for their sponsors including Revlon, Pepsi, Biore and Domino Sugar, were played on large concert screens before the shows and during intermissions. It was the first time advertising had been used in pop concerts and was met with mixed reactions in the music industry, with Jon Pareles of The New York Times dubbing the band forerunners of \\"buy-me feminism\\". Nevertheless, it opened up a whole new concert revenue stream, with music industry pundits predicting more acts would follow the Spice Girls' lead. In August 1998, bicycle company PTI Holding Inc. signed an exclusive agreement to manufacturer and distribute Spice Girls bicycles, helmets, in-line skates and bicycle accessory products for North America. The company received over $3 million in pre-order commitments on the day the deal was announced, and began shipping products during the fourth quarter for Christmas 1998. In May 1999, they were ranked sixth in Forbes inaugural Celebrity 100 Power Ranking, which ranks celebrities based on their brand name. In December 2000, the group went on an indefinite hiatus to concentrate on their solo careers.Spice Girls dismiss comeback plan BBC.

During the summer of 1997, the group was criticised for \\"selling out\\" to worldwide brands, being accused of overexposure and signing too many sponsorship contracts with large corporate businesses. According to Rolling Stones David Sinclair, \\"So great was the daily bombardment of Spice images and Spice product that it quickly became oppressive even to people who were well disposed towards the group.\\" A survey in October 1997 found that two-thirds of people in Britain believed the group to be over-exposed. Commentators opined that the band's music seemed like an afterthought, instead, Newsweek wrote, \\"the girls' main focus seems to be collecting huge fees for their advertising deals\\". Slates David Plotz noted that other music stars have had spinoff merchandise in the past, but never anything on the Spice Girls' scale. \\"Life is different in Spiceworld,\\" he explained, \\"If there is a product that 12-year-olds use, there will be a Spice Girls version of it in your mall by Thanksgiving.\\" Commentators often attribute the Spice Girls' vast marketing and merchandising efforts to their longtime manager Simon Fuller, dubbed \\"Svengali Spice\\" by the press. In 1997, Fuller was selected as one of Advertising Ages annual \\"Marketing 100\\" honorees, which awards 100 individuals for excellence in brand building.Advertising Age Announces Marketing 100 Honorees. Advertising Age. 30 June 1997. Fuller later explained in \\"Wannabe: How The Spice Girls Reinvented Pop Fame\\" (2004): Legacy In his analysis of the group's influence on 21st century popular culture two decades after their debut, John Mckie of the BBC News noted that while other stars had used brand endorsements in the past, \\"the Spice brand was the first to propel the success of the band\\". The Guardians Sylvia Patterson also wrote of what she called the Spice Girls' true legacy: \\"[T]hey were the original pioneers of the band as brand, of pop as a ruthless marketing ruse, of the merchandising and sponsorship deals that have dominated commercial pop ever since.\\" In a 2016 Vice op-ed, Tara Joshi acknowledged that \\"[a]s the Spice Girls‚Äô reign went on, they seemed to become less of a musical entity and more and more of an overt marketing tool, with Pepsi, Walkers, Polaroid, Barbie and more scoring very lucrative deals with them\\". However, she went on to argue that it is this merchandising success that \\"reinforce[s] the pop cultural phenomenon they had bestowed upon the British music industry and the world.\\" Joshi concludes that a \\"pop act having this much sway in the products people were buying was unprecedented ‚Äì on that scale, it seems unlikely to ever be repeated\\". Since 2008, \\"Spiceworld: The Exhibition\\", a collection of over 5,000 Spice Girls memorabilia and merchandise, has been showcased in museums across the UK, including the Leeds City Museum in 2011, Northampton Museum and Art Gallery in 2012, Tower Museum in 2012, Ripley's Believe It or Not!

Her mother was from Washington, D.C. and her father was an immigrant from Jamaica. The family went from Texas to Washington, D.C.. Eventually, Campbell moved to New York City in 1905. Career When she arrived in New York, Campbell devoted herself to community projects. She worked as a supervisor for the Empire Friendly Shelter, a home for unwed mothers. She donated part of her salary to found the organization, and funded it mostly on her own. Starting in 1915, she also worked for New York City. Campbell also worked in the Women's Sections of the Tombs Prison in New York as Chief Nurse. She was also employed as a probation officer, then a parole officer, and finally a court attendant for the Courts of Sessions in 1924. Around this time, she became involved in the Socialist Party of America. She became one of the founding members of the 21st assembly branch, and was the first African-American woman to join the party. She was also the first African-American woman member of the Communist Party of America. In 1919 and 1920, she ran unsuccessfully for office in the New York State Assembly on the Socialist ticket. Campbell continued to be active in political circles. She was the only female member of the 21st A.D. Socialist Club in 1918, and also acted as the club's secretary. She helped found the People's Educational Forum in 1920, a forum that was used to debate popular issues. The forum also opposed Marcus Garvey. In 1921, she moved away from the Socialist party. She was one of the founding members, along with Cyril Briggs and others, of the African Blood Brotherhood. She was the only woman to help found the organization, and also the only woman who served on its council.

History The year 1940 was comparatively quiet for Enescu. Romania had not yet entered the Second World War, and his schedule of concerts was not as intense as had been the case in the First World War, which gave him time to complete two major compositions, the Impressions d'enfance for violin and piano, and the Piano Quintet. The manuscript of the Quintet indicates that the first pair of movements was completed at Enescu's villa Lumini»ô in Sinaia on 24 September 1940, but the remaining pair of movements is undated, and Enescu continued making small revisions as late as 1949. The score is dedicated to the memory of the pianist (and Enescu's early patron) Princess Elena Bibescu. The work was not performed in Enescu's lifetime, but was finally premiered in Bucharest in 1964 by (amongst others) Valentin Gheorghiu, piano, and »òtefan Gheorghiu, first violin . Analysis The Quintet is in four movements, grouped in two \\"commanding musical blocks\\" of two movements each : * Con moto molto moderato * Andante sostenuto e cantabile * Vivace, ma non troppo * Pi√π tranquillo The overriding feature of the cyclic melodic material that contributes to unifying all of the movements of this Quintet is the constant presence of a \\"modal fifth\\": a formula that fits each of the motives within the framework of a perfect fifth, thus establishing an underlying pentachordal modal torso. Put another way, the displayed motives may be regarded as various kinds of melodic \\"disguisings\\" of the modal fifth over the course of the Quintet .

Democratic Mayor Thomas Richards, who first took office following Robert Duffy's resignation to take office of Lieutenant-Governor of New York in 2011, ran for reelection and was defeated in both the Democratic Primary and the general election by former City Council President Lovely A. Warren. Green Party candidate Alex White also ran and received a notable 5% of the vote. Considered a major upset victory, Lovely Warren defeated the incumbent mayor Richards in their party's primary against most major polling predictions. Background In May 2010, Rochester Mayor Robert Duffy was chosen by Andrew Cuomo to be his lieutenant gubernatorial nominee. They won on November 2, 2010 with 62% of the vote. Upon Cuomo's victory in the 2010 New York Gubernatorial Election, Duffy selected deputy mayor Thomas Richards to succeed him as interim-Mayor of Rochester, which he served from December 31, 2010 to January 18, 2011, when Richards resigned to ensure he could run in a special election without violating terms of the Hatch Act, which could have jeopardized federal funding.Thomas Richards resigns as Rochester mayor; Carlos Carballada to take his place Following his resignation, a special election was called to determine who would hold the office of mayor until the following election year. Former Rochester mayor William A. Johnson, Jr. ran against Democrat-backed Richards in the race, which took place on March 29, 2011. Richards ultimately won the election with 48.48% of the vote to former Mayor Johnson's 41.72%.2011 Special Mayoral Certification - Monroe County Board of Elections Primary Richards announced on February 6, 2013 that he would run for re-election for a full term as Rochester mayor. He was challenged by city council president Lovely A. Warren. Considered the favorite to win and ahead in most major polls, Richards did not focus much attention to campaigning, instead choosing to continue his duties as mayor and spending time at home in the midst of a family emergency. In contrast, Warren spent much time on the campaign trail, going door to door and engaging with community leaders. Richards lost the Democratic primary to City Council President Lovely A. Warren on September 10, 2013 57% to 42%. The defeat was considered a major upset, as Richards was better funded and led in the pre-vote polling. General Election Following his defeat in the Democratic Primary, Richards ended his active campaign and endorsed Warren for mayor, but was kept as the chosen candidate on the Independence and Working Families lines. The Independence Party created the grass roots Turn Out for Tom campaign. In response, Richards stated that he would serve if re-elected mayor but denied having any contact with the Independence Party campaign. Richards lost the election to Warren 55% to 39% on November 8. Following the election, Lovely Warren was inaugurated in January 2014 and became the first female mayor of the city. Many of Richards' proposals and policies were kept under the Warren Administration including the construction of the new RGRTA bus terminal and the Inner Loop urban renewal project.

Prior to his first legislative campaign in 2001, Chiang worked as a supervisor at First Commercial Bank. Bank chairman Jerome Chen was indicted in March 2001 of breach of trust, as Chen was found to have used bank resources in support of Chiang's campaign. Due to the controversy, Chiang resigned his role as a government advisor. On 23 September 2001, Chiang claimed to receive a faxed confession signed by Chang Chao-chuan, admitting to electoral fraud during the 2000 presidential election. After sending the evidence to the Ministry of Justice, Chiang filed suit against the Kuomintang in October. In his first term as legislator, Chiang joined an \\"anti-betrayal alliance,\\" which later became the Alliance Against Selling Out Taiwan. He was supportive of reductions to salaries of government workers. In 2003, Chiang asked the Judicial Yuan to offer an interpretation of a legislative resolution barring an increase on National Health Insurance premiums, which he believed to be non-binding. Later that year, Chiang and fellow legislator Lee Chen-nan accused Taipei Veterans General Hospital superintendent Chang Mau-song of corruption, leading to Chang's resignation. After the Referendum Act was promulgated, Lin Chin-hsing, Chai Trong-rong, and Chiang proposed in June 2004 that a referendum be held to decide the location of the capital. Such a referendum has yet to be held. Chiang won reelection in December 2004. In his second term, he was named the leader of a group that acted as a liaison between the Legislative Yuan and US Congress. Chiang became critical of the government's financial supervisory agencies, especially the Financial Supervisory Commission. After Lee Chin-chen resigned due to allegations of insider trading, Chiang called for commission chairman Kong Jaw-sheng to step down also. After the FSC was unable to stop a bank run on Rebar Chinese Bank, Chiang berated Premier Su Tseng-chang over the scandal. In 2005, he proposed a bill in response to China's Anti-Secession Law. He was detained later that year while in Chiang Kai-shek International Airport, because he was there to protest Lien Chan's attendance of the Pan‚ÄìBlue visits to mainland China. Chiang lost a May 2007 party primary to Wei Ming-ku, and during the election, filed defamation lawsuits against Wei and Hsiao Bi-khim. He was named a Democratic Progressive Party candidate for a third time, but lost reelection in January 2008 to Kuomintang candidate Hsiao Ching-tien. Following the loss, Chiang was elected in May as DPP chapter director for Changhua County. He launched a legislative campaign in 2011, but did not win. Chiang was one of five potential candidates representing the Democratic Progressive Party in 2013 for the magistracy of Changhua County, a post that was won by Wei Ming- ku.

The series starred Tina Philip and Kanwar Dhillon. It premiered on 3 April 2017 on Star Plus and aired from Monday through Saturday during the Star Plus Dopahar (afternoon) programming block. The series ended on 30 September 2017 with the discontinuation of the Star Plus Dopahar block. Plot The series revolves around Aastha, an atheist girl from Manali, who gets married into a very religious family in Kolkata and tries to save the family from Guru Maa's ploys. Aastha's and Shiv's love is meant to be. Radhika, Shiv's ex-girlfriend comes and destroys their love by creating misunderstandings between them. Shiv wants Aastha to stop his marriage with Radhika. But Aastha thinks that if Shiv loves her he will not marry Radhika. Shiv and Aastha love each other a lot but are unable to tell each other. Radhika and Gurumas plan fails when Astha exposes Radhika through the use of a recorder. During their engagement, Astha uses technology to show how Radhika conspired against the whole family to obtain her interest (money - rather I say). After Radhika is exposed, gurumaa says that she wants to do 'arti' before she leaves the household to which the members retaliate. But, on Asthas convincing, the family members agree. Gurumaa gives prashad which contains sleepy pills. In the parallel scene, Radhika comes in Asthas room and holds her up against the wall with a knife. Arguments continue between Lakshmi Gurumaa and others. Eventually, Shiv rescues Astha under the pretext of marrying Radhika. The show ends on a happy note that a person's character cannot be judged based on their religious views. An atheist person can be a good human and a religious person can be a bad human.

It is located at the confluence of the Tirlian River and the Belaya River 33 km from Beloretsk. The nearest railway station is 41km away. Ruins left from the Tirlyansk iron plant, washed away by the flood in 1994. Plans began in 1759 for an iron works in the village but it was not till 1803 that the plant began operations. A full road was only constructed to the town in 1913, built by Chinese workers. The railway was built soon after. After the construction of an asphalt road in 2001 between Tirlyan and Beloretsk, the movement of passenger trains Beloretsk-Tirlian-Beloretsk was closed since 20 May 2002. By autumn 2003, a section of a narrow-gauge railway between Tirlyan and Verkhnearshinsky was dismantled. As of the end of 2003, the narrow-gauge line from Beloretsk to Tirlyan remained alive. On it was an irregular movement - mainly the export of rolling stock from Tirlyan to scrap metal. Periodically, from Beloretsk to Tirlian, fuel oil for the boiler room was also delivered. These last 34 kilometers were once the most important section of the Beloretsk railway, where hundreds of passengers drove daily. The last section of the Beloretsk narrow-gauge railway (from Beloretsk to Katayki) was dismantled in the spring and summer of 2007. In 1994 the village was affected by terrible floods. Landmarks In Tirliansky, despite the small size of the village, there are a lot of attractions: The main one is the ruins of the Iron plant. The plant was closed after the 1994 flood. Near the ruins of the plant is a huge iron wheel with spokes. This is one of two drivers for the rolling mills. There is still a hollow in the rocks, where the Beloretskaya narrow-gauge railway line (BUW) ran, through which opens a beautiful view of the reservoir opens up.
