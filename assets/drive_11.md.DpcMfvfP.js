By an act of the Michigan Legislature on March 11, 1835, the townships of Hickory and Orange were set off from Clinton. Hickory then consisted survey township 1N13E, with the exception of the eastern row of sections, which were made part of Orange Township (later named Erin Township and that later became the cities of East Detroit, Roseville, Fraser, and St. Clair Shores. On April 2, 1838, the township name was changed from Hickory to \\"Aba\\" (sometimes misspelled \\"Alba\\") and was increased by the additions of sections 1 and 12. On March 26, 1839, the name was changed to \\"Warren\\".

Romig, s.v. \\"Warren\\". p. 582 The community that later became the Village of Warren, began to be settled about 1830, before the formation of Warren Township. It was at first known as \\"Beebe's Corners\\" after John L. Beebe, who operated the toll gate on the plank road that led to Detroit. Village of Warren, Michigan Historical Markers, accessed 2007-11-11 A Guide to Warren's History, City of Warren Historic District Commission, accessed 2007-11-11 However, Romig (s.v. \\"Richmond\\", p. 475) locates Beebe's Corners in the city of Richmond, Michigan, named after Erastus Beebe. The first landowner known to actually settle in the area is Charles Groesbeck in about 1830. He was soon joined by his brother Louis (the father of Michigan Governor Alex Groesbeck) and Charles Rivard. History of Warren, Warren Historical & Genealogical Society, accessed 2007-11-11 A strap iron railroad, one of the first of its kind in Michigan, connected the settlement with Utica to the north and with Detroit to the south. The settlement was situated on the line between sections 4 and 5, at the junction of what are now known as Chicago Road and Mound Road. Stewart, Map of Warren Township, circa 1875, p. 16 Geo. A.

Another settlement grew a few miles to the south of the village of Warren. This settlement incorporated as the village of Center Line in 1925. Center Line became a city in 1936 and was no longer part of Warren Township. On October 27, 1956, Governor G. Mennen Williams signed the charter that incorporated the remainder of the township, including the village of Warren, as the city of Warren. The city of Warren began operations on January 1, 1957.

This is the place where he learned the business of photography. After four years of working at Paul Hesse Studios, Casilli decided to open up his own studio and begin his career as a professional photographer. He had the opportunity to photograph big celebrities such as Dolly Parton, Sally Field, Will Smith, and Halle Berry. Casilli had a unique style which separated him from the rest. His style is said to have been iconic and defined the photography of the 1980s. From 1962 until 1981 he photographed fifty-seven Playmate pictorials, including Playmates of the Year Linda Gamble, Christa Speck, Jo Collins, Connie Kreski, Claudia Jennings and Dorothy Stratten. He also photographed several covers for Playboy, as well as celebrities such as Valerie Perrine, Victoria Principal, Joan Collins and Mariel Hemingway. In addition to his work with Playboy, Casilli also contributed stills to the films Star 80 (1983) (which was about murdered Playmate Dorothy Stratten) and Nuts (1987).

Purpose  The OES survey is designed to produce estimates of employment and wages by occupation by four-digit North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) in each State-level Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA-‚Äúurban‚Äù) or Balance-of-State (BOS-‚Äúrural‚Äù) geographic level, and their aggregates. Semi-annually, a \\"current\\" sample is combined with the immediate five prior samples to produce a ‚Äúcombined‚Äù sample of approximately 1.2 million establishments (6 x 200,000) to produce OES Estimates.  Process  During the sampling process, the National frame (using data collected by the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages) of business establishments (approximately 7 million frame business establishments in-scope) is allocated for 1.2 million sample cases, then ‚Äúdivided‚Äù by 6 for each geography/industry cell (1.2 million/6=200,000). After the sample of 200,000 is selected, data from each selected business establishment are collected by each state over the next nine months and reported back to BLS. These data include employment counts by occupation and wages paid by occupation. Wages are collected on an interval scale (rather than point data). Wages may be reported as an hourly wage or an annual wage. Wages include tips, but not overtime or any other bonus pay. OES is not a benefits survey; thus, benefits data are not collected. After data are collected from the roughly 200,000 establishments, data are then combined with five prior collections' worth of data (for a total of 1.2 million) and weighted estimates are calculated. Most estimates are occupational-based (highly detailed using the 800 occupations in the Standard Occupational Classification System manual); estimates are calculated at the MSA-level with aggregate estimates at the state and national levels. A good example is that OES estimates calculate how many primary school teachers (including their wages) work in the Los Angeles- Long Beach-Glendale, CA MSA, which can be aggregated to how many primary school teachers (including their wages) work in California, which in turn can be aggregated to how many primary school teachers (including their wages) work in the United States. The main occupational-based estimates that are calculated are: *employment counts *mean wages *median wages *percentile wages *upper 2/3-lower 1/3 (experienced vs. entry-level) wages *associated variances There are many customers who are interested in OES data, such as colleges and trade schools whose students would like to obtain occupational information before entering the work force, temporary employment firms, and people who start businesses and want to know how much to pay workers. BLS also utilizes OES data to make.employment projections The biggest customer for OES isForeign Labor Certification the Foreign Labour Certification (FLC), who are interested in employment opportunities and wages paid for documented foreign workers.

Rowland Hill. His work was continued in 1833 by the Congregational pastor Rev. James Sherman, and in 1854 by Rev. Newman Hall. The chapel's design attracted great interest, being circular in plan with a domed roof. When built it was set in open fields, but within a few years it became a new industrial area with a vast population characterised by great poverty amidst pockets of wealth. Recently the site itself has been redeveloped as an office block (currently occupied by the London Development Agency), and Southwark Underground Station has been built opposite. History The first stone of the chapel was laid in 1782, and the building opened in June 1783. Sponsorship was raised from Dissenting philanthropists such as the Methodist, Selina, Countess of Huntingdon. A round building, Rowland Hill is said to have remarked, prevented the Devil from hiding in any corners. Its founding pastor, Rowland Hill, having a strong interest in inoculation, established one of the most effective vaccination boards in London at Surrey Chapel. He was buried, at his own request below the pulpit, but was later re-buried below the Lincoln Memorial Tower of the successor chapel, Christ Church, Kennington Road. Surrey Chapel, though owned and managed by independent trustees primarily as a Nonconformist chapel, was operated as a venue for music, singing, and for the meetings of charities, associations and societies, several of which became closely associated with it. For a time, the composer and arranger Benjamin Jacob was organist, attracting thousands; a practical response to Rowland Hill's well known concern about chapel music of the time: 'Why should the Devil have all the good tunes ?' . One of the chapel's principal associations was with the non-denominational London Missionary Society; for over sixty years the society held its principal annual sermon at Surrey Chapel and from here dispatched many of its best known missionaries including Robert Moffat and John Williams. The chapel made itself available to many religious figures of different denominations; those invited to preach within its walls included both Establishment and Nonconformist figures. Clergymen of the Establishment included Henry Venn) and Rev. Thomas Scott, whilst eminent Dissenting ministers included Dr Chalmers. Martha and James Sherman took over the pastorate in 1935 and their partnership contributed to the chapel's success. Sherman also took a nondenominational approach to burial reform was developed - Abney Park Cemetery. Surrey Chapel - as a result of this 'open door' policy - became a popular London venue for many different religious leaders, societies, and meetings, including some of an avowedly political nature, as well as the site of the first Sunday School in London. So much so, that new premises had to be found to accommodate the growth in services, ragged schools, Sunday schools and the Southwark Mission for the Elevation of the Working Classes - an auxiliary to Surrey Chapel managed by the plain speaking George Murphy for the increasing numbers of industrial poor of the district. These additional premises included a nearby temperance hall (leased for about twenty years from 1844 using a centenary commemoration fund raised by James Sherman in honour of Rowland Hill, thus renamed Hawkstone Hall after his birthplace); and Lambeth Baths (whose use was paid for by Samuel Morley (MP) for additional Sunday services, meetings, lectures, classes, newspaper readings and musical entertainments). This growth led to the educational institutions of Surrey Chapel becoming probably more extensive than those connected with any free Church in the south of England. It became the nucleus of thirteen Sunday schools, four of them evening Ragged Schools, as well as day schools at Mansfield Street, Harrow Street, Kent Street, and Castle Yard, where more than five thousand children were taught by over four hundred teachers. In 1859 the trustees and congregation, did not renew the lease and purchased land at Westminster Bridge Road and Kennington Road where (led by the pastor, Christopher Newman Hall) where they built a larger complex of buildings, which included a large chapel (Christ Church), lecture halls and school rooms (Hawkstone Hall) and the Lincoln Memorial Tower - the latter reflecting Newman Hall's campaigning role in the American Civil War and on the side of Abraham Lincoln and the abolition movement. The congregation migrated there in 1876, as did many of the societies associated with Surrey Chapel. Rowland Hill's original chapel became used for various religious and social purposes, including by the Primitive Methodists for a time, before partial demolition, rebuilding and refitting works to suit it to commercial uses in 1881. The Illustrated London News reported its demise in May 1881 in these terms: The demolition of the well-known circular meeting-house, or Dissenting Chapel, in Blackfriar's-road, Southwark, removes another familiar landmark of London's social and religious history.Illustrated London News (7 May 1881) Rowland Hill's Chapel: London, p. 444 Later use Despite the fatalistic tone of the contemporary news report, sufficient of the original building was retained that it remained recognisable in the streetscene until bombed during the Second World War. Though it had various commercial uses after 1881, most notably as the Ring - a boxing arena - which commenced in 1910. Dick Burge and his wife Bella acquired the lease, and developed the venue so as to cater for a working class audience. In 1914 Bella became the first woman to attend a boxing match and soon her friend Marie Lloyd and other actresses became regular attendees at bouts. Today, on the site of the Surrey Chapel is a modern office block named Palestra. The new building is used by Transport for London and the London Development Agency. Situated opposite, across Union Street, is Rowland Hill House: an interwar block of council flats named in honour of the chapel's founder. The Surrey Chapel that existed in south London should not be confused with Surrey Chapel in Norwich, which was founded in 1844 and continues to the present day. Background reading * Rev.

The film follows the story of three children, one from Mexico, Cuba, and Morocco, as they attempt to deal with realities of immigration in their societies. The film won three awards at the Lleida Latin-American Film Festival in 2006, including Best Film and the Audience Award; Vanessa Bauche won best actress at the festival for her performance. Al Otro Lado was also the Mexican candidate for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film at the 78th Academy Awards, but was not selected as one of the final five nominees.  Plot  = Mexico = Priciliano, the first boy introduced in the story, has a very strong bond with his father. At the beginning of the film, his father tells him a story about a princess who was kidnapped by a conquistador and commits suicide in the lake he and his friend have been playing in. He is trying to teach his son the importance of respecting the dead, a very prevalent theme in Mexican culture. However, Priciliano is struck with grief when his father leaves his family to go find work \\"al otro lado\\" (on the other side). He is particularly upset because he is about to celebrate his ninth birthday, which his father will be missing. Frustrated, he attempts to cross the river to the other side with his friend and nearly drowns but is rescued by the ghost of the princess his father told him about. An older man in the community tells Priciliano that it is important to stay with his family because they need him, and the boy accepts his role as \\"the man of the house\\" in his father's place and begins to learn how to live everyday life without him. = Cuba = The second boy introduced in the story, √Ångel, is ashamed of his mother, who may be a prostitute. He was told before the story began that his father is a famous person and lives \\"al otro lado.\\" Desperate for a sense of pride, he and his friend, Walter, attempt to cross the ocean in a primitive raft to find his father. In their attempt, however, their raft is hit and overturned by a large wave. Walter drowns in the ensuing chaos, while √Ångel miraculously escapes. He doesn't have the courage to tell his friend's mother of what happened and feels extremely guilty. He has dreams of Walter by the ocean. In the dreams, Walter yells at him that he must tell his mother the truth. His grandfather notices something is wrong and urges his mother to talk to him. He tells his mother a little of what happened in the ocean and why they were there, and his mother figures out the rest and tells him that his father knows nothing of √Ångel's existence. But tells him that he is all that she and his grandfather have and vice versa. √Ångel learns to be content in his situation and the cinematography suggests that his friend's death is no longer a burden to him, but a memory to carry with him. = Morocco = F√°tima is a girl who runs away from home to find her father, bringing only a picture of him with her. She is intercepted, though, by human traffickers, who take her to Spain on their boat. Once the traders arrive, a woman who works with them refuses to send F√°tima with the other girls because F√°tima is too young and she had only asked for seven girls. This woman, who does not speak Arabic, takes F√°tima in and eventually softens enough to drive F√°tima to M√°laga and help her find her father. The father is with a Spanish woman, but once confronted with his daughter, he leaves the other woman to return F√°tima home. The movie ends with a shot of the two of them in front of their home village.

It stars James Mason, Robert Preston and Beau Bridges. The screenplay by Leon Prochnik is based on the 1970 play of the same title by Robert Marasco. Plot synopsis The film centers on the rivalry between two faculty members at St. Charles, an exclusive Catholic boarding school for boys. Joe Dobbs is an easy- going, well-liked English teacher, while Latin and Greek instructor Jerome Malley is feared and hated by his students. Malley is caring for his dying mother, and his stress is exacerbated by a series of threatening phone calls and written notes he receives. He's certain Dobbs is the source, but his caustic personality prevents him from winning any sympathy or support. Into the fray comes Paul Reis, a former student who has been hired to teach physical education, and he soon finds his loyalty torn between Dobbs and Malley, as he becomes increasingly aware of the latter's personal torments. Compounding his situation is the realization that the unbridled violence practiced by the students may be the result of demonic possession. Production notes Marlon Brando originally signed for the role of Joseph Dobbs, but dropped out of the film when he realized James Mason had the better role. He was replaced by Robert Preston, and first-time film producer David Merrick sued Brando for breach of contract.Marlon: Portrait of the Rebel as an Artist by Bob Thomas, published by Random House (1973) The Paramount Pictures release was filmed at Marymount Secondary School in Tarrytown, New York.

Ruth Morley Critical reception Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film 2.5 stars out of 4 and wrote \\"'Child‚Äôs Play,' which is beautifully acted and very nicely directed, doesn't seem to know whether it‚Äôs really about the supernatural or not ... the entire movie is set up to suggests supernatural overtones, so when we get a rather conventional, Freudian, ending, we‚Äôre disappointed. The original fault lies with Robert Marasco's Broadway play, I suppose. But it could have been fixed for the movie.\\" Vincent Canby of The New York Times wrote \\"With the exception of the performance of Mr. Mason, who is fine as the mad, exhausted Latin teacher, everything in 'Child's Play' seems to be rather cheaply tricky ‚Äî such as the low-range photography and floor lighting designed to throw faces into eerie relief. In a more thoughtful film, the screen play and the performances might have been expected to create the sense of true menace and mystery. Even more irritating is the soundtrack, full of ominous clicking noises that are so loud and so resonant that one can't believe that the characters inside the film can't hear them, too.\\"Canby, Vincent (December 13, 1972). \\"Screen: Weird Pupils of 'Child's Play'\\". The New York Times. 58.

Variety. December 6, 1972. 20.

A positive review from Charles Champlin of the Los Angeles Times called the film \\"a superior psychological thriller\\" that \\"works a few mild deceptions on the audience to achieve its ends, but no one is likely to care very much.

Gary Arnold of The Washington Post wrote \\"In a better play or movie we might have learned what makes one man despise another so intensely that he thinks he's justified in destroying him.

Early life Durdan was born in Arcata, California and attended Eureka High School, where he played running back on the high school football team. In 1935, Durdan's team was not only undefeated, but they did not allow their opponents to score a single point. Durdan went on to Oregon State, where he started in baseball, basketball, and football, and was a member of Pacific Coast Conference championship teams in each sport. He was named an All-American in basketball in his senior year of 1943. Rose Bowl MVP In 1941, the Beavers football team won the Pacific Coast Conference and a berth in the 1942 Rose Bowl against the undefeated Duke Blue Devils. With the United States' entry into World War II, concern about a Japanese attack on the West Coast brought a relocation of the game to Duke's home stadium in Durham, North Carolina. In spite of the fact that Duke was favored by two touchdowns, the Beavers pulled off a major upset, winning 20‚Äì16. Durdan, who showed his all-around skill by rushing for 54 yards and a touchdown, passing, and punting, was named the game's most valuable player. This remains the only Beavers' Rose Bowl victory. Professional career Durdan served in the United States Navy during World War II. After the war, Durdan signed with the San Francisco 49ers in 1946, where he played halfback as well as defensive back for one full season and part of a second in 1947. In addition to playing professional football, Durdan also played professional basketball for the Portland Indians of the Pacific Coast Professional Basketball League. The league lasted just two seasons (1946‚Äì47 and 1947‚Äì48), but Durdan's Indians won the best-of-five league championship in 1948 over the rival Seattle Athletics. Personal In 1946, Durdan married Maxine DeMoss, sister of Oregon golf champion Grace DeMoss (another DeMoss sister married Durdan's Rose Bowl teammate Quentin Greenough). Following his sports career, Durdan became a funeral director in his wife's family's funeral home business in Corvallis, Oregon. He died in Corvallis in 1971. He was inducted into the Oregon Sports Hall of Fame in 1981, and in 1988, to both the Rose Bowl Hall of Fame and the Oregon State University Sports Hall of Fame.

Shot on location on Cape Cod, No√´lle was originally produced under the title Mrs. Worthington's Party by Volo Films (David Wall's production banner) and won two awards at the 2006 Fort Lauderdale International Film Festival for Best Director and Best American Indie 1st Runner Up. The film was picked up for commercial distribution by Protestant film company Gener8Xion Entertainment and was released in theaters on December 7, 2007.The Hollywood Reporter - Volume 402 - Page 147 2007 - DECEMBER 21-23, 2007 Noelle Gener8Xion Entertainment NEW YORK ‚Äî Arriving just in time for the holidays is this low-budget, religious- themed indie drama, which was released in about 200 theaters Dec. 7 by Gener8Xion Entertainment, the company that brought you such similarly oriented films as \\"The Omega Code\\" and \\"One Night With the King.\\" \\"Noelle\\" is an interesting and heartfelt effort, even if it is ultimately too low-key to make much of a theatrical impact. Home video  Plot  Father Jonathan Keene goes to a small fishing village a week before Christmas to shut down a dying parish. When he gets there, he finds that the congregation has dropped from 150 to 20 under Simeon's leadership. While Simeon takes Father Keene around the parish, Keene sees a young woman he had seen at the bus station when he first arrived in the village. He returns her glove he accidentally picked up when they bumped into each other. The woman introduces herself as Marjorie Worthington but quickly excuses herself to return to having a rather animated discussion with her boyfriend. Later, at rehearsals for the Nativity play, Simeon tells the parishioners what Father Keene is there for and suggests that Keene takes over production. Keene wants Marjorie to play Mary as she is the only woman she has seen in town that is under 60, but she turns the role down saying that she 'isn't Mary'. A few days later after rehearsals, a woman goes into the Confessional and tells Father Keene that she overheard Marjorie and her boyfriend Seth talking and Marjorie is pregnant with Seth's baby even though he has a wife in New York. When Keene talks to Marjorie she tells him that she knew Seth was married and that she has ended their relationship. On Christmas Eve, Simeon tells Keene that he wants to marry Marjorie and is quitting the priesthood. Only a couple of people turn up to perform the Nativity and they tell Keene that there's no point in doing it and they're going to go to Mrs Worthington's Christmas party like everybody else. When at the party, Keene sees Seth flirting to another woman, and gets into a fight with him. He goes outside and talks to Marjorie. He tells her that everywhere he goes he sees a spirit of a little girl. The girl he explains, is the daughter he forced his girlfriend to abort when they were at university, and that he never wanted to be a priest, he just did it out of guilt. Simeon observes the conversation and realises that Keene loves Marjorie. Later, Marjorie goes into labour after trying to run away. Father Keene visits her in the hospital, and as he looks at Marjorie's newborn baby through the window, No√´lle, the spirit of his daughter, forgives him. Simeon meanwhile, who went to the church to say goodbye to Father Keene, is elated to see that the church is full. Four years later, Simeon is directing the church Nativity. Grace, Marjorie's daughter, whom Keene presumably adopted after marrying her mother, runs to Keene and hugs him.

The team was Bahamian owned and featured some Bahamian players and coaches, and the organization hoped to eventually play its home games in the Bahamas.

Born in London, Simms suffered from ill-health in his younger years (as his obituary put it, he was \\"of delicate constitution\\", and some difficulty was encountered in finding him suitable employment until via the influence of his brother he was despatched to Ireland as an assistant to the Ordnance Survey. After leaving Ireland Simms became an astronomical assistant at the Royal Observatory, Greenwich, under John Pond. He resigned his post on 31 October 1835, apparently having hoped to be awarded the post of First Assistant, for which he was \\"quite incompetent\\" in the words of Sir George Biddell Airy. He returned to his former occupation as a surveyor and civil engineer, visiting France with Richard Tappin Claridge,Obituary of Frederick Walter Simms, p.121 who in the 1830s patented the use of Seyssel asphalt in the UK, and later working with Claridge on the introduction of asphalt to Britain. The formation in 1838 of Claridge's Patent Asphalte Company (which ceased operating in 1917 ) \\"gave an enormous impetus to the development of a British asphalt industry\\". Simms' own efforts included writing a pamphlet promoting the use of Seyssel asphalt, based on an 1836 paper by geologist M. Rozet. In 1836 Simms joined the South Eastern Railway Company as a resident engineer and undertook a considerable number of works, including the construction of the Bletchingley and Saltwood tunnels. In 1846 the East India Company, having decided to construct railways in their territories, proposed to Simms that he become their consulting engineer in India. His health suffered from the climate and he spend some time in Mauritius before returning to duty where, among other work, he supervised a complete survey and mapping of the city of Calcutta which was principally carried out by local assistants. Having completed his engagement with the East India Company Simms returned to England in 1851, his health very much affected by India's climate and thereafter lived in retirement.

Charged with selling to a minor Lee entered the news again after the Halloween 2004 Free Comic Book Day giveaway at a street fair in Rome.Book Notes Lee's shop gave away thousands of free comics on that day, but a copy of Alternative Comics #2 was unintentionally included in the giveaway.Gordon Lee: The Road To Trial Alternative Comics #2 is an anthology containing an excerpt from the story The Salon by Nick Bertozzi.Cbldf Takes Action in Ga Case -- Files Four Motions to DismissGORDON LEE: MISTRIAL DECLARED The story portrays Pablo Picasso's first meeting with the fellow cubist Georges Braque, during which Picasso is depicted as nude in a non-sexual context. (The CBLDF has made statements that the comic is historically accurate in this depiction.) The copy of that comic that was unintentionally given away was handed to a minor, whose parent filed a complaint with the police. Upon learning of the error, Lee admitted that a mistake was made and offered to make a public apology for the first of many times. That apology was rejected, and days later, Lee was arrested. The minor in question was originally described as a nine-year-old boy, but various accounts by the District Attorney's office later stated that the comic was given either to the boy's six-year-old brother or to both boys. Lee later stated \\"Though I am willing to apologize for this particular art book getting in the hands that found it offensive, I will adamantly agree that the book is not 'harmful to children' or 'obscene.' In my opinion, this book is no more offensive then viewing the beautiful paintings of the Sistine Chapel or reading one of the best selling books with stories of sex, lust and nudity known as the Bible.\\"CBLDF Initiates Obscenity Defense in Georgia District Attorney Leigh Patterson charged Lee with two felony counts and five misdemeanors. The two felony charges were brought under the Distribution of Material Depicting Nudity or Sexual Conduct law, which requires materials containing nudity to be distributed in a labelled envelope. Penalties for violating this law include one to three years in prison and/or fines of up to $10,000 US. The five misdemeanors were presented under the Distribution of Material Harmful to Minors law, which makes it a misdemeanor to supply minors any material containing nudity. CBLDF involvement Lee approached Comic Book Legal Defense Fund board member Peter David for help late in January 2005. The CBLDF Board of Directors voted unanimously to financially support Lee's defense, putting a defense team in place within days. In May 2005, the CBLDF submitted four motions to dismiss the counts Lee faced, challenging the constitutionality of both laws. A hearing on those motions was held on December 1, 2005, during which all charges under the Distribution of Material Depicting Nudity or Sexual Conduct law were dropped. Two of the remaining misdemeanor charges were dropped as well, and the three remaining charges were consolidated into only two. The remaining charges were for \\"distributing a book, pamphlet, magazine, and printed matter containing pictures, drawings and visual representation and images of a person a portion of the human body which depict sexually explicit nudity, sexual conduct, and sadomasochistic abuse and which is harmful to minors;\\" and for knowingly furnishing and disseminating to a minor materials \\"containing explicit and detailed verbal descriptions and narrative accounts of sexual excitement, sexual conduct, and sadomasochistic abuse and which taken as a whole is harmful to minors.\\" The Fund maintained that the material did not meet the criteria as charged. Delays in the trial By November 2007, the CBLDF had spent over $80,000 on Lee's defense after taking the case in early 2005, and estimated costs reaching six figures by the end of the trial. The case has been ready for trial three times, but has been delayed each time. =Re-filing of charges= On April 2, 2006, 18 hours before Lee's jury trial, the District Attorney's team informed the defense team that all charges were being dropped against Lee based on a mistake: The recipient of the comic was not the nine-year-old originally referenced in the charges; it was his six-year-old brother. The same charges were immediately re-filed, but with the child listed. The defense team expressed shock at this statement, which meant the case (and defense preparations for it) had been proceeding for 18 months under faulty charges. Also, the prosecutor's admission meant that false testimony had been presented under oath at the pre-trial hearing. Lead counsel Alan Begner protested \\"How did a year and a half of statements based on one set of facts get changed at the last minute to another set of facts?\\" =New arraignment and additional delays= On May 19, 2006, a new arraignment was held, again charging the same two misdemeanors; this time both the six-year-old and nine-year-old boys were cited as victims. The CBLDF filed several procedural motions and motions to dismiss on May 30. The motions included allegations of prosecutorial misconduct in connection with what were now characterized as false allegations, as well as allegations of the District Attorney's office allowing untruthful testimony to be presented under oath, causing Lee and his defense counsel to incur unnecessary expense by requiring a change in trial date on too-short notice. Patterson said that her office had \\"been honest and above board throughout this case. We forwarded new information to the defense as quickly as we got it.\\"Motion: Law ‚Äòoverbroad‚Äô On June 2, 2006, prosecutors filed yet another new indictment, modifying the second misdemeanor charge. This marked the third time Lee had been formally charged for this one incident. Although new indictments were issued, the first two sets of charges were never formally dropped. The CBLDF team again filed motions, this time in response to all three sets of accusations, but they were all dismissed, including those alleging prosecutorial misconduct. The trial was postponed again on August 15, 2007, due to the illness of presiding Judge Larry Salmon.Gordon Lee comic book trial postponed =Mistrial= Opening statements in the new trial began on November 5, 2007, but quickly resulted in a mistrial. Prior to the opening statements, the defense requested that the judge bar prosecutors from commenting on Lee's previous conviction in 1994. However, the prosecution noted in opening statements that Lee told deputies during the 2004 incident he had \\"been through this before and beat it\\". The district attorney's office planned to bring the case back to Floyd Superior Court the following year. At this point, the CBLDF had spent over $80,000 on Lee's defense. =Case dismissed= On Friday, 18 April 2008, it was announced in author Neil Gaiman's blog that the case had been dismissed. Effects of the case The charges against Lee have unnerved many shop owners who are concerned about distributing materials that could result in similar charges. One store owner in Georgia stated that \\"We are a smaller community, very similar to the community that Gordon is in. We will special order [controversial comic Lost Girls] for anybody, but we will not have it out on display.\\" Later life and death Lee entered the news for unrelated reasons when he chased two women who have since been charged with stealing two puzzles based on the movie The Nightmare Before Christmas from his store. In an attempt to stop the women, Lee jumped on the hood of their car, and was thrown off, unhurt, after riding on the hood for a block. The women were later charged with shoplifting, and the driver was charged with aggravated assault.Comic book store owner chases 2 thieves Lee died on the afternoon of January 13, 2013, from complications stemming from a series of strokes.

He was involved in the Chu‚ÄìHan Contention ‚Äì a power struggle between the Han dynasty's founder, Liu Bang (Emperor Gao), and his rival, Xiang Yu ‚Äì as an ally of Liu Bang. In recognition of his contributions, Liu Bang granted Peng Yue the title \\"King of Liang\\" () after the Han dynasty was established. Life =Uprising= Peng Yue was a native of Changyi (present-day Jinxiang County, Shandong), and was originally a fisherman. Following the Dazexiang Uprising in 209 BC, Peng Yue was nominated by his fellows to be their leader and he led an uprising against the Qin dynasty. Initially, Peng Yue was reluctant to rebel, but obliged eventually and he arranged for his supporters to meet him the next morning. However, his men did not arrive on time and the last one came at noon. Peng Yue said, \\"Since everyone has chosen me to be the leader, there must be discipline. As there are too many people who were late today, I cannot possibly punish all of them. The last man to arrive will be executed.\\"Sima Qian. Records of the Grand Historian, Volume 90. =Chu-Han Contention= In 205 BC, Peng Yue allied with Liu Bang, the King of Han, and became one of Liu's generals after Liu promised to grant him land and the title of a vassal king. Earlier on, Peng Yue had refused to send his troops to help Liu Bang, that resulted in the latter's defeat by Xiang Yu at the Battle of Guling. Three years later, Peng Yue conquered more than 20 cities around Changyi and acquired a large amount of supplies. He then led his troops southwards and joined the armies of Han Xin and Liu Bang at the Battle of Gaixia against Xiang Yu. Peng Yue's contributed greatly to the eventual Han victory over Xiang Yu. After Liu Bang founded the Han dynasty, Peng Yue was conferred the title of \\"King of Liang\\" () and granted the lands of former Wei state as his kingdom.Ban Gu et al. Book of Han, Volume 34. =Death= In 196 BC, Liu Bang led an army to suppress a rebellion by Chen Xi, the Marquis of Yangxia, and he requested reinforcements from Peng Yue. Peng Yue claimed to be ill and sent his subordinates to help Liu Bang in place of himself. After Chen Xi's rebellion was quelled, Liu Bang heard rumours that Peng Yue was intending to rebel against him as well, and he had Peng arrested. Peng Yue was demoted to the status of a commoner and exiled to the remote Qingyi County (in present-day Ya'an, Sichuan). Along the way, Peng Yue encountered Empress L√º Zhi, who wanted to have him killed. He pleaded with her to spare his life and let him return home to Changyi, and the empress pretended to agree. Peng Yue was brought back to Luoyang where he was subsequently executed. Empress L√º ordered his clan be put to death as well. Peng Yue's corpse was minced into pieces, salted like meat, and distributed to all the noble families of China, who found this very disturbing.Sima Qian. Records of the Grand Historian, Volume 91.

According to tradition, he was from Pannonia and fled to the Adriatic coast to escape the persecution of Christians under Decius (ca. 250‚Äì51). His corpse was eventually thrown into a gorge near some hot springs (locally called acqua mala or acqua cattiva), near Pesaro.Santi Beati: San Terenzio vescovo e martire The place of his martyrdom was considered to be the area called the Apsella di Montelabbate, near the Abbey of San Tomaso in Foglia. This area contains sulphurous springs, and locally they are called the l'Acqua di S. Terenzio. An alternative traditionArcidiocesi di Pesaro makes him the first bishop of Pesaro, and a native of the city, rather than a Pannonian layman. Early representations of Terence depict him as an aging bishop.Musei Civici Pesaro However, later depictions show him as a young man in military dress, with the palm of martyrdom in one hand and a model of the city in the other, thus counting him amongst the \\"military saints.\\" Domani Festa del Patrono di Pesaro San Terenzio Giovanni Antonio Bellinzoni da Pesaro (ca. 1415 ‚Äì ca. 1477) depicts him this way. Veneration His body may have been buried by Bishop Florentius of Pesaro outside the city, close to Caprile, which ancient documents call the Valle di S. Terenzio. Another tradition states that his body was buried by a local woman named Theodosia. His relics were then translated to the basilica of San Decenzio (now the Chiesa del Cimitero centrale) before being translated in the sixth century to the new cathedral at Pesaro by Bishop Felix of Pesaro. The relics, placed initially in a crypt, were transferred by Giovanni Benedetti in 1447 to a large altar in which the relics were placed in a wooden urn, on which the aforementioned painter Bellinzoni depicted Terence. The urn is now found at the Museo Civico, in Palazzo Toschi-Mosca, and the relics themselves were translated to a new urn in a new cathedral chapel inaugurated in 1909, where the following inscription can be found: CIVITAS PISAURENSIS TUTELARI SUO A.D. MCMIX. As a soldier saint, Terence is considered to have appeared twice in times of crisis, the second vision occurring on 9 June 1793, in the times of the Cisalpine Republic, when Pesaro was besieged by French troops: a horseman appeared on the walls of the city, accompanied by a woman dispensing munitions. The vision terrified the French so much that they abandoned their siege. In gratitude, Terence was officially proclaimed patron of the city on 20 March 1802. Terenzio's most famous figuration in art is his minor appearance‚Äîas a young soldier saint‚Äîin a predella panel of Giovanni Bellini's \\"Pesaro Altarpiece\\", The Coronation of the Virgin (ca. 1475‚Äì80); in it Terenzio, as the city's patron, holds a model representing the Nuova Rocca, or Fortezza Costanzo, the citadel of Pesaro newly rebuilt by Costanzo Sforza.Everett P.

It is named after law professor William Francis Baxter Jr., who was an antitrust law professor at Stanford University. As Assistant Attorney General, he settled a seven-year-old case against AT&T; with by far the largest breakup in the history of the Sherman Antitrust Act, splitting AT&T; up into seven regional phone companies in 1982. Content Baxter's law theoretically is applied to a variety of other industries where incumbent, vertically integrated, regulated monopolies control both monopoly segments and potentially competitive segments. Each industry is constructed as a large network for transporting its fundamental product (information, telecommunication) between any two feasible points of origin and destination. Moreover, each network is conceptually separable into several basic functions and various levels of layers. From the perspectives of enterprises, a monopolist in a regulated industry may face a price cap, or a rate of return type pricing scheme. If this regulated industry serves as an input for another industry which is unregulated, the monopolist may wish to expand into this unregulated industry in order to increase overall profits. An economic theory referred to as ICE (Internalizing Complementary Externalities) suggests that when a monopolist seeks to expand their monopoly into other market levels, such an expansion is pro-competitive, because there is no reason for a monopolist to expand into an upstream or downstream market unless they are more efficient than competitors. This is because in a multi-level market, customers only gain a single final product, and are willing to pay only one \\"monopoly price\\" for this good. If a monopolist already owns one level of the market, then they can extract the entire monopoly price by increasing the prices on their level and expanding into other levels of the market since they are already getting the entire monopoly prices. To make it clearer, the total profits a monopolist can earn if it seeks to leverage its monopoly in one market by dominating a complementary market are theoretically no greater than the extra profits it could earn in an unregulated environment simple by charging more for the monopoly product itself. However, these measures which monopoly adopts to promote competition in complementary market might increase the total demands for the products through multi-level market. Baxter's Law is an exception to the ICE theory. Regulated monopolies have the incentive and opportunity to monopolize related markets in which their monopolized service is an input. Under Baxter's law, a monopolist in a regulated industry is unable to capture the entire monopoly price since their prices are regulated. This monopolist will then seek to use its monopoly on one level of the market to expand into another level of the market, one where price is unregulated. Whereas the ICE theory would normally find this acceptable, Baxter's law explains that the monopolist can use its monopoly position in one level to capture a monopoly in another level, and then capture the monopoly price in this other level of the market. While normal monopolists would suffer losses in their first monopoly level that would offset the gains in the new market level, a regulated monopolist will suffer smaller losses in their first monopoly level due to price regulation, but will still have full gains in the market level, and therefore will seek to expand their monopoly. Example *Baxter's law in Internet market: Baxter's law can be illustrated under the context of Internet market before the broadband age. As mentioned above, when the market for platform is subject to price and rate regulation, a monopoly of network provider holds strong incentives to monopolize an unregulated applications market (a downstream level market). For example, because the FCC have capped the price that telephone companies could charge consumers by using the telephone network circuit for Internet access, those companies are unable to extract monopoly profits from the platform. In other words, they are prohibited to increase charges and prices for the exclusive services which they provide in the market. As a result, these monopolies extend their business and service to unregulated markets. Comparing to rivals in these market, monopolies could offer lower, cost-based rates for the same service because of vertical integration. Therefore, the revenues earned in unregulated market can offset the loss due to regulation in monopoly market and increase overall profits.

Name In July 2014 the International Astronomical Union launched a process for giving proper names to certain exoplanets and their host stars.NameExoWorlds: An IAU Worldwide Contest to Name Exoplanets and their Host Stars.

The winning name was submitted by the Royal Netherlands Association for Meteorology and Astronomy of the Netherlands. It honors the astronomer Thomas Harriot.NameExoWorlds The Approved Names  Discovery  Radial velocity changes over time of 55 Cancri caused by the orbit of 55 Cancri f. The initial presentation of this planet occurred at a meeting of the American Astronomical Society in April 2005, however it was another two and a half years before the planet was to be published in a peer-reviewed journal. It is the first known planet outside our solar system to spend its entire orbit within what astronomers call the \\"habitable zone\\". Furthermore, its discovery made 55 Cancri the first star other than the Sun known to have at least five planets. Orbit and mass 55 Cnc f's orbit compared to the orbit of Venus (0.72AU). 55 Cancri f is located about 0.781 AU away from the star and takes 262 days to complete a full orbit. A limitation of the radial velocity method used to detect 55 Cancri f is that only a minimum mass can be obtained, in this case around 0.144 times that of Jupiter, or half the mass of Saturn. A Keplerian fit to the radial velocity data of 55 Cancri A indicates that the orbit is consistent with being circular, however changing the value in a range between 0 and 0.4 does not significantly alter the chi-squared statistic of the fit, thus a representative eccentricity of 0.2¬±0.2 was assumed. In a Newtonian model which takes interactions between the planets into account, the eccentricity comes out as 0.0002, almost perfectly circular. Astrometric observations made with the Hubble Space Telescope suggest that the outer planet 55 Cancri d is inclined at 53¬∞ with respect to the plane of the sky. The inner planets b and e are inclined at 85¬∞. The inclination of f is unknown.  Characteristics  Since the planet was detected indirectly through observations of its star, properties such as its radius, composition and temperature are unknown. With a mass half that of Saturn, 55 Cancri f is likely to be a gas giant with no solid surface. It orbits in the so-called \\"habitable zone,\\" which means that liquid water could exist on the surface of a possible moon. It is not known if the composition and appearance is more like that of Saturn or Neptune. Based on its temperature, it could be a Sudarsky Class II planet, covered in water clouds, or a Sudarsky Class III with no clouds and a dark azure color.

She concluded that a foreign language adds to the learning process and seems to improve results.Results look better in English, Times Education Supplement, 9 January 2004 According to J√§ppinen, \\"When pupils have to conceptualise and grasp issues in a foreign language as well as their mother tongue, it will help develop an ability to understand complex and multifaceted relationships between various themes.\\" The Finnish research used pupils who were studying three different languages (French, Swedish and English) and found that \\"the choice of (Second) language did not seem to have a major impact on performance\\" in a number of subjects including maths and geography. As the school notes, this conclusion is not universal to other previous studies. Studies at Luton University have shown that there can be a \\"trivial\\" delay in language development but the overall benefits in the long run outweigh this temporary disadvantage.\\"Two languages are better than one\\", The Guardian, 3 March 2004 See also * Bilingual education * Gaelic medium education - Scottish Gaelic medium education * Gaelscoil - Irish medium education * Language nest References External links * Official site Category:Schools in the Isle of Man Category:Educational institutions established in 2001 Category:Manx language Category:Celtic medium education Category:Minority schools ","title":"Bunscoill Ghaelgagh"},{"id":"14109425","text":"This article is about the particular significance of the year 1815 to Wales and its people.

His most recent book, Ali: A Life, is a biography of Muhammad Ali. Biography Eig was born in Brooklyn, New York and grew up in Monsey, New York. His father was an accountant and his mother was a stay-at-home mom and community activist. Eig began working for his hometown newspaper when he was 16. He attended Northwestern University's Medill School of Journalism, graduating in 1986 with a bachelor's degree. After college he worked as a news reporter for the New Orleans Times-Picayune, The Dallas Morning News, Chicago magazine, and The Wall Street Journal. Eig has taught writing at Columbia College Chicago and lectures at Northwestern. He has written as a freelancer for many outlets, including The New York Times, Washington Post, and online edition of The New Yorker. He is married to Jennifer Tescher and has three children. He lives in Chicago. Eig appeared on The Daily Show with Jon Stewart in May 2010. He has appeared in two PBS documentaries‚ÄîProhibition and Jackie Robinson‚Äîmade by Ken Burns and Florentine Films. He is currently working with Burns as a consulting producer on a documentary about Muhammad Ali. In 2016, Eig appeared on AMC's The Making of the Mob: Chicago, talking about Al Capone.  Reception  In 2019 Men's Health magazine named Eig's book \\"Ali: A Life\\" the tenth best sports book of all time. In 2020, Esquire magazine called \\"Ali\\" one of the 35 best sports books ever written. Eig's first book was Luckiest Man: The Life and Death of Lou Gehrig (2005). Opening Day: The Story of Jackie Robinson's First Season was his second book. For his third book, Get Capone, Eig discovered thousands of pages of never-before-reported government documents on the government's case against Capone. The Birth of the Pill (2014), Eig's fourth book, told the story of the renegades who invented the first oral contraceptive. In a 2017 review of Ali: A Life, Joyce Carol Oates, writing for The New York Times, said: \\"This richly researched, sympathetic yet unsparing portrait of a controversial figure for whom the personal and the political dramatically fused could not come at a more appropriate time in our beleaguered American history‚Ä¶.

Nine sequels followed, all starring Baxter.\\"The Crime Doctor\\" (notes) on TCM.com These later movies were more conventional mysteries than the original film, with the main character working as a psychiatrist to rehabilitate lawbreakers while also solving crimes as an amateur sleuth.

He died two years after the final \\"Crime Doctor\\" movie.Arnold, Jeremy \\"The Crime Doctor\\" on TCM.com Plot During the Great Depression, a man (Warner Baxter) is thrown out of a speeding car. When he regains consciousness in a hospital, he has amnesia. He is visited by a man who accuses him of faking his condition. The stranger calls the patient Phil and demands to know what happened to a valise, then runs away when Phil summons a nurse for help. When the man recovers, he takes the name Robert Ordway, after a hospital benefactor. Ordway's doctor, John Carey (Ray Collins), wants to continue treating him and offers lodging in his house. All attempts to discover his identity fail, so Ordway decides to learn all he can about his condition. After ten years, he has become a successful psychiatrist, in partnership with Carey. Ordway begins treating prison inmates. He is so successful, he is named head of the state parole board. While on a date in a nightclub with social worker Grace Fielding (Margaret Lindsay), he is recognized by two men from his past: Joe Dylan (Harold Huber) and Nick Ferris (Don Costello). They and a third man, Emilio Caspari (John Litel), are unsure if he is their partner in crime. They convince convict Pearl Adams (an uncredited Dorothy Tree), their associate's ex-girlfriend, to apply for parole. At her hearing, she calls Ordway \\"Dr. Morgan\\". Ordway badgers her until she reveals that he is Phil Morgan, the mastermind of a $200,000 payroll robbery from which the money was never recovered. To trigger his memory, he contacts the three men and reenacts the events of the day he lost his memory. Tempers flare and the men fight. During the struggle, Ordway is struck on the head and remembers his past. He also acquires the gun. He calls the police and has the gang arrested. Insisting on being tried for the robbery, Morgan admits his wrongdoing, but takes pride in his accomplishments since. The jury finds him guilty, but recommends clemency.

The 1897 Richardsonian Romanesque building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982 for having state-level significance in the themes of architecture and politics/government. It was nominated for being the home of the county's government and for the role that achieving county seat status had on the development of the city. Description The courthouse from the east The Waseca County Courthouse is a two-story building of Kasota limestone and buff- colored brick, with a large bell- and clock-tower. It was designed by Minneapolis architects Orff and Joralemon and constructed by J. D. Carroll of St. Paul Park for $55,833. It features polished granite columns supporting triple arches at the entrance. The interior is decorated with wainscoting, oak woodwork, tiled fireplaces, etched glass, paneled doors, and marble flooring. History The construction of the Waseca County Courthouse embodies a surge of effort to relocate the county's seat of government. With Waseca County's organization in 1857, Wilton had been given county seat status. A decade later, however, the Winona and St. Peter Railroad opted to route their tracks north of Wilton through the unassuming town of Waseca. Efforts to move the county seat to the suddenly booming town culminated in a popular vote during the 1870 election. The proposal passed and the county's records and courthouse furniture were moved that very night to a new facility in Waseca, which opened for business the following day. This facility was replaced by the current courthouse in 1897.

Founded in 1921, it is considered the oldest festival for contemporary classical music in the world, and among the best-known and most prestigious. History In 1913, the Donaueschingen Society of Friends of Music was founded under the auspices of the House of Fuerstenberg. The idea soon arose to establish a small festival for presenting young and promising artists. A committee of distinguished musicians, among them Ferruccio Busoni, Joseph Haas, Hans Pfitzner, Arthur Nikisch and Richard Strauss, met in 1921 to discuss possible formats for the event. The first concert was presented just a few months later. On 31 July 1921 the Donaueschingen Chamber Music Performances for the advancement of contemporary music gave world premiere performances of music by Alois H√°ba, Ernst Krenek and Paul Hindemith. Three years later, guest composers included Arnold Schoenberg, Anton Webern, and Josef Matthias Hauer, who were among the main representatives of the Viennese twelve-tone technique. In 1925, the festival's scope expanded from presenting only chamber music to include choral works; one year later, the offerings included music for wind orchestra. With experimental forms of music and art such as Oskar Schlemmer's 'Triadic Ballet', the festival encompassed an increasingly wide range of activities and became more and more attractive to avant-garde composers and performers alike. In 1927, the festival relocated to Baden-Baden. During the years 1931‚Äì1933, 1935, 1940‚Äì1945, and 1948‚Äì1949, all concerts were cancelled due to the overall national and international political situation. Instead of the original chamber music series, the National-Socialist party organized its own concerts from 1933 to 1935, called 'Donaueschingen Musical Celebration' or 'Old and new chamber-music from the Swabian-Alemannic region'. After the war, the Society of Friends of Music was able to re-establish the festival under the name Donaueschingen Festival of Contemporary Music. A cooperative agreement between the S√ºdwestfunk in Baden- Baden and its orchestra shifted the program emphasis to larger orchestral works. In 1951, Olivier Messiaen and his student Pierre Boulez offered new compositions, along with older works by Hindemith and B√©la Bart√≥k. In 1972, the Karl Sczuka Prize for H√∂rspiel (radio play) was awarded for the first time during the festival. Since 1993, every festival has its own theme. In 1998, South-West German Radio Baden-Baden became successor of S√ºdwestfunk. The 2020 Donaueschingen Festival was canceled on short notice due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Criminal Phil Morgan suffers amnesia and becomes criminal psychologist Dr. Ordway. He uses his expertise to solve crimes as well as to help patients. The character was the hero of the CBS radio program Crime Doctor on Sunday nights between 1940 and 1947. Dr. Benjamin Ordway was played by Ray Collins, House Jameson, Brian Donlevy, Hugh Marlowe, Everett Sloane and John McIntire. Columbia Pictures Corporation made a series of 10 low-budget \\"Crime Doctor\\" mysteries from 1943 through 1949. In them, Dr. Robert Ordway was played exclusively by Warner Baxter. In the first film, as an in-joke, Collins played the supporting role of Dr. John Carey, the Crime Doctor's doctor. Baxter was in poor health much of the time while working on the series, and two years after making the tenth film, he died of pneumonia. In March 2014, the \\"Crime Doctor\\" film series was shown on GetTV, an American digital multicast television network owned by Sony Pictures Entertainment.

It is particularly popular in part because of Hanna's mainstream name recognition as an animal expert, but also because the show meets programming criteria for federally mandated educational and informational requirements which all stations must follow.

In 2007, Bindeez was subject to a multi- national product recall after it was found that the Wangqi Product Factory in Shenzhen, China had, in some shipped toys, used a cheap chemical that was a pharmacologically active sedative prodrug instead of the safer chemical specified by the designers, resulting in the illness and hospitalization of some children who ingested the beads.China reveals producer name of toxic bead toy China News Agency, 11 November 2007. Since then, safer replacements have been marketed.  Description  Some Bindeez designs Bindeez contains a craft kit that allows children to create various multi-dimensional designs using small colored beads. \\"Bindeez\\" can refer to either the toy itself or the small beads. The beads are arranged into various designs on a plastic tray. When the beads are sprayed with water, their surfaces become adhesive and they fuse together. The beads are then left to dry and the whole design becomes fixed and can be removed from the tray.Bindeez instruction manual, Moose Toys 2006 The beads are approximately five millimeters in diameter and come in a wide range of colours. Bindeez are available in various different kits with accessories such as a drying fan, applicator pen, design templates for the beads, and water spray bottles. The product is labelled for ages four and above. 2007 recall The Aqua Dots Design Studio. Part of a range of Bindeez products Bindeez were first withdrawn from the Australian market, and subsequently from the North American market by the United States Consumer Product Safety Commission as well as European markets in early November 2007. They were recalled in Australia after a two-year-old boy and a 10-year-old girl became seriously ill after they swallowed large numbers of the beads and the connection between the illness and the product was discovered by a doctor at The Children's Hospital at Westmead, Sydney. Two children in North America became unconscious after similar ingestion. U.S. safety officials recalled about 4.2 million of the toys. The toy was supposed to contain the non-toxic plasticiser 1,5-pentanediol, but instead contained toxic 1,4-butanediol, which is metabolised into the sedative-hypnotic drug gamma-hydroxybutyric acid. At the time the substitution was discovered, the non-toxic ingredient was three to seven times more expensive than the toxic one. The affected children had seizure-like activity, which is an occasional side-effect of severe GHB overdose. Concern has been raised in the press that people may intentionally eat the beads in order to get high, potentially spawning a black market in the recalled toy.Theage.com.au (9 November 2007), 'Bizarre' Bindeez scare prompts warnings. Retrieved on 2007-11-13. The Australian distributor has claimed that the medical emergencies \\"did not result in any long-term effects.\\" The issue was the topic of the second episode of the third season of Elementary, a Sherlock Holmes remake that aired on 6 November 2014. The episode was entitled \\"The Five Orange Pipz\\". The murderer was attempting to market the beads after they would be released from evidence. A similar Japanese product, Aquabeads, which was developed in Japan by Epoch Co. Ltd, and is produced by a different Chinese manufacturer, has not been recalled and is uncontaminated. In Australia, replacement beads were available from March 2008 onwards, based on the interim ban being lifted. The replacement beads will be manufactured using only approved ingredients. To discourage ingestion, the replacement beads will also be coated with the bitter-tasting substance known as Bitrex.States of Jersey (12 November 2007), Bindeez Beads Recall. Retrieved on 2007-11-12. The name of the product was also changed from Bindeez to Beados in an attempt to extinguish the link between the recall of the old toy and the new toy.

As of the 2003 census, the population in the Skull Valley Elementary School District was 525 people. Historical significance Although official records do not indicate this, area settlers recall that a school was established in 1878. The school had been formally established by the early 1900s, when it offered education to children in all of the grades. The two-room schoolhouse structure, built in 1925, still stands on the school grounds. Despite extensive consolidations over time in Yavapai County, Arizona, Skull Valley still has a school. The new/current elementary school building sits on the same land, next to the historical schoolhouse. Students above the 6th grade are bused to Prescott to attend middle and high school.

He is the uncle of heavy metal music personality and lawyer Eric Greif.  Background  Son of an immigrant Harlem grocery store owner, Martin Greif graduated from Stuyvesant High School and was further educated at Hunter College, NYC, graduating in 1959 (B.A. cum laude) and Princeton University, graduating in 1961 (M.A. with honours), where he was a Woodrow Wilson Fellow and groomed as an expert in Daniel Defoe. After graduation he became a professor of English and taught in NY universities from 1963‚Äì73, including lecturing in biblical literature at New York University,Theology Today before entering the world of publishing as managing editor of Time-Life Books (1969‚Äì73), and then as co-founder and editorial director of Main Street Press. Main Street Press was founded in 1978 by Greif and his life partner, Lawrence Grow, in Clinton, New Jersey. Their first office was on Main Street in Clinton, hence the name. Both men had enjoyed successful publishing careers in Manhattan but wanted to move to the country for the wide, open spaces and the lower costs. Subsequently the business moved to nearby Pittstown, New Jersey. Main Street specialized in publishing books on Americana, crafts and restoration. However, their biggest publishing success was the Vogue magazine spoof Dogue (1986), featuring modeling canines and billed as \\"a parody of the world's most famous fashion magazine\\".  American career  Martin Greif's popular book, \\"The Gay Book of Days\\" (1982) Martin Greif became a prolific and varied author and book editor. His more than a dozen books range from Depression Modern: The Thirties Style in America (1975), a photo study of 1930s American design, predominantly architecture, that sought to define a wider, more American definition of Art Deco; Aunt Sammy's Radio Recipes (1975); The New Industrial Landscape: The Story of the Austin Company (1978); The Morning Stars Sang: The Bible in Folk Art (1978); The Airport Book: From Landing Field to Modern Terminal (1979); The Lighting Book: A Buyer's Guide to Locating Almost Every Kind of Lighting Device (1986); and The World of Tomorrow: The 1939 New York World's Fair (1988). The book for which he is best remembered, however, is The Gay Book of Days (1982) - \\"An evocatively illustrated who's who of who is, was, may have been, probably was, and almost certainly seems to have been gay during the past 5,000 years.\\" The Gay Book of Days was a gossipy, witty and lighthearted attempt to catalogue as many famous, and not so famous, gay men and lesbians as possible throughout history, ranging from Roman emperors, European kings and queens, famous writers and literary figures to the stars of Hollywood and television. For all its supposed frivolity, it was an important work at a time when the gay community was growing in confidence and visibility and was about to be struck unawares by the AIDS epidemic. Tellingly for the time, the book ends with a list headed \\"I Know They Are, You Know They Are, and They Know They Are, but Initials Will Just Have to Do\\", betraying the reality of the closet in those less open times. Greif and Grow also wrote a few books using different, sometimes female, nom de plumes - Jean Bach, Frederick S. Copely, Martin Lawrence and Leona Wesley Hunter.  Irish years  \\"Celtic Tales of Terror\\" (1997), one of several Irish-themed works for Sterling Publishing (written as Mairtin O'Griofa), that came out after Greif's death Greif was often asked to write an updated version of the Book of Days, to which he gave considerable thought during the 1990s, but he never got beyond the planning stages. Martin Greif and Larry Grow spent their latter years in Ballinadee, County Cork, Ireland, where they set up Orchard Hill Press in a deal with Sterling Publishing of NYC. Greif's last works were several books on chess and puzzles, and Irish-themed titles written as Mairtin O'Griofa. Grow died of a stroke associated with AIDS in 1991. Greif died of an AIDS-related illness in November 1996 at Cork University Hospital. Greif's nephew is Eric Greif, a lawyer and entertainment personality known first for a management career within the heavy metal musical genre in the 1980s and later within the legal profession.

On February 27, 1984, it was added to the National Register of Historic Places. History The first Episcopal service in the vicinity of Saugatuck was conducted by Reverend J. Rice Taylor in 1862. The Saugatuck Episcopal congregation was officially organized in 1868. Taylor, who had been assigned to the parish in Holland, Michigan, acted as a missionary minister. The congregation immediately began planning for a church building, and in 1871 purchased the lot that this church sits on. Rev. Taylor was instrumental in raising funds for the church, both within and outside of the parish. (note: large pdf file) The congregation hired Detroit architect Gordon W. Lloyd to design the new church, and local workmen George Harnes, George E. Dunn, and William Dunning to construct it. Construction began in 1872, and although the church was not yet complete, the first service was held in January 1873. The church was substantially completed by the end of 1874. However, the building was poorly outfitted, and over the next few years, funds were raised to install stained glass windows, carpets, a reed organ, lamps, and seats. Saugatuck's fortunes declined over the next few decades, as lumbering slowed and the population fell. By 1892, the church entered a period of disuse, lacking a priest and it was vandalized. However, by 1907, Saugatuck had become a popular summering spot, and the church became renewed, regaining a priest. Regular services were once again held in the church, and its infrastructure upgraded The church continues to be used by the Episcopal congregation. Description All Saints Episcopal Church is a board-and- batten Gothic Revival structure with a gable roof and tower located on one corner containing the main entrance. The facades have lancet windows. The interior has pine flooring and a vertical-board, beaded wainscoting. The ceiling is constructed against the underside of the roof, and supported by exposed wooden trusses. The nave has a center aisle with pews on each side.

The museum has catalogued approximately 1,200 items to its collection. Over 600 are on display, including over 300 sculptural pieces, ancestor poles, shields, and drums. Later, upon retiring to his native St. Cloud, MN, US area, Bishop emeritus Sowada was also instrumental in founding a second Asmat museum, the American Museum of Asmat Art which opened in 1995 at the University of St. Thomas in St. Paul, Minnesota, where it also appears under the acronyms AMAA and AMAA@UST. The director of the Asmat Museum of Culture and Progress, as of 2007, has been Eric Sarkol with John Ohoiwirin as assistant. Building upon a 1968‚Äì1974 United Nations funded Asmat wood carving project, the museum hosts an annual woodcarving competition and auction. The 31st Asmat Culture Festival sponsored by the Museum was scheduled for 8‚Äì13 October 2015.

He then became a poet, and in middle age a clergyman of the Church of England. London life Browne contributed poems to The Gentleman's Magazine, winning several prizes from its founder. Moses Browne married Ann Wibourne in 1738 in Clerkenwell. Moses and Ann had at least 11 children ‚Äì some records indicate up to 13. Church appointments Browne found success as a devotional writer, and on the instigation of the evangelical writer James Hervey, was ordained in 1753. He was then appointed Vicar of Olney, Buckinghamshire in 1753. In 1764, Browne took the additional post of Chaplain at Morden College in Blackheath, London, one reason being that his Olney post could not sustain such a large family. However, he remained a pluralist Vicar of Olney at the same time as Vicar of Sutton (probably Long Sutton, Lincolnshire) until his death in 1787.Alexander Chalmers, in General Biographical Dictionary (1812-17) 7:131-32.

Schauer joined the Army from Scobey, Montana, and by May 23, 1944 was serving as a private first class in the 15th Infantry Regiment, 3rd Infantry Division. On that day, near Cisterna di Littoria, Italy, he single-handedly killed five German snipers and disabled two machine gun emplacements. The next day he destroyed a third German machine gun nest. He was subsequently promoted to technical sergeant and, on October 27, 1944, awarded the Medal of Honor. Schauer died at age 78 and was buried in Salem, Oregon's City View Cemetery. Medal of Honor citation Schauer's official Medal of Honor citation reads: > For conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at risk of life above and beyond > the call of duty. On May 23, 1944, at 12 noon, Pfc. (now T/Sgt.) Schauer > left the cover of a ditch to engage 4 German snipers who opened fire on the > patrol from its rear. Standing erect he walked deliberately 30 yards toward > the enemy, stopped amid the fire from 4 rifles centered on him, and with 4 > bursts from his BAR, each at a different range, killed all of the snipers. > Catching sight of a fifth sniper waiting for the patrol behind a house > chimney, Pfc. Schauer brought him down with another burst. Shortly after, > when a heavy enemy artillery concentration and 2 machineguns temporarily > halted the patrol, Pfc. Schauer again left cover to engage the enemy weapons > single-handed.

Schauer knelt, killed the 2 gunners of the machinegun only 60 > yards from him with a single burst from his BAR, and crumpled 2 other enemy > soldiers who ran to man the gun. Inserting a fresh magazine in his BAR, Pfc. > Schauer shifted his body to fire at the other weapon 500 yards distant and > emptied his weapon into the enemy crew, killing all 4 Germans. Next morning, > when shells from a German Mark VI tank and a machinegun only 100 yards > distant again forced the patrol to seek cover, Pfc. Schauer crawled toward > the enemy machinegun. stood upright only 80 yards from the weapon as its > bullets cut the surrounding ground, and 4 tank shells fired directly at him > burst within 20 yards. Raising his BAR to his shoulder, Pfc. Schauer killed > the 4 members of the German machinegun crew with 1 burst of fire.

The title character retells adventures ranging from shrimp boating and ping pong championships, to thinking about his childhood love, as he bumbles his way through American history, with everything from the Vietnam War to college football becoming part of the story. Gump is portrayed as viewing the world simply and truthfully. He does not know what he wants to do in life, but despite his low IQ, he is made out to be full of wisdom. He says that he \\"can think things pretty good\\", but when he tries \\"sayin or writin them, it kinda come out like Jello\\". His mathematical abilities, as an idiot savant, and feats of strength lead him into all kinds of adventures. Plot Forrest Gump, named after General Nathan Bedford Forrest, narrates the story of his life. The author uses misspellings and grammatical errors to indicate his Southern accent, education, and cognitive disabilities. While living in Mobile, Alabama, Forrest meets Jenny Curran in first grade and walks her home. They then became the best of friends. By the time Forrest is sixteen years old, he is 6' 6\\" (1.98 m), 242 pounds (110 kg), and plays high school football. Miss Henderson, with whom Forrest is infatuated, gives him reading lessons. He reads Mark Twain's The Adventures of Tom Sawyer and two other books that he does not remember. While he enjoys the books, he does not do well on tests. He gains popularity as a football player, making the All State team. When Forrest is called to the principal's office, he meets Bear Bryant, who asks if he'd considered playing college football. After high school, Forrest takes a test at a local army recruitment center, and is told he is \\"Temporarily Deferred.\\" Forrest and Jenny meet again in college. They go to see Bonnie and Clyde, and play together in a folk music band at the Student Union, covering songs by Joan Baez, Bob Dylan, and Peter, Paul and Mary. Forrest flunks out of the University of Alabama after one semester. He and his friend Bubba join the Army, but Bubba dies in the Vietnam War. He meets Lieutenant Dan, who has lost his legs, in the infirmary. He also plays in a ping-pong championship in China. He then works for NASA as an astronaut with a major and an orangutan, after he gets in trouble for participating in an anti-war protest in Washington. Forrest also has brief careers as a chess champion, a stunt man with a naked Raquel Welch in Hollywood, and as a professional wrestler called \\"The Dunce\\". There comes a point where Forrest finds a Vietnamese man during his time in Vietnam and figures out that he can breed shrimp in a simple pond or lagoon. All he needs to do is gather shrimp and put them in a mass of water, throw feed into a pond and let nature take its course. He eventually ends up with a shrimp business with a name honoring Bubba. He gives away the company to Bubba's family and workers and decides to go his own way, frustrated with the complications it added to his once simple life. At the end of the book, Forrest ends up with Dan and a male orangutan named \\"Sue\\" living life by being a one-man band, begging for change, while sleeping on a green bench. Film adaptation The novel was adapted into a feature-length film by Paramount Pictures in 1994. Before being made into an Academy Award winning movie, the novel sold an estimated 30,000 copies. The movie does not mention Forrest's being an idiot savant, and sanitizes his sex life and the character's profanity. According to the author, the movie \\"took some of the rough edges off\\" Forrest, whom he envisioned being played by John Goodman. The movie takes great advantage of special effects to have the characters interact with real people from history. It omits his time with NASA and some of his other careers, as well as his time with the cannibals and the ape named Sue.

Early life He was born at Boothstown, Salford, the son of cotton-mill manager Thomas Doodson. He was educated at Rochdale secondary school and then in 1908 entered the University of Liverpool, graduating in both chemistry (1911) and mathematics (1912). He was profoundly deaf and found it difficult to get a job but started with Ferranti in Manchester as a meter tester. WWI During World War I he worked on the calculation of shell trajectories. Career in Oceanography In 1919 he moved to Liverpool to work on tidal analysis and became in 1929 the Associate Director of Liverpool Observatory and Tidal Institute. He then spent much of his life developing the analysis of tidal motions mainly in the oceans but also in lakes, and was the first to devise methods for shallow water as in estuaries. Tide height and current tables are of great importance to navigators, but the detailed motions are complex. The thorough analysis at which he excelled became the international standard for the study of tides and the production of tables through the method of determination of Harmonic Elements by Least-Square fitting to data observed at each place of interest. That is, by proper association of the astronomical phases, observations made at one time can enable predictions decades away with different astronomical phases. Doodson published a major work on tidal analysis in 1921. This was the first development of the tide generating potential (TGP) to be carried out in harmonic form: Doodson distinguished 388 tidal frequencies.S Casotto, F Biscani, \\"A fully analytical approach to the harmonic development of the tide- generating potential accounting for precession, nutation, and perturbations due to figure and planetary terms\\", AAS Division on Dynamical Astronomy, April 2004, vol.36(2), 67. Doodson's analysis of 1921 was based on the then-latest lunar theory of E W Brown.D E Cartwright, \\"Tides: a scientific history\\", Cambridge University Press 2001, at pages 163-4. Doodson devised a practical system for specifying the different harmonic components of the tide-generating potential, see below for the Doodson Numbers. Doodson also became involved in the design of tide-predicting machines, of which a widely used example was the \\"Doodson-L√©g√© TPM\\".See also the account of the Doodson-L√©g√© TPM at the National Oceanography Centre . Among other works, Doodson was co-author, with H.D. Warburg of the \\"Admiralty Manual of Tides\\". Further biographical information is available from the National Oceanography Centre,National Oceanography Centre website. whose Liverpool facility was formerly the Liverpool Observatory and Tidal Institute, part of the UK Natural Environment Research Council, of which Doodson became director.Proudman Oceanographic Laboratory (history section); biography of Dr A T Doodson . WWII In 1944, as the Allies prepared the invasion of Nazi-occupied France, they wanted to land at first light when it was low tide, so hidden obstacles could be seen. Doodson was enlisted to work out the tidal patterns using his mechanised calculators. His calculations revealed that 5‚Äì7 June would provide the best combination of full moon and ideal tidal conditions and D-Day duly took place on 6 June 1944.'D-Day Has Come', BBC Awards and Achievements In May, 1933 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society His nomination reads Death Doodson died at Birkenhead on 10 January 1968 and was buried at Flaybrick Hill Cemetery. He had married twice. He married firstly in 1919 Margaret, daughter of J. W. Galloway, a tramways engineer of Halifax with whom he had a daughter, who died in 1936, and a son, whose mother died shortly after his birth in 1931. He married secondly in 1933 Elsie May, daughter of W. A. Carey, who survived him.

Schaefer joined the Army from Long Island, New York in January 1942,WWII Army Enlistment Records and by September 24, 1944 was serving as a Staff Sergeant in Company I, 18th Infantry Regiment, 1st Infantry Division. On that day, near Stolberg, Germany, Schaefer led his squad in their defense against a German attack. He voluntarily took the most dangerous defensive position, killed many of the attacking soldiers, and single-handedly captured ten. He then participated in the American counter-attack and freed a group of American soldiers captured earlier. For his actions during the battle, he was awarded the Medal of Honor eleven months later, on August 22, 1945. Schaefer later served in the Korean War. He died at age 68 and was buried at Long Island National Cemetery, Farmingdale, New York. Medal of Honor citation Schaefer's official Medal of Honor citation reads: > He was in charge of a squad of the 2d Platoon in the vicinity of Stolberg, > Germany, early in the morning of 24 September 1944, when 2 enemy companies > supported by machineguns launched an attack to seize control of an important > crossroads which was defended by his platoon.

Biography He was born on July 30, 1877 to Walter Samuel Carpenter and Bedde Morgan. Known as \\"Ruly\\", Carpenter was educated at the Hillman Academy in his hometown of Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, and at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He worked in his family's hardware store before joining DuPont as a district purchasing agent in 1906. He married Margaretta Lammot du Pont, the sister of company president Pierre S. du Pont, on December 18, 1906. They had a son, Robert Ruliph Morgan Carpenter, Jr. He began working under another brother, Ir√©n√©e du Pont in the development department, of which he was named director in 1911. Carpenter was instrumental in guiding the company's diversification outside the explosives industry, being appointed to the executive committee and serving on the board of directors from 1914 until his death in 1949. During his tenure, he held positions including head of personnel and vice president. His younger brother, Walter S. Carpenter, Jr., was President of DuPont from 1940 to 1948. In 1940, Carpenter joined the board of trustees of the University of Delaware, and was a major catalyst for the development of its athletic program, personally funding the construction of a new gymnasium. In 1943, he purchased the Philadelphia Phillies of the National League. He left day-to-day control in the hands of his son, R. R. M.

The name Bubbles & Cheesecake referred to Willis' and Palmer's respective alter-egos. They jointly published music, videos, art work, animation merchandise, online characters, stories and games online. History Bubbles & Cheesecake grew out of the songwriting partnership of Willis and Palmer, who were originally introduced in 2001 by music publisher Marla McNally. At first they came together to compose songs for Palmer's third solo album, I Confess. Their collaboration was interrupted when Willis left to co-write the music and lyrics for the Broadway production of The Color Purple. During that time, Palmer formed her own independent record label, Bombshell Records, and released \\"I Confess\\" in 2004. She also went on the road singing with the Gnarls Barkley live band. In the 1990s, Willis developed willisville, an evolving prototype for the first sonic and visual interactive social network online. This merging of narrative frameworks and multiple technologies and platforms into a single cohesive environment was written up by Fortune', The Wall Street Journal, and The New York Times. It now serves as the archetype for Bubbles & Cheesecake. The website features artwork by Bubbles the artist, Willis' alter ego. The idea of creative collaboration with an alter ego began when Willis started painting and making ceramics as Bubbles the artist in 1999. At the time, Willis told people that she had stumbled across Bubbles online and that she had decided to manage her career. The initial spin was that Bubbles was a \\"bad\\" artist and Willis' most significant discovery since the musical Del Rubio Triplets, but in reality, Bubbles ultimately sold close to 1,000 paintings and ceramic pieces to collectors including Lily Tomlin and Tracey Ullman. In May, 1999, The New York Times reported that \\"Bubbles the artist is Ms. Willis herself.\\" Although most people who collected Bubbles were in on the joke, Willis continued to deny her dual identity. Palmer had recently been given the nickname \\"MC Cheesecake\\" by her husband while she was rhyming about food in the car one day. Palmer came up with the idea that Cheesecake should become Bubbles' prot√©g√©, paralleling her relationship as Willis'. In 2006, the two resumed composing together at the multi-media studio at Willis' Los Angeles-area home, an art deco house known as \\"Willis Wonderland.\\" They originally intended to write songs for what would be Palmer's fourth solo album, Songs For Tuesday. Released in 2007, Songs For Tuesday features the Willis-Palmer co-write \\"Girl In Lust,\\" which, like \\"I Confess\\" from Holly's previous album, also was later recorded and performed by Bubbles & Cheesecake. Instead of continuing to work on Palmer's solo album, however, Willis and Palmer were inspired to write, perform, and record together in full collaboration under the name Bubbles & Cheesecake. Their first official single and video as Bubbles & Cheesecake is It's A Woman Thang, which was introduced with the launch of their website in October 2007. Allee Willis died in Los Angeles on December 24, 2019, at the age of 72. The cause of death was cardiac arrest.

Hanoch ben Moses (Hebrew: ◊®◊ë◊†◊ï ◊ó◊†◊ï◊ö ◊ë\\"◊® ◊û◊©◊î) (d. 1014 CE or 1024 CE) was a Spanish rabbi. Almost all of the information we have about him comes from the Sefer ha-Qabbalah by R. Abraham ibn Daud.Hebrew text online at Daat. Along with his parents, R. Moses ben Hanoch and his wife (name unknown), R. Hanoch was captured by the Moorish pirate Ibn Rumahis and brought to Cordova. R. Hanoch eventually succeeded his father as rabbi and Rosh Yeshivah there, although for a time he faced opposition by R. Joseph ibn Abitur and by the latter's patron, Yaakov ibn Jo, the lay leader of the Jewish community of the Caliphate of Cordoba. So highly respected was R. Hanoch by everyone that even his bitter adversary Ibn Abitur (who has been exiled because of the ban issued by R. Hanoch on the latter) couldn't help but express his admiration for him, \\"I bring the heavens and earth as my witnesses that there is none equal to R. Hanoch, from Spain to the academies of Babylon.\\"The Rishonim, The Artscroll history series, p. 55 His best-known student was R. Shmuel ha-Nagid. Ibn Daud reports that relations between R. Hanoch and R. Hai Gaon were strained, since the increasing stature of the Spanish yeshivot led to a lessening of their communities' financial contributions to the Talmudic Academies in Babylonia. Indeed, R. Hanoch seems to have corresponded only rarely with the Babylonian Geonim. However, R. Hai demonstrated his respect for R. Hanoch, by honoring his excommunication of Ibn Abitur and refusing the latter an audience. R. Hanoch left no written works, although there are some extant responsa between him and Rav Hai Gaon, as well as between him and the then-Gaon in the Land of Israel, Rav Shmuel ha-Kohen. He died of injuries following a fall, when the bimah in the Cordova synagogue collapsed on Simchat Torah. Ibn Daud dates this incident to 4775 (1014 CE), but also states that it was thirteen years before the death of Rav Hai Gaon in 4798, so that the correct reading should be 4785 (1024 CE).

The company is also known colloquially as \\"Chelsea Sugar\\", taking reference from the company's branded sugar \\"Chelsea\\", and the site is also colloquially known as the \\"Chelsea Sugar Refinery\\", or \\"sugar works\\". The refinery was established in 1884, and remains New Zealand's main source of sugar products (for both home use and for the food and beverage industry). This position remained even after New Zealand's deregulation opened the markets in the 1980s to foreign competition, and products are also exported overseas. The refinery also has one of Auckland's deepwater ports, with handysize ships importing raw sugar globally every six weeks. History Throughout most of the 19th century, all sugar products in New Zealand had to be imported; wishing to improve New Zealand's self-sufficiency, in 1882 the government offered a bounty to the first company to produce sugar locally. Already interested in business prospects in New Zealand, the Australian Colonial Sugar Refining Company had investigated possible sites in New Zealand and purchased of farm land in Birkenhead. This was later expanded to . The site was ideal for a refinery: the Waitemata offered deep water close to shore for a port, and fresh water from Duck Creek, which ran through the estate, and land and timber for building purposes were plentiful.Luke, p 9Howell, p 17 The name \\"Chelsea\\" was bestowed on the site by the refinery's first customs officer, who named it after Chelsea in England, his hometown.Chelsea website: History =New Zealand Sugar Company established= The \\"New Zealand Sugar Company\\" was formed in June 1883 by the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, the Victorian Sugar Company, and a number of prominent Auckland businessmen, including Sir Frederick Whitaker, Allan Kerr Taylor, LD Nathan (of Lion Nathan), and AG Horton and JL Wilson (of Wilson & Horton). However, a collapse in the world sugar market in the 1880s led the New Zealand Sugar Company to be re-amalgamated into its parent company Colonial Sugar in 1888. In 1959, the present New Zealand Sugar Company was formed to allow local autonomy.Luke, p8 Wilmar International currently own 75% of the New Zealand Sugar Company, and Mackay Sugar own 25%. =New refinery= company logo. Work began on the new refinery in 1883, when 150 workers levelled the ground, reclaimed a natural lagoon, built wharves (by blasting bedrock), and created dams using two-thirds of the 1.5 million bricks which were made on site; the remainder were used in the buildings. By 1884, the refinery was operating, and has not ceased its 24-hour operation since. Of the 150 workers who built the refinery, 100 remained to work in it once it was complete; most had migrated from Auckland and settled in the area.Luke, p 5 Some of the early machinery and equipment was imported from Greenock in Scotland; much of this historic equipment remains on site, providing a rich industrial heritage.Howell, p 18 Built in 1909, the row of brick workers' cottages are little changed today. =Model village= As work on the refinery began, the managers and company officers were able to adapt the existing farm cottages on the estate for their use, but the majority of workers lived in tents and temporary dwellings near the building site. This shanty town was replaced by Chelsea Village, which consisted of 35 cottages provided by the company within the grounds, some distance from the existing Birkenhead village. Planned to be a model town, it provided gardens, a church, reading room, school, and shop. However, the village did not remain for many years; the lower houses suffered from dampness and were unoccupied by the early 1890s, and by 1900 it was known as the \\"barracks\\" and occupied mainly by single men. In 1905, the village was condemned by the health authorities and the worst of the houses were demolished; the rest were sold and shifted from the site. Some of the relocated cottages can still be seen in the older streets around Birkenhead, and the church, now known as St Peters, was moved to Verrans Corner (a local suburb).Luke, p 6 Desiring its core tradesmen to remain on site, in case of emergencies, the company built four semi-detached brick houses in 1909 on the site of the old Chelsea Village. These houses remain in Chelsea's ownership, but are now rented to private individuals. For the remaining workers, the company offered inexpensive housing loans, which financed the building of over a third of Birkenhead's new houses between 1910 and 1926, mainly in the streets surrounding the refinery, including Colonial Road (named after the original sugar company) and Huka Road (after the Maori name for sugar). =Sugar workers= Renowned poet James K Baxter worked at Chelsea as a cleaner in 1969-a job found for him by Hone Tuwhare. Dismissed after three weeks, he wrote the satirical poem \\"Ballad of the Stonegut Sugar Works\\" which expressed his unhappiness at the working conditions.Luke, p 3 Baxter's impression of the factory was not shared by all workers; it was recognised as a place of hard work, but the community spirit was high and the company provided many benefits for workers. The company housing loans and secure employment ensured long service, often complete generations from the same families all working at the refinery.Luke, p 7 In the 2000s, about 240 people were occupied at the refinery. Wider impact =Development of Birkenhead= Before the opening of Auckland's Harbour Bridge in 1959, access to the North Shore from the City was restricted to transport by ferry. While some residents commuted to the city, most of the development of the area was determined by local employment; thus, Chelsea was a leading proponent and determinant in the growth of Birkenhead and provided a focal point for the community. With Chelsea as the major employer, Birkenhead was considered by many to be a 'company town'.Luke, p 4 In 1900, when the borough's population was 1000, one-third of the men worked at the refinery; local farmers and orchadists relied on casual labour in their off-season. Before the establishment of the sugar works, the area consisted of farms and orchards, with a small village beside Birkenhead Wharf; within four years of the refinery's opening, Birkenhead had become a borough. The burgeoning town grew up the hill towards Chelsea Village, with a group of shops established at Highbury, between the two original villages. Most of the local shops were supported by business from Chelsea and its workers, and workers became involved in local community affairs, including the offices of mayor and councillor. The shift sirens could be heard throughout Birkenhead and served as a 'clock' for all. =Second port on the Waitemata= The bulk carrier Port Alice docked at Chelsea Wharf for unloading The site was chosen due to the deepwater access, allowing a port to be built in 1884. Raw sugar came from Fiji, Cuba, Australia, Indonesia, and Peru for refining, and until the building of the Auckland Harbour Bridge, the finished products were shipped out from the wharf. All other commodities, such as coal, food, and mail, were also handled by Chelsea Wharf.Howell, p 19 This port continues to accept ships, generally handysize bulk carriers, delivering up to 30,000 tons of raw sugar. It remains private, but arrivals at the port are recorded by the Ports of AucklandPorts of Auckland shipping schedule and subject to Customs and MAF regulations. As the ships generally exceed , the ships require pilotage, managed by the Ports of Auckland's Harbour Control. Some of the land was in the ownership of the Ports of Auckland, and leased to Chelsea. In 1997, approval was granted for Chelsea to purchase the land, a total of nine hectares.CAFCA notes Sept '97 The port is located up-harbour from the Harbour Bridge, thus enforcing a large central span (243.8 m) and height (43.27 m at high tide). One of the footpaths leading through the grounds =Architectural and cultural impact= Chelsea is more than a landmark on the coast; it has been central to the development of the local community and remains active in preserving and encouraging interest in the local heritage and local events, sponsoring things as diverse as school trails and the publication of local histories. As part of the company's interest in preserving its early heritage for later generations, it has entrusted its archives to the Birkenhead Public Library. These Chelsea Archives contain company records, including wage books, legal files, and share registers from throughout its history.Shore Libraries Collections: The Chelsea Archive The architectural and social importance of the site is recognised by Heritage New Zealand. The early factory buildings, manager's house, and brick houses have Category II listings, and the site as a whole is recognised for its industrial heritage. As one of the largest complexes in New Zealand, and one of the few refineries in the South Pacific, it helped to established New Zealand as an economic force.Howell, pp 17-18 Throughout its history, Chelsea has allowed the public open access to its significant grounds, which comprise wetlands, lakes, open space, and bush. To ensure the parkland -and its access- is maintained, has become a public legacy. Among the other cultural impacts which the refinery has had on its surrounds is the origin of top local association football team Glenfield Rovers. The club, founded as Chelsea F.C. in 1960, was originally a social club for staff at the refinery. It later became more than just a social side, and has among the strongest teams in the Auckland region since the mid-1990s. The club reached the semifinals of the national Chatham Cup competition in 2008. In modern times The current Golden Syrup tin displays an illustration of the 19th-century refinery, a design reflected in the company logo shown on the White Sugar packaging. Chelsea operates 24 hours a day, 5 days per week, and remains New Zealand's market leader in sugar products. Chelsea purchases bulk raw sugar globally, which is brought in by ship and processed and packaged at the Refinery. Sales offices and warehouses around the country aid in the distribution of 200,000 tonnes of sugar a year, supplying both retail and manufacturing markets.Chelsea website: Business About 20% of Chelsea's total production is exported, mainly to Australia and the Pacific.Chelsea website: Exports New Zealand has a deregulated economy, hence it has no subsidies or import tariffs for sugar, so Chelsea operates entirely within the free market. Chelsea provide financial support and sponsorship for a variety of organisations and projects within the local community. They also provide funding for the Sugar Research Advisory Service, an independent organisation undertaking and reviewing research into sugar.Sugar Research Advisory Service website Notes References *Haddon, Kathy; Birkenhead: The Way We Were Auckland, NZ: Birkenhead Library, North Shore City Council, 1993. * *Howells, Shelley; \\"Pretty in Pink\\", New Zealand Heritage, New Zealand Historic Places Trust: Issue 103, Summer 2006. online version *Luke, Peter; Sugar Workers, Sugar Town : An Oral History of Chelsea Sugar Refinery, 1884-1984.

She began organizing public sector employees for the state of California,Franklin, \\"History, Heritage at Heart,\\" Chicago Tribune, September 23, 2007. and eventually was hired as an international union staff representative. She rose to become an \\"area director\\" in California, overseeing AFSCME's collective bargaining efforts for public employee locals and leading the union's political operations for statewide and federal races.Boyarsky, \\"A Test for Black Clout in Politics,\\" Los Angeles Times, October 28, 1992. AFL-CIO career In 1995, John Sweeney was elected president of the AFL-CIO, unseating incumbent Thomas R. Donahue. Sweeney's running mate, Linda Chavez-Thompson, was elected the labor federation's Executive Vice-President. Chavez-Thompson, a local AFSCME leader from Texas, hired Holt Baker as her executive assistant.Kamen, \\"Storm Clouds in NATO's 'Quad',\\" The Washington Post, November 8, 1995. Holt Baker was given a number of assignments in addition to her duties as an executive assistant to Chavez- Thompson. In 1998, she led the AFL-CIO's successful effort to defeat California Proposition 226, which would have denied dues check-off to public employees belonging to unions and required all union members in the state to annually give their assent before any portion of their dues could be used for political purposes.Galvin, \\"Labor Critical of Tycoon's Gift,\\" Associated Press, May 20, 1998.

A precursor effort to American Rights at Work and Working America, the Voice@Work project was designed to build community support for union organizing efforts.Greenhouse, \\"AFL-CIO Focuses on Recruiting to Stem Loss of Union Influence,\\" The New York Times, February 20, 1999; Brackey, \\"Unions in Quest to Fortify Ranks,\\" Miami Herald, February 26, 1999; Hayes, \\"Door by Door: Progressives Hit the Streets in Massive Voter Outreach,\\" In These Times, December 9, 2003. As a top aide to Sweeney, Holt Baker was repeatedly tapped to head up AFL-CIO political efforts. In 2000, she led a coalition of labor unions which registered voters and mobilized supporters in Pennsylvania, an important electoral battleground for unions. Labor's efforts in Pennsylvania were cited as critical to winning the state for the Democratic column. Holt Baker led the same coalition a second time in 2002, helping Ed Rendell win the gubernatorial election.Infield, \\"Big Push to Get Out Union Vote,\\" The Philadelphia Inquirer, November 2, 2000; Yardley and Verhovek, \\"GOP Governors in Key States Failed to Deliver for Bush,\\" The New York Times, November 14, 2000; Burton, \\"Rendell Got Out Huge Vote,\\" The Philadelphia Inquirer, May 22, 2002.

Holt Baker's work for Voices for Working Families was so successful that the Republican Party filed a complaint against VFWF and 13 other 527 groups with the Federal Election Commission. The complaint, which was eventually dismissed, alleged that VFWF and the other 527s were illegally coordinating their electoral efforts with John Kerry's presidential campaign.Stone and Drinkard, \\"FEC Filing Targets Liberal Groups,\\" USA Today, April 1, 2004.

AFL-CIO President John Sweeney immediately announced that he intended to have the federation executive council approve Holt Baker to fill the remainder of Chavez- Thompson's unexpired term. At its regularly scheduled meeting 10 days later, the AFL-CIO Executive Council unanimously voted to approve Arlene Holt Baker as AFL-CIO Executive Vice-President. Her term expired in 2009. At least one prominent labor commentator sharply criticized Holt Baker's elevation. Longtime union democracy activist Harry Kelber has argued that Chavez-Thompson should not have resigned immediately, but rather given the Executive Council several months' notice so that additional candidates could be recruited and/or their qualifications considered; that the timing of Chavez-Thompson's retirement gave only a few days' notice to the Executive Council before an election was held; and that the appointment of a staff member as an elected leader violates basic principles of union democracy.Kelber, \\"Sweeney Rushes to Fill AFL-CIO‚Äôs No. 3 With an Unknown Personal Assistant,\\" Labor Talk, September 17, 2007. Holt Baker was re-elected to the position of Executive Vice President for a full four-year term at the AFL-CIO's regularly scheduled quadrennial convention in September 2009.

Danescourt is part of the Llandaff Community. History Danescourt is built around Radyr's Church in Wales parish church of St John the Baptist and the site of Radyr's former 14th century manor house. The toponym \\"Danescourt\\" was devised when the housing estate was built in the 1970s. It is a portmanteau from the names of two homesteads that predate the suburb: Radyr Court Farm and Danesbrook House. St John the Baptist parish church, beside Radyr Chain, is nearly 800 years old, but was much altered by a Victorian restoration in the 19th century. Radyr Court farmhouse is now the Radyr Court Inn public house. The Taff Vale Railway built the railway through Danescourt in the 19th century. It became part of the Great Western Railway in the 1923 grouping. British Railways opened Danescourt railway station as part of the Cardiff City Line in 1987. Amenities As well as trains, Danescourt is served by several bus routes through the area operated by Cardiff Bus and Stagecoach South Wales. Danescourt has a primary school. Next to St John's parish church and the Radyr Court Inn is a shopping centre that includes a Co- Operative store, a newsagent, a Post Office, a nursery for children and Forte School of Music. Close to the shopping centre there are a dentist's surgery, a GP's practice, a pharmacy and a women's hairdressers.

He was a three-sport athlete at Washingtonville, starring on the school's soccer, basketball and track teams. However, his talent lay with soccer and he was two-time All State, two-time National Coaches All-American and two time Parade high school All American. His talent attracted the attention of pro scouts and when he graduated in 1980, the Washington Diplomats of the North American Soccer League (NASL) selected him in the second round of the draft. Hawkins chose to delay his entry into professional sports and entered Hartwick College. During his four seasons with the Hawks, he went to the 1980 NCAA Final Four. When he graduated in 1984, he had amassed 30 career goals and 10 career assists. He was inducted into the Hartwick College Athletic Hall of Fame in 1995.

The road is long and stretches from Concourse to Woodlawn. Both of these termini are with the Major Deegan Expressway which runs parallel to the west. Most of the elevated IRT Jerome Avenue Line runs along Jerome Avenue. The Cross Bronx Expressway interchanges with Jerome and the Deegan. Though it runs through what is now the West Bronx neighborhood, Jerome Avenue is the dividing avenue between nominal and some named \\"West\\" and \\"East\\" streets in the Bronx; Fifth Avenue, and to a lesser extent, Broadway, also splits Manhattan into nominal \\"West\\" and \\"East\\" streets. Street description The IRT Jerome Avenue Line is the brown straight line linking the two Yankee stadiums with the bottom of the picture. Edward L Grant Highway crosses Cross Bronx Expressway. The south end of Jerome Avenue is at exit 5 of the Major Deegan Expressway. The road begins as a divided highway, intersecting with 161st Street, which goes east to Yankee Stadium and the 161st Street‚ÄìYankee Stadium station of the IRT Jerome Avenue Line (served by the ). Jerome merges into the road to the Macombs Dam Bridge and heads north, paralleling Macombs Dam Park. After some intersections with local roads, Jerome Avenue intersects with 167th Street which at the intersection which, west of there, is named Edward L. Grant Highway. Just east of the intersection is the 167th Street station, another station along the way. Several blocks north, 170th Street intersects, just before crossing the Edward L. Grant Highway. Mt. Eden Avenue intersects in Morris Heights and the Cross Bronx Expressway does soon after. North the intersection with Tremont Avenue, Burnside Avenue intersects as Jerome Avenue leaves Morris Heights. 183rd street is the next major intersection, in University Heights. Fordham Road, both East and West intersect in University Heights. Saint James Park is passed to the east of Jerome, south of the intersection with Kingsbridge Road. As Jerome passes Lehman College, Bedford Park Boulevard (200th Street) intersects. Jerome Avenue then crosses the Mosholu Parkway on an overpass, after passing the Mosholu Yard. After Mosholu Parkway, Jerome Avenue enters the Norwood neighborhood. There, Jerome Avenue intersects with Gun Hill Road, with Van Cortlandt Park to the west. The final station on the IRT line is located just before intersecting Bainbridge Avenue. Jerome Avenue continues, cuts between Van Cortlandt Park and Woodlawn Cemetery, after which it enters Woodlawn. Jerome Avenue comes to an end at the Major Deegan and 233rd Street. The road continues as a service road for the Major Deegan, until it reaches the Bronx-Westchester border, where it becomes Central Park Avenue (NY 100), one of the main streets of the city of Yonkers. History Jerome Avenue was put together as a plank road in 1874 for $375,000. It appeared on maps as Central Avenue, because it started from Macombs Dam Bridge to Jerome Park Racetrack. Borough President Louis F. Haffen selected contractors in 1897 to pave Jerome Avenue. Three sections of the road were to be remodeled, costing the Bronx about $136,505. The street was to be renamed after an unknown city alderman. Kate Hall Jerome, wife of Lawrence Jerome, was furious, replacing all the signs with the name Jerome Avenue in honor of Jerome Park Racetrack opened by her husband's financier brother, Leonard Jerome in 1866. When the subway line was commissioned, Jerome went from rural road to commercial artery. The southern part of the avenue, from the intersection with 161st Street, formed the western edge of Macombs Dam Park. The parkland was alienated by the state legislature to enable construction of a new Yankee Stadium.

The Park Plaza Apartments at 1005 Jerome Avenue, one of the borough's first and most prominent Art Deco apartment houses and a New York City landmark since 1981, was overlooked in the environmental impact statement and is now in the shadow of the completed new stadium. In March 2018, the New York City Council voted to approve the rezoning of 92 blocks in the South Bronx, centered along Jerome Avenue from 165th to 184th Streets. The rezoning will allow developers to construct 4,600 housing units along the corridor, including 1,500 affordable housing units. At the time of the rezoning, the corridor consisted mainly of small businesses, warehouses, and auto-parts shops.

A former Muslim cleric and scholar of Shia Islam, he became an atheist during his study of the history of monotheistic religions. Influenced by the 9th-century Iranian skeptic philosopher Ibn al-Rawandi, Dursun wrote a number of books about religion which included interpretations of Islamic texts, heavily criticizing Islam and the founders of its major branches. Dursun was frequently threatened by Islamic fundamentalists, and on 4 September 1990 was assassinated outside his home in Istanbul, after which his books sold tens of thousands of copies in Turkey.Gazeteci Dursun √ñld√ºr√ºld√º, Milliyet, September 5th, 1990  Biography  Dursun's father was a Ja'fari Muslim from the Twelver Shi'a madhab. From his childhood on, he was motivated by his father to be an Islamic scholar. With this purpose, he worked hard and mastered major Islamic texts. = Years as a mufti = After passing the necessary exams to become a mufti, Dursun was unable to officially become one as he did not have a primary school diploma. He had to complete primary school exams without attending school and did so with understandable speed. He achieved mufti status in 1958. Whilst the mufti of Sivas, Dursun began establishing himself as a mufti of a different kind. Using his position, he initiated a number of projects for the development of the area and its imams: * Organised 50 tree plantations in the different villages of Sivas. * Forced plans for a mufti accommodation center to be changed for hospital to be built, with success. * Collected wheat from villages as aid for the hospital project. * Gave importance to the non-religious education of imams, through cinema and attendance of conferences. * Facilitated issue of school diplomas for imams through the Ministry of Education. * Put pressure on the mayor of Sivas for exhausting water supplies to be addressed. Dursun gained a lot of followers and enemies at Sivas and was threatened on numerous occasions. He was exiled to the city of Sinop and stayed in what he called a \\"broken down shack\\". He received help from Ali ≈ûarap√ßƒ±, a teacher who was tormented and falsely labeled as communist, as Dursun was. His mufti career ended in 1966. = First atheistic thoughts = In an interview with ≈ûule Perin√ßek, Dursun recounted one of the first instances, where he began doubting the existence of God. During a time when he was in love at the age of 11, Sabo, the older sister of the girl he loved, called Safi, was disabled. Dursun felt sorry for Sabo and one night during his sleep he saw God in his dream. After making him swear that he will not get angry, Dursun asked God why he created this Earth if he also created heaven and asked why Sabo was disabled and Safi was beautiful. In the same interview, Dursun states that: Dursun discovered what he called \\"Muhammad's passings on\\" when he began learning about the holy books that existed prior to the Quran. He states: Dursun began researching into Christianity when it was planned that he would be proudly introduced to the Pope as an intellectual mufti. To prepare for this meeting and to \\"be able to talk with him (the Pope) with more strength\\", Dursun studied Christianity but \\"instantly\\" realized the \\"con\\" as he compared his already vast knowledge of Islam with Christian information. After coming to negative conclusions about religion, Dursun became \\"angry\\" that Mohammed took away valuable years of childhood and youth. He said: Dursun was an independent theist for a short period of time before he became an atheist. First, he pronounced to himself that He undertook experiments to see if God existed or not during his mental battle with him. He began believing that humans evolved over millions of years and continued learning about anthropology. He stated that his independent theist period lasted \\"two or three years\\". = Life as a producer and an author = Following his resignation as a mufti, Dursun struggled to earn a living in Istanbul and even became a binman. The decision to quit as a mufti was tough, but Dursun stated that his principle was always \\"never to have a contradiction between what I thought and what I did\\". Due to a number of friends he made as a thinking mufti, he was able to get a foot in at the Turkish Radio and Television Corporation, (TRT), working firstly in basic administrative positions before taking and passing an exam to become involved in programme production. Among his productions are, \\"Turks in history\\", \\"Mankind from the beginning\\" and \\"Towards the evening\\" (unofficially translated titles). There is also a production which has never been allowed to be broadcast, titled \\"Before and after the first Grand National Assembly\\". Dursun resigned from TRT in 1982, after 16 years of service. In 1987, Dursun was introduced to Doƒüu Perin√ßek, a self-proclaimed socialist politician with heavy nationalist undertones, who was the editor of the magazine 2000'e Doƒüru (Towards 2000). Dursun contributed to the magazine with a column titled \\"Din Bilgisi\\" (Knowledge of religion). He also wrote for other publications such as Sa√ßak, Teori and Y√ºzyƒ±l. He wrote countless books in the 1980s, including a Turkish translation of Ibn Khaldun's Muqaddimah, collating his vast knowledge of Islam and languages of the Middle East, opening the religion to internal criticism through the mass media, perhaps for the first time in the religion's history. = Assassination = On 4 September 1990, shortly after leaving his home in the Asian part of Istanbul on his way to work, Dursun was assassinated by two gunmen. He was hit by seven bullets. As a result of the investigation, 15 suspects were arrested but they were immediately released after their first appearance in court. In 1996, ƒ∞rfan √áaƒüƒ±rƒ±cƒ± was arrested, suspected of being involved in the assassination of Dursun, as well as the killing of journalist √áetin Eme√ß in March 1990 and the kidnapping of Akbar Ghorbani (the People's Mujahedin of Iran's representative in Ankara). It was reported at √áaƒüƒ±rƒ±cƒ±'s trial that he had links with the Iranian government and was trained in Iranian camps. √áaƒüƒ±rƒ±cƒ± (codenamed \\"Mesut\\") was a member of ƒ∞slami Hareket √ñrg√ºt√º (English: \\"Islamic Movement Organisation\\" or \\"Islamic Action Group\\") and gave the order to murder Dursun for \\"humiliating the Quran\\". He was sentenced to death, and four co-defendants were imprisoned for life in July 2000; upon appeal, √áaƒüƒ±rƒ±cƒ±'s death penalty was also converted to life imprisonment in March 2002. However, the gunman who carried out the order, Muzaffer Dalmaz, is still at large abroad.

The Sidewise Award for Alternate History, established in 1995 to recognize the best alternate history stories and novels of the year, was named in honor of \\"Sidewise in Time.\\" Plot summary Professor Minott is a mathematician at Robinson College in Fredericksburg, Virginia who has determined that an apocalyptic cataclysm is fast approaching that could destroy the entire universe. The cataclysm manifests itself on June 5, 1935 (one year in the future of the story's original publication) when sections of the Earth's surface begin changing places with their counterparts in alternate timelines. A Roman legion from a timeline where the Roman Empire never fell appears on the outskirts of St. Louis, Missouri. Viking longships from a timeline where the Vikings settled North America raid a seaport in Massachusetts. A traveling salesman from Louisville, Kentucky, whose van bears a commercial logo including Uncle Sam with the Stars and Stripes, finds himself in trouble with the law when he travels into an area where the South won the American Civil War. A ferry approaching San Francisco finds the flag of Tsarist Russia flying from a grim fortress dominating the city. When a forest of sequoias appears north of Fredericksburg, Professor Minott leads an expedition of seven students from Robinson College to explore it. They reach the Potomac River, and find on its banks a Chinese village surrounded by rice paddies. At this point, Minott reveals the true situation to the students: he knew in advance that the timeline exchanges were going to take place, and he intends to lead the students to a timeline where he can use his scientific knowledge to gain wealth and power. The party returns to Fredericksburg, which in their absence has been replaced by wilderness, and Minott informs the students that they cannot return to their original timeline. That night, an airplane from their own timeline makes a crash landing near Minott's party. Before the pilot dies, they learn from him that Washington, D.C. from their timeline was still in place. A student named Blake wants to make for Washington, but Minott refuses. The forest catches fire from the burning airplane, and the party flees to a Roman villa. They are captured by the villa's owner, except for Blake, who escapes. Later that night Blake secretly returns to the villa and frees the others from the slave pen, shooting the owner in the process. The next morning, the party finds itself near a section of their own timeline. Blake leads the other students there, but Minott refuses to come; he still intends to travel to a more primitive timeline and make himself its ruler. One of the women in the party joins him, while the rest of the students return to their timeline. The students are able to contact the rest of the world and inform them of Minott's deductions about the event. Within two weeks, the timeline exchanges trail off, leaving bits and pieces of other timelines embedded in our own. Influence \\"Sidewise in Time\\" was among the first science fiction stories about parallel universes. In 1903 H. G. Wells wrote \\"A Modern Utopia\\" in which people from our timeline were shown traveling to another, but Wells used this mainly as a literary device to present his speculations of a perfect society. Leinster's story, conversely, introduced the concept to the pulp science fiction readership, bringing about the creation of one of the field's subgenres. L. Sprague de Camp's 1940 story \\"The Wheels of If\\" followed a single man as he was involuntarily transported through a series of alternate timelines. H. Beam Piper's paratime series (1948‚Äì1965) postulated the existence of a civilization that could travel at will across the timelines, a theme echoed in Larry Niven's \\"All the Myriad Ways\\" (1968), Frederik Pohl's The Coming of the Quantum Cats (1986), and Harry Turtledove's Crosstime Traffic series (2003‚Äì2008). Other stories dealing with travel to parallel timelines include Isaac Asimov's \\"Living Space\\" (1956), Keith Laumer's Imperium series (1962‚Äì1990), Jack Vance's \\"Rumfuddle\\" (1973), and Jack L. Chalker's G.O.D. Inc trilogy (1987‚Äì1989). Lawrence Watt-Evans' story \\"Storm Trooper\\" (1992) is set in world whose inhabitants, like those of \\"Sidewise in Time\\", must cope with the sudden appearance of sections of other timelines. Gordon R. Dickson's Time Storm (1977) depicts an Earth ravaged by a cosmic storm that randomly changes the historical periods of local regions, much like \\"Sidewise in Time\\". The anime series Orguss took \\"Sidewise in Time\\" as one of its inspirations, and showed the world caught in a trap of constantly changing territories of alternate-Earths. The setting of Fred Hoyle's October the First Is Too Late (1966) is similar to that of Leinster's story, except that the segments of Earth which are brought together and interact with each other are from different historical periods, rather than from different parallel histories. In his comments on the story in Before the Golden Age, Isaac Asimov writes that \\"Sidewise in Time\\" had a long-term effect on his thinking. \\"It always made me conscious of the 'ifs' in history, and this showed up not only in my science fiction, as in 'The Red Queen's Race', but in my serious books on history as well. I also used the alternate-history theme, in enormous complexity, in my novel The End of Eternity.\\" Themes touched upon by Leinster would be taken up at greater length by others: Confederate victory in the American Civil War, a Roman Empire which never fell, enduring Viking colonization of America, Russia keeping its 19th-century colonies in Pacific America, Chinese colonists finding their way to America. The idea of a scholar using a cataclysmic event to make himself the ruler of primitive people was taken up by S. M. Stirling in the Nantucket and Emberverse series, where the main villains do this repeatedly.

It stars Charlotte Gainsbourg, who won the C√©sar Award for Most Promising Actress, and Bernadette Lafont, who won the C√©sar Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role. It is a free adaptation of the novel Frankie Addams (French title of Carson McCullers's The Member of the Wedding). The film won the Louis Delluc Prize, and received C√©sar nominations for Best Film, Best Director, Most Promising Actor, Best Writing, Best Costume Design and Best Sound.  Plot  Charlotte Castang is a working-class 13-year-old girl, who lives in a drab, run-down neighbourhood, and is ready to become an adult. Her mother died giving birth to her, and she lives with her crass brother, and her father whose attention is elsewhere. Her only friend is Lulu, a sick 10-year-old she regards as a pest. Charlotte is antisocial, bored and dreams of a better life. Her life improves when she meets Clara Bauman, a pianist prodigy whom she admires. Charlotte wants to be friends with Clara, whom she sees as a potential route to prosperity, while the sophisticated Clara jokingly suggests that Charlotte should become her manager.

Licensed to Whitney, Nevada, United States, it primarily serves the Las Vegas area. The station is currently owned by Univision Radio, through licensee Univision Radio Illinois, Inc., and features programming from TUDN Radio. History KLSQ began as KROL in 1986. KROL was founded by \\"Laughlin Roughrider Broadcasting\\" and operated from two tower sites. A three-tower operation was built in Laughlin for a 10,000 watt day and 1,000 watt night operation, using two different, three-tower directional antenna system. The other site was near Henderson and was the KROL experimental synchronous transmitter, using a non-directional antenna by day and a three-tower directional system by night. After 840 AM went on in the area, measurements were made showing that a power increase would not cause prohibited overlap with KROL on 870. This allowed an increase to 5,000 watts days (still at 500 watts nights). Both sites used diesel generators to make all of the power to broadcast. The station was sold to Million Dollar Broadcasting and changed call letters to KOWA, known as \\"The Cow\\". Heftel Broadcasting bought the station in 1995 and changed to a format of Spanish hits. Management at HBC were concerned that the bulk of population covered by the station was from the second transmitter in the Las Vegas area. This coverage was licensed as a secondary authorization, and was subject to cancellation with little or no prior notice. David Stewart at HBC Engineering found a way to make the northern signal the main (and only site). The city of license was changed from Laughlin to Whitney (which combined some unincorporated Clark County with the former village of East Las Vegas). The former main site in Laughlin was parted out. The Laughlin towers are used by other area stations, including AMs on 1000 and 1490, and, at one time, the analog operation of KMCC TV. On December 20, 2016, Univision announced that KLSQ would be one of the charter affiliates of their new Spanish-language sports network, Univision Deportes Radio, which launched in early 2017.Univision To Launch \\"Univision Deportes Radio\\" KLSQ has been silent since late 2019.

English tradition The concept is first attested in English in Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet in Mercutio's speech of the many exploits of Queen Mab, where he seems to imply the locks are only unlucky if combed out: :\\"She is the fairies‚Äô midwife, and she comes :In shape no bigger than an agate stone....... :That plaits the manes of horses in the night :And bakes the elflocks in foul sluttish hairs, :Which once untangled, much misfortune bodes.\\" Therefore, the appellation of elf lock or fairy lock could be attributed to any various tangles and knots of unknown origins appearing in the manes of beasts or hair of sleeping children. It can also refer to tangles of elflocks or fairy-locks in human hair. In King Lear, when Edgar impersonates a madman, \\"he elfs all his hair in knots.\\"Shakespear's \\"Lear\\"(Lear, ii. 3.)

Grimm, who compiled the list, also remarked on the similarity to Frau Holle, who entangled people's hair and herself had matted hair.(Stallybrass tr.)

BiliBlanket is a trademark of General Electric's Datex- Ohmeda subsidiary, but its name has become the generic, colloquial term for a range of similar products and the term used in the medical professions. The name \\"biliblanket\\" combines the words bilirubin and blanket. The baby is placed in direct contact with the pad. This device is also known as home phototherapy system, bilirubin blanket, or bidirectional fiber-optic phototherapy blanket. Different types of phototherapy for jaundice involve a blue light of varying types of light, wavelengths, and degrees of irradiance. The light waves promote breakdown of bilirubin and allow it to be eliminated. Compared to standard forms of phototherapy, a biliblanket utilizes a fiberoptic system, allowing them to be used at home. The biliblanket system consists of three components: an illuminator, fiberoptic pad, and disposable pad cover. The fiberoptic pad is used to transport blue or white light from the light source, the illuminator, directly onto the baby's skin.  Neonatal jaundice  Jaundice (Hyperbilirubinemia) is not uncommon in newborn babies and presents itself as yellow discoloration of the skin and whites of the eyes (sclera). Jaundice occurs in roughly 60% to 84% of infants. This condition also causes babies to appear sick, experience difficulty waking up, make high- pitch cries, or not be able to be fed or gain weight. Bilirubin is an orange yellow bile pigment that is produced as a byproduct of hemoglobin as red blood cells break down (hemolysis). Bilirubin is then metabolized in the liver, recycled, and excreted in the bowel movements. When a baby has jaundice or hyperbilirubinemia, this can indicate that the baby's body is producing excess bilirubin or that the liver is too immature to be able to eliminate bilirubin fast enough. Feeding, in particular breastfeeding, the baby often in the first few days of birth can help lower the chances of developing jaundice, since the baby will pass more stool and the milk provides energy to the liver to allow metabolism of bilirubin. Uncontrolled levels of bilirubin can be harmful to the baby. Most neonatal jaundice shows during the first week after birth. Nevertheless, when bilirubin levels become exceedingly high, the substance may move out of the blood, cross the blood brain barrier, and collect in brain tissue, damaging the baby's brain cells, a condition known as acute bilirubin encephalopathy. If acute bilirubin encephalopathy is not addressed promptly, Kernicterus syndrome can develop and cause permanent brain damage. In rare situations, a baby may experience seizures, deafness, cerebral palsy or mental retardation. Jaundice can be prevented and treated in the majority of cases. Jaundice is more dangerous in certain cases such as babies who are born prematurely (before 37 weeks of gestation), babies who are underweight (less than 2500 grams at birth), babies who are going through an infection, babies who experienced a difficult delivery or have bruises (since they are replacing and breaking down more red blood cells at a higher rate) and babies who have a blood group that is not compatible with their mothers.  Phototherapy mechanism  Jaundice in some babies can disappear within one to two weeks without treatment; however for babies with more severe jaundice, treatment is required. Traditional phototherapy devices include blue LEDs, halogen white light, and fluorescent tubes. A biliblanket is a phototherapy home treatment that consists of a portable illuminator and fiber-optic pad. It uses a pad of woven fibers to transfer light to a baby in order to treat neonatal jaundice (hyperbilirubimia). It uses visible light to transform bilirubin into a more water-soluble form that allows it to dissolve easily in water and be eliminated. This therapy lowers the serum bilirubin level. The baby is placed on the fiber-optic pad, which has a disposable cover in direct contact with the baby's skin. This fiber-optic pad exposes the skin to light, and bilirubin is eliminated when light is absorbed. The biliblanket releases waves of blue or white light, when these are absorbed in the skin, bilirubin breaks down and is eliminated from the baby's blood stream. This lowers the yellowing effect in the baby's eyes and skin. Afterwards, blood needs to be tested to observe bilirubin levels and decide whether the biliblanket is still needed. Majority of babies that need a biliblanket use it for several days, but it depends on each baby's condition. Even though a biliblanket may cause loose stools and skin rashes, it is considered safe for the most part. This device is mostly used for 2 to 3 days only. In severe situations, intravenous fluids may be needed to be given to the patient. Phototherapy uses photons of energy that are infused and absorbed by bilirubin located in superficial capillaries and subcutaneous tissues and interstitial spaces of the skin. Photochemical reactions then transform bilirubin into nontoxic isomers that are more polar, water-soluble and therefore, can be excreted without being further metabolized by the liver. Urinary and gastrointestinal elimination remain important to the process of reducing the bilirubin load.  Proper use  The biliblanket setup consists of the light generator, termed the light box, the fibre-optic cable through which the light is carried, and the fiberoptic pad, which is a 25cmx13cm (10\\"x5\\") pad that is attached to the baby. The light generator stores the source of light, which is a halogen bulb. The fiber-optic cable connects the light generator to the fiberoptic pad, which contains fiberoptic fibers and usually has a disposable cover. It is important to make sure that the light-source machine is placed on a flat, level, hard surface such as a table or nightstand to ensure proper ventilation. A disposable cover is placed onto the light pad and should be changed if the cover becomes soiled. For effective therapy, the baby‚Äôs skin should be directly exposed to the light pad as much as possible. The light pad should be on at all times except during baths. The light pad is usually placed on the undressed baby‚Äôs back with a diaper on. Clothing may be worn, but the clothing should be placed over the light pad, and the light pad should still be in direct contact with the baby‚Äôs skin. The light pad should never be placed on the baby's head. The baby can sleep, eat, or be held while the light pad is on. The biliblanket is safe and can be used for 24 hours a day as long as therapy is required. However, the duration of phototherapy will vary from individual to individual based on the baby's current condition and disease state. It will also depend on the physician‚Äôs clinical judgement. Blood tests may be required daily during phototherapy to assess the bilirubin levels and determine if normal levels have been reached and whether or not phototherapy can be stopped. Once the bilirubin levels are normal, the baby's skin will return to its normal color.  Side effects One common side effect that is experienced by babies who are receiving phototherapy treatment is more frequent and loose stools. The color of these stools are usually a greenish color; however, this is normal because that is the way bilirubin is removed from the body. As bilirubin levels return to normal and phototherapy is no longer needed, the frequency of bowel movements and the color of the stools will return back to normal. = Short- term = * Skin lesions * Diarrhea due to thermal and hydroelectrolytic abnormalities * Bronze baby syndrome (grey and brown pigmentation of the skin in infants with cholestasis) * Hematological changes * Paralytic ileus = Long-term = * Neoplasms * Skin lesions * Caf√© au lait spots * Allergic diseases (allergic asthma, rhinitis, and conjunctivitis) Other side effects of phototherapy include effects on circadian cycle genes, patent ductus arteriosus, and possible retinal damage if the eyes are exposed to constant phototherapy.  Advantages  Unlike conventional forms of phototherapy, which require eye protection, the baby does not need to have eye protection when using a biliblanket. Another advantage of the biliblanket is that it can be used at home. In some cases, if the baby‚Äôs condition is not too severe, the parents will be given a biliblanket to set up and use at home. This provides a more comfortable and convenient setting since the parents and baby do not have to stay in the hospital. Other advantages of the biliblanket are that it can be easily transported, can be used when the baby is sleeping, eating, and or being held, and promotes a relationship between parents and infants since they do not need to be separated during treatment.  Disadvantages  From a review, fibreoptic phototherapy was more effective at lowering serum biliruben than no treatment but less effective than conventional phototherapy. However, a combination of fibreoptic and conventional phototherapy was more effective than conventional phototherapy alone.  History  In 1956, Sister Ward, a nurse at Rochford General Hospital in Essex, England, discovered that a jaundiced infant's body had regained its normal skin color after exposure to the sun. One small region, which had not been exposed to the sun, remained yellow in color. This discovery, along with findings that blood tubes exposed to the sun showed a decrease in bilirubin concentrations, drove research and development of the first phototherapy device for treatment of neonatal jaundice. Phototherapy has been used to treat neonatal jaundice since the early 1970's. The conventional form of phototherapy has been performed in the hospital for more than thirty years and requires the presence of multiple overhead light sources, such as halogen or fluorescent lamps, shining directly on the baby.

It was an NBC Radio Network affiliate, broadcasting a schedule of dramas, comedies, news, sports, game shows, soap operas and big band broadcasts. In 1955, it was bought by the Southwestern Broadcasting Company, which put Channel 3 KORK-TV (now KSNV) on the air in that same year. In 1961, KORK got an FM counterpart, 97.1 KORK-FM (now KXPT).Broadcasting Yearbook 1966 page B-91 In 1968, KORK, airing a full service Middle of The Road format, moved to 920 kHz (today KRLV). Going to 920 allowed KORK to increase its daytime power to 5,000 watts. Meanwhile, Nevada Broadcasting, Incorporated, acquired the 1340 frequency, and began airing country music as 1340 KRAM. At this point, KRAM was powered at 1,000 watts by day, but still had to reduce power to 250 watts at night.Broadcasting Yearbook 1971 page B-128 It was an affiliate of the ABC Entertainment Radio Network. In 1985, the station was acquired by Southern Nevada Radio, which changed the call sign to KMTW. By the early 1990s, 1340 KMTW had become an all-news station, carrying CNN Headline News. In 1995, Far West Radio acquired the station. On August 9, the new owner changed its call sign to KRLV. It aired a talk radio format for several years. In 2004, Continental Broadcasting bought the station, putting on a Spanish-language format of music, news and sports. In August 2012, KRLV and 1230 KLAV were sold to Lotus Communications. In April 2015, KRLV flipped from its Spanish-language format to Fox Sports Radio.

W. Griffith, and starring Carol Dempster, Charles Emmett Mack, and Ralph Graves in a story about a love triangle set in London, and based on two short stories by Thomas Burke, \\"Gina of Chinatown\\" and \\"Song of the Lamp\\". The cast also features Tyrone Power, Sr. The film, released by United Artists, was poorly received in its day, and critics still consider it one of Griffith's worst films. Cast Dream Street (full film) * Carol Dempster as Gypsy Fair * Charles Emmett Mack as Billy McFadden * Ralph Graves as James Spike McFadden * Edward Peil Sr. as Swan Way * Tyrone Power Sr. as Street Preacher * Morgan Wallace as Masked Violinist * William J. Ferguson as Gypsy's Father * George Neville as Tom Chudder * Charles Slattery as Police Inspector * Porter Strong as Samuel Jones Premiere The original 1921 version of Dream Street is notable for a brief sequence when D. W. Griffith steps out in front of a curtain at the beginning of the movie, and talks to the audience about the film, using Photokinema, an early sound-on-disc process developed by Orlando Kellum. Some films made in the Photokinema process, including Griffith's Dream Street introduction at the beginning, are preserved at the UCLA Film and Television Archive. The silent version premiered on April 12, 1921, at the Central Theatre in New York City. On April 27, Griffith and Ralph Graves recorded their respective sound segments at Orlando Kellum's Photokinema office at 203 West 40th Street.\\"Griffith to Present Sound Film at Town Hall Tomorrow\\", The New York Times (May 1, 1921), Drama and Music section, p. 78 The premiere engagement of the sound version of Dream Street took place on May 2, 1921, at Town Hall in New York City, with Griffith's introduction.

It is similar to other Harmonix games Amplitude and FreQuency.  Gameplay  Phase is played in a forced single-point perspective view of a three line track. Down each line come colored circles, and the player must click the corresponding button on the click wheel when the circle reaches the bottom of the screen. The circles are arranged on the track in relation to the beat of the music track being played. Additionally, there are occasional series of smaller, more closely spaced dots that will sweep across the track. These require the player to swipe their finger across the click wheel at the correct pace, instead of clicking the wheel buttons. The game comes with Easy, Medium, and Hard settings available for immediate play. After completing a marathon with the Hard difficulty setting, Expert mode is made available. In the same way, completing a marathon on Expert unlocks Insane mode. The difficulty settings control the speed of the track and the number of the dots, as well as their value.  Soundtrack  Phase ships with seven songs, some by bands of Harmonix employees, but can be made to work with any song on the iPod as long as it is longer than 30 seconds but less than 30 minutes long. Custom songs must be added to a Phase playlist in iTunes, where they are processed for proper interpretation and become available in the game. The Phase music playlist is limited to 1,000 songs.

His usual position is at number eight. Koyamaibole also plays for Fiji, including playing in the 2003 Rugby World Cup, the 2007 Rugby World Cup and the 2011 Rugby World Cup, and has played for the Fiji Sevens in rugby sevens tournaments. At club level, he has represented Taranaki, Petrarca Padova, Toulon, Sale Sharks, Lyon OU, Bordeaux B√®gles and currently plays for Brive. Career Born 6 March 1980 in Suva, Koyamaibole began his international career in 2001 making his debut against Tonga. Koyamaibole was one of the few local Fijian club players to be selected for the 2003 Rugby World Cup. In 2004 Koyamaibole moved to the Number 8 position where he also played for the Pacific Islanders. After showing impressive form for the Pacific Islanders that year, Koyamaibole was given a contract with New Zealand club Counties Manukau. A year later he moved to Taranaki, but missed most of the season due to injury and then a long suspension. He played every test for Fiji between 2001 and 2004, however between 2005 and 2007, Koyamaibole did not play any Tests for Fiji. This was reportedly due to a falling out with Wayne Pivac, then coach of Fiji. =2007 World Cup= When Fiji announced their 30-man squad for the 2007 Rugby World Cup, Koyamaibole was one of the most experienced members, one of only four players to have more than 30 caps at the time. Koyamaibole was part of the Fiji team that knocked Wales out of the tournament by winning 38‚Äì34, and played in Fiji's first quarter-final at a Rugby World Cup since the 1987 Rugby World Cup. Although they lost 37‚Äì20 to eventual winners, South Africa, Fiji received a standing ovation from the crowd despite South African player Jaque Fourie commenting before the match that Fiji did not deserve the respect of the Springboks. Koyamaibole played five matches in the tournament, playing at number eight on four occasions. =Toulon= It was announced in June 2008 that Koyamaibole would join French club RC Toulonnais. He was one of several players signed by the club as the club prepared for the 2008-09 Top 14 season ‚Äì the top level of the national league system of France ‚Äì having secured promotion the previous season. The club struggled to avoid relegation for most of the season, although managed to stay in the top flight. Koyamaibole left the club at the end of the season and was offered a contract with English club Sale Sharks =Sale Sharks= In May 2009 it was announced that Koyamaibole had signed a two-year contract for Guinness Premiership side Sale Sharks. Kingsley Jones, Sale's director of rugby, described Koyamaibole as \\"a gifted athlete who is very mobile around the field\\" with \\"excellent discipline\\". He was one of several players signed by Sale in the off-season after the departure of Philippe Saint-Andr√© as director of rugby and several players. Jones requested that Koyamaibole try to lose nearly 3 stone to slim down to the weight of 18.5 stone, as he was at the 2007 Rugby World Cup. Koyamaibole commented that Sale was different to the clubs he had previously been a part of, with a focus on professionalism and fitness. It was possible that commitments to Sale would conflict with international duties, but he has stated that \\"if I can be released by the club then I'll be more than happy to play for Fiji\\". Koyamaibole made his debut for Sale on 4 September 2009, dominating the scrum with fellow Sale-debutant Jack Forster. The match, which was the opening game of the 2009‚Äì10 Guinness Premiership, was won by Sale who defeated the Leicester Tigers, the defending champions, 15‚Äì12. Koyamaibole had a good start to his Sale career, his strong carrying a joy to behold. Koyamaibole was given a two-week ban starting on 26 January 2011, for kicking Saracens' Richard Wigglesworth during Sale's 28‚Äì22 victory over the club.

On March 7, 1985, it was added to the National Register of Historic Places. History The church was built in 1878 on the foundation of a fisherman's unfinished house, with lumber donated by Mrs. L. M. Griswold, wife of a local sawmill owner. The style is Carpenter Gothic, with exterior of board and batten and wood shingles. The congregation initially had twenty members, led by Mrs. Griswold and Sara Jeffcoat, a widowed schoolteacher. Early on the congregation was served by Reverend Joseph Jameson who was shared with congregations at Jacksonport, Algoma and Sturgeon Bay. In 1985 the building was added to the National Register of Historic Places for its religious and architectural significance. Today the church offers worship services in summer only, because the building remains unheated. Rotating clergy serve each Sunday morning.

Scored for piano, tape and full orchestra, its form is innovative for an instrumental concert: solo pieces for piano (\\"preludes\\") alternate with orchestral passages, which are played partly without, partly with the participation of the piano. The tape has its own system in the score, which indicates the actual sound by means of graphic lines. The twelve-tone-set c#-d-a-d#-e-h-f-a#-f#-g#-c-g can be traced back to the three-tone constellation of major-third and minor-second, which also determine the first three notes of Richard Wagner's \\"Tristan and Isolde\\" (a-f-e). With respect to the intellectual history, Henze addresses the 19th century, to which he was attracted and by which, at the same time, he was repelled. Blurred quotes from the music of Wagner, Chopin and Brahms are the triumvirate of musical romanticism, which can be described in terms of progress, virtuosity and historicism. Before the work was completed, Ingeborg Bachmann and Wystan Hugh Auden died. On September 11, 1973 Pinochet chased away the dream of a socialist democracy in Chile. Henze was personally affected and sought psychotherapeutic help. A shadow of this crisis can be heard towards the end of the work, when it comes to a climax, for which Henze coined the phrase \\"death cry ... of the whole suffering world\\".Hans Werner Henze: \\"Tristan (1975)\\".

Haiti has a World Heritage site located here. In the wake of the 2010 Haiti earthquake, UNESCO's World Heritage Program is helping Haiti assess the damage. Biodiversity and conservation Most of the island's endemic species exist within the 'de la Hotte Biosphere. Rising to a peak level of approximately 7700 ft (2347 m) in Pic Macaya; Haiti's second highest peak, the Massif's high and fluctuating elevations supports some of Hispaniola's highest levels of biological diversity and endemism. Much of the region lies within the Pic Macaya National Park. Conservation International recognizes the region as one of the most conservation-urgent in the world in which 13 of Hispaniola's most critically endangered species (all amphibians) occur. Among the most critically endangered frog species are Eleutherodactylus chlorophenax and Eleutherodactylus parapelates, two frog species endemic to Haiti. The Hispaniolan trogon has a recognized presence in the region.

The band consists of Brian Fallon (lead vocals, rhythm guitar), Alex Rosamilia (lead guitar, backing vocals), Alex Levine (bass guitar, backing vocals), and Benny Horowitz (drums, percussion). The Gaslight Anthem released their debut album, Sink or Swim, on XOXO Records in May 2007, and their second album, The '59 Sound, on SideOneDummy Records in August 2008. The band's third album, American Slang, was released in June 2010, and their fourth, Handwritten, was released in July 2012 through Mercury Records. The lead single from Handwritten, \\"45\\", became their most successful single on the charts, and possibly their most well known to date. The band's fifth studio album, Get Hurt, was released on August 12, 2014, through Island Records. On July 29, 2015, the band announced an indefinite hiatus following their European summer tour, which concluded at Reading Festival on Sunday 30 August. The band temporarily reunited for a string of shows in 2018 to celebrate the 10th anniversary of The '59 Sound, before resuming their hiatus. History =Before the Gaslight Anthem= Brian Fallon was in a number of bands prior to the Gaslight Anthem, most recently This Charming Man. The band went through a number of line-up changes, to the point where the band consisted of Fallon, Mike Volpe, Benny Horowitz, and Alex Levine. At this stage, the band renamed themselves to the Gaslight Anthem, due to a change in direction. After this, Volpe left and Alex Rosamilia joined, and the current line-up of the Gaslight Anthem was formed. The band's first gig was at The Only Game in Town in Somerville, New Jersey in early 2006. =Sink or Swim (2007‚Äì08)= The Gaslight Anthem's debut, Sink or Swim, was well received by both independent music review sites such as punknews.org, AbsolutePunk.net, and more mainstream publications such as Spin.com. In 2009, the song \\"I'da Called You Woody, Joe\\" was featured as part of the soundtrack of the video games Skate 2 and Skate It. A 4-song EP titled Se√±or and the Queen was released on February 5, 2008, through Sabot Productions. A double-7\\" vinyl version of the EP was also released on standard black vinyl, as well as limited edition pressings on clear vinyl, red vinyl (500 copies), and white vinyl (100 copies). =The '59 Sound and breakthrough (2008‚Äì10)= The band's second album, The '59 Sound, was released on August 19, 2008, through SideOneDummy Records.Conoley, Ben.\\"Gaslight Anthem Have Got Soul\\", Exclaim!, September 2008. The record was produced by Ted Hutt and features Hot Water Music's Chris Wollard and the Mighty Mighty Bosstones' Dicky Barrett as guests. The album was voted the No. 1 album of 2008 by eMusic, and received a high rating from Pitchfork Media. The first song on the album, \\"Great Expectations\\", references the character Estella from the Charles Dickens novel of the same title. In 2008, the band covered \\"God's Gonna Cut You Down\\" for the Johnny Cash tribute album All Aboard! A Tribute to Johnny Cash. On August 6, 2008, the band made British music history becoming the first band to ever appear on the cover of Kerrang! magazine without the magazine having previously written about them. Kerrang! called them \\"The best new band you'll hear in 2008.\\" In addition, the band received airplay on BBC Radio 6 Music, and embarked on a UK and European tour in November. In August 2009, The Gaslight Anthem won the 2009 Kerrang! Award for \\"Best International Newcomer\\". In 2009, the Gaslight Anthem supported Social Distortion on their European tour and was announced as a supporting act for Bruce Springsteen at Hyde Park Calling. The band performed at Pinkpop on June 1, 2009. At the Glastonbury Festival on June 27, 2009, Springsteen joined the band on stage during their performance of \\"The '59 Sound.\\" Brian Fallon later contributed to Springsteen's headlining set, performing the song \\"No Surrender.\\" At London's Hard Rock Calling festival on June 28, Springsteen again joined the band to perform \\"The '59 Sound\\", and Fallon again joined Springsteen in singing \\"No Surrender.\\" The Gaslight Anthem subsequently performed at Lollapalooza in Chicago on August 7, 2009. In 2014, the album's bonus track (\\"Once Upon a Time\\") was featured in the 20th Century Fox film Devil's Due. =American Slang (2010‚Äì11)= The band's third album, titled American Slang, was released on June 14, 2010, in the UK and June 15, 2010, in the USA Kerrang! The Gaslight Anthem name new album. According to frontman Brian Fallon, the songwriting on the new album was different than on the band's previous efforts. He named the Rolling Stones, Blues Breakers with Eric Clapton, and Derek and the Dominos as influences. In addition to five UK dates, the band played at festivals including Bonnaroo Festival, the Austin City Limits Music Festival, Southside Festival, Hurricane Festival, Hard Rock Calling, Rock Werchter, The Guernsey Festival of Performing Arts, A Campingflight to Lowlands Paradise, Reading and Leeds Festivals and √òyafestivalen. The Gaslight Anthem toured the UK and Europe at the end of 2010 with support from Chuck Ragan and Sharks. They performed two songs from American Slang on Episode 6, Series 37 of Later... with Jools Holland, originally broadcast in the UK on October 22, 2010. The Gaslight Anthem at Tr√§dg√•r'n G√∂teborg, Sweden. 2013-04-06 =Handwritten (2012‚Äì13)= In July 2010, Fallon said he was already working on new material for a fourth album. Subsequently, Fallon stated on his blog that the band would start writing their record in January 2011. However, prior to playing on Pinkpop in June 2011, Fallon stated that they had just started working on the new album and that it would not be released for at least a few months. In the same interview Fallon said only one song was finished so far, referring to Biloxi Parish which they performed on stage at Pinkpop 2011 as well as Rock Am Ring. Fallon stated that the band's next record would sound closer to their breakthrough record, The '59 Sound, rather than American Slang. During this time, Fallon was also working with good friend Ian Perkins on their side project, The Horrible Crowes. On October 6, 2011, the Gaslight Anthem announced via Facebook that they had signed with Mercury Records. They stated that they were sorry to leave their friends at SideOneDummy, but felt that the change was necessary for their musical career. On October 14, 2011, the band announced that their last show before going into the studio to record their new album would be on December 9, 2011 at the Asbury Park Convention Hall. On February 22, 2012, the band's Twitter feed announced the forthcoming album would be titled Handwritten. The album was released on July 20, 2012, in Germany, July 23 in the UK, and July 24 in the US. On September 21, 2012, in Pensacola, Florida, the Gaslight Anthem performed Pearl Jam's \\"State of Love and Trust\\" live at DeLuna Fest with Eddie Vedder on vocals. On November 30, 2012, the last of three nights in a row at New York City's Terminal 5 venue, Fallon announced that they would be releasing a live DVD of the previous night's show. =Get Hurt and hiatus (2014‚Äì2017)= The band announced on July 4, 2013, via their Tumblr site, that they were \\"Working on new songs for a new Gaslight Anthem album in 2014.\\" Fallon cites Pearl Jam's No Code album as an influence and inspiration for the upcoming album. On July 29, 2013, rumors about the band‚Äôs hiatus peaked from a Tumblr post by Brian Fallon. After playing a show in New York City, he explained his frustration about audiences continually requesting Bruce Springsteen covers. ‚ÄúMy name isn‚Äôt Bruce,‚Äù he added. The band released a limited edition box set titled Singles Collection: 2008-2011 in June 2013. The set compiled nine of the band's 7\\" singles in a wooden box. In December 2013 the band released their first DVD, titled Live in London, and one month later in January 2014 they released The B-Sides, a collection of acoustic songs, live songs, and outtakes from their various singles. On March 10, 2014, the band entered Blackbird Studios in Nashville to record their fifth album. The band stated on April 14 that they had arrived at the \\"last week in the studio\\" of recording the album. In an interview with Rolling Stone published May 23, 2014, Fallon described the new record as \\"completely different than anything we had ever done before. Instead of going that extra step of just adding some organ or some background vocals, this time we actually really changed up a lot of the sounds.\\" On June 16, 2014, the title of the album was announced as Get Hurt. It was released on August 12, 2014. On July 24, 2014, the music video for the title track debuted. On July 29, 2015, the band announced an indefinite hiatus following their European summer tour, which concluded at Reading Festival on Sunday 30 August. =Reunion (2018)= On January 3, 2018 it was revealed that the band would be reuniting for Governors Ball Music Festival held on Randall's Island in New York City. The band later via their Facebook page, announced that they were reuniting for a string of shows celebrating the 10th Anniversary of The 59' Sound. Regarding the decision, Brian Fallon noted, \\"The big thing between us was let's just do what's fun. So if it's heavy-handed and not that cool, then let's not do it. But we all feel that this is an important record to not only us, but to the people that love it. I would not be on the phone talking about my Sleepwalkers record had it not been for The '59 Sound.\\". Fallon stated, however, that the band would not be working on new material during the reunion: \\"I think Green Day's American Idiot is probably the best comeback or mid-career record that any band has done. So if I was sitting on American Idiot level stuff, then I might push for the, 'Hey guys, maybe we should try these songs out.' But I'm not sitting on that. I don't have a Born to Run in me.\\" Fallon elaborated, \\"People will always say, ‚ÄòWhy are you doing a solo record?‚Äô And I‚Äôm like, ‚Äòbecause I don‚Äôt have anything to say with Gaslight‚Äô. Those five records, that‚Äôs what you got. That‚Äôs the piece. I feel it‚Äôs a lot like The Replacements. There‚Äôs no new music because that‚Äôs all Paul Westerberg and the band has to say. When the book is over, it‚Äôs over. And I have like‚Ä¶ four-and-a-half records I‚Äôm really proud of.\\" In June 2018, the band released The 59 Sound Sessions, a 10th anniversary album of 9 early versions and B sides from The '59 Sound. They then celebrated this milestone with a tour through North America and Europe.  Description and influences  The New York Times music critic Jon Caramanica described the band as \\"part of a rich tradition of New Jersey punk, spanning the Misfits to the Bouncing Souls.\\" The Gaslight Anthem's music also embraces many elements of the Jersey Shore sound. Brian Fallon's fondness for Springsteen, a significant influence on their music, is a fact celebrated by fans and critics alike. However, the band claims they never set out to sound like the New Jersey icon. Representative of such views, one critic wrote, \\"The Gaslight Anthem are like something out of speculative fiction: this is what pop music would be if Springsteen hadn't listened to his producer, let The Ramones record Hungry Heart, and launched the C.B.G.B.'ers into megastardom.\\"\\"Review of 'Senor and the Queen.'\\" Sobriquet Magazine Record Reviews, May 12, 2008 Drummer Benny Horowitz and guitarist Alex Rosamilia stated that \\"We're more Bruce Springsteen appreciators. We didn't start listening to him until we joined the band. I always liked his songs when I heard them, but I wasn't a big fan until I met Brian [Fallon].\\" Following the release of their third album, American Slang, Fallon himself said, \\"There's so much else that we look at for our sound and influences that you don't want to be notched in with one guy... There's a lot of things [Springsteen] does that I admire. We come from a lot of the same places but a lot of different places, too. But at the same time, that's a good thing to be compared to. I think it's one of those things we're gonna have to wear until it wears out.\\" Of the Springsteen comparisons, Rosamilia added, \\"I think there's enough out there on the Internet about that already.\\" The song \\"I'da Called You Woody, Joe\\" is a tribute to Joe Strummer, who has been spoken about and referenced by lead singer Brian Fallon often. Similarly, Tom Petty is referenced in several songs, either by name or through references to particular songs of his. The band has covered Petty's \\"American Girl\\" and \\"Refugee\\" live. As a bonus track for the deluxe version of Handwritten, the Gaslight Anthem covered the Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers song \\"You Got Lucky\\".

ErbB3 is a member of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR/ERBB) family of receptor tyrosine kinases. The kinase-impaired ErbB3 is known to form active heterodimers with other members of the ErbB family, most notably the ligand binding-impaired ErbB2.  Gene and expression  The human ERBB3 gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 12 (12q13). It is encoded by 23,651 base pairs and translates into 1342 amino acids. During human development, ERBB3 is expressed in skin, bone, muscle, nervous system, heart, lungs, and intestinal epithelium. ERBB3 is expressed in normal adult human gastrointestinal tract, reproductive system, skin, nervous system, urinary tract, and endocrine system.  Structure  ErbB3, like the other members of the ErbB receptor tyrosine kinase family, consists of an extracellular domain, a transmembrane domain, and an intracellular domain. The extracellular domain contains four subdomains (I-IV). Subdomains I and III are leucine-rich and are primarily involved in ligand binding. Subdomains II and IV are cysteine-rich and most likely contribute to protein conformation and stability through the formation of disulfide bonds. Subdomain II also contains the dimerization loop required for dimer formation. The cytoplasmic domain contains a juxtamembrane segment, a kinase domain, and a C-terminal domain. Unliganded receptor adopts a conformation that inhibits dimerization. Binding of neuregulin to the ligand binding subdomains (I and III) induces a conformational change in ErbB3 that causes the protrusion of the dimerization loop in subdomain II, activating the protein for dimerization.  Function  ErbB3 has been shown to bind the ligands heregulin and NRG-2. Ligand binding causes a change in conformation that allows for dimerization, phosphorylation, and activation of signal transduction. ErbB3 can heterodimerize with any of the other three ErbB family members. The theoretical ErbB3 homodimer would be non-functional because the kinase-impaired protein requires transphosphorylation by its binding partner to be active. Unlike the other ErbB receptor tyrosine kinase family members which are activated through autophosphorylation upon ligand binding, ErbB3 was found to be kinase impaired, having only 1/1000 the autophosphorylation activity of EGFR and no ability to phosphorylate other proteins. Therefore, ErbB3 must act as an allosteric activator. = Interaction with ErbB2 = The ErbB2-ErbB3 dimer is considered the most active of the possible ErbB dimers, in part because ErbB2 is the preferred dimerization partner of all the ErbB family members, and ErbB3 is the preferred partner of ErbB2. This heterodimer conformation allows the signaling complex to activate multiple pathways including the MAPK, PI3K/Akt, and PLCŒ≥. There is also evidence that the ErbB2-ErbB3 heterodimer can bind and be activated by EGF-like ligands. = Activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway = The intracellular domain of ErbB3 contains 6 recognition sites for the SH2 domain of the p85 subunit of PI3K. ErbB3 binding causes the allosteric activation of p110Œ±, the lipid kinase subunit of PI3K, a function not found in either EGFR or ErbB2.  Role in cancer  While no evidence has been found that ErbB3 overexpression, constitutive activation, or mutation alone is oncogenic, the protein as a heterodimerization partner, most critically with ErbB2, is implicated in growth, proliferation, chemotherapeutic resistance, and the promotion of invasion and metastasis. ErbB3 is associated with targeted therapeutic resistance in numerous cancers including resistance to: * HER2 inhibitors in HER2+ breast cancers * anti-estrogen therapy in ER+ breast cancers * EGFR inhibitors in lung and head and neck cancers * hormones in prostate cancers * IGF1R inhibitors in hepatomas * BRAF inhibitors in melanoma ErbB2 overexpression may promote the formation of active heterodimers with ErbB3 and other ErbB family members without the need for ligand binding, resulting in weak but constitutive signaling activity.  Role in normal development  ERBB3 is expressed in the mesenchyme of the endocardial cushion, which will later develop into the valves of the heart. ErbB3 null mouse embryos show severely underdeveloped atrioventricular valves, leading to death at embryonic day 13.5. Although this function of ErbB3 depends on neuregulin, it does not seem to require ErbB2, which is not expressed in the tissue. ErbB3 also seems to be required for neural crest differentiation and the development of the sympathetic nervous system and neural crest derivatives such as Schwann cells.

Joy (1924 ‚Äì June 26, 1998) was the author of several books on Canadian language demographics. In 1967, he self-published the groundbreaking book, Languages in Conflict: The Canadian Experience, in which he used statistics from the 1961 census to demonstrate a number of points which ran counter to the accepted wisdom of the day: *Birthrates in Quebec were plunging, which meant that the French language could no longer keep pace with English purely through natural increase; *French was in serious decline outside of Quebec and a bilingual belt stretching eastwards into New Brunswick and west into eastern and north-eastern Ontario; *English was in decline in all parts of Quebec other than Montreal. Based on these considerations, Joy came to the following sombre conclusion: In 1972, the book was re-published by Carleton University Press. Joy updated his findings periodically, based on the results of the most recent decennial census. His second book, Canada's Official Language Minorities, was published by the C.D. Howe Institute in 1978. His third book, Canada's Official Languages: The Progress of Bilingualism, was published by the University of Toronto Press in 1992. In this book, Joy concluded that ‚Äúthe data from the language questions of the 1986 census do not yield a straightforward answer to the administrator‚Äôs question: to what extent does the population of each municipality wish to be offered service in the minority language? ‚Ä¶.

It invites over 30 high-schools from across the North Country to participate in a quizbowl-style tournament. It debuted in 1980, and has been on the air since. The show airs on WPBS Mondays through Thursdays at 7:30 p.m in the months of October and November. The American Championship Game starts at 8:00 p.m. The Championship Match is an hour-long show, with double the amount of questions. Whiz Quiz was hosted by Glenn Gough, a former sports anchor for WWNY-TV. In the fall of 1979, Glenn joined WPBS as a producer. In 1980, when Whiz Quiz premiered, he was co-host alongside Eddie Carvin. Glenn was on the show from its inception until his retirement in 2018. Glenn was replaced by Jeremy Graves for the 2018 season. Jeremy has since been replaced by Joleene DesRosiers for the 2019 season. Format Whiz Quiz is a knock-out bracket style tournament. A school progressively competes against other schools until that school loses. One loss means elimination from the competition. The team that competes on television consists of four players. However, a school's entire team may have many more alternates and also includes the advisor(s). The team of four stands behind a booth with four buzzers. In 2007 the booths were painted orange, an endorsement of WPBS's support for Syracuse University. The game lasts for 25 minutes and is divided into four rounds. Correct answers score ten points, Bonus questions score 15. The winner and runner-up of the entire competition receive trophies as well as cash scholarships granted by the Rotary Club. The Canadian and American Finals as well as the international finals are hour-long games. The first and second International Finals were won by Carthage Central High School (of Carthage, NY, US, led by coach Jennifer Hanno) in 2001 (team members: Justin Reilly, Aaron Kratzat, Dustin Lackey, Joshua Pucci) and 2002 (team members: Justin Reilly, Aaron Kratzat, Nathan Wakefield, Robert Newton, Erik LaLone, Lauren Streeter).

The other team cannot answer the question. Five seconds are given to teammates to converse with each other and ring in to give an answer. Around 12 questions are asked in this round. Questions are worth 10 points each. =Round 2: One- on-One= The players are matched up against corresponding position players on the other team. Chair 1 against chair 1, Chair 2 against Chair 2, etc. Talking with teammates is not allowed in this round. 12 questions are asked in this round; 3 to each chair. Questions are worth 10 points each. =Round 3: Know- And-Tell= Know-And-Tell is a toss-up round, in which either team can answer. Tossups are worth 10 points each. Conversations with team members are allowed. Some questions have bonuses attached to them. Bonus questions are worth fifteen points and awarded to the team that gets the related question right. This round concludes with a section called four of a kind. Four questions of a common topic are asked. =Round 4: Think Fast= In this round, wrong answers now yield a free question for the other team that the incorrect team cannot answer. Originally, the rules stated that wrong answers would yield a deduction of points from a team's score. If a tie results at the end of this round, the game continues in a sudden death format.

Function  This gene encodes a subunit of interleukin 12, a cytokine that acts on T and natural killer cells, and has a broad array of biological activities. Interleukin 12 is a disulfide-linked heterodimer composed of the 40 kD cytokine receptor like subunit encoded by this gene, and a 35 kD subunit encoded by IL12A. This cytokine is expressed by activated macrophages that serve as an essential inducer of Th1 cells development. This cytokine has been found to be important for sustaining a sufficient number of memory/effector Th1 cells to mediate long-term protection to an intracellular pathogen. Overexpression of this gene was observed in the central nervous system of patients with multiple sclerosis (MS), suggesting a role of this cytokine in the pathogenesis of the disease. The promoter gene polymorphism of this gene has been reported to be associated with the severity of atopic and non-atopic asthma in children. = Role as IL-23 subunit = Interleukin-12 p40 also serves as a subunit of Interleukin 23.

He is notable for being awarded an exceptionally high level of public research funding and for piloting a trans disciplinary international research partnership network. As a child, Bednarski also worked in Montreal, Quebec and Toronto, Ontario as an actor.  Personal Life  Steven Bednarski was born in 1973 to Anglophone parents in Montreal. His mother was a homemaker and his father a secondary school mathematics teacher. He has two younger brothers. During his childhood, changes to the language laws of Qu√©bec meant he was part of the first generation of English-speaking Montreal school children afforded the opportunity to attend public school equally in both English and French within the then-English language Catholic School Board, the now-defunct Montreal Baldwin-Cartier English Catholic School Board. In 1989, Bednarski‚Äôs family moved from the Canadian francophone province of Qu√©bec to the predominantly English-speaking province of Ontario. Bednarski currently lives in Waterloo, Ontario, with his wife and children.  Child Actor  At the age of eight, Bednarski‚Äôs mother registered him and his siblings with a local modelling agency and this opportunity soon led the siblings to active careers as child actors. His most notable roles were the English voices of Astro Boy (produced by Montreal's Cinelume Studios in 1985), Roobear in Adventures of the Little Koala, and Chad in Sailor Moon. At the time Astro Boy was dubbed from Japanese into English, Canadian voice-over regulations did not require producers to list voice actors' credits at the end of their productions. As a result, although his voice aired for over a decade and a half on TV, VHS, and DVD, he received no official recognition for his contribution and did not receive royalties. By the time Sailor Moon aired, however, ACTRA (the Alliance of Canadian Cinema, Television, and Radio Artists) had negotiated credits for dubbing. As a result, his name does appear in the list of credits for Sailor Moon. His brothers Robert and Andrew are also actors. He also voiced Rosey's scientific archenemies Jeffrey and Matthew in the ABC animated series Little Rosey. Bednarski also appeared on camera in a number of film and television productions. His first lead role on camera was for a National Film Board of Canada short film, The Cap, where he co-starred with Michael Ironside. In 1985, he played Young Kevin in the film adaptation of Mordecai Richler‚Äôs novel of the same name, Joshua Then And Now. His most notable on-camera role, however, was in the 1988 horror film, PIN, in which he played Young Leon alongside Terry O‚ÄôQuinn. Overall, Bednarski‚Äôs work in the Canadian entertainment industry spanned two decades. In 2002, he received a SSHRC postdoctoral grant which prevented him from working outside of academia and he officially retired as an actor.  Education  Bednarski began his education in 1985 at Loyola High School, Montreal, a Jesuit private school for boys with a strong Liberal Arts tradition. At the time, the school still required students to study Latin for the first two years of their secondary school education. Subsequently, upon moving from Montreal to Toronto, he attended Glendon College, the bilingual (French and English) campus of York University, Toronto. There, he received an Honors Bachelor of Arts degree in History and Linguistics, and studied under Andr√©e Courtemanche, a French- Canadian medieval historian. After working with Courtemanche‚Äôs historical records from Provence, Bednarski began his MA studies in the History Department at the University of Toronto on a full scholarship from the Province of Ontario. Upon graduation from this MA program, Bednarski attended the Universit√© du Qu√©bec √† Montr√©al (UQAM) where he pursued doctoral studies under the co-supervision of Michel H√©bert and Andr√©e Courtemanche. His doctoral research was funded by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC). In the fourth and final year of his doctoral studies, Bednarski was invited to apply for, and subsequently received, a prestigious SSHRC Postdoctoral Fellowship, hosted at the Centre for Medieval Studies at the University of Toronto.  Research  = Late Medieval Proven√ßal Criminal History = Bednarski‚Äôs MA, PhD, and Postdoctoral research was derived from and largely based upon a large-scale study of thousands of criminal registers conserved from the Proven√ßal town of Mansoque. His PhD thesis, entitled ‚ÄúCrime, justice et r√©gulation sociale √† Manosque, 1340 ‚Äì 1403‚Äù (‚ÄúCrime, Justice and Social R√©gulation in Manosque, 1340 ‚Äì 1403‚Äù) is based on the approach of social history and looks at how ordinary people used a local municipal court to resolve disputes and advance their own agendas, even as the court worked to establish its legitimacy over daily life. This research became the basis for Bednarski‚Äôs first monograph, Curia: A Social History of a Court, Crime, And Conflict, published through the Presses Universitaires de la M√©diterran√©e. = Microhistory = Bednarski‚Äôs forays into premodern criminal archives and his interest in social history inclined him toward microhistory, a genre of historical writing rooted in narrative tale-telling, which uses a single, telling historical ‚Äúmoment‚Äù to unpack a wider world. Microhistorians like Bednarski often use criminal cases which they see as examples of the ‚Äúexceptional normal,‚Äù instances in which boundaries are transgressed illicitly, thereby allowing them to trace the counters of the licit. Moreover, they feel that such trial records often contain a wealth of information about everyday life everyday people. This approach is rooted in the Italian tradition established and developed beginning in the 1970s by historians such as Giovanni Levi, Carlo Ginsburg, Edward Muir, and Gene Brucker. The genre famously influenced scholars of French premodern history such as Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie and Natalie Zemon Davis. Drawing on his most extensive criminal register from Provence, and building on research first proposed to him and initially developed by Andr√©e Courtemanche, Bednarski worked collaboratively with his students to write A Poisoned Past: The Life of Times of Margarita de Portu, an Accused Poisoner, which appeared through the University of Toronto Press. This, his second monograph, was the first ever pedagogical microhistory. It tells the tale of a young Proven√ßal woman who suffered from seizures and was accused by her brother-in-law, but subsequently acquitted, of using poison or sorcery to murder her older husband. In the book, Bednarski alternates between tale- telling and interjecting his own authorial voice. He challenges the reader to consider his own role in shaping the narrative and plays with different historical interpretations of the source material. A Poisoned Past was widely reviewed and well received by critics. Its approach and success helped secure for him in 2017 the international D2L Award for Innovation in Teaching and Learning from the Society for Teaching and Learning in Higher Education. = Late Medieval Environmental History = In 2012, Bednarski conducted a sabbatical abroad as Scholar in Residence at Queen‚Äôs University‚Äôs Bader International Study Centre (BISC) at Herstmonceux Castle. There, in a partnership he negotiated between his own institution, the BISC, and Queen‚Äôs University, he developed a proposal for a research partnership that began to explore the relationship between climate change, land use, and settlement on the Herstmonceux estate. In 2013, he applied for and received four-years of seed funding in the form of a $200,000 SSHRC Partnership Development Grant (PDG). With those funds, Bednarski created a large number of training opportunities for Canadian students to live, study, and work in the UK. Building on his initial partnership with Queen‚Äôs University, Bednarski expanded his network, Environments of Change, to include an initial working group of thirty scholars and fifteen agencies (not-for-profits, educational sector partners, and private-sector partners). Environments of Change aims to find ways of using emerging digital technologies to explore the historical relationship between natural environment and human culture in late medieval England. As part of that effort, Bednarski launched Canada‚Äôs first digital humanities lab dedicated to the study of climate and culture, the Medieval DRAGEN (Digital Research in Arts and Graphical Environmental Networks) Lab at St. Jerome‚Äôs University in the University of Waterloo. In April 2019, Bednarski received a SSHRC Partnership Grant valued at $2,500,000 which augments partner cash and in-kind contributions for a total initial operating value of $10,000,000. This amount of research funding places Bednarski as one of the most successful public grant applicants working in the discipline of History in Canada.  Career  Upon completing his academic formation, Bednarski taught as a contract faculty member in the History Department at York University. Between 2004 ‚Äì 2006, he also worked concurrently as a high school teacher at St. Michael‚Äôs College School, an elite Catholic preparatory school for boys founded by the Congregation of St. Basil and located in downtown Toronto. In 2006, he was appointed Assistant Professor of History at St. Jerome‚Äôs University in the University of Waterloo. In 2011, he was tenured and promoted to Associate Professor. In 2017, he was promoted to Full Professor. Bednarski also holds associate faculty appointments at the Centre for Medieval Studies at the University of Toronto and in the History Department at Queen‚Äôs University.  Awards & distinction  In addition to receiving a high level of research funding, Bednarski has won two teaching awards and other distinctions. Notably, in 2011, he was the recipient of theUniversity of Waterloo‚Äôs Distinguished Teacher Award and, in 2017, of the Society for Teaching and Learning in Higher Education‚Äôs D2L Innovation Award in Teaching and Learning. In 2019, he was the recipient of the Ontario Council for University Faculty Association‚Äôs (OCUFA) Lorimer Award for Collective Bargaining. 2019 ‚Äì 2027 SSHRC Partnership Grant (Stage 2) ($ 2,500,000 CAD as part of a total project value of approx. $ 10,000,000 CAD) 2018-2019 SSHRC Partnership Grant (Stage 1) ($ 20,000 CAD) 2018 SJU Faculty Research Grant ($ 6,785 CAD) 2017 STLHE - D2L Innovation Award in Teaching and Learning ($ 3,500 CAD) 2017 ‚Äì 2018 SJU Faculty Research Grant ($ 4,000 CAD) 2017 ‚Äì 2018 SSHRC Connection Grant ($ 25,000 CAD as part of a total project value of $ 40,500 CAD) 2016 SJU Faculty Research Grant ($ 5,000 CAD) 2015 SJU Faculty Research Grant ($ 7,500 CAD) 2014 ‚Äì 2018 SSHRC Partnership Development Grant (>$ 340,000 CAD) 2014 ‚Äì 2015 SJU Faculty Research Grant ($ 6,591.98 CAD) 2013 UW/SSHRC 4A Award ($ 8,000 CAD) 2011 University of Waterloo Distinguished Teacher Award ($ 1,500 CAD) 2011 ‚Äì 2013 SSHRC Insight Development Grant ($ 15,596 CAD) 2011 ‚Äì 2012 SJU Faculty Research Grant ($ 5,125 CAD) 2009 ‚Äì 2010 University of Waterloo SSHRC Seed Grant ($ 5,024.43 CAD) 2009 ‚Äì 2010 SJU Faculty Research Grant ($ 6,000 CAD) 2008 ‚Äì 2009 SJU Faculty Research Grant ($ 2,000 CAD) 2007 ‚Äì 2008 SJU Faculty Research Grant ($ 6,000 CAD) 2006 New Faculty Member Award for Grad.

It is published by the Herzog College, an affiliate of Yeshivat Har Etzion, two or three times a year. Along with Beit Mikra, it is one of the few journals that deal almost exclusively with analysis of the Tanakh. Megadim was first published around 1986. More than 45 issues were published by 2009. Some of the writers and editors for Megadim are Dr. Yosef Ofer and Dr. Mordechai Sabato from Bar-Ilan University; Dr. Shmuel Wygoda (a student of Emmanuel Levinas); Rabbi Yoel bin Nun, Rabbi Yaaqov Medan, and other notable members of the religious Zionism movement. The writers for Megadim include analysts of the Bible, lecturers at colleges, and advanced students, especially from Yeshivat Har Etzion and Herzog College. The guiding principle of Megadim is to maintain the balance between an academic standard on the one hand, and adherence to the faith of its intelligent religious Jewish audience on the other hand. Therefore, the most popular topics among the articles are literary analyses of the Bible and of Jewish commentators, which enable the adoption of scholarly approaches without needing to deal with loaded issues such as the Documentary Hypothesis or the origins of Christianity. The articles in Megadim are strictly peer reviewed before publication in order to maintain high standards. One of the weaknesses of the journal is an insufficient reliance on sources written in languages other than Hebrew.

The greatest user of sawn timber in past centuries was the shipbuilding industry. Sawing Large logs would be usually hauled to the site by horses. A sawyer is a person who cuts (\\"saws\\") wood for a living. Sawyers were at one time important members of the rural community, because many implements, as well as buildings, were made of wood. In England, the terms used were 'bottom sawyer', for the man standing in the pit, and 'top sawyer', for the man who balanced on the log. Together, the sawyers would alternate pulling the two-man saw through the log. If the saw kerf began closing, it could cause the saw to bind and increase friction; wedges, most often made of convenient bits of wood, could be inserted in order to keep the kerf open and reduce the friction. \\"Kerf\\" is an Anglo-Saxon word related to our modern day word 'carve'.The word Kerf Two- man saws were designed to cut in both directions and very careful tooth design was necessary to clear the sawdust during the cut. The sawdust accumulated to the extent that it had to be 'dug out' and removed in a bucket. Oak dust could be burned and used in the curing of bacon.Sturt, George (1963). The Wheelwright's Shop.. Cambridge University Press. . A small two-handled crosscut saw, not a pit saw which is a rip saw. The two man team would use a two handled saw, called a 'whipsaw', with 'saddleblocks' or 'dogs' to hold the log in position horizontally. Sawing was a slow and exhausting process, requiring strong men with great stamina. The topsawyer had to be especially strong because the saw was pulled in turn by each man, and the lower had the advantage of gravity. The topsawyer also had the important task of guiding the saw so that the board was of even thickness. This was often done by following a chalkline. In some cases the box handle on one end of the saw could be removed so the saw could be pulled free when the sawyers needed to move the timber to a new position.A detachable end to the saw. The top-sawyer's work had to be very accurate; it was he who kept a careful balance on the log and guided the long saw, who kept the cuts straight or curved as required, and who estimated the width of the planks. He was the man in charge of the operation, and it wasn't uncommon for nicknames such as 'William Top-sawyer' to be common currency in country areas.Memoirs of Country life. Saw pits were a crucial component of shipbuilding, for which planks of wood were necessary for the construction of all classes of vessels. The logs of wood to be sawn were placed over a pit on planks of wood called \\"dogs\\" in naval jargon. The senior sawyer stood on top of the plank. The junior one had to go into the pit, which was often partially filled with water, with sawdust constantly 'raining down,' so he stood in a layer of sawdust as a result.Brixham Museum model One theory of the origin of the terms 'top dog' and 'underdog' is that they come from saw pit work practices (however, others cite documentary evidence that these terms more likely arose from dog fighting).Dog fighting and the origin of Topdog, etc. Cutting from underneath a suspended log is sometimes called \\"underbucking\\". Ten foot logs were sometimes sawn into boards except for about the last two inches. In this way the boards could be more easily handled; then the boards were separated by cutting off the end of the log.Number of boards cut in a day. Up to 200 boards a day could be produced with water-driven power sawing, compared to the 12 or so a day by two men in a saw pit. A saw pit could, if circumstances demanded, be worked by a single person, the end of the saw being weighted with a stone or some other weight, and then raised and lowered by the sawyer.Paterson, Page 105 ;Views of the Kennox estate saw pit Image:Kennox sawpit 1.JPGThe main surviving retaining wall of the pit with the collapsed wall in the foreground.

A very early water driven Roman sawmill was in use in Hierapolis, the Hierapolis sawmill. Sawmills may well have been developed in the medieval period, as one was sketched by Villard de Honnecourt in c. 1250.Singer, Pages 643 - 4. There are claims that they were introduced to Madeira following its discovery in c. 1420 and spread widely in Europe in the 16th century.Peterson, Pages 84-5. The 'modern' sawmill was invented or perfected by the Dutchman Cornelis Corneliszoon (1550‚Äì1607) who applied a pitman arm onto a wind mill, which converted a turning motion into an up-an- down sawing motion. Cornelis took out a patent on his sawmill on December 15, 1593, and on the pitman arm device on December 6, 1597. Early sawmills adapted the whipsaw to mechanical power, generally driven by a water wheel. The circular motion of the wheel was changed to back-and-forth motion of the saw blade by the pitman arm or rod. A pitman is similar to a crankshaft, but in reverse (a crankshaft converts back-and-forth motion to circular motion). Several early sawmills in England were burned by sawyers who were fearful of losing their livelihoods. However, the increased efficiency of the sawmill, and the back-breaking nature of the saw pit work, resulted in saw pits generally going out of use in the United Kingdom at the time of the industrial revolution. Old OS maps circa 1860 often show the location of saw pits, but by the start of the 20th century very few remained and most are no longer in use. Roy Underhill tells the tall tale, or tongue-in-cheek story, that, after the development of steam-powered sawing machines, saw pits were unnecessary, and therefore were cut up and sold as post-holes. The Royal Dockyards Saw pits were introduced into the Royal Dockyards in the mid 18th century. Before their introduction, trestles were used to support the log, and a frame saw employed for the cutting. In the Royal Dockyards saw pits, the upper sawyer was called the 'Topman;' he followed the marked line to make a straight plank, and the 'Underman' pushed the rib, pit or whip saw. The logs were held firmly in place by 'G' shaped clamps called 'dogs' that were hammered into the log being cut. The pits were usually lined with elm wood, which withstood damp. Access to the saw pit was via steps or a ladder at one end. The sawyers were paid by the 100 foot runs, with pay related to the difficulty of sawing the wood, oak being the highest paid. Usually the sawyer was responsible for sharpening the saws, however on occasion a whet man was employed to do that work.Dodds and Moore, Page 46  Around the world  =Australia= Saw pits provided much of the sawn timber for Australia during the 1800s. Convicts were put to work in saw pits as a punishment in penal colonies in Tasmania. Saw pits also featured in some of the most significant events of early european Australian settlement. In August 1788, William Bligh captain of , anchored in Adventure Bay, Tasmania and ordered his crew to dig a saw pit in order to repair their boat. Eight months later the crew would go on to mutiny in the famous Mutiny on the Bounty. In January 1788, the first British fleet sailed into Botany Bay, then Sydney Cove to settle Sydney. Saw pits were promptly dug in both places so building timber could be produced. =New Zealand= Saw pits were prominent in the early european logging of New Zealand. Even with the introduction of water powered sawmills in the 1840s, and steam powered sawmills in 1865, saw pits were still being used in the early 1900s in difficult locations. A pit sawyer in New Zealand was well paid. For instance during the 1840s in Nelson a sawyer could earn 80 pounds in five months, more than double the average wage.  Micro history  The saw pit at Llanaeron Home Farm is unusually housed in a single-story open-fronted building. The rear wall is of rubble (stone) construction and there is a rubble pier at each of the front corners, with the whole structure under a pitched slate roof. Q-pits, used to make White coal, are often found nearby saw pits.Muir, Pages 91 - 92. William Shakespeare refers to saw pits in the Merry Wives of Windsor. Daniel Defoe's character, the 17th century castaway Robinson Crusoe, complains about how difficult it is to saw timber into planks without the use of a saw pit. Philip Wharton was born in 1613, and at the age of 12 (1625) he became the fourth Lord Wharton. In 1642 Lord Wharton raised a regiment of foot soldiers and a troop of horsemen to fight in the Battle of Edgehill. They behaved less than gloriously - \\"Before there were any near excuse three or four of our regiments fairly ran away - Sir William Fairfax's, Sir Henry Cholmley's, my Lord Kimbolton's and to say the plain truth my own.\\" Wharton himself ran away and is said to have hidden in a saw pit, thus earning for himself the parliamentary nickname of Philip 'Sawpit' Wharton.Sawpit Wharton. The settlement of Saw Pit in the United States of America eventually outgrew this name and became Port Chester by incorporating as a village in 1868.

His brother was cinematographer, film producer, and director Haskell Wexler. Business ventures By his early 30s, he was building a reputation for financing monumental skyscrapers, including 400 East Randolph a luxury apartment building in Chicago's Loop. With his father's help, he brokered the construction of the Executive Plaza Hotel on Wacker Drive (now known as Hotel 71). In 1979 he, along with his business partner Edward W. Ross, purchased the Drake Hotel. The Drake was successfully nominated for the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. In 1983, Wexler's Jupiter Industries, which had interests in the Playboy Building, Lake Point Tower, Michigan Avenue real estate, dozens of Chicago hotels, and property holdings in both New York City and Los Angeles, saved Goldblatt's from bankruptcy. Jupiter also developed the Vista International Hotel at the World Trade Center, later known as the Marriott World Trade Center, which was destroyed in the September 11, 2001 attacks. He was known for pioneering new development areas; the Executive Plaza was the first hotel in Chicago in decades, and the Vista was the first hotel in downtown Manhattan for decades. He also built the Outer Drive East development in Chicago, which expanded the downtown into an industrial and shipping area in decline.

Newly completed DFE Ascender III-C prior to first flight, 2004 DFE Ascender III-C in front of its hangar. The aircraft in the background is a Quad City Challenger II. The Pterodactyl Ascender is a family of U.S. designed and built ultralight aircraft that were sold in kit form between 1979 and 1984 under Pterodactyl Limited and is currently being sold by DFE Ultralights. With a total production of 1,396 aircraft between 1979 and 1984 plus limited production today as the DFE Ascender III series, the aircraft has been one of the most influential designs in ultralight aviation.Cliche, Andre: Ultralight Aircraft Shopper's Guide 8th Edition, pages B-4-5. Cybair Limited Publishing, 2001. Design and development The Pterodactyl designs have their roots in the Manta Fledge hang gliders of the 1970s. The Fledge was designed by Klaus Hill and produced by Manta Products in a series that ran from the Fledge I to the IV, with numerous sub models designated by letters. The Fledge series were of a \\"rigid-wing\\" type, as opposed to the predominantly \\"flex-wing\\" hang glider designs then common. These designs all featured weight-shift pitch control and tip-rudders for yaw and roll control. The tip rudders were controlled by control-bar sliders which deployed one tip rudder at a time to create a yaw. The glider's swept wing then translated the yaw into a matched rolling motion. The Fledge series were considered to be high performance hang gliders during their production run in the 1970s. California inventor Jack McCornack took the Fledge IIB wing and designed a tubular assembly that replaced the Fledge's hang glider seat with a reclined pilot seat, wheeled landing gear and engine mount for a pusher powerplant. The aircraft used a mouth-controlled throttle, as both hands were used on the tip rudder twist grips which were retained from the Fledge. The aircraft was tailless. Power was supplied by a two-stroke Xenoah engine of 16 horsepower driving a 36-inch propeller. This new design, named the Pterodactyl Fledgling, was first flown in 1977. It is also referred to variously as the Pterodactyl Fledge and Pfledge. The aircraft was first publicly displayed at an ultralight fly-in at Gilroy, California in 1978. McCornack formed Pterodactyl Limited to produce an improved version of the design, designated the Fledge X powered by the Xenoah 242 engine. In 1979 McCornack and his flying partner, Keith Nicely, flew two improved Fledglings from their base in Monterey, California, to Oshkosh, Wisconsin, where they made a positive impression on the large gathering of pilots at the EAA annual convention there. At the convention they were invited by Mother Earth News magazine to fly the aircraft on to the Atlantic coast on pure ethanol supplied by the magazine. The flight from coast to coast was one of the longest trips of the period and garnered much attention for the start-up company. Limited production of the version flown to Oshkosh started in the fall of 1979. The model was called the Pterodactyl Pfledge OR (Oshkosh Replica) and was powered by a Sachs SA-340 336 cc direct drive two-stroke engine.McCornack, Jack: Ptimes, Volume 1 Number 3. Pterodactyl Limited, Winter 1979. Construction of all Pterodactyl aircraft was predominantly of anodized 6061-T6 aluminum tubing, braced with swaged steel cables supported by a king post and with a sewn Dacron sail for wing covering. Fittings to join the tubing were either extruded or made from sheet and bolted together.McCornack, Jack: Ptimes, Volume 1 Number 1. Pterodactyl Limited, Summer 1979. The company was moved in 1980 from Monterey to a new facility co-located with the Seventh-day Adventist Monterey Bay Academy at Watsonville, California, and series production of the Pfledge was commenced. The new location was ideal as it included access to the Monterey Bay Academy Airport. The design went through a series of evolutionary improvements, mostly involving the powerplants installed and these resulted in a number of different models.McCornack, Jack: Ptimes, Volume 1 Number 4. Pterodactyl Limited, Winter 1979. Pterodactyl production commenced in 1979 and was completed in 1984, when the company was sold to a group of partners under the name \\"Freedom Fliers\\" and moved to Rowlett, Texas. The company quickly went out of business, and few aircraft were completed. McCornack was never paid for the sale of the company. A total of 1,396 aircraft were built by Pterodactyl. =DFE Ultralights= In 1991 one of McCornack's original dealers from 1978, Dave Froble, started producing parts to keep his own fleet of Pterodactyls flying. He located and purchased the old stock of Manta Products airframe parts and produced CAD drawings for the complete parts. In 1992 Froble started making parts available and later offered kits for complete aircraft in three models under the company name DFE Ultralights (Dave Froble Enterprises). These were very similar to the original Pfledge and Ascender series and were named Ascender III, with letters to designate the various models. DFE Ultralights has produced a small number of complete kits and continues to support the fleet of existing aircraft with parts to keep them flying. Operational history In the USA the single seat Pterodactyl models are flown as ultralights under FAR 103, whereas the two seat models are usually registered as experimental amateur-builts. In Canada all Pterodactyls are classified as Basic Ultra-lights. Pterodactyls have been flown on many long flights. John D. (Jack) Peterson, Jr. completed a flight in a Pfledge from Long Beach, California to Hilton Head, South Carolina over a period of 29 days between July 9 and August 6, 1979, with ground support. He flew the distance by flying distances of a maximum of 120 miles (194 km) in a single flight. This feat was the first time that an ultralight airplane had been flown across the US from coast to coast. Peterson's aircraft is on display in the Smithsonian Museum's Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center. McCornack and Nicely's 1979 flight from Monterey, California, to Oshkosh, Wisconsin, and on to the Atlantic coast was the second transcontinental flight by this aircraft type and was done mostly without ground support. Variants ;Pfledge :The first Pfledges (also referred to as Fledges, and Fledglings) were tailless flying wings powered by a two-stroke Xenoah engine driving a 36-inch propeller. Some were also powered by a 136 cc Chrysler two stroke engine. ;Pfledge X :The Pfledge X featured a Xenoah 242 powerplant that produced . ;Pfledge OR :The \\"Oshkosh Replica\\" was the production version of the two aircraft that were flown coast to coast in 1979. It was powered by a German Sachs SA-340 direct drive engine with a 336 cc displacement. This model sold for USD$2,850 in 1980. ;Pfledge 430D :The Pfledge 430D was announced late in 1979. This model featured a Cuyuna 430D engine which McCornack helped design. The engine was a two cylinder, two stroke engine with a displacement of 429 cc and a power output of . It weighed . The \\"D\\" indicated that the engine was direct drive and not connected to the propeller through a reduction drive system. :The Pfledge 430D also replaced the twist grips with a conventional stick for roll control, originally developed by Paul Yarnell, while pitch remained via weight shift. :The Pfledge 430D cost USD$3600 in 1980. ;NFL :Before the introduction of its FAR 103 ultralight regulations in 1982 the FAA did not regulate ultralights as long as they were foot-launchable.McCornack, Jack: Ptimes, Volume 2 Number 1. Pterodactyl Limited, Spring 1980. :The demand from conventional aircraft pilots for a version of the Pfledge that had aerodynamic pitch control instead of weight-shift led McCornack to add an elevator to the back of the aircraft, mounted on twin booms behind the pusher propeller. Because this design was \\"Not Foot Launchable\\" it was called the NFL (pronounced \\"Niffle\\"). The design was not a production success and few were built, but the NFL paved the way for the Ptraveler and Ascender to follow. ;Ptraveler :McCornack had first installed a canard elevator on a Pfledge in 1978, but did not create a production model until 1980. The canard was operated by a side-mounted control stick. Fore-and-aft movement of the stick moved the canard and sideways movement controlled the tip-rudders. The canard was constructed with tubular spars, aluminum ribs and covered in standard aircraft fabric. :In the Early 1980s a Pterodactyl pilot named Jeff Ballas attended the Sun-N-Fun fly-in and was impressed with the mylar covering on the Lazair. He bought a roll of mylar and some tape, went home and re-covered his canard with the clear mylar. This experiment was a success. The handling of an Ascender with the lightweight mylar was much lighter and increased the nimble feeling of the aircraft. :The new model carried the name \\"Ptraveler\\", continuing the use of the silent letter \\"P\\" in Pterodactyl designs. :The new model was powered by the Cuyuna 430D direct drive engine and was introduced in 1980 at a price of USD$3900. ;Ascender :The Cuyuna 430D powerplant was greatly improved by the addition of a 2:1 belt reduction drive, allowing larger propellers of 54 inches diameter to be used. This produced more thrust and less noise. The modified powerplant was called the Cuyuna 430R.McCornack, Jack: Ptimes, Volume 2 Number 2. Pterodactyl Limited, Late Spring 1981. :Fitting the new powerplant into the Ptraveler drastically improved the aircraft's take-off and climb performance. The new model was named the \\"Ascender\\" for its improved climb rate and also in tribute to the Curtiss- Wright XP-55 Ascender, an early canard fighter design. In 1981 a complete kit cost USD$4200. ;Ascender II :The Ascender II was an improved Ascender with evolutionary changes incorporated. It had an improved muffler, re-located throttle and fiberglass spring rod main landing gear suspension. ;Psounder :The Pterodactyl Psounder was a one-of-a kind Ascender II that was modified for an atmospheric research project at Colorado State University.McCornack, Jack: Ptimes Volume 3. Pterodactyl Limited, Late 1982. ;Ptug :The Ptug was a special hang glider towing version of the Ascender II that was modified with a special rigid bridle to ensure that the tow rope stayed clear of the propeller. ;Ptiger :By adding a fiberglass tub in place of the basic Ascender II+ airframe, along with clipping the wing by to a span, the result was a new model named the \\"Ptiger\\". With the Cuyuna 430R the aircraft was capable of in level flight.McCornack, Jack: Ptimes Volume 2, Number 3 & 4\\\\. Pterodactyl Limited, June 1982. :Under the rules of the time it could not be foot-launched and Pterodactyl advised purchasers to register their Ptigers as experimental amateur-built aircraft With the advent of FAR 103 and the alternate worksheet, the Ptiger conformed and became a legal Ultralight. ;Ascender II+ :The Ascender II+ was introduced in early 1982 and was aimed at the physically larger pilot. This redesigned model incorporated a wider 20-1/2 inch hang cage. All earlier models had a hang cage. It also had stronger upright struts and wing with 1-3/4 inch spars of 0.049 inch thickness, whereas all earlier models used 1-1/2 inch spars of 0.049 inch thickness and heavier 1/8 inch outer bottom cables. :The Ascender II+ sold for USD$5260 in 1983. ;Ascender II+2 :The Ascender II+, with its additional structural strength lent itself to the creation of a two-seat trainer version. This was designed by adding an off-center \\"sidecar\\" frame to hold the second seat and was named the \\"Ascender II+2\\". There was no dual control installation, as both pilots had access to the single side-stick control. :The II+2 was first marketed in the middle of 1982 at a price of USD$5560. ;Light Flyer :The final aircraft design and produced by Pterodactyl was based on the Easy Riser wing and was a tribute to the Wright Flyer. The Light Flyer introduced practical improvements over the original Wright brothers design, such as wheeled landing gear instead of fixed skids, allowing taxiing. The aircraft was introduced in 1984 at a price of USD$5400, but only about five were sold. ;DFE Ascender III-A :The Ascender III-A is similar to the original Pterodactyl Pfledge. It lacks a canard and pitch control is by weight shift, although it incorporates some refinements, such as nose wheel steering. The 2003 price was USD$6800.Vandermeullen, Richard: 2012 Kit Aircraft Buyer's Guide, Kitplanes, Volume 28, Number 12, December 2011, page 50. Belvoir Publications. ISSN 0891-1851 ;DFE Ascender III-B :The Ascender III-B is similar to the Pterodactyl Ascender II with the addition of nose wheel steering and in 2003 sold for USD$7900. ;DFE Ascender III-C :The Ascender III-C is equivalent to the Pterodactyl Ascender II+ with the heavy-duty style airframe. It sold for USD$8100 in 2003. :Like the Ascender II+, the Ascender III-C can be fitted with a sidecar to become a two- seat trainer version. ;DFE Ascender III-T :The Ascender III-T is similar to the Pterodactyl Ascender II Ptug hang glider tug aircraft and incorporates a bridle to fit around the propeller to attach the tow rope to.

Located near modern-day Ponca City, it was founded by Colonel George Washington Miller, a veteran of the Confederate Army, in 1893.Hoy, Jim, Cattle Industry,\\" Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture (accessed March 5, 2015). The 101 Ranch was the birthplace of the 101 Ranch Wild West Show and one of the early focal points of the oil rush in northeastern Oklahoma. It was the largest diversified farm and ranch in America at the time. Bill Pickett's grave and the White Eagle Monument are located on the ranch grounds. The location of the former working cattle ranch was subdivided and all of its buildings destroyed. An area of the ranch is a National Historic Landmark. In 2003, the ranch was inducted into the Texas Trail of Fame. In 1903, when Colonel George Miller died, his three sons, Joseph, George Jr., and Zack took over operation of the 110,000 acre ranch. By 1932 most of the land was owned by the Miller family. They leased other land from the Ponca, Pawnee, and Otoe Indians in Kay, Noble, Osage and Pawnee Counties.\\"The 101 Ranch\\", Ellsworth Collings, University of Oklahoma Press; Reprint edition (March 1986) .

Located at 207 W. Grand in Ponca City, OK The Miller Brothers 101 Ranch Wild West Show wagons Pawnee Bill and Zack Miller on horseback in Oklahoma The Millers' neighbor Major Gordon W. Lillie, who performed as Pawnee Bill, motivated the Millers to produce a Wild West Show of their own. The Millers made their transition from putting on local shows to the national scene in 1907, when they performed at the Jamestown Exposition in Virginia. Later in 1907, the Miller Brothers 101 Ranch Wild West Show began the tour circuit in Brighton Beach, New York.\\"Buffalo Astray from Show,\\" The New York Times, July 24, 1907. Joe Miller, the eldest son, was an exceptional equestrian and star performer. Over the course of the show's history, its cast included Lillian Smith, Bill Pickett, Bessie Herberg, Bee Ho Gray, Tom Mix, Jack Hoxie, Mexican Joe, Ross Hettan, and an elderly Buffalo Bill. The Miller brothers came late into Wild West Show business and suffered financially along with the other shows after the invention of motion pictures. Their show had more problems than most in a business that was harsh in the best of times. During their first year on the circuit, they suffered a serious railroad accident. Later several members of their cast contracted typhoid fever. In 1908, when Buffalo Bill and Pawnee Bill combined their shows into an extravaganza that broke records at Madison Square Gardens in New York City, the Miller Brothers took their show abroad. In England, the British military confiscated most of the 101's horses, stagecoaches, and automobiles to build up for war, as tensions were building related to the pending World War I. When the Millers' show toured in Germany, authorities arrested some of their Oglala Sioux performers on suspicion of being Serbian spies, they were never seen again. A frantic Zack Miller managed to get the rest of cast out of Germany via Norway, and then to England. Once in London, however, he had difficulty finding a steamship that would sell his people passage. Finally, he obtained passage for his cast on an American ship. Once the cast returned to Oklahoma, the eldest brother Joe Miller refused to pay the Indian cast overtime. As a result, the entire Indian cast quit the show. By 1916, the two younger Miller brothers abandoned trying to work with their volatile oldest brother. George Jr. and Zack worked at the ranch, while Joe schemed to make the Wild West Show a financial success. Joe Miller hired an out-of-work, aging, and ill Buffalo Bill to star in a World War I recruitment show called the \\"Pageant of Preparedness.\\" Soon Cody quit the show; he died within a year. Still unwilling to let the show close, Joe continued to operate on a smaller scale. In 1927, Joe was unsuccessful in his attempts to sell his show to the American Circus Corporation. thumb = Oil and Miller brothers' decline = In 1908 the Millers entered into a leasing arrangement with E. W. Marland, who formed the 101 Ranch Oil Company. Oil was struck in 1911 at the \\"Willie-Cries-for-War\\" well. Marland would become a millionaire and later a U.S congressman. He was eventually elected the governor of Oklahoma.John Joseph Mathews, E. W. Marland: Life and Death of an Oil Man, p. 80. (Norman: University of Oklahoma Press, (1985): The company's 1911 oil discovery led to the founding of the Marland Oil Company, later renamed the Continental Oil Company, and then ConocoPhillips. On October 21, 1927 a neighbor found Joe Miller dead in the 101 Ranch garage with his car running. The family physician ruled his death accidental. In 1929, George Miller, Jr., died in a car accident. Zack Miller tried to carry on alone, but in 1932, during the Great Depression, he filed for bankruptcy. The US government seized the show's remaining assets and bought of the 101 Ranch. Completely broke, the 101 Ranch show closed after the New York World's Fair in 1939. Zack Miller died of cancer in 1952.  National Historic Landmark  A small portion of the ranch property was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1975. and After Zack Miller's bankruptcy, the federal Farm Security Administration (FSA) divided the remaining ranch lands and sold off parcels to individuals. The 101 Ranch house and most other buildings were torn down. The 101 Ranch store remained standing until September 22, 1987, when it burned in a fire of unknown origins.Palmer, Griff, \\"Flames Destroy Bid to Preserve 101 Ranch Store,\\" Daily Oklahoman, Sept. 23, 1987. Few of the 101 Ranch buildings are left standing today. In 1990, the Oklahoma Legislature designated State Highway 156 as the 101 Ranch Memorial Road. An historical marker is located on the highway about southwest of Ponca City. Little of the former 101 Ranch estate remains today. Nearly all of the buildings were destroyed and the land subdivided and sold after the Miller Brothers' final bankruptcy.

Function  Synaptic vesicles store neurotransmitters that are released during calcium-regulated exocytosis. The specificity of neurotransmitter release requires the localization of both synaptic vesicles and calcium channels to the presynaptic active zone. Syntaxins function in this vesicle fusion process. Syntaxin-1A is a member of the syntaxin superfamily. Syntaxins are nervous system-specific proteins implicated in the docking of synaptic vesicles with the presynaptic plasma membrane. Syntaxins possess a single C-terminal transmembrane domain, a SNARE [Soluble NSF (N-ethylmaleimide- sensitive fusion protein)-Attachment protein REceptor] domain (known as H3), and an N-terminal regulatory domain (Habc). Syntaxins bind synaptotagmin in a calcium-dependent fashion and interact with voltage dependent calcium and potassium channels via the C-terminal H3 domain. Syntaxin-1A is a key protein in ion channel regulation and synaptic exocytosis.  Clinical significance  Syntaxins serve as a substrate for botulinum neurotoxin type C, a metalloprotease that blocks exocytosis and has high affinity for a molecular complex that includes the alpha-latrotoxin receptor which produces explosive exocytosis.

Sessa later became a government witness.  Biography  = Murders = After becoming a government witness, Sessa admitted to personally murdering four people. In September 1984, Sessa murdered Mary Bari, a former girlfriend of then Colombo consigliere Alphonse Persico. When Persico went into hiding to avoid an indictment, the family decided to kill Bari out of concern that she knew Persico's location. Bari was lured into Sessa's social club Occasions on the pretext of a job interview. When Bari arrived, Sessa shot her three times to the head. In May 1988, Sessa murdered Anthony Bolino. Suspecting Bolino of robbing his dealers, Sessa shot him one time in the head on a street corner in Bayside. In November 1988, Sessa murdered Vincent Angellino, a top capo in the Colombo family. Angellino was lured to a home in Kenilworth, New Jersey, where Sessa shot him. In 1989, Sessa murdered Anthony Collucio, a member of Sessa's crew. Suspecting Collucio of becoming an informant, Sessa shot him.  Attempted murder  In 1988, Sessa attempted to kill Dominick Costa as a service to the Lucchese crime family. Costa was a master safecracker for the Bypass Gang, a highly skilled group of bank robbers run by Lucchese mobster Anthony Casso in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn. When Casso discovered that Costa was a police informant, he decided to kill him. Casso hired Sessa because of his reputation as a hitman and because Costa did not know him. Sessa shot Costa five times in Costa's apartment, but Costa survived to later testify against the Lucchese family. = Colombo War = In 1991, a rivalry within the Colombo family erupted into war. Imprisoned family boss Carmine Persico planned to have his son Alphonse \\"Little Allie Boy\\" Persico become acting boss on his release from prison. In 1990, three years after becoming a made man in the Colombo family, Carmine Persico had appointed Sess as consigliere. He was now part of the family leadership. In 1988, Persico appointed the former capo of Little Allie Boy's crew Victor Orena, as acting boss until Little Allie Boy's release. By 1991, Orena felt that he should be boss in his own right. He instructed Sessa to poll all the capos on whether they supported him or Carmine Persico as boss. Sessa ignored Orena's request and forwarded the information to Carmine Persico. At this point, Persico ordered Sessa to murder Orena. On June 20, 1991, Sessa, Zambardi, John Pate, and Hank Smurra went to Orena's Long Island, New York home to ambush and kill him. However, when Orena arrived at the house, he saw the trap, and escaped unharmed. As a result of the attempt, a two-year war erupted between the Persico and Orena factions. On November 29, 1991, Sessa's nephew, Larry Sessa was nearly killed during an ambush; Larry was chased down the street by masked gunmen and jumped into a friend's car. When the Colombo war ended with Orena's defeat, 12 people were dead out of 24 murder targets. On April 8, 1993, Sessa and other Colombo mobsters were arrested while attending a secret meeting outside St. Patrick's Cathedral in Manhattan. Sessa had been a fugitive for the previous nine months. Sessa was indicted on Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act murder conspiracy charges. = Government witness = Shortly after his 1993 indictment, Sessa, at the urging of his wife, pleaded guilty to four murders and became a government witness. Sessa went on to testify in eight mob trials. In the summer of 1997, Sessa was released on bail. However, that December, Sessa was arrested for gun possession by a convicted felon, domestic violence against his wife and stealing guns from his son. In 2000, Sessa was sentenced to time already served for the four murders. He told sentencing judge Jack Weinstein, \\"I hate everything about the life I led, and I hope that it ends soon because it keeps destroying families and kids who are infatuated with it and can't wait to be 'goodfellas.' I wish I could tell them what it really is.\\" In October 2007, Sessa testified at the corruption trial of former Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) agent Lindley DeVecchio. DeVecchio, the agent in charge of informant Gregory Scarpa, had the charges against him dismissed after revelations that the prosecution's star witness, Scarpa's girlfriend Linda Schiro, had given an interview denying that Scarpa was involved in the murders.Robbins, Tom.

This gene encodes a member of the STAT- induced STAT inhibitor (SSI), also known as suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS), family. SSI family members are cytokine-inducible negative regulators of cytokine signaling.  Function  The expression of SOCS3 gene is induced by various cytokines, including IL6, IL10, and interferon (IFN)-gamma. For signaling of IL-6, Epo, GCSF and Leptin, binding of SOCS3 to the respective cytokine receptor has been found to be crucial for the inhibitory function of SOCS3. Overexpression of SOCS3 inhibits insulin signaling in adipose tissue and the liver, but not in muscle. But deletion of SOCS3 in the skeletal muscle of mice protects against obesity-related insulin resistance. SOCS3 contributes to both leptin resistance and insulin resistance as a result of increased ceramide synthesis. For that reason, studies have shown that removal of the SOCS gene prevents against insulin resistance in obesity Studies of the mouse counterpart of this gene suggested the roles of this gene in the negative regulation of fetal liver hematopoiesis, and placental development. The SOCS3 protein can bind to JAK2 kinase, and inhibits the activity of JAK2 kinase.  Interactions  SOCS3 has been shown to interact with: * Erythropoietin receptor, * Glycoprotein 130, * Insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor, * Janus kinase 2, * PTPN11, and * RAS p21 protein activator 1.  Regulation  There is some evidence that the expression of SOCS3 is regulated by the microRNA miR-203, miR-409-3p and miR-1896 .

Plot summary \\"A New England Nun\\" is the story of Louisa Ellis, a woman who has lived alone for many years. Louisa is set in her ways, she likes to keep her house meticulously clean, wear multiple aprons, and eat from her nicest china every day. She has an old dog named Caesar who she feels must be kept chained up because he bit a neighbor 14 years ago as a puppy. Louisa promised Joe Dagget 14 years ago that she would marry him when he returned from his fortune-hunting adventures in Australia, and now that he has returned it is time for her to fulfill her promise. When Joe arrives, however, it becomes obvious that Louisa sees him as a disruption of the life that she has made for herself. When Joe arrives on one of his twice weekly visits, Louisa attempts to have a conversation with him, but is distracted when he tracks dirt on the floor, re-arranges her books, and accidentally knocks things over. The two have a cool and slightly awkward conversation when Louisa inquires after Joe's mother's health and Joe blushes and tells Louisa that Lily Dyer has been taking care of her. Clearly, she is only planning on marrying Joe because she promised that she would, since it would mean that Louisa would have to give up the life that she has made for herself. Three weeks later, a week before the wedding, as Louisa is enjoying a moonlit stroll, she happens to overhear a conversation between Joe and Lily. Through this conversation, Louisa learns that Joe and Lily have developed feelings for each other in the short time that Joe has been back, and that Joe is in love with Lily but refuses to break his promise to Louisa. Lily supports Joe's decision, and though Joe encourages her to find someone else, Lily says, \\"I'll never marry any other man as long as I live.\\" The next day, when Joe comes to visit, Louisa releases Joe from his promise without letting him know that she is aware of his relationship with Lily. Joe and Louisa then part tenderly, and Louisa is left alone to maintain her present lifestyle. The last line of the story is: \\"Louisa sat, prayerfully numbering her days, like an uncloistered nun.\\" Characters =Louisa Ellis= Louisa Ellis, the protagonist, lives in a quiet home in the New England countryside. Louisa is known for her cool sense and sweet, even temperament. Her world is her home, and everything from her aprons to her china has a use and purpose in her every day rhythm. She is engaged to Joe Dagget for fourteen years while he is off to Australia to make his fortune. However, after listening to Joe and Lily discuss their affection, she resolves to ‚Äúkeep her inheritance‚Äù and disengage herself from her long- standing engagement. In the end, she is content to spend her life as a spinster. =Joe Dagget= Joe Dagget is the fianc√© of Louisa and beau to Lily Dyer. He is a man of great wealth for he traveled fourteen years to Australia for his fortune. He currently works his large farm to care for his mother and himself. Joe is described to walk around with ‚Äúheavy step‚Äù and carries dust wherever he goes. After returning from Australia, he meets Lily and in the short months before his marriage to the protagonist, falls in love with her. After being released from his engagement, there is no real textual evidence that he and Lily marry, but his admiration for Louisa never changes. =Lily Dyer= Lily Dyer is the darling of Joe Dagget and his mother‚Äôs caretaker. Louisa describes her as \\"tall and full-figured, with a firm, fair face, her strong, yellow hair braided in a close knot\\". Her reputation among the village was praiseworthy. Her honor would not allow Joe to leave Louisa: \\"I've got good sense an' I ain't going to break my heart nor make a fool of myself; but I'm never going to be married, you can be sure of that. I ain't that sort of a girl to feel this way twice.\\" While there is not a solid ending saying whether or not Joe and Lily wed, there is enough evidence to suggest they do. She is the better match for Joe with her sensibility and courage. =Caesar= Caesar is Louisa‚Äôs ‚Äúveritable hermit of a dog.‚Äù For most of his life he resided in the small hut, which Louisa‚Äôs dead brother built for him, eating only corn- mush and cakes for food. The dog is not crucial to the plot, but brings insight into the internal affairs of the Ellis home. Just like the dog, Louisa has not permanently left the home in over 14 years, as he is chained up after biting a neighbor. Caesar is a foreshadowing for Louisa in his example of what will come of her if she should not marry. For example, there is no fear or sadness with the dog, but a simple acceptance of life as it passes before the front gate. The dog is also a warning for Joe, for the only reason he is allowed outside the limits of the land is to walk with his mistress as she leads him by a heavy chain. Analysis \\"A New England Nun\\" falls within the genre of local color. A thorough focus on native scenery, dialog of the characters as native to the area, and displays of the values of a 19th-century New England landscape, are all contributing elements to that genre. The story is told from a third person viewpoint. Another specific, structural feature includes Freeman's focus on nature. The piece begins with a brief but thorough description of the landscape surrounding the world of Ms. Louisa. \\"Somewhere in the distance the cows were lowing, and a little bell was tinkling; now and then a farm-wagon tilted by, and the dust flew; some blue-shirted laborers with shovels over their shoulders plodded past; little swarms of flies were dancing up and down before the peoples' faces in the soft air.\\" Through this small scene the reader feels the presence of nature and the rhythm to which people and time march on in the New England landscape. The emphasis of the countryside and the human's small part of nature also is very reminiscent of literature of the time period. Dr. Jesse S. Crisler, a scholar specializing in literary realism, notes in his class lectures that the opening and closing scenes of the piece are reminiscent of Thomas Gray's \\"Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard\\". Unbeknownst to Louisa, the reason Joe will not disengage himself from her is because he would \\"break her lil‚Äô heart\\". The same reason holds true for Louisa as the wedding day approaches. When both parties realize there is no affinity for one another, there are no arguments or fights but a simple conversation that leads to an honorable ending for both Louisa and Joe. Lily is also an example of honor as she declares, \\"Honor's honor, an' right's right. An' I'd never think anything of any man that went against ‚Äòem for me or any other girl - you'd find that out, Joe Dagget.\\" As a whole, the honor displayed in the story is an element of the local color of the New England area. The title of \\"A New England Nun\\" captures several qualities of both nature and religious sentiments. The genre of local color is partially characterized by the landscape scenes. \\"There was a full moon that night. About nine o‚Äôclock Louisa strolled down the road a little way. There were harvest-fields on either hand, bordered by low stone walls. Luxuriant clumps of bushes grew beside the wall, and trees‚Äîwild cherry and old apple trees‚Äîat intervals. Presently Louisa sat down on the wall and looked about her with mildly sorrowful reflectiveness. Tall shrubs of blueberry and meadow-sweet, all woven together and tangled with blackberry vines and horsebriers, shut her in on either side.\\" The emphasis is not on the impact nature has on the humans, nor the humans upon nature. Like a good ecosystem, both nature and humans are able to interact peacefully. However, in spite of the drama of the story, the ecosystem continues on in its natural rhythm. The term \\"nun\\" implies several layers of complexity to the short story. There are a number of religious inferences to the text, which give the piece a feeling for the deep devotion of Louisa to her way of life. For example, \\"If Louisa Ellis had sold her birthright she did not know it, the taste of the pottage was so delicious, and had been her sole satisfaction for so long\\". This passage explains the opportunity for marrying had passed the protagonist and her \\"pottage\\" was the world she meticulously cared for. The passage expresses an awareness of the loss of a good opportunity, but the greater joy came from the \\"pottage\\" of the life she already knew. Another example: ‚ÄúLouisa sat, prayerfully numbering her days, like an uncloistered nun\\". The catholic notion of prayer accompanies the rosary and the numbering of prayers. Freeman uses this religious imagery to display the devotion-like rhythm Louisa accepts and loves. Adaptations In 2001, the Radio Tales series presented an adaptation of the story on National Public Radio.

Biography =Early life= Flaherty was born Edmund Joseph Flaherty in Washington, D.C.; the son of Mary Rose Ella (n√©e Wilson) and Michael Joseph Flaherty. He was the older brother of writer Vincent X. Flaherty. Flaherty had Irish ancestry. Pat attended Eastern High School, and Dean College in Franklin, Massachusetts. After playing baseball, he attended Princeton University and graduated on January 26, 1918. Flaherty served in the United States Army during the Pancho Villa Expedition and then as a pilot in World War I. =Early athletic career= Flaherty was a popular Washington, D.C. athlete and coach, who went on to become a professional baseball and football player who pitched for John McGraw's New York Giants, and punted for George Halas' Chicago Bears. After his professional athletic career ended, he went into the music publishing business with the legendary DeSylva, Brown and Henderson during the time of Mayor Jimmy Walker in New York. =Acting career= Flaherty relocated to Hollywood to take a position as a producer at 20th Century Fox for the owner Joseph P. Kennedy when the Great Depression began. Subsequently, he found work as an actor and technical advisor in over 200 motion pictures. Flaherty can be seen in roles both large and small in films such as Death on the Diamond (1934), Mutiny on the Bounty (1935), Sergeant York (1941), Yankee Doodle Dandy (1942), The Pride of the Yankees (1942), It Happened in Flatbush (1942), and a bit appearance as a bewildered Marine in Stage Door Canteen. In 1943 he was commissioned in the US Marine Corps as a captain.Marine Corps Chevron, Volume 2, Number 21, 29 May 1943 He returned to the Corps for the Korean War and finished his service as a major.p. 157 Rowan, Terry World War II Goes to the Movies & Television Guide Lulu.com He resumed his acting career after the war with The Stratton Story (1949, as the Western All-Stars coach), The Jackie Robinson Story (1950) and The Winning Team (1952, as legendary umpire Bill Klem). He was given the task of making William Bendix look, move and act like Babe Ruth in The Babe Ruth Story, and Gary Cooper to pitch, look, move and act like Lou Gehrig in Pride of the Yankees. In order to make Cooper appear left-handed like Gehrig, the film was reversed. Outside the realm of baseball, Flaherty was usually cast in blunt, muscle-bound roles, notably Fredric March's taciturn male nurse \\"Cuddles\\" in A Star is Born (1937). One of Flaherty's most unusual roles was in Wheeler & Woolsey's Off Again, On Again (1937), in which his character finds his wife (played by actress Patricia Wilder) in a compromising position with Bert Wheeler; he does not pummel the hapless Wheeler as expected, but instead meekly apologizes for his wife's flirtatiousness. =Personal life= Pat Flaherty was married twice. His first wife was the former Dorothy Fiske. The couple had one child, Edmund Flaherty, Jr. who was born in 1919 and died in 1995, by which time his name had been changed to Edmund Graham. On January 19, 1929, Flaherty married Dorothea Xaviera Fugazy, the daughter of boxing promoter Jack Fugazy aka Humbert Fugazy. They had two children, Patrick Joseph Flaherty and Frances X. Flaherty Knox.http://sabr.org/bioproj/person/bbc1ed84 Flaherty died on December 4, 1970, in New York City of a heart attack. Selected filmography * Come On, Marines!

Part of the Turrican series, it is the sequel to Super Turrican for the same platform. The game was released on the Virtual Console in North America on September 29, 2008. However, it was retired without any explanation on October 2013 in the same region.  Story  The location is a small star system floating in the endless spiral arms of a black hole. Little do the inhabitants of the planets know about the menacing hordes of The Machine. Fleeing through the outer regions of the known galaxy, the villain found his next victims. Long since his last defeat, The Machine has returned and the defenses of the star system are no match for The Machine's phasers launched from deep space. Civilizations were destroyed in an instant and the whole system fell under the spell of evil, with just a few tiny cries for help escaping the boundaries of the system. In the U.S.S. Avalon, flagship of the United Freedom Forces, the heroes of many rescued souls are restlessly waiting for the final encounter with their longtime arch-enemy. As the sirens yell across the hangar, three ships blast off into the unknown. Ready to face their final challenge, the ships prepare to enter a black hole in order to reach the attacked system. But seconds later, only one of the ships manage to escape the dangerous influence of the black hole. Badly damaged and burning, the ship hurtles towards a devastated dune world. Shipwrecked somewhere in this devastated realm is the last remaining survivor of the assault squad team sent by the United Freedom Forces. Equipped with his Turrican assault suit, he has to face alone the attempt to stop The Machine's plan to transform the devastated galaxy into his new army stronghold. Gameplay Super Turrican 2 features more straightforward shooting action and uses Dolby Pro-Logic surround sound as well as many \\"Mode 7\\" effects, but sacrifices the big levels of the original Turrican games by playing more similar to the Konami 'Contra' series. The major addition is a grappling arm, similar to that used in Bionic Commando, which can be used to swing between platforms and grab power-ups. The game features different vehicles such as a desert dune buggy, a space motorcycle and an underwater motojet.http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/turrican/turrican3.htm Reception GamePro gave the game a rave review.

IL8RB is also known as CXCR2, and CXCR2 is now the IUPHAR Committee on Receptor Nomenclature and Drug classification-recommended name.  Function  The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the G-protein-coupled receptor family. This protein is a receptor for interleukin 8 (IL8). It binds to IL8 with high affinity, and transduces the signal through a G-protein-activated second messenger system (Gi/o-coupled). This receptor also binds to chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 1 (CXCL1/MGSA), a protein with melanoma growth stimulating activity, and has been shown to be a major component required for serum-dependent melanoma cell growth. In addition, it binds ligands CXCL2, CXCL3, and CXCL5. The angiogenic effects of IL8 in intestinal microvascular endothelial cells are found to be mediated by this receptor. Knockout studies in mice suggested that this receptor controls the positioning of oligodendrocyte precursors in developing spinal cord by arresting their migration. This gene, IL8RA, a gene encoding another high affinity IL8 receptor, and IL8RBP, a pseudogene of IL8RB, form a gene cluster in a region mapped to chromosome 2q33-q36. Mutations in CXCR2 cause hematological traits.  Senescence  Knock-down studies involving the chemokine receptor CXCR2 alleviates both replicative and oncogene-induced senescence (OIS) and diminishes the DNA-damage response. Also, ectopic expression of CXCR2 results in premature senescence via a p53-dependent mechanism.

In the early 1990s, Vogel issued two EPs on Dave Clarke's Magnetic North Records label, the first of which was the underground success, Infra.[ Cristian Vogel] at Allmusic.com After further solo EPs and collaborations with emerging UK techno artists such as Neil Landstrumm and Dave Tarrida, Vogel released his debut full-length, Beginning to Understand, in 1994 on Mille Plateaux, and subsequently became the first UK techno artist to be signed to Berlin's Tresor Records. He also started the vinyl only label Mosquito with Si Begg, on which he released both his own music and other artists'. Vogel is considered to be one of the main founders of the No-Future collective that was active in Brighton during the mid-nineties. Alongside Jamie Lidell, he formed the group Super Collider, who released two albums before Jamie Lidell saw fame with his Warp Records album Multiply. Cristian Vogel also sings and plays guitar in his band project Night of the Brain, whilst continuing to maintain a presence on the underground techno scene. From 2003 to 2010, he worked with the Swiss choreographer Gilles Jobin, composing electronic music scores for 6 of his contemporary dance pieces. Over a 20-year career, Vogel has also worked as a remixer and album producer, having worked with artists such as Radiohead, Max√Ømo Park, Chicks on Speed, and Thom Yorke.

Function  The protein encoded by this gene belongs to a group of apparently inactive homologs of ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes. The gene product contains a coiled-coil domain that interacts with stathmin, a cytosolic phosphoprotein implicated in tumorigenesis. The protein may play a role in cell growth and differentiation and act as a negative growth regulator. In vitro steady-state expression of this tumor susceptibility gene appears to be important for maintenance of genomic stability and cell cycle regulation. Mutations and alternative splicing in this gene occur in high frequency in breast cancer and suggest that defects occur during breast cancer tumorigenesis and/or progression. The main role of TSG101 is to participate in ESCRT pathway. This pathway facilitates reverse topology budding and formation of multivesicular bodies (MVB) which delivers cargo destined for degradation to the lysosymes. TSG101 recognises short linear motif : P(T/S)AP via the UEV protein domain of the VPS23/TSG101 subunit. The assembly of the ESCRT-I complex is directed by the C-terminal steadiness box (SB) of VPS23, the N-terminal half of VPS28, and the C-terminal half of VPS37. The structure is primarily composed of three long, parallel helical hairpins, each corresponding to a different subunit. The additional domains and motifs extending beyond the core serve as gripping tools for ESCRT-I critical functions.  Viral Hijacking  TSG101 plays an important role in the pathogenesis of HIV and other viruses. In uninfected cells, TSG101 functions in the biogenesis of the multivesicular body (MVB), which suggests that HIV may bind TSG101 in order to gain access to the downstream machinery that catalyzes MVB vesicle budding.  Interactions  TSG101 has been shown to interact with: * EP300, * HGS, * LRSAM1, * P21, * P53, and * VPS28.  Orthologue, Vps23  In humans, the orthologue of vps23 which has a component of ESCRT-1 is called Tsg101. Mutations in Tsg-101 have been linked to cervical, breast, prostate and gastrointestinal cancers. In molecular biology, vps23 (vacuolar protein sorting) is a protein domain. Vps proteins are components of the ESCRTs (endosomal sorting complexes required for transport) which are required for protein sorting at the early endosome. More specifically, vps23 is a component of ESCRT-I. The ESCRT complexes form the machinery driving protein sorting from endosomes to lysosomes. ESCRT complexes are central to receptor down-regulation, lysosome biogenesis and budding of HIV.  Structure  Yeast ESCRT-I consists of three protein subunits, VPS23, VPS28, and VPS37. In humans, ESCRT-I comprises TSG101, VPS28, and one of four potential human VPS37 homologues.

Claude arrived in Acadia to assist Jean de Biencourt de Poutrincourt et de Saint-Just in establishing a permanent colony at Port-Royal, N.S.. He was accompanied by his son, Charles de Saint-√âtienne de la Tour, and they were initially occupied with the construction of buildings and planting crops. After the initial colonization effort, it is known that Claude engaged in fur-trading activities in the Penobscot Bay area. It is believed that Fort Pentagouet, a combined trading post and fishing station which he built, was the first permanent settlement in present-day New England. We know that about 1626, Claude de La Tour had to abandon the area to the Plymouth colony. Claude returned to France and upon returning to his son's fort at Cap de Sable in the spring of 1628, the ships were captured by the British, under the command of Sir David Kirke, and he was sent as a prisoner to England. He returned to Acadia in 1630 with an English wife and briefly switched allegiance to the British. There was a siege of Fort la Tour by Claude with his son resisting and winning. Claude was eventually convinced by his son Charles to return to Cap de Sable and French allegiance. He lived his remaining years in that area. He was in receipt of a large land grant and Fort Pentagou√´t itself by the French Crown although it does not appear that he took residential possession of it.
