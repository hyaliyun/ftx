It is down the line from London Liverpool Street and is situated between to the west and to the east. Its three-letter station code is INT. The station is currently managed by Greater Anglia, which also operates all trains serving it, as part of the East Anglia franchise. History The first station at Ingatestone was opened by the Eastern Counties Railway (ECR) in July 1843, sited just below Stock Lane, and operated for less than a month. The station consisted of wooden platforms on each side of the railway, connecting to the road carried above by wooden steps up the embankment. However, the agreement for the construction of the railway across the Petre Estate, obtained in 1836, and section 7 of the enabling private Act of Parliament (An Act to amend and enlarge the powers and provisions of the Act relating to the Eastern Counties Railway) in 1838 both required that the Petre Estate consent to the construction of any station on the estate. The railway obtained consent for the construction of a station adjacent to Old Hall Lane (now Station Lane), adjacent to the level crossing, subsequently the site of the existing station. Despite this, in August 1842 the railway requested permission to relocate the station to the cutting adjacent to the Stock Lane bridge, a change that Lord Petre refused to agree. Despite this, a station was constructed on the alternative site, and opened on 22 July 1843 for services between Shoreditch in London and . Following the legal case of Lord Petre v Eastern Counties Railway Company in August 1843, an injunction was issued by the High Court prohibiting use of the Stock Lane station. As a result, a permanent station on the present site was opened in 1844 and certainly given the present main station building, in Tudor style with diaper brickwork, in 1846. The up-side buildings (largely not in railway use for some years, but restored as a station caf√©, with grant aid from the Railway Heritage Trust, in 2017) were provided by the Great Eastern Railway (GER) in 1885 to a domestic revival design by W. N. Ashbee. Ingatestone station and the area around it form one of the first conservation areas to be designated in Essex. The railway station is a Grade II listed building. Services A train for stopped at Ingatestone in 2013 The typical off-peak Monday-Saturday service is two trains per hour west to , one per hour east to and one per hour east to .

He obtained a BMI award for co-writing and singing on one of the most frequently aired rock radio hits of 1992 and 1993, \\"I‚Äôve Got A Lot To Learn About Love\\"', by The Storm. In October 1993 he very briefly sat in for Steve Perry in Journey, singing lead at a roast for Journey's manager, Herbie Herbert, and in 2003, he toured as lead vocalist for the Alan Parsons Live Project. 707 Chalfant's first national success came when he joined AOR group 707 in 1982. With Chalfant on lead vocals, the band enjoyed its biggest hit, \\"Mega Force\\", which peaked at No. 12 on Billboard 's Mainstream Rock chart. That success, however, was not enough to assuage internal conflicts and the group disbanded before a follow-up could be recorded. Steel Breeze In 1984, Chalfant joined the band Steel Breeze, who were riding the success of their hit single, \\"You Don't Want Me Anymore.\\" He recorded one album with the band, Heart on the Line, before leaving in 1985. Around that time, he sang \\"Hold On to the Vision,\\" the theme to the film No Retreat, No Surrender, featuring Joe Satriani on guitar. The Storm Chalfant later formed The Storm in 1990 with guitarist Josh Ramos and (former) Journey members Ross Valory (bass), Gregg Rolie (keys), and Steve Smith (drums). Journey, a multi- platinum band that was also no stranger to internal conflict, had undergone several personnel changes over the years. Original member and early vocalist/keyboardist Rolie had left Journey to pursue a solo career in 1980, and Valory and Smith had been \\"replaced\\" in the studio and on tour in 1986. Chalfant and Valory had dabbled in the studio with a side band called The Vu (pronounced \\"The View\\") as the mega-band's (Journey's) turmoil simmered and its next step was considered. By 1989, Journey had splintered completely into a series of solo projects and side bands, and The Storm started brewing. Released by Interscope Records in late 1991, The Storm hit the album charts and the band's first single, \\"I‚Äôve Got A Lot To Learn About Love\\" surged well into the Top 40 of the Billboard Hot 100. Faring even better at Mainstream Rock radio, the single peaked at No. 6 on the national Billboard charts, and its follow-up, \\"Show Me The Way\\" went to No. 22. That spring, the band went on a major US tour in support of Bryan Adams, then at his commercial peak, and playing arenas, moving on to open for Peter Frampton, as well as several headlining dates. When it came time to release the second Storm album in 1993, however, the band found their label, Interscope, entrenched in the burgeoning rap scene. The band's second album, The Eye of the Storm, did not find label release until 1996, and by then the winds powering The Storm had died out. Journey By 1993, Journey had been on a nearly seven-year hiatus, and the late-70s lineup was poised to regroup, minus singer Steve Perry, who was in the midst of working on a second solo album. Chalfant stepped in to tackle Perry's parts for a live performance in October 1993 for a Herbie Herbert roast at Bimbo's in San Francisco, he performed five songs with Neal Schon, Jonathan Cain, Gregg Rolie, Ross Valory, Steve Smith and Aynsley Dunbar at a roast for manager Herbie Herbert.[24]. Chalfant proved to be a good fit and was invited to formally join the band. Chalfant then began writing material in 1994 with Rolie, Neal Schon, and Jonathan Cain in anticipation of a full album and tour. By 1995, however Steve Perry had returned for a brief, Grammy- nominated reunion of their early-80s lineup instead, leaving Chalfant suddenly on his own again. Later recordings Chalfant relocated back to his native Illinois and took a couple of years off. Upon his return to music, he brought his spirituality into the fore.Liberty n' Justice ‚Äì LNJ get to know Kevin Chalfant He released a solo album in 1997 entitled Running with the Wind, and released two albums with the band Two Fires, a self-titled release in 2000, and Ignition in 2002. In 2003, he toured as the lead singer for the Alan Parsons Live Project. In 2004, Chalfant released an album of traditional gospel songs and hymns, Back To Square One, with proceeds going to benefit former Chicago Bear Jerry Stillman. A Christmas CD featuring fans caroling along with Chalfant and his band was released in December 2005. Chalfant featured in the studio project Shadows Fade, releasing a self-titled album in 2004. Chalfant then signed as the lead singer for Kansas City AOR favorite Shooting Star. He released one album, 2006's Circles, before leaving the band. In 2007, Chalfant released Fly2Freedom, a 13-track solo album covering his favorite Journey hits. The \\"fly\\" of the album's title and its cover art are a humorously self-deprecating homage to the scarab that appeared in the cover art on many of Journey's albums of the 1970s and 1980s. Freedom was the 1985 working title for Journey's followup to their Frontiers album prior to the departure of Valory and Smith; it was ultimately released as Raised On Radio. Chalfant is quoted on the label's website as saying, \\"The Journey love-laden sound has won the hearts of millions of fans world wide. I am proud to consider them personal friends and label them America's Finest Rock Band.\\"Clique Records & Productions Rockingham 2016 In 2016 Chalfant appeared at the three-day Rockingham 2016 melodic/hard rock festival held in Nottingham, United Kingdom. He appeared on October 23, headlining that day's seven-act programme.

It was held in Glasgow between 26 April and 26 September 1988. It was the first event of its type to be held in the city in 50 years, since the Empire Exhibition of 1938, and also marked the centenary of Glasgow's first International Exhibition, the International Exhibition of Science, Art and Industry of 1888. It attracted 4.3 million visitors over 152 days, by far the most successful of the five National Garden Festivals. Its significance in the rebirth of the city was underlined by the 1990 European City of Culture title bestowed on Glasgow in September 1986. The two events together did much to restore Glasgow to national and international prominence.  The festival site  The Clydesdale Bank 150th Anniversary Tower was an observation tower that dominated the Glasgow Garden Festival site. Another view of the festival site from the Clydesdale Bank Tower The festival site covered , including 17 of water, on the south bank of the River Clyde at Plantation Quay in Govan, and also on land reclaimed from the partial filling-in of the Prince's Dock basin. Once the largest dock on the River Clyde when opened in 1900, it had been closed to navigation in the early 1970s with the advent of Containerization. Continuing businesses including Smith & McLean Galvanisers were now resited elsewhere in the city. Most of the docklands required had already been sold by Clydeport Authority to Laing Homes. To ensure a clear site the Scottish Development Agency and Glasgow City Council identified suitable off-set sites within the city which Laing Homes then purchased and promptly developed, relinquishing their ownership of the dockland site.Scottish Development Agency Annual Reports The Festival was designed and built by the Scottish Development Agency after the necessary industrial dismantling and site-clearing. The Agency also led the creation of the Scottish Exhibition Centre on the north bank of the Clyde, upon the site of the Queen's Dock.http://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk/Glasgow/ScottishExhibitionCentre.htm Glasgow Garden Festival 1988 Ltd., a subsidiary of the Scottish Development Agency, managed the public operation of the Festival. The Coca-Cola Roller roller coaster ride. Features included the high Clydesdale Bank 150th Anniversary Tower, the Coca-Cola Roller roller coaster, a miniature railway and five former Glasgow Corporation Tramways vintage trams running again in the city along the riverside. A new swing bridge, Bell's Bridge, sponsored by the Distillers Company, had been constructed across the river to link the Garden Festival to the SECC, which held the Grand International Show in its Hall 4 in conjunction with the festival. The official opening ceremony took place on 29 April and was conducted by Prince Charles and Princess Diana. The event had significant media coverage, including daily BBC TV magazine shows, The Beechgrove Garden and radio features, the festival was also used as a backdrop for the Taggart episode \\"Root of Evil\\".  After the Garden Festival  The Bell's Bridge, opened in 1988 as the world's longest pedestrian swing bridge and remains one of the enduring physical legacies of the Garden Festival. After the end of the festival, the site was expected to be developed for commerce and leisure, with a small Festival Park retained. After a decade and more new developments started on the site, renamed Pacific Quay. The Glasgow Science Centre, substantially led by SDA with the City Council, Glasgow University and others, was built and close by the media campus and digital centres, which include new headquarters for BBC Scotland and Scottish Television, opening in 2007. The Clydesdale Bank tower was dismantled and re- erected in Rhyl in North Wales; however, its spiritual successor came in the form of the Glasgow Millennium Tower as part of the Science Centre complex, which stands on approximately the same spot.

In its early years, WCOR functioned as a community-oriented station aimed primarily at residents of Wilson County, Tennessee. (It is licensed to the county seat of Wilson County, Lebanon). After this format became untenable in the 1980s (as it did for many small-town radio stations, particularly those located adjacent to major and mid-major markets), the station, after going dark for a period, resumed operation, marketing itself to particularly the eastern portion of the wider Nashville market. The majority of its programming now consists of a simulcast of its FM sister station, WANT, but some separate sports programming is also carried associated with Lebanon's Cumberland University. In fall 2005, the station moved from the 900 kHz frequency, where it had spent nearly 60 years, to a newly licensed frequency at 1490 kHz. The station is an affiliate of the Tennessee Titans radio network.

James Madison Sr. (March 27, 1723 ‚Äì February 27, 1801) was a prominent Virginia planter and politician who served as a colonel in the militia during the American Revolutionary War. He inherited Mount Pleasant, later known as Montpelier, a large tobacco plantation in Orange County, Virginia and, with the acquisition of more property, had 5,000 acres and became the largest landowner in the county. He was the father of James Madison Jr., 4th President of the United States, who inherited what he called Montpelier, and Lieutenant General William Taylor Madison, and grandfather of Confederate Brigadier General James Edwin Slaughter. Biography Madison was the son of planter and politician Ambrose Madison and his wife Frances Taylor (aunt of Richard Taylor), and was born in 1723 in Orange County, Virginia. When he was nine, his family moved to their new plantation of Mount Pleasant in 1732. His father had hired slaves and an overseer to clear it, work that had been going on for five years to establish cultivation. That summer (1732) his father died at age 36 in August after a short illness. The family or the sheriff believed he was poisoned by slaves, and three were charged in the case and convicted by justices of the Commission of Peace. Unusually, only one slave was executed; Dido and Turk, owned by the widow Frances Taylor Madison, were returned to her to serve as laborers after being punished by whipping.Chambers, Douglas B., Murder at Montpelier: Igbo Africans in Virginia, Oxford, Mississippi: University Press of Mississippi, 2005, pp. 5-9 James was tutored and trained to be a planter and slaveholder, and member of the landed gentry. His widowed mother never remarried, which was unusual at that time for a woman her age; she had extensive Taylor family in the county.Taylor (2012), \\"Slave in the White House\\", Chapter 1 As the eldest son, James Madison Sr. inherited Mount Pleasant when he came of age in 1744. He called the plantation Home House. Acquiring more land, he eventually owned 5,000 acres, making him the largest landowner in Orange County.

It is currently the oldest continuously operating synagogue in Brooklyn. Founded as Baith Israel in 1856, the congregation constructed the first synagogue on Long Island, and hired Aaron Wise for his first rabbinical position in the United States. Early tensions between traditionalists and reformers led to the latter forming Congregation Beth Elohim, a Reform synagogue, in 1861. The synagogue nearly failed in the early 20th century, but the 1905 hiring of Israel Goldfarb as rabbi, the purchase of its current buildings, and the 1908 merger with Talmud Torah Anshei Emes re-invigorated the congregation. The famous composer Aaron Copland celebrated his Bar Mitzvah there in 1913, and long-time Goldman Sachs head Sidney Weinberg was married there in 1920. Membership peaked in the 1920s, but with the onset of the Great Depression declined steadily, and by the 1970s the congregation could no longer afford to heat the sanctuary. Membership has recovered since that low point; the congregation renovated its school/community center in 2004, and in 2008 embarked on a million-dollar capital campaign to renovate the sanctuary.  19th century  = Origins = Twelve Bavarian, Dutch, and Portuguese Jews gathered at a private home on January 22, 1856 to discuss their \\"earnest desire [to] effect the incorporation of a synagogue and congregation for divine service\\",Dickter (2004). and in March that year they founded Congregation Baith Israel. The group had originally organized in 1855 as the United Brethren Society, a benefit society that provided members with medical and burial assistance.Our History, Synagogue website. Hiring the Reverend M. Gershon\\"Rabbis, Cantors and Presidents 1856‚Äì2006\\", The Synagogue Journal, Issue 23, June 9, 2006. as cantor (the person who leads the prayers),Mooney (2004). they first met in various homes, then rented space at 155 Atlantic Street, now Atlantic Avenue.Olitzky & Raphael (1996), p. 226.Abelow (1937), p. 40. Gershon's appointment was controversial; after a background check, the board decided by a 10‚Äì9 vote on April 6, 1856, that he had never held the position of cantor in any other congregation, and was therefore not \\"sufficiently acquainted with the actual requirements to fill said office\\", and was furthermore not \\"a competent reader enough to read the Sepher Torah\\". As a result, services were led by laymen, except during the Jewish holidays, when a professional cantor would be brought in from Manhattan. An 1886 Brooklyn Eagle article states that until the founding of Baith Israel \\"[h]itherto the Hebrew residents in Brooklyn had been under the necessity of finding their way across the East River in all kinds of weather, when they wished to go to their place of worship\\".Brooklyn Eagle, June 13, 1886. According to synagogue legend, the founders had grown tired of rowing across the East River each Friday to celebrate Shabbat in Manhattan.Gross (1999). See also Barton (2006), Dickter (2004), and Greenwald (2001), p. 33. Carol Levin, however, writes that a ferry service from Whitehall Street in Manhattan to South Ferry, Brooklyn (at the foot of Atlantic Street) had existed since 1836 (see South Ferry (ferry)), that the Atlantic Street synagogue's location, so close to the ferry terminus, \\"must have seemed convenient to many\\", and that \\"[f]erry service was fast, frequent and inexpensive ... In the year 1869 there were almost 52 million passengers.\\" Thus, in her view, the story of the founders growing tired of rowing across the East River is a \\"folk tale\\".Levin (January 6, 2006). = Attempts at reform and amalgamation, construction of first synagogue = In the congregation's early years, tensions existed between traditionalists and reformers, and in 1861, 41 of the latter left Baith Israel to form the Congregation Beth Elohim, a Reform synagogue. That year Baith Israel hired the Reverend Joel Alexander as its religious leader. Alexander, the synagogue's first full-time rabbi, was a graduate of the Jews Seminary in M√ºnster, and had been ordained both in Posen and by Hermann Adler, the Chief Rabbi of the United Kingdom. In 1862, the remaining 35 members purchased two lots at the corner of State Street and Boerum Place in Boerum Hill for $3,000 (today $), and on January 12 laid the cornerstone for a new building, the first synagogue built on Long Island. The building was completed on August 12, at a cost of $10,000 (today $), and was consecrated on August 31 by Alexander and assembled dignitaries.The New York Times, September 1, 1862. The synagogue, which came to be known as the Boerum Schule, created a Sunday school soon afterwards, the first in Brooklyn,Brooklyn Eagle, March 14, 1890. and at the time, an innovation. The school was free, and run by volunteers, with separate classes for boys and girls. By 1890 the school had 160 students, and at its peak the school had 500 pupils. In 1869 reformers again left Baith Israel, and, joining with dissenters from Kahal Kodesh Beth Elohim of Williamsburg, founded Temple Israel.Galvin (2001), p. 30.\\"Congregation Baith Israel Anshei Emes ‚Äì 1853-2006\\", The Synagogue Journal, Issue 23, June 9, 2006. Though many reformers had left the congregation, several reforms in the service were nonetheless introduced: the congregation abolished most piyyutim and the Priestly Blessing,Olitzky & Raphael (1996), p. 227. and, in 1873, introduced a confirmation ceremony for girls,Waxman (1998), p. 294. led by the Reverend Dr. Tinter. The confirmation ceremonies, which had initially been held during the holiday of Sukkot, were eventually moved to the holiday of Shavuot (the holiday during which the Reform movement held these ceremonies), and continued for both boys and girls (in place of Bar and Bat Mitzvah celebrations) until the 1940s. Aaron Wise, father of Stephen Samuel Wise, was one of the synagogue's earliest rabbis, from 1874 to 1875. This was his first rabbinical position in the United States, before moving to Congregation Rodeph Sholom in Manhattan.See Abelow (1937), p. 66, and The New York Times, December 18, 1892. = Building renovations, failed mergers, traditionalism = In 1876, the congregation voted by a margin of over two to one to re-orient the synagogue pews in the manner of Christian churches, and introduce mixed seating. However, nothing was done about this until 1879, when the renovations were carried out: the front pews were removed, the side pews extended to the walls, and the vestibule moved outside the sanctuary. Led by rabbi Dr. E. M. Myers, the synagogue was re-dedicated on September 7.Brooklyn Eagle, September 8, 1879. In April 1883, Baith Israel, Beth Elohim, and Temple Israel, Brooklyn's three leading synagogues, tried to merge;Brooklyn Eagle, April 7, 1883. Beth Elohim and Temple Israel had both been formed in the 1860s by dissenters from Baith Israel. This was the third such attempt; the previous two had failed when the members could not agree on synagogue ritual.Brooklyn Eagle, April 26, 1883. The combined congregation, which would purchase new premises, would have 150 members (only heads of households were considered members at that time). Members would be refunded half the purchase price of the pews in their existing buildings.Brooklyn Eagle, April 26, 1883. The rabbis of Beth Elohim and Temple Israel were to split the offices of rabbi and cantor: Baith Israel, at the time, had no rabbi. Though this attempt also failed, in the following year the three congregations carried out combined activities, including a picnicBrooklyn Eagle, July 7, 1884. and a celebration of the 100th birthday of Sir Moses Montefiore.Brooklyn Eagle, October 27, 1884. alt=Rev. M. Friedlander. Baith Israel hired Marcus Friedlander as rabbi in 1887. Born in Congress Poland in 1862, he left Russia for England before he was twenty. Though speaking little English at the time, he graduated there from the London Theological Seminary, before emigrating to the United States. He was 24 years old when he assumed the post at Baith Israel, at the time the youngest man in New York state to be appointed to so significant a position of Jewish leadership.Brooklyn Eagle, April 8, 1889., Brooklyn Eagle, September 27, 1891. Friedlander served until 1893, when he resigned to take a more lucrative position in CaliforniaBrooklyn Eagle, May 1, 1893. at the First Hebrew Congregation of Oakland.Olitzky & Raphael (1996), p. 55. After Friedlander left, his name was, for reasons unknown, deleted from the synagogue histories, and the financial records and minute books dating from his tenure were removed from Baith Israel's archives. He was succeeded by Joseph Taubenhaus, the brother of Dr. Gottheil/Godfrey Taubenhaus, the rabbi of Congregation Beth Elohim; another brother, Jacob/Jean Taubenhaus was a famous French chess master. In 1889, the congregation again renovated the synagogue building, repairing it and replacing the roof, increasing the seating capacity, adding a new vestibule and double entrance way, and redecorating the interior. At that time over half of the congregants still spoke German as their native language. The congregation had 50 members‚Äîdefined as \\"heads of families who own seats\\"‚Äîby 1891, and 300 congregants in total. By 1900, the congregation had 160 members, and the congregational school, which held classes for two hours once a week, had ten teachers and 150 students.American Jewish Year Book, Vol. 2, p. 329. Though the synagogue had undertaken innovations in some areas of Jewish law, it still insisted on strict adherence in others. In 1878 Tinter was dismissed for officiating at the marriage of a Jewish woman and Christian man, and Baith Israel was, for a time, the only congregation in Brooklyn that celebrated Jewish holidays for the traditional two days. In 1889 Baith Israel asserted it was \\"the only orthodox congregation in the city\\",Brooklyn Eagle, February 21, 1889. and that year the board forced the resignation of a Mr. J. Folkart, for transgressing the laws of Yom Kippur.Whitman (2008). In 1892, when Hyman Rosenberg was expelled as rabbi of Brooklyn's Beth Jacob synagogue for eating ham, the Brooklyn Eagle canvassed local rabbis for their views on the matter. While George Taubenhaus, rabbi of Beth Elohim stated, \\"I do not believe my congregation would expel me if I ate ham\\", Baith Israel's rabbi Friedlander responded, \\"While there are some differences between the reform and orthodox Jews, I do not think it is the place for any Jewish minister to eat ham. The reformers do not so strictly observe the old Mosaic law, but it does not seem to me a good example for a rabbi to set to his congregation.\\"Brooklyn Eagle, December 16, 1892.  20th century  = Decline and reinvigoration = By 1904, membership had fallen to 30, and the synagogue nearly failed: mass transit had allowed Jews to migrate away from downtown Brooklyn, and a fire had nearly destroyed the Boerum synagogue building. Further innovations were attempted, including a pipe organ and a mixed-sex choir, but these were removed after objections from Orthodox members. The congregation decided that the Boerum location was part of the problem, and made the bold decision to sell it, buy new premises, and hire a rabbi (the synagogue had, for many years, run without one).Greenwald (2001), p. 35. In 1905, they hired Israel Goldfarb, a 1902 graduate of the Jewish Theological Seminary, as \\"Hazan [cantor] and Teacher\\",Kaufman (1999), p. 215. his first and only pulpit. The following year Goldfarb was appointed rabbi, a position he would hold for over 50 years. Kane Street synagogue exterior. In 1905, the congregation also purchased for $30,000 (today $) its current building at Tompkins Place and Harrison Street (renamed Kane Street in 1928),\\"Copland's Sanctuary\\", NewMusicBox. along with an adjacent school building and a connecting two-story arcade. The Romanesque revival church building, erected in 1855, had originally housed the Middle Dutch Reformed Church, and, from 1887, the Trinity German Lutheran Church. The hiring of Goldfarb and purchase of a new building helped revive the congregation, and by 1906 (its 50th anniversary) membership had doubled. Goldfarb was a talented musician, known to this day as composer of popular tunes for the songs \\"Shalom Aleichem\\" and \\"Magein Avot\\" used in most Ashkenazi synagogues. With his brother Samuel E. Goldfarb, he compiled The Jewish Songster for schoolchildren, the first American collection of Jewish songs.Michelman (2006). Israel Goldfarb also served as Professor of Liturgical Music at the Jewish Theological Seminary from 1920 to 1944, and in 1949 founded the School of Sacred Music at Hebrew Union College. In his Kol Nidre sermon of 1905, Goldfarb emphasized the need for a Talmud Torah (providing inexpensive Jewish education for primary school children), and it was immediately founded. Talmud Torahs helped synagogues in neighborhoods with small Jewish populations to attract young Jewish families, and were common in \\"second-settlement areas of New York City such as Harlem and Brooklyn\\".Kaufman (1999), p. 160 cites Baith Israel's Talmud Torah as one of two such examples. By 1907‚Äì1908 the congregation had grown to 85 member families. The Talmud Torah, which held classes four days a week, had three teachers and 75 students.American Jewish Year Book, Vol. 9, pp. 262‚Äì263. = Merger with Talmud Torah Anshei Emes and growth = In 1908, Baith Israel merged with Degraw Street's Talmud Torah Anshei Emes Synagogue, a growing congregation that had become too large for the row house in which it held services. Talmud Torah Anshei Emes's membership was mostly made up of Eastern European Jews, who were stricter in their observances than Baith Israel's mostly German-origin membership; to accommodate them, a special all-men section of pews was designated at the front left of the sanctuary. The merged congregations adopted the current name, a combination of the two previous names, and, with the assistance and encouragement of Goldfarb and synagogue president Harris CoplandPollack (2000), p. 26.Abelow (1937), p. 46. founded a sisterhood. Nevertheless, the combined membership was still not large; in 1911, the year the congregation renovated the recently acquired synagogue building, the Talmud Torah had only 45 students, 10 of them the children of non-members. The sisterhood had grown to 42 members by 1913; that year 11 men were accepted as new congregants, including \\"a dentist, an optician, a druggist, a lawyer, a butler and two store owners and a roofer\\"--in general, middle class occupations. Baith Israel Anshei Emes also became one of the charter members of the United Synagogue of Conservative Judaism in 1913,Greenwald (2001), p. 36. with Michael Salit, who had been synagogue president in 1906, serving as the congregation's delegate, and he, Rabbi Goldfarb and another synagogue member, Isaac Applebaum, were among the 22 individuals who initially founded the organization. Aaron Copland celebrated his Bar Mitzvah at Baith Israel Anshei Emes in 1913. The Copland family was active in the synagogue; his father Harris became treasurer and chairman of the Talmud Torah in 1905, had helped purchase the current building,Barton (2006). served as president of the congregation from 1907 to 1910, and was made a life trustee in 1936. Aaron's brother Ralph served as superintendent of the Sunday School. Goldfarb was instrumental in assisting Aaron Copland in his early musical career. While still in high school, Aaron had approached Goldfarb for his support in studying music: Aaron's father wanted him to enter the legal profession. Goldfarb engineered an agreement whereby Aaron would study music for two or three years, and, if that did not work out, then study law. In his memoirs, Copland would later describe Goldfarb as \\"a composer of liturgical music and the possessor of a fine baritone voice ... a sensitive human being and an effective leader of the congregation\\". By 1916, the congregation had installed 10 stained glass windows, electric lighting, a new pulpit, and two large bronze menorahs, and employed six people. Dues were $12 (today $) per year, and Sunday school fees were $0.02 (today $0) per session. Membership had grown to 140 families by 1919. The congregational school held classes daily, and had 400 students and 20 teachers.American Jewish Year Book, Vol. 21, p. 440. Sidney Weinberg, who rose from the job of assistant porter to head Goldman Sachs from 1930 to 1969, was married at Baith Israel Anshei Emes in 1920. The Weinberg family, which had joined the synagogue when it was still on Beorum Place, was also very active in the synagogue; Sidney's mother, Sophie, was sisterhood president from 1912 to 1913, and his father, Pincus, served as president from 1919 to 1921, and the children all attended the Sunday school and Talmud Torah.Levin (March 17, 2006). The Weinbergs subsequently moved to Flatbush, where in 1924 Pincus became the first president of the East Midwood Jewish Center.History, East Midwood Jewish Center website. In 1924, a fire almost destroyed the upper level of the school building, but the congregation repaired the damage. Another renovation was begun in 1928, and included installing illuminated stained glass over the ark and bronze memorial tablets at the rear of the sanctuary, and repainting the sanctuary walls and columns in a trompe-l'≈ìil manner imitating Jerusalem stone and marble. = Great Depression and post- World War II decline = Synagogue courtyard. On its 75th anniversary in 1931, the congregation received a congratulatory message from President Herbert Hoover.Hoover, March 1, 1931 (dated February 28, 1931). Additional congratulatory messages arrived from Governor (later President) Franklin D. Roosevelt, Lieutenant Governor Herbert H. Lehman, Mayor Jimmy Walker, and Felix M. Warburg. Nevertheless, the Great Depression brought difficult times; officers were no longer paid their salaries, and were informed in 1932 that they would have to \\"wait indefinitely\\" to receive their back wages. In 1933, the synagogue abolished fixed wages entirely for its employees, and instead paid them on a \\"month-to-month basis\\", depending on what the congregation could afford.Wenger (1999), pp. 126‚Äì127. In 1932 women were allowed to join the choir. In deference to traditionalists, however, the choir was moved to the organ loft, so that the women would be less visible. In the late 1940s and early 1950s, Herman Belth raised $20,000 (today $) and contributed another $20,000 for another renovation of the synagogue. The building was fortified, the interior (except the front wall) repainted, and the exterior brick walls, which had been clad in \\"blue-veined white stone\\", were refinished with \\"brownstone type stuccoed slabs\\".Greenwald (2001), p. 37. When the renovations were complete, the synagogue was re-dedicated in January 1953. Despite Belth's efforts, membership continued to decline, as congregants moved to the suburbs. Though the Centennial Celebrations of 1956 \\"provided a brief burst of energy for the Congregation and produced funds to maintain the Synagogue\\", during this period the choir was disbanded, the Sunday School and Talmud Torah closed, and paid staff reduced. In the 1960s, following Goldfarb's retirement, the synagogue hired a series of part-time rabbis, including Goldfarb's grandson, Henry D. Michelman, who served as rabbi from 1967 to 1971. Michelman, who would later become the Executive Vice President of the Synagogue Council of America,Steinfels (1989). was, like his grandfather, a talented musician, composing music for synagogues and churches, writing scores for television films for ABC, A&E;, CNBC, and PBS, and serving as Chairman of the American Society of Jewish Music.Rabbi Henry D. Michelman, American Society for Jewish Music website, April 25, 2007. The membership decline continued in the late 1960sShelby (1998). and early 1970s, as older congregants died and moved away, and dwindled to the point where the congregation could no longer afford to heat the sanctuary,Clark (2006). and thought they would have to disband.Gross (1999). Nevertheless, in 1972 the congregation established a nursery school and prozdor (high school). = Rebirth: 1980s and 1990s = Sanctuary interior. Changing demographics and new synagogue programs helped the congregation recover from its low point in the 1970s. In 1979, Raymond Scheindlin, a Ph.D. in Arabic literature from Columbia University, and professor of medieval Hebrew poetry at the Jewish Theological Seminary of America (JTSA), became the part-time rabbi of the congregation, replacing Howard Gorin, who had served since 1976.Our Rabbi, Tikvat Israel Congregation website. Scheindlin had become a member in 1974, after joining the faculty of the JTSA and moving to Brooklyn Heights, and from that point on read the Torah every week and served as cantor.Rand & Decter (2007), pp. xii‚Äìxiii. He also encouraged the re-constitution of a choir, which called itself \\"the DeRossi Singers\\" after Salamone DeRossi, the leading Jewish composer of the late Italian Renaissance, whose works the choir sang.Greenwald (2001), p. 38. Even after leaving the synagogue, Scheindlin continued to return to serve as cantor for the High Holidays every year until 2016. In 1982 Scheindlin stated that the membership had grown to the point where it again required the services of a full-time rabbi, and the congregation hired Jonathan Ginsburg as its first full-time rabbi since Israel Goldfarb's retirement. Ginsburg developed adult education and young singles programs, and improved standards in the synagogue's children's education programs. Geoffrey Goldberg followed him as rabbi from 1987 to 1988. In 1994 the buildings' stained glass windows, parapet tower, and brownstone were repaired, landscaping redone, and, with a grant from the Sol Goldman Charitable trust, the bimah and vestibule were refurbished. Membership had increased to almost 200 families by 1995, and in 1996 Samuel H. Weintraub was hired as rabbi. = Increasing involvement of women = In 1961 the synagogue began granting women some pulpit honors, giving the Sisterhood President gelila, and in 1966 granting married couples hagbaha and gelila (the honors of lifting and re- wrapping the Torah after it has been read). In the 1970s, women became more involved in the synagogue's political and religious activities: in 1972, the first woman was elected to the board of trustees, and in 1975, the congregation began calling women to the Torah and counting women in the minyan, the latter just two years after the Committee on Jewish Law and Standards of the Rabbinical Assembly voted nine to four in favor of this innovation.Fine (2002), p. 2. In 1980, Nancy Fink, a Brooklyn Law School professor, was elected as the congregation's first female president. Fink called a full membership meeting in 1982 to decide whether women could lead the services, blow the shofar (the rams-horn trumpet blown on the High Holidays), and whether daughters of kohanim (hereditary priests) could give the priestly blessing. Advised by Scheindlin, the congregation decided to make the services fully egalitarian, allowing women to perform all three functions. Baith Israel Anshei Emes's move to egalitarianism culminated in August 1988, when Debra Cantor was hired as its first female rabbi, making it the first synagogue in the Northeastern United States to be led by a woman.Goldman (1988).Gonzalez (1993). Cantor, who was 33 at the time, had been valedictorian of that year's graduating class at the Jewish Theological Seminary. The decision was not accepted by all congregants; the Conservative movement had ordained its first female rabbi, Amy Eilberg, only three years before, in 1985, and following Cantor's appointment a number of families left the synagogue to form B'nai Avraham, an Orthodox congregation in Brooklyn Heights.Greenwald (2001), p. 39.  21st century  Sol and Lillian Goldman Education Center. In 2002 Baith Israel Anshei Emes received a $1 million grant for building renovations from Lillian Goldman, just weeks before her death; she had previously donated $20 million for the reconstruction and expansion of Yale Law School's library, and $5 million to Manhattan's 92nd Street Y for a family center there.Lewis (2002). After raising over $2 million more, including a $54,000 grant from the Jewish Communal Fund,Annual Report 2003, Jewish Communal Fund. in 2003 the congregation began re-building the three story school/community center from the ground up, leaving only the historic facade.Son (2003). In 2004 the building was re-opened as the \\"Sol and Lillian Goldman Education Center\\",Wolff (2004). and a day-time pre-school launched. Though the sanctuary also needed extensive repairs, the renovations of the school/community center were undertaken first because the congregation decided \\"a venue for social functions is at the heart of every cohesive religious group\\". The following year, the school received a $25,000 grant from the Edith Glick Shoolman Children's Foundation \\"[t]o assist in the development of the Kane Street Kids program for pre-school age children housed in the Congregation's Early Childhood Center\\".Grantees 2004/5, Edith Glick Shoolman Children's Foundation website. Nearly 300 households were members by 2006, and in the same year, the New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation awarded the synagogue a grant of $350,000 for exterior restoration of the sanctuary.2006 EPF Grant Awards, New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation, October 20, 2006. The grant was part of a million-dollar capital campaign that the membership intended to carry out in 2008, as the synagogue building still required extensive repairs: the roof leaked, causing interior damage, and (along with the gutters) needed to be replaced; interior columns were taped to prevent plaster from falling off them; the sanctuary doors needed to be replaced; and the stained glass windows needed to be removed, the metal holding them repaired, and their wooden framing replaced. In 2007 the New York Landmarks Conservancy's Sacred Sites Program awarded Baith Israel Anshei Emes grants totaling $17,500, for copper roof and masonry restoration.Past Projects in 2007, The New York Landmarks Conservancy. The congregation had been supportive of gays since at least the early 1990s,Pompeo (2007). and following the late 2006 decision by the Committee on Jewish Law and Standards to allow same-sex commitment ceremonies,Ordination of Gays and Lesbians and Same-Sex Commitment Ceremonies Memorandum, United Synagogue of Conservative Judaism, December 6, 2006. in 2007 Baith Israel Anshei Emes voted to follow suit. The day before Yom Kippur, 2009, the synagogue was picketed by members of the Westboro Baptist Church, who shouted antisemitic and anti-gay slogans.Muessig (2009). Led by Rabbi Samuel H. Weintraub since 1996,Leadership, Synagogue website.

Maekelay zone is bordered on the east by Misraqawi (Eastern), on the south by Debub Misraqawi (South Eastern), on the west by Semien Mi'irabawi (North Western) and on the north by Eritrea. Towns and cities in Mehakelegnaw include Axum and Adwa, as well as the historically significant village of Yeha and the town of Tembien Abiyi Adi.  Demographics  A map of the regions and zones of Ethiopia Based on the 2007 Census conducted by the Central Statistical Agency of Ethiopia (CSA), this Zone has a total population of 1,245,824, of whom 613,797 are men and 632,027 women; 176,453 or 14.16% are urban inhabitants. The largest ethnic group reported in Mehakelegnaw was the Tigrayan (99.37%); all other ethnic groups made up 0.63% of the population. Tigrinya is spoken as a first language by 99.4; the remaining 0.6% spoke all other primary languages reported. 97.82% of the population said they were Orthodox Christians, and 2.07% were Muslim.Census 2007 Tables: Tigray Region , Tables 2.1, 3.1, 3.2, 3.4. The 1994 national census reported a total population for the Mehakelegnaw Zone of 943,850, of whom 464,633 were men and 479,217 women; 91,058 or 9.6% of its population were urban dwellers. The Zone is predominantly Tigrayan, at 99.6% of the population, while 0.11% were Agaw, 0.096% Amhara, and all other ethnic groups 0.12%. Tigrinya was spoken as a first language by 99.67% of the inhabitants. 98.41% of the population said they were Orthodox Christians, and 1.55% were Muslim. Concerning education in the Zone, 9.64% of the population were considered literate; 10.62% of children aged 7‚Äì12 were in primary school, while a negligible number of the children aged 13‚Äì14 were in junior secondary school, and 0.14% of children aged 15‚Äì18 were in senior secondary school. Concerning sanitary conditions, about 25% of the urban and 5.6% of all houses had access to safe drinking water at the time of the census; about 2.5% of the urban and 6% of the total had toilet facilities.The 1994 Population and Housing Census of Ethiopia: Tigray Region , vol. 1, part 1: Tables 2.1, 2.11, 2.14 According to a May 24, 2004 World Bank memorandum, 13% of the inhabitants of Mehakelegnaw have access to electricity, this zone has a road density of 29.0 kilometers per 1000 square kilometers, the average rural household has 0.8 hectare of land (compared to the national average of 1.01 hectare of land and a regional average of 0.51)Comparative national and regional figures comes from another World Bank publication, Klaus Deininger et al. \\"Tenure Security and Land Related Investment\\", WP-2991 (accessed 23 March 2006). and the equivalent of 0.8 heads of livestock. 17% of the population is in non-farm related jobs, compared to the national average of 25% and a regional average of 28%. 74% of all eligible children are enrolled in primary school, and 28% in secondary schools. 78% of the zone is exposed to malaria, and none to Tsetse fly. The memorandum gave this zone a drought risk rating of 616.World Bank, Four Ethiopias: A Regional Characterization (accessed 23 March 2006). The decline of Tigrayan ethnic population in Ethiopia (and in present-day districts like Addi Arkay (woreda), Kobo (woreda) & Sanja (woreda)), during Haile Selassie's rule is likely to have been his immense oppression & systematic prosecution against non-Amhara ethnic people of Ethiopia (in particular, his immense systematic prosecution of Tigrayans). For example, on the 1958 Tigray famine, Haile Selassie refused to send basic emergency food aid to Tigray province even though he had the money; so in consequence over 100,000 people died of the famine (in Tigray province). Later on, the Mengistu Haile Mariam-led military dictatorship (Derg) also used the 1983‚Äì1985 famine in Ethiopia as government policy (by restricting food supplies) for counter- insurgency strategy, and for \\"social transformation\\" in non-insurgent areas (against people of Tigray province, Wello province and so on). Due to organized government policies that deliberately multiplied the effects of the famine, around 1.2 million people died in Ethiopia from this famine where majority of the death tolls were from Tigray province (and other parts of northern Ethiopia).

Museum of History of Azerbaijan, Baku The Pir Huseyn Khanqah and Mausoleum lies along the left bank of Pirsaat River (Pirsaat√ßay), 126 kilometers to the southwest of Baku. The inscription plaque over the portal, read by V. Kratchkovskaya in 1952, announces that the khanqah (dervish monastery) was built by Sharaf al- Dawla wal-din Hasan during the reign of the Shirvanshah Afridhun Abul-Muzaffar Fariburz (Fariburz III, 1225-1255). The title gives a later date: \\"Here lies the sheikh, imam, mystic...Al-Husain, son of 'Ali, known as Pir Husain Rawanan...His tomb was rebuilt by 'Umar, son of Muhammad al-Shirzadi of Qazvin and completed in the year of 684 [1280 B.C.E.].\\" It is likely that the tomb of Pir Husayn bin Ali, an Azeri sheikh of the Qalandari sect who lived in the 11th century, existed on this site before a formal khanqah was built around it in the 13th century. Built out of cut-stone, the roughly rectangular complex was centered on an open courtyard fortified with ramparts, similar to a ribat. The crenellated rampart walls were buttressed with round bastions at the corners and semi-circular bastions at the middle of the south, east and west walls. A monumental gate centered on the eastern wall gave access to the courtyard, which was surrounded with halls of different sizes to its north and west, including a mosque on the western wing and a single minaret near the northeastern corner. The Pir Husayn Khanqah was renowned for the glazed tiles covering the interior of the tomb and the sheikh's sarcophagus, which had disappeared entirely by 1913. By the 1940s, more than four hundred of the tomb's cross and star-shaped tiles were identified by V. Kratchkovskaya at the Hermitage Museum (St. Petersburg) and the State Museum of Georgia (Tbilisi), including tiles from the inscriptive frieze of the mausoleum. Set in an array with plain cross-shaped tiles, each eight-sided star tile featured a unique composition of floral motifs and depictions of birds, horses and fish painted on a turquoise base and bordered with a single line of inscription on a white background. Given the absence of ceramic workshops in Shirvan Shahi territory in the thirteenth century, it is likely that the tiles were made by Persian artisans from Kashan or Tabriz.

Playing career Chavis joined Tennessee's football squad as a walk-on defensive lineman. He played sparingly in 1976, picking up two tackles. He delivered an explosive performance in the 1977 Orange-and-White Game, and briefly pushed future All- SEC lineman Jim Noonan for the starting spot at middle guard. Playing as a backup to Noonan, Chavis registered 40 tackles (26 solo) and two sacks, and was awarded a scholarship at the end of the year. Prior to the 1978 season (his senior year), Chavis switched to defensive tackle, and was vaulted into the starting slot after Bill Christian suffered a season-ending knee injury.1978 Squad, 1978 Tennessee Volunteers Football Guide, p. 39. He finished the year with 32 tackles (19 solo). During his playing career at UT, Chavis had 74 tackles (46 solo) and two sacks.Career Football Statistics , UTSports.com. Retrieved: January 10, 2014. He lettered in 1977 and 1978 and received his degree from the College of Education in 1979. He was initially served by coach Bill Battle, but spent his final two seasons served by Battle's replacement, Johnny Majors. His position coach was former Atlanta Falcons lineman Jim Dyar. Chavis is a native of Dillon, South Carolina. He played high school football at Dillon High School under long-time coach Paul Chapman.1977 Tennessee Squad, 1977 Tennessee Volunteers Football Guide, p. 39. Coaching career =Early career= Before returning to Tennessee (where he had briefly been a graduate assistant), Chavis had been defensive coordinator at Alabama A&M;, a historically Black university. There he led the defense of the Division II school to the best defensive record in the nation. The Bulldogs ranked first in total defense in 1987 and 1988. Before taking the defensive coordinator job at Alabama A&M;, Chavis coached as a graduate assistant at Tennessee in 1979, as defensive line coach at Alabama A&M; from 1980‚Äì83 and then as defensive line coach and defensive coordinator at Alabama State in 1984-85. =Tennessee= Chavis returned to Tennessee in 1989 as defensive line and linebackers coach under his former college coach, Johnny Majors. He was promoted to defensive coordinator under Majors' successor, Phillip Fulmer, in 1995. Under Chavis' watch, Tennessee gained a reputation for fielding some of the stingiest defenses in the nation.Official UT Sports Bio Chavis in 2007 Following the national championship season of 1998, Chavis was named the SEC's outstanding linebacker coach. Tennessee's defense led the SEC in 1996 and ranked in the top three five of the past seven years. In addition to supervising linebackers and the overall defense, Chavis in 1999 was named assistant head coach. Following the 2006 season, Chavis was named as the Assistant Football Coach of the Year by the American Football Coaches Association.AFCA Announces 2006 Assistant Coach of the Year Award Winners Courtesy: AFCA Release: November 29, 2006 Chavis and other members of the staff saw increased pressure after a slow start to the 2007 season, including double-digit losses to California and Florida. Yet, the 2007 Tennessee team competed in the SEC Championship game against an LSU team that won the National Championship that year. In that SEC Championship game against LSU, the final score was 21 to 14, with 7 of LSU's points coming from an interception return for a touchdown. A year later Les Miles reached out to Chavis to become the defensive coordinator for LSU largely due to how impressed Miles was with Chief's defensive performance at the SEC Championship game. Chavis' career at Tennessee came to an end in the 2008 season. Following a 3-6 start and a loss to Steve Spurrier and South Carolina, Phillip Fulmer announced the following Monday that he, at the University's decision, would step down as head coach. Fulmer's resignation would ultimately oust Chavis as defensive coordinator. Chavis' final three games would bring confidence but major disappointment to his final days with Tennessee, starting with an embarrassing 13-7 loss to Wyoming which would keep Tennessee from making a bowl for the second time in four years. Though disappointing, Wyoming only had to move the ball 7 yards for those two scoring drives. Remarkably, Chavis' 2008 defense finished 3rd nationally and 1st in the SEC in Total Defense despite the 2008 Tennessee Total Offense ranking of 115th. Chavis would win his final game at Tennessee against the University of Kentucky, 28-10, continuing a 24-game win streak against the Wildcats. \\"I look at their defense. Coach Chavis, he's done a great job for a long time.\\" - Charlie Weis (Notre Dame Head Coach).Charlie Weis Press Conference Transcript (Nov. 1): Irish head coach looks ahead at this weekend's opponent - the Tennessee Volunteers. November 1, 2005 =LSU= On January 5, 2009, Chavis was named the defensive coordinator at LSU. While with the Tigers, his defenses were consistently ranked among the nation's best. The 2011 LSU team finished the regular season undefeated which included a 9-6 overtime victory over Alabama. LSU played in the 2011 national championship game. Chief was the recipient of the 2011 Broyles Award as the best assistant coach in college football. As of 2013, Chavis has seen 19 players that he's coached at LSU selected in the NFL draft, including five in the first round. =Texas A&M;= The day of LSU's 2014 Music City Bowl loss to Notre Dame, Chavis turned down a three-year, $5.4 million offer from Les Miles. That same day, it was reported that Chavis had accepted an offer from Texas A&M; to take their then vacant defensive coordinator position. He officially signed a contract to accept the position on February 12, 2015, which guaranteed him $1.5 million in 2015, $1.55 million in 2016 and $1.6 million in 2017, not including potential bonuses. After the 2017 season, Texas A&M; fired head coach Kevin Sumlin, and hired Florida State head coach Jimbo Fisher. Fisher did not retain Chavis as defensive coordinator, instead hiring Mike Elko away from Notre Dame. =Arkansas= In January 2018, Chavis was hired to be the defensive coordinator for the Arkansas Razorbacks, under new head coach Chad Morris. Chavis was terminated for convenience following the 2019 season with a $1.25 million buyout.https://www.wholehogsports.com/news/2019/dec/11/assistants-owed- near-1-9-million-201912-1/ Family Chavis and his wife, Diane Crisp Chavis, are the parents of two sons, C.

Adalberto Libera (; 16 July 1903 ‚Äì 17 March 1963) is one of the most representative architects of the Italian Modern movement.* Adalberto Libera at DARC (Dept. of Architecture and Contemporary Art, Italian Ministry for Cultural Heritage) Biography Adalberto Libera was born in Villa Lagarina in the County of Tyrol of Austria-Hungary (now in Trentino) in northern Italy. He graduated from Parma's Institute of Art in 1925 and then in 1928 from Rome's Scuola Superiore di Architettura he became acquainted with Futurism through his fellow Trentino Fortunato Depero. Even before graduating he was one of the founders of M.I.A.R. (Movimento Italiano per l'Architettura Razionale or ‚ÄúItalian Movement for Rational Architecture‚Äù) and later became its secretary. Based in Rome, MIAR was a rival organisation to Gruppo Sette, which was based in Milan and Como. He was invited by Ludwig Mies van der Rohe to the 1927 Stuttgart Exhibition (Deutscher Werkbund). In 1928 and 1931 he organised the MIAR exhibitions of \\"Architettura Razionale\\" in Rome. MIAR then dissolved. He also contributed to the 1932 Exhibition of the Fascist Revolution. An extremely able and talented creative architect more influenced by Futurism than Rationalism, he was also politically astute. His activity as founder and secretary of MIAR enabled him to establish a close working relationship with the high-up officials of the Fascist regime in Rome, where all the big decisions were taken about funding public construction programmes, and who were responsible for commissioning the hundreds of new public buildings required for Mussolini's modernisation programmes. Thanks to these connections he had a prolific career throughout the Fascist regime and designed many notable buildings during the 1930s, some of which are masterpieces of the international modern movement. One of the most important is his Palazzo dei Congressi (Palace of Congress) at the EUR in Rome. This building shows Libera's great ability to design ambiguously in a spare, metaphysical language that sits on a knife-edge between modernism and neo-classicism. His use of sail vaults in this building creates an innovative architectural space. He also designed Casa Malaparte for Curzio Malaparte on the island of Capri (1938), although there is continuing controversy as to whether Libera himself was the main designer. During the Fascist period, all architects were legally forced to join the party; but the most successful went further and became important party members. Like his contemporaries Giuseppe Pagano and Giuseppe Terragni, Libera's good fortune in this period was due to his close party links. After the fall of the Fascist regime and its defeat in World War II, Libera along with everyone else underwent a period of personal and professional crisis, but after living quietly for several years in his home town of Trento, he recovered and began again to work on numerous projects, including public housing and office buildings, in a new style that turned its back on Fascistic modes of expression. Many of his greatest projects are from this postwar period. In 1954‚Äì1962 he designed and built the Regional Government building for the Trentino Region in Trento.

Oliva was born at Genoa in 1600, and in 1616 he entered the Society of Jesus. A famous pulpit orator, he was Apostolic Preacher of the Palace under Popes Innocent X, Alexander VII, Clement IX, and Clement X. In 1661, during the disease of the Superior General Goschwin Nickel, the General Congregation XI elected him vicar-general with the right of succession. His chief aim was to remove all causes of dissension and of personal friction between his institute and other religious orders, towards which he showed himself most reverent and yielding. He extended and increased the missions, creating new ones outside of Europe, especially in Japan. His book of forty-odd sermons for Lent, and his work of six folio volumes, In Selecta Scripturae Loca Ethicae Commentationes, demonstrate his scholarship and piety. Remembering what had happened to Cardinal Francesco Sforza Pallavicino, Oliva printed one thousand of his letters, in order that they might not be printed by others and be misconstrued. Popish Plot In 1678 the English informer Titus Oates named him as one of the ringleaders of the Popish Plot, a supposed Catholic conspiracy to kill King Charles II of England, which was entirely Oates' own fabrication. Fortunately for Oliva, unlike the many English Jesuits who suffered in the Plot, he was safely out of reach of the English authorities. Oates had never met him but was acquainted with several English Jesuits and knew enough about the Society to make it appear that he was in the Jesuits' confidence. In reality Oliva could have no motive to kill King Charles, who was himself an all but open Roman Catholic, and Oliva may even have corresponded with him, as he certainly did with his brother, the future King James II of England. In addition he took a strong view of the unlawfulness of attempting to overthrow a sovereign ruler, stating that if any Jesuits had engaged in such actions (while stressing that he thought it improbable that they had) they deserved to suffer the full penalty of the law. He died at Sant'Andrea al Quirinale in Rome. References * *Kenyon, J.P.

He is the son of former England forward Teddy Sheringham. Club career =Early career= Sheringham was born in Chingford, London, while his father Teddy was playing for Millwall. Sheringham followed in his father's footsteps by also progressing through Millwall's academy set‚Äìup, but he subsequently moved on to another of his father's former teams, Tottenham Hotspur. Having been released by \\"Spurs\\", Sheringham was given a trial at Bournemouth which proved unsuccessful. On 11 October 2004, it was announced that the 16-year‚Äìold striker had been offered a trial at Championship side Ipswich Town. He was a member of the team that won the 2004‚Äì05 FA Youth Cup by beating Southampton 3‚Äì2 on aggregate on 23 April 2005 in front of a crowd of 14,889 at Portman Road, coming on as a 71st minute substitute for Danny Haynes. The young striker's performance impressed manager Joe Royle enough for him to be offered a one‚Äìyear contract on 11 May 2005. He was transferred to Charlton Athletic on a free transfer but failed to make an impact and was very soon released, after which he went on trial at Crystal Palace, playing several games for Kit Symons's reserve side. He impressed, and was kept on for the pre‚Äìseason by manager Peter Taylor, scoring in a first team pre‚Äìseason friendly at Stevenage Borough. He also impressed against the American Major League Soccer champions Los Angeles Galaxy which led to him being given a professional contract, on a month‚Äìby‚Äìmonth deal. He then impressed even further, and was given a full contract, lasting two years. On 18 April 2007, Sheringham flew out to America with teammate Lewwis Spence to join Crystal Palace's feeder club Crystal Palace Baltimore on loan for four months, though he had to fly home early with a hairline fracture of the foot. Sheringham was released at the end of the January 2008 transfer window without making a single first team appearance for \\"The Eagles\\". Following his release from Crystal Palace Sheringham headed to Denmark on an eight‚Äìday trial at Fremad Amager of the Danish 1st Division. The trial was set up by Teddy Sheringham, an old friend of Fremad Amager manager Jakob Friis-Hansen. However, the move fell through at the last minute. =Non‚ÄìLeague career= Following the move to Denmark falling through, Sheringham had a brief, though successful, spell at Conference South side Cambridge City where he scored six league goals in only five league games. His impressive goal scoring tally attracted interest from fellow Conference South team Welling United and he signed for the club at the start of the 2008‚Äì09 season. Sheringham was Welling's top scorer that season, scoring 26 goals in all competitions of which 19 were in the league. Sheringham then signed for another Conference South side, Bishop's Stortford on 15 May 2009. Once again he proved to be a great goal scorer by scoring 17 league goals in 28 league games for \\"The Bishops\\". His form attracted Conference side Histon and on 12 February 2010 Sheringham moved to Histon on loan until the end of the 2009‚Äì10 season. However, he failed to score in the loan period which saw him make 15 appearances for the club. On 17 June 2010, Sheringham signed for Conference South side Dartford. Here Sheringham rediscovered his goal scoring form, netting 30 league goals in 46 league games. =Football League career= Bournemouth His impressive form for Dartford attracted interest from League One side Bournemouth. In October 2011 he signed for Bournemouth on an 18-month contract. He made his Football League debut for the south coast club on 25 October 2011, coming on as a late substitute, against Colchester United. He scored his first football league goal in his sixth appearance against Brentford on Boxing Day 2011. The game, which would end up being his last for Bournemouth, ended 1‚Äì1. Following the Brentford game Sheringham suffered a severe foot injury and underwent surgery in October 2012. On 20 March 2013, he rejoined Conference side Dartford on an initial one-month loan deal. Three days later he scored in his first match back at the club, a 3‚Äì0 win against Gateshead. During the loan spell Sheringham played 10 games and scored four goals. He returned to Bournemouth after the last game of the 2012‚Äì13 Conference season on 20 April. Nine days later, on 29 April 2013, he was released by the newly promoted club. AFC Wimbledon On 21 June 2013, he joined League Two side AFC Wimbledon on a free transfer. =Return to non- League= On 30 June 2014, Sheringham joined Conference South side Ebbsfleet United on a two-year contract, following his release by AFC Wimbledon. After a successful loan spell with Hemel Hempstead during the 2016‚Äì17 season, Sheringham made the switch permanent following his release from Ebbsfleet United. =Saif Sporting Club= On 9 November 2017, Sheringham joined Bangladesh Football Premier League side Saif Sporting Club following a successful trial. On 13 November 2017, Charlie scored his first goal for the club on his debut against Dhaka Abahani where his team was victorious by 2‚Äì1 margin. He finished the season with six goals in 10 appearances, helping Saif to fourth place in the league, and qualification for the preliminary round of the 2018 AFC Cup. =Return to Hemel Hempstead Town= On 13 June 2018, it was announced that Sheringham had returned to Hemel Hempstead for the start of the 2018‚Äì19 season. =Return to Dartford= On 31 August 2018, it was announced that Sheringham had returned to Dartford. =Dual registration with Leatherhead= On 21 February 2020, Sheringham joined Leatherhead on a dual registration until the end of the 2019/20 season.

It can be found at many aquariums and theme parks across the world. The ride consists of a pre-show which then leads into a stadium seated auditorium. The ride is in 4-D, meaning it is a motion simulator with a 3D movie. The effects on the ride vary at different parks. Water spray, bubbles, wind, leg ticklers, smoke, and smells are usually found. The ride once appeared at Camp Snoopy in Mall of America as a film rotation of The Mystery Mine Ride. Instead of being in 4-D with special effects, the ride was in 3-D, and the seats would move (causing a very realistic fall during the Rock Bottom sequence). In fall 2007, the Mystery Mine Ride, which once housed SpongeBob SquarePants: The Ride, was demolished to make way for SpongeBob SquarePants Rock Bottom Plunge roller coaster, part of the park's transformation into Nickelodeon Universe. In 2008, SpongeBob SquarePants 4-D came to Nickelodeon Family Suites. On April 19, 2013, Nickelodeon Family Suites premiered a sequel called SpongeBob SquarePants 4D: The Great Jelly Rescue. Plot The film begins with Painty the Pirate about to sing the television series theme as usual, but he instead pops out of the painting and throws the riders into Bikini Bottom. The audience ends up in The Krusty Krab, where SpongeBob SquarePants welcomes them and shows them how to make a Krabby Patty by pointing at the ingredients with his spatula. When preparing the Krabby Patty, SpongeBob accidentally loses a pickle. The pickle then bounces out of the restaurant into Patrick Star's hand, as he rides on a pogo stick. Patrick then steals the pickle, and SpongeBob, not knowing why, tells the riders to find Patrick on his bubble bike, destroying half of Bikini Bottom. While going through Jellyfish Fields, SpongeBob plummets down the vertical road into Rock Bottom, where a fish pops the bubble bike by biting it. The force of the pop hurdles SpongeBob into the air, landing in the Chum Bucket where Plankton is holding the real Patrick hostage, revealing that the pickle thief was a robotic version of Patrick.

Flames jet into the air from a thin, porous sandstone layer. Administratively, Yanar Dag belongs to Absheron District of Azerbaijan. Unlike mud volcanoes, the Yanar Dag flame burns fairly steadily, as it involves a steady seep of gas from the subsurface. It is claimed that the Yanar Dag flame was only noted when accidentally lit by a shepherd in the 1950s. There is no seepage of mud or liquid, which distinguishes it from the nearby mud volcanoes of L√∂kbatan or Gobustan. On the territory of Yanar Dag, State Historical- Cultural and Natural Reserve was established by the Presidential decree dated 2 May 2007 which operates under the control of State Tourism Agency of Azerbaijan. After major overhaul between 2017-2019, Yanardag Museum and Yanardag Cromlech Stone Exhibition were launched in the area of the Reserve. In the first millennium BCE, the fire played a role in the Zoroastrian religion, as the link between humans and the supernatural spheres. Geography View of Yanar Dag on the road side hill The Yanar Dag fire is never extinguished. Around this open fireplace the atmosphere is filled with the smell of gas. The flames emanate from vents in sandstone formations and rise to a height of (different figures are mentioned in other references) at the base of a scarp below a hillside. Yanar Dag is described by the Geological Survey of Azerbaijan as \\"Intensive flames, to high, develop for along the base of a and tectonic scarp.\\" The surface flames result from the steady gas emissions from underlying soils. Even the surface of streams near Yanar Dag fire can be ignited with a match. These streams, which otherwise appear calm, are known as Yanar Bulaq: \\"burning springs.\\" There are several such springs in the vicinity of the Vilascay River, where the local people take curative baths. Alexandre Dumas, during one of his visits to the area, described a similar fire he saw in the region inside one of the Zoroastrian fire temples built around it. Only a handful of fire mountains exist today in the world, and most are located in Azerbaijan. Due to the large concentration of natural gas under the Absheron Peninsula, natural flames burned there throughout antiquity and were reported on by historical writers such as Marco Polo. Most mud volcanoes are located off the Baku‚ÄêShamakha road, about from the city. Causes Yanar Dag view by the road side The reason offered for the Yanar Dag fires is the result of hydrocarbon gases emanating from below the earth's surface. Apart from Yanar Dag, the most famous site of such a fire is the Fire Temple near Baku, off the Greater Caucasus, which is a religious site known as an ateshgah, meaning temple of fire. It has also been inferred that such fires could be the cause for \\"thermal metamorphism.\\" Like the flames of Yanar Dag, the Ateshgah of Baku's flame was a manifestation of the seepage of natural gas from porous strata, but the natural flow at Ateshgah ceased some time ago and the flames seen there now are fed from a gas main for touristic effect - whereas those at Yanar Dag are still entirely natural. According to a study carried out by the scientists and geologists of the Geological Survey of Azerbaijan, analyses of four samples taken from Yanar Dag revealed that the area of maximum flux was situated at the upper side of the fault scarp - the very area from which the flames emanate. The value of microseepage recorded was in the range of 103 mg m‚àí2 d‚àí1 at approximately 30 metres (~100 ft) from the fire, on the upper part of the study area. It has been inferred that the degassing area is larger than the measured area, and it is very likely that the microseepage is pervasive along the fault zone. This fault scarp is inferred as a part of the huge Balakhan-Fatmai structure on the Absheron Peninsula.  Yanardag State Historical, Cultural and Natural Reserve  In Mammadli village of Absheron district, Yanardag State Historical-Cultural and Natural Reserve was established by the Presidential decree dated 2 May 2007 in order to protect this monument and develop tourism in this area. The Reserve operates under the control of State Tourism Agency of Azerbaijan. After major overhaul between 2017-2019, Yanardag Museum and Yanardag Cromlech Stone Exhibition were launched in the territory of the Reserve. The reserve covering an area of 64.55 hectares features a 3-zoned museum, a 500-seat amphitheater for outdoor concerts, different exhibitions displaying ancient stones and pieces of craftsmanship used by locals, as well as, tombstones, ancient kurgans, 2 burial grounds with historic graves.

He lived in the time of the Caliph HƒÅr≈´n al-Rashƒ´d. Bahl≈´l was a well known judge and scholar who came from a wealthy background.  Becoming Bahl≈´l  The Caliph HƒÅr≈´n al-Rashƒ´d had begun a crackdown against the followers of the imprisoned Shƒ´‚Äòah ImƒÅm Imam Musa al-Kadhim. WƒÅhab and a few others met the Imam and sought advice. M≈´s√° replied with the Arabic letter Ô∫ù (jƒ´m). Each of these companions took their own interpretation of the letter: jala'u l-wa·π≠an \\"exile\\", jabl \\"refuge in the mountains\\" and for WƒÅhab, jun≈´n \\"madness, possession by the jinn\\". The next day, WƒÅhab left his wealthy life, wearing rags and came into the streets. Baghdadis soon dubbed him Bahl≈´l. Bahlool was born in Kufa and his real name is Wahab bin Amr. HƒÅr≈´n al-Rashƒ´d feared for the safety of his Khalifate and kingdom from the 7th Imam Musa Al- Kadhim; therefore, he tried to destroy the Imam. Harun thought of a trick by which he could kill the Imam. He put the blame of rebellion upon the Imam and demanded a judicial decree from the pious people of his time‚Äîwhich included Bahlool. Everyone gave the decree except Bahlool, who opposed the decision. He immediately went to the Imam and informed him of the circumstances, and asked for advice and guidance. Then and there the Imam told him to act insanely. Because of the situation, Bahlool acted insanely as per the Imam's order. By doing this, he was saved from Harun's punishment. Now, without any fear of danger, and in amusing ways, Bahlool protected himself from tyrannies. He insulted the notorious Khalifa and his courtiers just by talking. Nevertheless, people acknowledged his superior wisdom and excellence. Even today many of his stories are narrated in assemblies and teach the listeners valuable lessons. According to a more popular tradition, some of the Imam's companions and special friends came to him because the Khalifa was angry with them, and asked him for advice. The Imam answered with the sole letter (jim); all of them understood that that was it and asked no further questions. Each person understood the Holy Imam's advice in his own different way. One person took (jim) to mean (jala'u l-wa·π≠an) --exile. Another thought of (jabal) -- mountain. Bahlool took it to mean (junoon) -- insanity. This is how all of the Imam's companions were saved from calamity. Before becoming insane, Bahlool lived a life of influence and power, but after obeying the Imam's order, he turned away from the majesty and splendor of the world. In reality, he became crazy. He dressed in rags, preferred desolate places over Haroun's palaces, lived on a bite of stale bread. He did not accept favors from or depend on Haroun or those like him. Bahlool considered himself better than the Khalifa and his courtiers because of his way of life. (A Poem) Those with kingly temperaments deserve respect from the chiefs of the kingdom. This is a ragged king whose slaves are great and powerful kings like Jamsheed and Khaqan. Today he overlooked the goodness of this world, tomorrow he will not even give importance to Paradise. Don't look scornfully at these beggars with no shoes on their feet! They are dearer to wisdom than eyes which shed tears from fear of Allah.< If Adam sold Paradise for two grains of wheat, then truly know that these people will not buy it for even one grain. Bahlool was devoted to Allah; he was an intelligent and virtuous scholar. He was the master of the mind and manners; he spoke with the best of answers ready on his lips; he protected his faith and the Shariah. Bahlool became insane at the Imam's command for the love of Ahl al-Bayt, and so he could enforce the rights of which they had been wronged. There was no other way for Bahlool to protect his life. For example, Harun told his vizier, Yahya bin Khalid Barmaki, that listening to the words of Imam Jafar al-Sadiq's student Hisham bin Hakam‚Äîwho proved Musa al-Kadhim's Imamate‚Äîwas more dangerous to him than 100,000 swords. Harun said, \\"Even then it amazes me that Hisham is alive and I am in power.\\" Harun planned to kill Hisham. Hisham learned of this and fled from Kufa, and hid in a friend's house, but after a short while he died.

The patron saint's day of the church is the 2nd of May, when several thousand people gather. According to Bulgarian archaeological and historical research from 2004, it is the oldest active monastery in Europe. An expedition led by doctor and academician Rosen Milev was carried out on 18 January 2004, affirming that the monastery was founded by Athanasius of Alexandria in 344 while returning from the Council of Serdica in present-day Sofia. On the way back he stopped and slept in a Roman fortress, the remains of which are located close to today's monastery, deciding to found a monastery due to the strong influence of the Arians (see Ulfilas), whom he considered heretical, on the Goths living in the region of Beroe (modern Stara Zagora). After his death in 373, the monastery was named after him. This is regarded to be proven by the passional of Saint Athanasius and the annals of the Patriarchate of Alexandria, as well as further research in the Vatican Secret Archives. The existence of the monastery during the Middle Ages is evidenced by archaeological material. It was also visited by Bulgarian revolutionary Vasil Levski during his trips throughout the country in the late 19th century. The present buildings of the Monastery of Saint Athanasius were constructed in the 1980s after an idea by Lyudmila Zhivkova. The Patriarch of Alexandria, Peter VII, visited the monastery in 2003.

Early career Fahmy graduated from the Egyptian Military Academy in 1940. He was commissioned in a cavalry unit and initially commanded armored platoons and squadrons equipped with Cruiser Mk I, Mk II, Crusader and Sherman tanks. In 1952 he was in command of an armored battalion at Alexandria and was crucial during the July coup. Military years In 1953, he was made an executive staff officer in the Defense Ministry. In 1954 he was promoted to the rank of Colonel. From 1955 onwards he became interested in the concept of Air Defense and proposed to President Nasser to further extend the existing Air Defense units in the Army which until then was only based on British 20mm Flak guns. Between 1957 and 1961, six Air Defense battalions, grouped under 2 Brigades were raised from scratch under his supervision as General Staff Officer-II in charge of Operations in the Army HQ. From 1957‚Äì59 he studied in the Soviet Union the concepts and practicals of Air Defense, and came back to command an Air Defense Brigade. Since the 1930s, Air Defense was considered to be a \\"combat support\\" arm of the regular Army and was considered less prestigious than the 'combat arms' of Infantry, Cavalry and Field Artillery. He was made a Major General in 1963. In 1964, he completed a PhD in the Soviet Union on Air Defense strategy and became the commander of one of the only two Air Defense Divisions in the Army. He participated in World War II, the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War, the Suez Crisis, the Six-Day War, the War of Attrition and the Yom Kippur War. Military influence After the debacle of 1967, he prevailed upon Nasser to make the Air Defense a separate branch of the Armed Forces, based on the Soviet model. Between 1968 and 1971 he raised five new Air Defense Brigades and two new Air Defense Divisions, plus established an Air Defense Academy in 1970 for the training of young officers and conscripts. He was the first commander of the Egyptian Air Defense Command from September 1968 to January 1975 and Chief of Staff of the Egyptian Armed Forces from January 1975 to October 1978. In this capacity he was also the Deputy Chairman of the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces and a close aide to President Sadat. Legacy He is mostly known for his planning and management of the Egyptian Air Defense Command during the Attrition War and 6 October war and for building \\"the Egyptian Missile Wall\\". He resigned as Chief-of-Staff of the Armed Forces owing to opposition with Egypt's rapprochement with Israel and due to his conflict and rivalry with Hosni Mubarak, a man several years his junior but becoming more important than him in the corridors of power during the Sadat era.

Founded in 2001, the group believes that international migration places undue demand on limited resources and that the current level of immigration is not sustainable. The group has been praised for what is seen as improving the quality of debate around immigration while others have suggested that the group is anti-immigration and have criticised what they say are faults in the group's studies. Lord Green of Deddington, former ambassador to Saudi Arabia, is the founder and president of the group. Alp Mehmet, former ambassador to Iceland, is its current chairman. David Coleman, Professor of Demography at Oxford University, is an honorary consultant. History MigrationWatch UK was founded in December 2001 by Sir Andrew Green, former ambassador to Saudi Arabia. In an article in The Independent, Deborah Orr writes that the organisation came into being when, \\"after reading some of his anti-immigration letters in The Times\\", the then Sir Andrew approached David Coleman, Professor of Demography at Oxford University, and they subsequently set up MigrationWatch. The group first came to public attention in 2002 when it stated that immigration, including an estimate of illegal immigrants, was running at two million per decade \\"and probably more\\". This claim was challenged at the time by a number of public commentators, with an editorial in The Independent at the time criticising what it called \\"tendentious projections and the deliberate citing of the vast populations of countries such as India to frighten people and wreck any rational debate\\". Two years later, Philip Johnston in the Daily Telegraph would argue that Government Actuary's Department forecasts that the UK population would increase by six million people due to immigration over three decades \\"appear to confirm claims made by Migrationwatch two years ago, when the group first sprang to prominence\\". A later Telegraph editorial following the 2011 Census would call the group's initial claims \\"overly cautious\\". The group quickly attracted the attention of Home Secretary David Blunkett, who in 2002 set up a unit intended to monitor and rebut the organisation and sought to control the timing of statistical releases to avoid pressure from it. The organisation has an advisory council, which is chaired by Baron Green and whose members include David Coleman and Caroline Cox, Baroness Cox, Alp Mehmet, former ambassador to Iceland, and Roger Williams. Outputs MigrationWatch's website contains a range of briefing papers to support the organisation's perspective on the statistical, legal, economic and historical aspects of migration, and on topics such as the European Union, housing, health and social cohesion, as they relate to immigration. It has also helped to contribute to briefings on immigration for third parties such as the BBC. MigrationWatch has been frequently cited and seen its spokespeople featured in British newspapers such as the Daily Mail, Daily Telegraph, The Times, The Sunday Times, The Guardian, Daily Express and Daily Star. as well as British broadcast media such as BBC News and ITV News. In October 2011, the group started a petition on the UK Parliament petitions website calling on the government to take \\"all necessary steps\\" to stop the UK's population exceeding 70 million. The petition reached over 100,000 signatures. In August 2019, the group started another petition on the site calling on Boris Johnson to rule out any prospect of granting an amnesty on illegal immigration. The petition reached over 35,000 signatures before closing early due to the general election.https://conservativewoman.co.uk/the-immigrant-determined-to-halt-our- borders-free-for-all/ Policy stances =Immigration flows= MigrationWatch argues that the growth of the population of the United Kingdom through international migration is a key \\"factor driving problems and pressure on school places, the NHS, housing and transport infrastructure\\". The group in 2018 argued that migration was linked to 82% of population growth between 2001 and 2016, when combining both net migration and children born to immigrant parents. In the same year it predicted that the population of the United Kingdom would exceed 70 million by 2026. A 2019 report by MigrationWatch condemned the Conservative government's approach to immigration, stating that its \\"flaccid proposals have no prospect of achieving a significant reduction in the level of net migration\\". It has called Britain's port security \\"resourced to fail\\" in stopping illegal immigration, and has opposed the idea of an amnesty for illegal immigrants in Britain, after it was postulated by Prime Minister Boris Johnson. The group criticised the same government for extending the period in which overseas students can stay in the UK from four months to two years, arguing that it would \\"likely lead to foreign graduates staying on to stack shelves\\". It has also been critical of proposals by Boris Johnson to scrap the ¬£30,000 salary cap on migrants, warning that abolishing the cap could lead to further rises in migration. The group has expressed opposition to sham marriages, and in August 2019 called for nationality profiling in an attempt to crack down on the practice. =Asylum seekers= MigrationWatch claims to support the principle of political asylum but argues that many asylum seekers do not have a genuine case for qualifying for refugee status and are instead using the asylum system to gain entry to the UK for economic reasons. The group has also been strongly critical of what it sees as the government's failure to remove many of those whose claims are rejected. In a briefing paper published in January 2009, the group's Honorary Legal Adviser Harry Mitchell, QC stated that while the group supported \\"asylum for genuine claimants\\", the \\"overwhelming majority of asylum seekers\\" were in fact economic migrants and did not have a \\"well-founded fear of persecution\\". In July 2010, MigrationWatch highlighted what it saw as the potential consequences of the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom's unanimous ruling in favour of two homosexual asylum seekers from Iran and Cameroon, allowing them to stay in the UK. The group argued that the decision would \\"increase by many thousands the numbers of persons who may be eligible for asylum\\", as well as \\"generate a large number of claims that will be difficult to determine\\", such as instances where people smugglers \\"tell their clients who come from countries where homosexual acts are illegal to claim that they are homosexual\\". It argued that assessing such claims \\"can often take many months during which applicants are supported by public funds\\". In August 2016, in response to Home Office data showing that over a third of asylum applications were made by migrants who entered the UK illegally or overstayed their visas, MigrationWatch suggested that the data showed that \\"many of those claiming asylum were in fact economic migrants\\". The group has defended the use of the term \\"illegal immigrant\\" to describe those who enter a country for the purpose of claiming asylum, against those who associate the term with criminality. The group argues that the term is appropriate, as those who come into a country without permission and outside the law are doing so illegally. =Economic impact of immigration= MigrationWatch has argued that, while limited skilled migration (in both directions) is a natural and beneficial feature of an open economy, very large scale immigration is of little benefit to the indigenous population. MigrationWatch has claimed that migration into the UK has and will tend to hold down the real wages of British citizens. In 2006 it expressed concern that immigration from Eastern Europe was depressing wages. In December 2008, a MigrationWatch report stated that while some immigration results in an increase in the number of people in employment, \\"it seems an inescapable conclusion that the sudden arrival of a very large number of very capable workers willing to work for low pay has had a negative impact on the employment of British-born workers at the bottom of the pay scale\\". Will Somerville and Madeleine Sumption of the Washington, D.C.-based Migration Policy Institute state in an Equality and Human Rights Commission report that: \\"Few serious international or UK economists would agree with this conclusion\\". Their report did, however, note that \\"the recent migration may have reduced wages slightly at the bottom end of the labour market, especially for certain groups of vulnerable workers\\". MigrationWatch chairman Alp Mehmet has expressed the view that immigrant labour has benefited employers to the detriment of ordinary workers, as domestic labour has often been \\"prepared to work in all sorts of conditions for comparatively little money\\". The group has criticised sectors that lobby for a permissive immigration policy, accusing them of offering \\"low paying jobs with poor conditions and little flexibility for workers\\". In 2014, the group published a report on population growth in London, in which it claimed that immigration trends had put \\"massive pressure on schools and hospitals and especially housing\\". It has expressed concerns about the effects of migration rates on the national housing market as a whole, pointing to the discrepancy between migration rates and the number of new houses being built to accommodate a growing population. The group has claimed that current migration rates require the construction of one new house every six minutes,https://conservativewoman.co.uk/housing-crisis-immigration- is-the-elephant-in-the-room/ and in 2017 claimed that the impact of immigration on future demand for homes in England had been \\"seriously understated\\" by the British government. In 2016, MigrationWatch issued a paper estimating the fiscal impact of immigration for the year 2014/15, which found an overall fiscal cost from immigration with a positive contribution only from migrants of pre-2004 EU states. This was in line with a 2014 study from University College London.http://www.cream-migration.org/files/FiscalEJ.pdf =Human rights legislation= MigrationWatch UK in 2003 advocated that the UK government should \\"'cut loose from the straitjacket' imposed by its obligations under various conventions that made it impossible to operate the system in the country's best interests\\". In 2007 it called for the British government to withdraw from the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) and write its own Human Rights Act. =EU membership= The group has been critical of large-scale migration from the European Union, having in 2013 predicted combined migration inflows from Romania and Bulgaria of approximately 50,000 per annum when free movement restrictions would be lifted the following year. In January 2016, the group published a report claiming that the UK leaving the European Union could result in a reduction of annual net migration from 180,000 to around 65,000, although added that such a number should not be taken as a ‚Äúprecise estimate‚Äù but was ‚Äúintended to illustrate the scale of the potential reduction under the policy outlined‚Äù. MigrationWatch stated that they would not take a position on the UK's EU membership referendum held in June 2016. In 2017 the group backed the idea of visa-free travel between the UK and EU after Brexit, adding that EU citizens who would want to work in the UK should need a work permit. =Hong Kong= After the British government reacted to the Hong Kong national security law, announcing that British National (Overseas) passport holders in Hong Kong would be given the right to live, study and work in the UK and would be offered a route to route to citizenship, MigrationWatch published a paper stating that \\"a Home Office factsheet confirmed that the number who might eventually be able to come is up to 2.9 million ‚Äì the current number of BNOs residing in Hong Kong\\". The paper argued that the government had \\"cast the proposed offer of a pathway to citizenship as part and parcel with the UK honouring its 'historical responsibilities'\\", suggesting that this set a dangerous precedent. Chris Whitehouse, responding to the MigrationWatch paper in an article for CapX, argued that \\"the UK's historic duty towards Hong Kong is very different to other former colonies; and the future of Hongkongers is based on China keeping its word, which it is brazenly failing to do\\". He concluded that \\"Lord Andrew Green and Migration Watch are out of step with the nation on this one, and they should urgently consult Lord Patten on their route ahead if they are not to lose their way\\". Reaction to the group =Praise= Conservative politician Jonathan Aitken has credited MigrationWatch with improving the quality of the British debate on immigration. He argues that \\"Migrationwatch has changed the administrative practices of the civil service and the policies of the major political parties on asylum seekers, work permit criteria and numerical totals. It has introduced integrity and accuracy into the previously misleading government statistics on immigration. The level of understanding of the subject in all serious newspapers and broadcasting organizations has been improved. Britain may or may not have the right answers to immigration questions, but we certainly now have a far more informed debate on them\\". Similarly, an article by Dean Godson of the centre-right think tank Policy Exchange published in The Times in June 2006 states: \\"The dramatic change in the terms of the immigration debate over recent months is largely down to the determination and courage of a single individual ‚Äì Sir Andrew Green, the founder and chairman of MigrationWatch UK. Almost single-handedly, he has rescued the national discourse from the twin inanities of saloon-bar bigotry on the Right and politically correct McCarthyism on the Left\\". Jay Rayner, writing in The Observer quotes one senior BBC News executive, who stated: \\"We probably were reluctant and slow to take him seriously to begin with. We probably didn't like what he had to say. But then we were also slow to pick up on immigration as a story, not least because we are a very middle-class organisation and the impact of mass immigration was being felt more in working-class communities. If he's proved himself, it's because he hasn't put a foot wrong on the information he's published\\". Peter Oborne, writing as chief political commentator of the Daily Telegraph, has also praised MigrationWatch and the efforts of Lord Green. In 2014 Oborne called Green \\"one of the most morally courageous people in British public life\\", and has said that the \\"liberal media establishment\\" owe Green \\"a huge apology\\" for mocking his predictions about future immigration numbers. Kathy Gyngell, co-editor of The Conservative Woman, has praised chairman Alp Mehmet for \\"speaking truth to power on behalf of the British people\\" on a \\"tricky, emotionally and politically charged subject\\". =Criticism= While the group describes itself as independent and non-political, it has been characterised as a right-wing lobby or pressure group by some commentators and academics. It has been argued that MigrationWatch's messages \\"can be taken advantage of by people with Islamophobia and prejudice\\". The accuracy of the group's research has also been questioned. David Robinson, Professor of Housing and Public Policy at Sheffield Hallam University, argues that the group's assertion that immigrants are placing strain on social housing lacks evidence. Economist Philippe Legrain has claimed that \\"MigrationWatch's xenophobic prejudice is causing it to twist the truth\\" about the impact of immigration on the employment prospects of British people. Similarly, in February 2013, Migration Matters, an organisation chaired by former Labour MP Barbara Roche and co-chaired by then-Conservative MP Gavin Barwell, criticised the BBC for treating MigrationWatch's analysis as politically neutral. In 2014, Jonathan Portes of the National Institute of Economic and Social Research complained to the Press Complaints Commission that articles in the Daily Mail and Daily Telegraph about the net amount of tax paid by Eastern European migrants, which were based on MigrationWatch statistics, were inaccurate. The two newspapers amended the articles in response. Other commentators have criticised what they see as the media uncritically reproducing the findings of MigrationWatch in their own reporting. Academics Nissa Finney and Ludi Simpson in 2009 stated that while they believed the evidence used by MigrationWatch to be questionable, it received prominence in migration debates and have assumed an authority which they considered to be \\"dangerous if there is no similar authority presenting counterarguments\\". Bernhard Gross, Kerry Moore and Terry Threadgold of the Cardiff School of Journalism, Media and Cultural Studies at Cardiff University have criticised the broadcast media's use of MigrationWatch to 'balance' reports on immigration, arguing that the \\"whole idea of 'balance' in these contexts needs to be re-thought\\" and that \\"there are never just two sides to any story\\". A website launched in February 2011 with the aim of allowing users to identify so-called churnalism revealed the extent to which newspapers such as the Daily Mirror, Daily Mail, Daily Express and The Times copy and paste from MigrationWatch press releases in articles on migration. =Defamation= In 2007, the Daily Mirror paid damages to Andrew Green after columnist Brian Reade likened him and the group to the Ku Klux Klan and Nazi Party, which the paper admitted was \\"untrue\\". In August 2010, Sally Bercow, a Labour Party Prospective Parliamentary Candidate and wife of Conservative MP John Bercow, argued on a Sky News newspaper review that a Daily Express article based on MigrationWatch research was \\"oversimplifying\\" and constituted \\"dangerous propaganda\\". As a result, MigrationWatch and Andrew Green threatened to take libel action against Bercow. After she instructed the lawyer David Allen Green to defend the threatened action, MigrationWatch dropped its threat. According to a MigrationWatch press release, in the light of an assurance by her lawyer that Mrs Bercow \\"did not intend to (and did not) allege that Migrationwatch is a fascist or racist organisation\\", the organisation decided not to take the matter further.

It describes itself as the oldest formally organized horticultural institution in the United States. In its mission statement, the society dedicates itself to encouraging the science and practice of horticulture and developing the public's enjoyment, appreciation, and understanding of plants and the environment. As of 2014, it had some 5,000 members. History 137px Exhibition of the Society The society was established in 1829 in Boston as the Boston Horticultural Society, and promptly began weekly exhibits (in Faneuil Hall and Quincy Market) of locally grown fruit and later vegetables, teaching the newest horticultural techniques and breeds, including the local Concord grape in 1853. It continued this tradition from 1871 through 2008 with its annual New England Spring Flower Show. In 1831 the society bought a estate called \\"Sweet Auburn\\" for an arboretum, garden, and cemetery. Although the horticultural garden never materialized, in 1835 the site was incorporated as Mount Auburn Cemetery. Until 1976, the society received one-fourth of the proceeds from the sale of Mount Auburn's cemetery lots. Elm Bank Horticulture Center. The current Horticulural Hall, at 300 Massachusetts Avenue at the corner of Huntington Avenue, was built in 1901 and was designed by Edmund March Wheelwright. =Horticultural Hall= In its early years, the Society met in various locations in Boston. Starting in 1845, the society has built for itself three successive exhibit halls, each named \\"Horticultural Hall.\\" The first was located on School Street; the second on Tremont Street, and the third on Massachusetts Avenue. Since 2001 the society's headquarters have been at the Elm Bank Horticulture Center (36 acres) in Wellesley. The encompass multiple gardens including an acre-sized one designed by prominent UK plantsman Adrian Bloom. Other gardens include the Weezie's Children's Garden, an Italianate Garden, a floral and vegetable trial garden run as part of the All-America Selection group, and specialty gardens built around rhododendron, daylilies, herbs and native plants. =Financial difficulties= In 2008 the society found itself in financial difficulty. Following revelation that then- new executive director Bob Feige had spent three days in jail the year before for failing to pay employees at a former business he owned, the trustees began a detailed review of the books which revealed the organization to be \\"essentially broke and facing a stack of bills with no way to pay them.\\" Feige resigned after the trustees presented the facts, but it was apparent that problems were building over a number of years due to overspending. In 2002 the society sold $5.25 million of rare books and prints to raise cash, at which time the Massachusetts Attorney General strongly advised the society to educate its trustees on sound financial practices.\\"Facing Trouble with Deep Roots\\" In order to conserve cash the society decided to not hold the New England Spring Flower Show in 2009 for the first time since 1871, opting instead for a truncated event in downtown Boston called 'Blooms\\". In September 2009, MassHort announced that it would incorporate \\"Blooms\\" as part of the Boston Flower & Garden Show, produced by the Paragon Group, Inc., a privately- held events marketing group. That show took place in March 2010 at the Seaport World Trade Center. MassHort took responsibility for two floral design competitions, amateur horticulture competition, Ikebana displays, plant society displays and one day of lectures. In its May 2010 newsletter, 'The Leaflet', MassHort described the venture as 'financially successful'. Also in its May 2010 newsletter, MassHort reported it had reached agreement with the bulk of its remaining creditors by selling off an additional group of books from its collection. =Mass Hort 2011 and Beyond= In January 2011 the Board of Trustees hired Katherine K. Macdonald as Executive Director/President of the Society after the Board stabilized the organization's financials. During the period from 2011 to the writing of this note (2014) Massachusetts Horticultural Society has expanded it programming, delivering its educational mission of promoting horticulture and the understanding of the natural world. Contemporary programs include: The Garden to Table Program, which offers the public an opportunity to come together in a beautiful and welcoming setting to learn about growing, cooking, and preserving healthy food; Thursday Night at the Hort: an adult horticulture lecture series; Plantmobile: youth science and horticulture outreach; Hands On Hort: experiential programs in the gardens; as well as the Gardeners Fair (May) help to connect people with horticulture. The Society continues it 116-year-old tradition of Honorary Medals in October, where we recognize the outstanding contributions of horticulturalists, plant innovators, and those who have made significant contributions to the enjoyment and appreciation of plants and the environment. In November and December, the Festival of Trees provides an enjoyable family event to celebrate the holidays. The Gardens at Elm Bank include twelve display gardens. In 2011, a new vegetable garden was designed to support the Garden to Table program. By 2013, this vegetable garden was producing over 4000 pounds of produce that was donated to two food pantries. The Welcome Garden near the parking lot entrance was added in 2012, designed by Paul Miskovsky. Improvements to the Italianate Garden included the restoration of the fountain, a central element to the garden. In January 2014 the Italianate Garden was featured on This Old House. Since 2011, over $250,000 in capital investments have been made to the property, thanks to the generosity of foundation grants. A small staff and hundreds of volunteers, including Master Gardeners, work together to make the Gardens at Elm Bank a wonderful destination for visitors. Garden group tours are available Tuesdays at 10 am from April 30 to October 1. Mass Hort at the Flower Show provides the management of the amateur horticulture, floral design, Ikebana, and photography for Paragon Group, the owners of the Boston Flower & Garden Show. Working with hundreds of volunteers, committees, and amateur competitors, this important rite of spring continues for the public to learn and enjoy plants, flowers, and design. 1840 Grand Dahlia show Award winners * 1911 George R.

History Richard Blair, 2016 The origins of the band can be traced back to 1992 when Richard Blair, then a studio engineer for Peter Gabriel's Real World Records label, found himself working on the album La Candela Viva by Tot√≥ la Momposina. Captivated by the mix of Latin and Afro-Caribbean sounds made by Tot√≥ and her band, he made the journey to Colombia to visit her and find out more about her music. Originally intending to stay for just a few weeks holiday, Blair ended up staying in Colombia for three years, as he immersed himself in the culture and the music of the country, funding his stay by producing and engineering the early albums by artists who would later go on to be some of Colombia's best known musicians, including Con el Corazon en la Mano by Aterciopelados and La Tierra del Olvido by Carlos Vives. Returning to the UK in 1996, Blair began DJing under the name Sidestepper and recorded the album Southern Star. Released in 1997 on the UK label Deep South, the album was an instrumental mix of salsa and British styles such as drum and bass and dub. While working on La Tierra del Olvido Blair had met the album's co- producer Iv√°n Benavides, a singer-songwriter who had previously been part of the duo Iv√°n y Luc√≠a. On a visit to Colombia in 1997 Blair played his tracks to Benavides and suggested that they should write some songs together to add vocals to Blair's music. The pair set about putting together a band of the same name, with the intention of playing live versions of the songs they had written. Sidestepper signed to MTM in Colombia and Chris Blackwell's US-based label Palm Pictures worldwide to produce three further albums, More Grip (2000), 3AM (In Beats We Trust) (2003) and Continental (2006), which continued to explore the salsa/drum and bass hybrid sound while incorporating other Colombian rhythms such as cumbia and bullerengue. Benavides stopped working with the group in 2007 when he moved back to Colombia from New York in order to concentrate on setting up his new project \\"Toda Via\\" to promote independent Colombian musicians. Biography of Iv√°n Benavides as artistic producer of the 2010 \\"Gran Concierto Nacional\\", Colombian Ministry of Culture website In an interview with the Colombian newspaper El Tiempo Blair dismissed the notion that Benavides had \\"left\\" the band, saying that he had never \\"joined\\" the group or been part of the live act, and that the likes of Benavides, Pernett and Mart√≠nez were simply part of a fluid collective that changed over time. In 2008 Palm Pictures released a mix album, The Buena Vibra Sound System, consisting of previously unreleased tracks and remixes of old songs. In 2011 Bogot√°-based label Polen released a compilation album titled 15: The Best of 1996‚Äì2011, preceded by a new single, \\"Justicia\\". Following the end of their contract with Palm Pictures, the band took a long break and the individual members worked on other musical projects. The group raised money via the crowdfunding website Pledge Music to record a new album, Supernatural Love, in their home studio in Bogot√°.Sidestepper album page on Pledge Music It was released to Pledge Music subscribers in March 2015, with a full worldwide release on Real World Records in January 2016. Supernatural Love marked a new musical direction for the band, replacing the electronic sounds with more traditional instruments such as hand drums, shakers, flutes and acoustic instruments.

Background The follow-up to Rock Bottom, for which Wyatt had written all of the music and lyrics, Ruth... consisted of Wyatt's adaptations and arrangements of other people's music (either friends ‚Äì Phil Manzanera, Fred Frith, Mongezi Feza, former Wilde Flowers bandmate Brian Hopper ‚Äì or influences ‚Äì Charlie Haden) with Wyatt adding his own lyrics in much the same way as he had done on Matching Mole's Little Red Record. Apart from \\"Sonia\\", recorded for the shelved \\"Yesterday Man\\" single in October 1974 (again with Nick Mason as producer), the entire album was recorded and mixed at Virgin's The Manor Studio with Wyatt himself handling production duties. Much of the album features Wyatt (on lead vocals and keyboards) backed by a \\"band\\" consisting of bassist Bill MacCormick, drummer Laurie Allan and saxophonists George Khan and Gary Windo, with Brian Eno adding his own idiosyncratic \\"anti- jazz\\" touch. Two years earlier Wyatt had provided the hypnotic soundtrack to the experimental film Solar Flares by Arthur Johns. The nine-minute film, \\"a personal essay on colour effects\\", had been produced by Nick Mason and recorded at his home studio. Wyatt had been involved at an early stage and his music became an integral part of the project. The music itself would reappear on his 1975 album \\"in a more 'digestible' form\\". Concept The album contains several pieces which recall the complexity and despair of Rock Bottom, but much of the record echoes the relaxed, almost silly feel of earlier Wyatt efforts such as The End of an Ear or his work with Matching Mole. This becomes evident from the choice of title (a pun on \\"truth is stranger than fiction\\") onwards; the two sides of the original LP release were not labelled \\"Side A\\" and \\"Side B\\", but rather \\"Side Ruth\\" and \\"Side Richard\\" respectively. The songs on Side Ruth all have more traditional structures; the rollicking \\"Soup Song\\" (derived from the Wilde Flowers song \\"Slow Walking Talk\\", of which Wyatt had recorded a version with Jimi Hendrix) has the air of a pub singalong. The remaining songs are all covers or collaborations; the Mongezi Feza trumpet piece \\"Sonia\\", featuring a guest appearance by Feza himself (as do a number of other songs on the album) in the last year of his life, \\"Team Spirit\\" (written with Phil Manzanera, who would record the same song on his album Diamond Head under the title \\"Frontera\\") and a cover of \\"Song for Che\\" by Charlie Haden round off the album. The three \\"serious\\" pieces on Side Richard ‚Äì the ballad \\"Solar Flares\\", \\"5 Black Notes And 1 White Note\\" (a funeral instrumental, a rearrangement of Jacques Offenbach's Barcarolle from The Tales of Hoffmann, which degenerates into a series of noises somewhere between free jazz and electronic noise) and the piano-led Rock Bottom-esque Fred Frith collaboration \\"Muddy Mouth\\"‚Äîwith a series of brief, nonsensical interludes featuring only sparse piano accompaniment and some very strange high-pitched yelping vocals under the collective title \\"Muddy Mouse\\". Reception Ruth Is Stranger Than Richard was released in May 1975. Unlike its predecessor Rock Bottom, it received a mixed critical and public response. Not counting 1982's Nothing Can Stop Us (which brought together a series of previously released single A and B sides, most of which were cover versions), Ruth... would be Wyatt's last solo studio album until 1985's Old Rottenhat.  Track listing  Reissues from 1998 onward have the track order reversed, with \\"Side Richard\\" first and \\"Side Ruth\\" second.

It was originally a medieval fortified manor house, founded by Ednyfed Fychan. In 1438, Ioan ap Gruffudd was granted a licence to crenellate and he founded the stone castle and added a tower house. Samuel Wyatt reconstructed the property in the 1780s. History The present building was created between about 1822 and 1837 to designs by Thomas Hopper, who expanded and transformed the building beyond recognition. However a spiral staircase from the original property can still be seen, and a vaulted basement and other masonry were incorporated into the new structure. Hopper's client was George Hay Dawkins-Pennant (1764‚Äì1840), who had inherited the Penrhyn Estate on the death of his second cousin, The 1st Baron Penrhyn (first creation; 1737‚Äì1808), who had made his fortune from slavery in Jamaica and local slate quarries. The eldest of George's two daughters, Juliana, married an aristocratic Grenadier Guard, Edward Gordon Douglas (1800‚Äì1886), who, on inheriting the estate on George's death in 1840, adopted the hyphenated surname of Douglas-Pennant. Edward, the grandson of The 14th Earl of Morton, was created The 1st Baron Penrhyn (second creation) in the Peerage of the United Kingdom in 1866. The cost of the construction of this vast \\"castle\\" is disputed, and very difficult to work out accurately, as much of the timber came from the family's own forestry, and much of the labour was acquired from within their own workforce at the slate quarry. It cost the Pennant family an estimated ¬£150,000. This is the current equivalent to about ¬£49,500,000. Penrhyn is one of the most admired of the numerous mock castles built in the United Kingdom in the 19th century; Christopher Hussey called it, \\"the outstanding instance of Norman revival.\\" English Country Houses: Late Georgian (1988 edition), p. 181. . The castle is a picturesque composition that stretches over 600 feet from a tall donjon containing family rooms, through the main block built around the earlier house, to the service wing and the stables. Penrhyn Castle circa 1880 Penrhyn Castle between 1890 and 1900 Penrhyn Castle in 2011 The carved stonework staircase at Penrhyn It is built in a sombre style which allows it to possess something of the medieval fortress air despite the ground-level drawing room windows. Hopper designed all the principal interiors in a rich but restrained Norman style, with much fine plasterwork and wood and stone carving. The castle also has some specially designed Norman-style furniture, including a one-ton slate bed made for Queen Victoria when she visited in 1859. The 4th Baron Penrhyn died in June 1949, and the castle and estate passed to his niece, Lady Janet Pelham, who, on inheritance, adopted the surname of Douglas-Pennant. In 1951, the castle and 40,000 acres (160 km¬≤) of land were accepted by the treasury in lieu of death duties from Lady Janet. It now belongs to the National Trust and is open to the public. The site received 109,395 visitors in 2017. In 2020, the Trust was working on a plan to include coverage about the owners of its properties who had links to colonialism and slavery. That will including the Castle which was built from profits made by a family that used \\"hundreds of enslaved people\\".

In the nineteenth century, Penrhyn Castle was the home of the Pennant family (from 1840, the Douglas-Pennants), owners of the Penrhyn slate quarry at Bethesda. The quarry was closely associated with the development of industrial narrow-gauge railways, and in particular the Penrhyn Quarry Railway (PQR), one of the earliest industrial railways in the world. The PQR ran close to Penrhyn Castle, and when the castle was bequeathed to the National Trust in 1951 a small museum of industrial railway relics was created in the stable block. The first locomotive donated to the museum was Charles, one of the three remaining steam locomotives working on the PQR. Over the years a number of other historically significant British narrow-gauge locomotives and other artifacts have been added to the collection. =Art collection= It houses one of the finest art collections in Wales, with works by artists such as Canaletto, Richard Wilson, Carl Haag, Perino del Vaga, and Palma Vecchio.

Charles de Noyelle, S.J. (28 July 1615 ‚Äì 12 December 1686) was a Belgian Jesuit priest, elected the twelfth Superior General of the Society of Jesus. Very Rev. Charles de Noyelle, S.J.  Early formation  After secondary studies at Mons and Ypres, Charles de Noyelle joined the Jesuits at the early age of fifteen (in 1630). After following the usual spiritual training given to those newly entered into the Society, he did his Philosophy and Theology in Louvain, where he was ordained priest in 1644. He was destined to be professor of Theology, which he taught for some time in Antwerp. He had been Rector of the School of Kortrijk for three years when he was called to Rome as sub-secretary of the Society (1653)  In Rome  As soon as he was elected Superior General (in 1661) Giovanni Paolo Oliva appointed de Noyelle as his Assistant for the German provinces' affairs. He remained in that post for 20 years, being made Vicar General of the Society on several occasions too. At the General Congregation that followed the death of Father Oliva Charles de Noyelle was elected unanimously, at the first ballot, Superior General. This remains the only case (leaving aside St. Ignatius of Loyola) of a Superior General being elected unanimously.  Problems and controversies  Just about the time of his election, the dispute between Louis XIV of France and Pope Innocent XI (over the Gallican Liberties, among other subjects) had culminated in the publication of the D√©claration du clerg√© de France. This placed the Society in a difficult position in France, as its attachment to the Universal Church and the Pope prevented the Jesuits to teach the Gallicanism of the Declaration. It required all the ingenuity and ability of the influential Father Fran√ßois de la Chaise and Father de Noyelle to prevent a break. The middle of the road position adopted by the Society dissatisfied Innocent XI with whom the Jesuits had otherwise good relations. Even more delicate was the question of the Chinese Rites. Reports of Jesuits (in China) ignoring or rejecting openly the papal decree forbidding the so-called Chinese rites reached the Congregation of the Propaganda Fide, resulted in ill will towards the Society.

Early life and education Moshe Shmuel Shapiro's father, Aryeh Shapira, was the son of Refael Shapiro of Volozhin and grandson of Naftali Zvi Yehuda Berlin (the Netziv.) His mother was a descendant of Yom Tov Lipman Heilpern of Bialystock (1816‚Äì1879), a descendant of Yom-Tov Lipmann Heller. Even though his father was the Dayan of Bia≈Çystok, Poland, Moshe Shmuel was born in the city of Minsk, Belarus, where his family had escaped the horrors of World War I. After the war, the Shapira family returned to Bia≈Çystok where Shapiro studied in the local yeshiva. Chaim Soloveitchik, Moshe Shmuel's uncle, frequented the Shapira residence. In 1933, Shapiro left home to study in the Baranovich Yeshiva under the tutelage of Elchonon Wasserman. Shmuel Berenbaum, the Rosh Yeshiva of Yeshivas Mir, attests to the special relationship which existed between the young Shapiro and Wasserman. Even after Shaprio left Baranovich, he continued corresponding with Wasserman. In the summer of 1936, Shapiro moved to Yeshivas Mir where he immediately gained a reputation as having potential for leading the Torah world and was recognized by Yerucham Levovitz. Shapiro joined students older than himself in sleeping arrangements, despite his young age compared to them. He developed a friendship with such Torah scholars as Yonah Karpilov of Minsk (who was murdered in the Holocaust) and Aryeh Leib Malin. In 1937, Shapiro reached the age of army conscription and had to flee Poland. He moved to Israel. In Israel In Israel, Shapiro attended Yeshivas Lomza in Petah Tikva, where Yechezkel Levenstein recognized his potential. During his time in Lomza, Elazar Shach was the main Talmudic lecturer, while Shapiro and Shmuel Rozovsky delivered other specialized lectures in Talmud studies. During this time, Shapiro was the teacher of many rabbis, including Chaim Kanievsky. When Shapiro's first cousin, Yitzchok Zev Soloveitchik, moved to Jerusalem, Shapiro developed a strong relationship with him and helped publicize the Brisker methods. He was given special access to writings from his cousin and his uncle, Chaim Soloveitchik, which he incorporated into his own understandings of various Gemara sugyas. Shapiro was the main editor of the works of Yitzchok Zev Soloveitchik on Kodashim. Shapiro was granted semicha by Isser Zalman Meltzer. During this period he also became very close to Avrohom Yeshaya Karelitz. After his marriage in 1946, Shapiro spent one year learning in Karelitz's kollel (known as Kollel Chazon Ish and then was hired to deliver Talmudic lectures in Yeshivas Kol Torah for three years. At the behest of Karelitz, Shapiro joined Shlomo Wolbe in establishing Yeshivas Be'er Yaakov. He was also the Chief Rabbi of Ramle, the town where his yeshiva was located, for a short time before resigning because it took away too much time from running his Yeshiva. Shapiro consulted with Karelitz and Yitzchok Zev Soloveitchik on all yeshiva matters. In 1953, on the day of the death of the Karelitz, Shapiro held a two-hour conversation in Torah with the aging sage. In 1968, Shapiro was repeatedly asked to join the Moetzes Gedolei HaTorah by Yisrael Alter, the Gerrer Rebbe, and Yechezkel Sarna. Eventually he acceded to their request when the latter paid him a personal visit. Works From the year 1963 until the year of his death, Shapiro published many Talmudic works on the Orders of Nashim, Nezikin, and Moed. They are divided into two sets of books. Kuntres Ha-Biurim are in-depth analysis of various Talmudic topics, often based on exclusive manuscripts and ideas which Shapiro heard from Yitzchok Zev Soloveitchik. Sha'arei Shemu'os is a compilation of Shapiro's novellae arranged by folio of the Talmudic tractates on which he published his works. Shapiro's sons published his work on Tanakh entitled Zahav MiShva. Shapiro also worked extensively with manuscripts of various Rishonim and published an edition of the Ri Migash with his own footnotes.

The organization gained power promising stability and a restoration of the United Kingdom after a worldwide nuclear war between the United States and the Soviet Union decimates the Earth. The United Kingdom and Ireland survive due to their geographic isolation and the decommissioning of Britain's nuclear arsenal, but suffer widespread damage leading to societal instability, which is a catalyst for the rise of Norsefire. Due to the chaotic state of the world outside of the United Kingdom, the party gained power by promising order and security among the population. However, while the Norsefire regime did indeed bring order back to the country, this order came at a cost. Political opponents along with religious and ethnic minorities were rounded up and sent to concentration camps. With their potential enemies all removed within a short space of time, Norsefire began consolidating their power over the country. In public, the party portrays itself as a Christian fascist party supportive of the Anglican Communion. In private, the party leaders are apathetic on the subject, and allow higher-ranking members to not follow Christian morality or Christianity in private as long as it did not threaten the party's power. For instance, propagandist Lewis Prothero takes illicit drugs, Bishop Lilliman has relations with children, and three Fingermen attempt to rape Evey Hammond when they apprehend her. The head of the party, Leader Adam Susan, actually worships Fate, the super-computer surveillance system that surveys the nation, and considers himself and his creation God. While this is not explored in the film, both novel and film imply that Susan/Sutler is not a fervent Christian so much as a person who values security and order, which he maintains by eliminating political opponents and cultural minorities. Similarly, the Islamophobia that Norsefire exhibits in the film is likely not the result of a hatred of Islam so much as a consequence of their perception of Muslims as terrorists, as well as that many Muslims are Arabs and thus violate Norsefire's standards for racial purity. The Norsefire party is loosely based on the Nazi Party and the private religious views of Adolf Hitler.* Alan Bullock; Hitler: a Study in Tyranny; Harper Perennial Edition 1991; p. 219: \\"Hitler had been brought up a Catholic and was impressed by the organisation and power of the Church... [but] to its teachings he showed only the sharpest hostility... he detested [Christianity]'s ethics in particular\\" * Ian Kershaw; Hitler: a Biography; Norton; 2008 ed; pp. 295‚Äì297: \\"In early 1937 [Hitler] was declaring that 'Christianity was ripe for destruction', and that the Churches must yield to the 'primacy of the state', railing against any compromise with 'the most horrible institution imaginable'\\" * Richard J. Evans; The Third Reich at War; Penguin Press; New York 2009, p. 547: Evans wrote that Hitler believed Germany could not tolerate the intervention of foreign influences such as the Pope and \\"Priests, he said, were 'black bugs', 'abortions in black cassocks'\\". Evans noted that Hitler saw Christianity as \\"indelibly Jewish in origin and character\\" and a \\"prototype of Bolshevism\\", which \\"violated the law of natural selection\\". * Richard Overy: The Dictators Hitler's Germany Stalin's Russia; Allen Lane/Penguin; 2004.p 281: \\"[Hitler's] few private remarks on Christianity betray a profound contempt and indifference\\". * A. N. Wilson; Hitler a Short Biography; Harper Press; 2012, p. 71.: \\"Much is sometimes made of the Catholic upbringing of Hitler... it was something to which Hitler himself often made allusion, and he was nearly always violently hostile.

Catholicism and the Roots of Nazism. Oxford: Oxford University Press, p. 181 : Hastings considers it plausible that Hitler was a Catholic as late as his trial in 1924, but writes that \\"there is little doubt that Hitler was a staunch opponent of Christianity throughout the duration of the Third Reich.\\" * Joseph Goebbels (Fred Taylor Translation); The Goebbels Diaries 1939‚Äì41; Hamish Hamilton Ltd; London; 1982; : In his entry for 29 April 1941, Goebbels noted long discussions about the Vatican and Christianity, and wrote: \\"The Fuhrer is a fierce opponent of all that humbug\\". * Albert Speer; Inside the Third Reich: Memoirs; Translation by Richard and Clara Winston; Macmillan; New York; 1970; p.123: \\"Once I have settled my other problem,\\" [Hitler] occasionally declared, \\"I'll have my reckoning with the church. I'll have it reeling on the ropes.\\" But Bormann did not want this reckoning postponed [...] he would take out a document from his pocket and begin reading passages from a defiant sermon or pastoral letter. Frequently Hitler would become so worked up... and vowed to punish the offending clergyman eventually... That he could not immediately retaliate raised him to a white heat...\\" * Hitler's Table Talk: \\"The dogma of Christianity gets worn away before the advances of science. Religion will have to make more and more concessions. Gradually the myths crumble. All that's left is to prove that in nature there is no frontier between the organic and the inorganic. When understanding of the universe has become widespread, when the majority of men know that the stars are not sources of light but worlds, perhaps inhabited worlds like ours, then the Christian doctrine will be convicted of absurdity.\\"  Overview  In the story, the party is presented as rising during a post- apocalyptic Britain that has narrowly avoided an international nuclear war from 1988 on. As displayed during the story of Evey Hammond, although the United Kingdom did not suffer any nuclear attacks, the effects of full-scale nuclear war on other countries had severe effects on the environment, and thus on agriculture. This in its turn severely damaged the British economy and mass riots broke out. As Evey relays to V, an anarchist determined to destroy Norsefire, the government quickly collapsed and chaos overran the country. The situation turned after several years. From the madness of the violence came the ultra right-wing Norsefire regime: fascists (similar to Oswald Mosley's British Union of Fascists) that united with the surviving big companies and businesses, giving them the appearance of wealth and stability. After seizing control of the country, the party gained complete control over the Anglican Church and other influential organizations to promote doctrines favorable to Norsefire. They began promoting and demoting members of the clergy as they saw fit. They also took over the television companies, creating NTV (Norsefire Television), and implemented the technologies that would allow for a closely monitored society, including closed-circuit television. In the novel the British monarchy continues under Queen Zara. No direct reference is made to the monarchy in the film, though \\"God Save the King\\" is played during a television comedy sketch to greet an actor playing Chancellor Sutler. By the time the story of the graphic novel has begun, Norsefire has shut down the concentration camps and is essentially in complete control of society. Although competition exists between the varying branches of the state, they generally have complete control over the United Kingdom. Their control over the state soon faces a threat from V, the anarchist protagonist of the story who seeks to overthrow the regime and allow the people to decide their own fate. By the end of the novel, every top government official and notable figure in Norsefire has died, except for Lewis Prothero who is driven insane by V and incapacitated by Norsefire early on in the novel, and Eric Finch who leaves Norsefire after he kills V and when Norsefire collapses. In the movie, anti-Irish sentiment is implied to be an element of party policy, Prothero mocks a member of the technical staff on his show as \\"that Paddy\\" and Creedy views Finch with suspicion on the grounds that Finch's mother was Irish and then gloats about the death toll in Ireland from the \\"St. Mary's Virus\\", although the outbreak in Ireland may have been an unintended result of infected British citizens travelling to the Irish Republic. = Motto = A common recurring motto is \\"Strength Through Purity, Purity Through Faith\\" (or in the film, \\"Strength Through Unity, Unity Through Faith\\"). The British Union of Fascists also used a similar slogan, \\"Action within unity\\". Another maxim often used by Norsefire as a salute is \\"England Prevails\\". = Symbol = The flag of Norsefire as portrayed in the film version of V for Vendetta. In the book, a blue \\"N\\" on a black flag is the symbol of the party. An \\"N\\" or \\"NF\\" are the only party symbols shown. Yet, as mentioned above, the first issue's cover also features a Greek or Latin cross merged into a pair of wings rising from red flames. In the film, the Norsefire symbol is the Cross of Saint George combined with a Nordic cross in red and black, with the black possibly taken from the flag of Saint David and the Nordic cross representing Scotland. The symbol is shown on flags, police badges, coat of arms, government vehicles, and army beret badges. Two versions exist, one with a red cross on a black background and another with a black cross on a red background.

At school, he organised the first student parliament, and after graduating from Utrecht University with a degree in law and international relations in 1975, wanted to be a journalist or politician. Career On graduation, he decided to immediately undertake his National Service with the Royal Netherlands Army, where he founded the Algemene Vereniging Nederlandse Militairen (General Association of Dutch soldiers), a union that existed until 1996. On leaving the army, to enable him to continue his work with the trade union, he joined a subsidiary of ITT Corporation because it gave him time to sit on a Dutch state committee to reform the army. His first promotion came after he went to the European Union Parliament in Brussels to protest about the company's alleged role in the overthrow of Salvador Allende's government in Chile; ITT responded by making him its Netherlands public relations chief. In 1988, Verwaayen became a director of PTT Telecom, the state-owned Dutch telecoms group that was a forerunner of today's KPN; and then was appointed a board member of Lucent Technologies in 1997, moving to the United States.

Early career Anstis is first recorded as a member of the sloop Buck, which sailed from New Providence in the Bahamas in 1718. During the course of the voyage, Anstis conspired with six other crew members to attempt a mutiny aboard the ship which, upon doing so, stated their intentions to sail southward as pirates. Howell Davis was elected captain. After Davis' death Bartholomew Roberts replaced him as captain, and eventually had several ships. Anstis commanded one of these, the brigantine Good Fortune.Charles Johnson, A General History of the Robberies and Murders of the Most Notorious Pyrates, p. Roberts, Fenn & Admiral Flowers During the night of 18 April 1721, Roberts' ships headed for Africa, but Anstis and his crew in the Good Fortune slipped away in the night and continued to operate in the Caribbean. Between Hispaniola and Jamaica, the Good Fortune plundered two vessels. Aboard one, the Irwin, Anstis's crew committed gang rape and murder against a female passenger. Afterwards they stopped to careen their vessel. Continuing onward towards Bermuda, Anstis spotted a treasure ship out from Guinea heading towards the Carolinas, Morning Star. After its capture, the ship was outfitted with 32 guns and placed in the command of ships gunner John Fenn, Anstis opting to retain command of the smaller Good Fortune because of her superior handling. The two ships continued to sail along the southeastern coast of the colonies until fighting began to break out among many of the forced crew members, and they decided to petition George I of Great Britain for a pardon, claiming they had been forced into piracy by Anstis and Roberts. Sailing to an island off Cabo San Antonio in Cuba, the crew awaited a reply from the British government for nine months until August 1722, when they received news from their courier ship that their pleas had been ignored, and the king had sent Admiral Sir John Flowers to eradicate the pirates. On their southward course they encountered the Grand Caymans, where the Morning Star ran aground and, as the survivors were being rescued by the Good Fortune, the pirates were sighted and pursued by HMS Hector and HMS Adventure. Anstis was forced to cut his anchor cable and run, finally making his escape under oars when the fresh wind subsided. Anstis lost more than forty of his men on Grand Cayman, most of these being captured by a landing party from the two Royal Navy vessels, under the command of Flowers. Anstis and Fenn (who had been rescued from Grand Cayman before the interference of the Royal Navy) now sailed to the Bay of Honduras and careened on an offshore island, capturing three or four prizes en route and augmenting their depleted crew from their captives. Anstis next sailed for the Bahama Islands in early December 1722. On the way, he captured a sloop named Antelope, which he added to his squadron, and then a 24-gun ship, which was entrusted to Fenn. Not all sources agree on the details of Anstis' associates or the ships in his group. Some sources have Anstis keeping Morning Star for himself and putting Brigstock Weaver in command of Good Fortune. Weaver's ship had been captured by Roberts and Montigny la Palisse, who forced Weaver to sign their Articles. When Anstis left Roberts, Weaver was first mate on the Good Fortune. Weaver eventually made his way back to England where he was pardoned after his trial. Final days The pirates put in at Tobago in April 1723, intending to careen their new vessels, and having just started the task, they were surprised by the British man-of-war Admiral Sir John Flowers HMS Winchelsea. Antis and his men were forced to burn the ship and the sloop and flee into the island's interior, but the Winchelsea's marines overtook and captured them. Anstis escaped again in his swift brigantine Good Fortune, but his crew, discouraged by their losses, murdered him as he slept in his hammock, and took prisoner all who remained loyal. The mutineers then surrendered to Dutch authorities in Cura√ßao, where they received amnesty and their prisoners were hanged.

Description Corn spurry is a summer or winter annual broadleaf plant, and its seeds buried in the soil can survive for several years. The leaves contain a compound called oxalate that can be toxic if eaten in large quantities by livestock. =Flower= Perfect flower with 5 white tiny petals and 5 green sepals slightly offset from petals. There are also 10 yellow stamens about 1 cm in diameter. Taxonomy and nomenclature Spergula arvensis var. arvensis and S. arvensis var. sativum are the distinct variants, that have been found in the UK and the chromosome number: 2n = 18. It is the county flower of Montgomeryshire in the United Kingdom. It is considered a cosmopolitan agricultural weed. Habitats Roadsides, farmland, sand dunes, and coniferous woodland. A kind of plant, which can be found in almost all over the world, including Britain. Reproduction Corn spurry can be reproduced by the following ways: *Free spread of the weed ‚Äì Because of the high seed yield rate of corn spurry, it can produce 10-40 fruits (capsules) per plant, and each capsule produces about 20 seeds in summer and autumn. It also produces seeds while flowering, that is, the upper part of the same plant is still blooming, and the lower part of the mature seeds have dropped. Corn spurry has small, lightweight seeds that can be spread by the wind and cover adjacent land the next year. *Ruminants spread ‚Äì The excrement of ruminants can also be transmitted. After eating ruminants, their mature seeds cannot be digested in the stomach of the animal, and they can continue to germinate and grow after they are expelled from the excrement. Therefore, although some suitable habitats are far away, they can be transmitted and reproduced through the livestock trade. Prevention It takes less time and money to prevent crops from corn spurry than it does to control corn interference. When planting in a new area, you should plant registered seeds. Ensure that infected areas are well cleaned to ensure that seeds are not transferred. Corn spurry control =Cultural control= Corn spurries do not germinate in very deep soil, thus, conventional planting methods can bury some of them. Experimental studies have shown that the germination rate decreases as the depth of seeds buried in the soil increases. However, being buried increases the life span of the seeds, which means that they end up on the surface of the soil as a result of cultivation. Therefore, once the ideal soil and weather conditions are achieved, plant high-yield crops in the field as soon as possible, with narrower rows and higher number of plants between the crops. =Physical control= Before sowing the seeds of the crops, some mechanical methods can be carried out, such as hand hoeing, ploughing, grazing and so on. =Chemical control= Chemicals can be applied to control corn spurry, but this variety is resistant to many kinds of herbicides. Chemicals can be used to control weeds, but the variety is resistant to many herbicides. =Biological control= It is known that few insects and pathogens can attack corn spurry, while an arbuscular-mycorrhizal fungal inoculum has been shown to be effective in reducing the biomass of weeds.

The Kurloff cell contains a characteristic proteoglycan- containing inclusion body. In the guinea pig, Kurloff cells are more numerous in the adult female than the adult male. A marked increase in the number of circulating Kurloff cells is present in the peripheral blood during pregnancy and after estrogen treatment in male and female animals. A relatively smaller number of cells take place in immature, non-pregnant, and non-estrogen-treated animals. The exact function of Kurloff cells remains unknown, but it has some of the characteristics of both monocytes and lymphocytes. In guinea-pigs, it has been proposed that Kurloff cells mainly involve in the function of the immune system, such as acting as a natural killer cell and preventing damage to the trophoblast by maternal defensive cells. Also, Kurloff cells present antibody-dependent cytotoxic activity in vitro.  Structure  The structure of Kurloff cell was identified using light microscopy and periodic-acid Schiff staining. The Kurloff cell has an egg shape and the axis of the cell varies from 8 to 12 ¬µm in length, and 10-25 ¬µm in diameter. The inclusion body, which is round in shape and 1-8 ¬µm in diameter, occupies most of the cell's cytoplasm. Also, the inclusion body resembles a lymphocyte. The nucleus of Kurloff cell is sickle-shaped and is pushed toward the periphery of the cell by the inclusion body. In thymus and spleen, Kurloff cells are categorized depending on the size and the number of inclusion bodies within cells. The cells with small and medium-sized inclusions are present when the density of thymocytes is low. On the other hand, cells with large inclusion bodies were first observed among low-density cells. Over time, they are found where the density of thymocytes is high.  Tissue distribution  In pregnant and estrogen-treated male and female guinea pigs, clumps of Kurloff cells containing inclusion bodies of different sizes are present in large numbers in stromal tissue of the thymus and bone marrows, and the pulp cords of the spleen. In the thymus, clumps of Kurloff cells are occasionally seen at the cortico-medullary junction, scattered single cells are seen in the cortex, and numerous Kurloff cells are spotted in lymphatics and venules. In the spleen, Kurloff cells are absent in the lymphoid tissue of the white pulp, whereas there are large numbers in the red pulp. In the vertebral bone marrow, Kurloff cells are seen scattered as single cells and in clumps in random pattern among the hematopoietic cells in the stroma. Besides, the veins and lymphatic vessels of these tissues contain a significantly large number of Kurloff cells relative to the numbers in the arterial blood supply. It has been suggested that Kurloff cells might be produced at these sites. A small amount of Kurloff cells are observed within lymph nodes, and those which are present are in sinuses and blood vessels. During pregnancy and after treatment, a large number of Kurloff cells circulated in the blood. At the placenta of a pregnant guinea pig, Kurloff cells are more concentrated at the vascular channels of the labyrinth than the plasmodial spongy zone  Characteristics  In guinea pig, the Kurloff cells have some characteristics of monocytes and lymphocytes. The first characteristic that Kurloff cells share with monocytes is the presence in the blood and organ but absence from the spleen white pulp, thymus parenchyma, and lymph node follicles. The second shared characteristic is that the Kurloff cell has a receptor for cytophilic immunoglobin. On the other hand, Kurloff cells have many lymphocytic features such as it does not contain lysosomes or phagosomes, lack of nonspecific esterase activity, and phagocytic capacity, and last, the Kurloff cell with the early inclusion body possesses a lymphocyte morphology. The results of antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity assay on guineas-pig Kurloff cells strongly indicate an immunological role of the cells as the natural killer cell. The data also suggest that the Kurloff cell is probably the predominant cytotoxic line in guinea pig lymphocyte composition, and different level of killer cell activities depends mostly on varying degrees of Kurloff cell contamination. The Kurloff cells were suggested to have an impact on the immunological status of the guinea-pig placenta. The fate of cells in pregnant guineas pig has been studied by immunofluorescent methods, including an antiserum against the isolated mucoprotein of the inclusion body. The satisfactory staining of the inclusion particle was extracted from the spleen and thymus. Immunofluorescence results showed that during pregnancy circulating Kurloff cells release their inclusion particles inside the trophoblast. In the placenta, the Kurloff cell was occasionally surrounded by a cloud of tiny droplets of material, which gives a similar staining result as the inclusion particles. That material was frequently observed displaying on the luminal surface of the inner placenta compartment. It was obvious that the Kurloff cell must have a role during pregnancy in the guinea-pig because of a significant increase in the number of these cells in the blood and tissues. The inclusion material has been proved to prevent immunological damage to target cells when purified. Studies were done on the effect of extracted inclusion body material in purified form, on inflammatory cells in vitro. The results showed marked toxic effects on macrophages with first clumping follow by cell death. The evidence suggests that Kurloff cells may play a part in preventing immunological damage to the trophoblast by maternal defensive cells.

DaMSA operated throughout Denmark as part of the Danish Search and Rescue (SAR) organization that runs 21 rescue stations located along the coasts of Denmark. Responsibilities of DaMSA included authorizing navigation systems and buoyage, resolving issues concerning wrecks and their salvage in Danish waters, and running the Danish Pilotage Service (Lodsv√¶senet). DaMSA was the Centre for Operational Oceanography, which collects hydrographical and oceanographic data from all national waters, and makes charts and maps for use by the Military of Denmark and civilians. DaMSA was a full member of the North West Shelf Operational Oceanographic System. History Farvandsv√¶senet is headquartered in S√∏kv√¶sthuset. On 1 April 1973 Farvandsdirektoratet was established by merging the following organizations: Danish Lighthouse Service (Fyrv√¶senet), Danish Pilotage Service (Lodsv√¶senet), Danish Rescue Service (Redningsv√¶senet) and the Royal Danish Nautical charts archive (Det Kongelige danske S√∏kortarkiv). During the late 1970s and 1980s, the name Farvandsdirektoratet was changed to Farvandsv√¶senet. Farvandsdirektoratet remained a used and accepted name. In 1987 the Royal Danish Nautical charts archive was detached for merger with the National Survey and Cadastre of Denmark. All of these services have a long history on their own, reaching back to 1560. On 1 April 2008 Farvandsv√¶senet changed its English name from Royal Danish Administration of Navigation and Hydrography (RDANH) to Danish Maritime Safety Administration (DaMSA).Hydrographic National Report of Denmark, April 2008 Buildings Farvandsvaesenet occupied the buildings named S√∏kv√¶sthuset and Bakkehuset. Bakkehuset is known for housing the Danish poet Johan Ludvig Heiberg.Plaque on Bakkehuset Mission and tasks The mission of the Danish Maritime Safety Administration was to assure the safety of navigation at sea in Danish, Faroese and Greenlandic waters. DaMSA achieved this mission through execution of the following tasks: Exercise jurisdiction and issue nautical publications; Provide aids to navigation; Provide coastal rescue; Provide pilotage; Conduct hydrographical surveys and provide oceanographic information. DaMSA was a member of the SeaDataNet European Directory of Marine Organizations, providing bathymetric measurements in Danish and Greenlandic waters. Five surveying ships are present working in Danish waters, all equipped with a shallow water multibeam system. Two surveying ships (one with multibeam) are stationed in Greenland with working area on the west coast. Abolition The Maritime Safety Administration was abolished by royal decree of 3 October 2011. Its tasks were redistributed: pilotage service and maritime buoyage were transferred to the Ministry of Economic and Business Affairs, oceanography was transferred to the Ministry of Climate and Energy and hydrographic surveying was transferred to the Ministry of Environment.

History James, Earl of Arran, the first Colonel of the Regiment Regimental standard, 1839 The regiment was first raised by James, Earl of Arran as the Earl of Arran's Regiment of Cuirassiers in 1685 as part of the response to the Monmouth Rebellion, by the regimenting of various independent troops, and was ranked as the 6th Regiment of Horse. It fought at the Battle of the Boyne in July 1690 and the Battle of Steenkerque in August 1692 during the Williamite War in Ireland. In 1691 it was re-ranked as the 5th Horse, and in 1746 transferred to the Irish regiment establishment where it was the ranked 1st Horse. It returned to the British establishment in 1788, as the 4th (Royal Irish) Dragoon Guards. The regiment was then involved in activities in support of the Invasion of France by √©migr√©s in June 1795 before taking part in fighting at the Battle of Naas on 24 May 1798, the Battle of Prosperous also on 24 May 1798 and the Battle of Tuberneering on 4 June 1798 during the Irish Rebellion. At Tuberneering a troop from the regiment were ambushed and the troop commander, Lieutenant-Colonel Walpole and 100 of his men died. The regiment went on to fight at the Battle of Arklow on 9 June 1798 and the Battle of Vinegar Hill on 21 June 1798. The 4th (Royal Irish) Dragoon Guards departing from the Crimea in 1856 Musicians of the 4th (Royal Irish) Dragoon Guards in 1859 The regiment was deployed to the Peninsula in 1811 and fought under General Sir John Slade at the Siege of Ciudad Rodrigo in January 1812 during the Peninsular War. It also took part in the charge of the Heavy Brigade at the Battle of Balaclava in October 1854 during the Crimean War and in the Battle of Tel el-Kebir in September 1882 during the Anglo-Egyptian War. Returning to the United Kingdom in late 1882, the regiment was back in Egypt (detachment to the Nile) from 1884 to 1885, then was posted to Ireland in 1886. It returned to England in 1891, and was posted to British India in 1894, where it was first stationed at Rawalpindi in Punjab, then from late 1902 in Muttra.Hart‚Ä≤s Army list, 1903 A defensive position built by the 4th (Royal Irish) Dragoon Guards in August 1914 The regiment landed in France at the outbreak of the First World War as part of the 2nd Cavalry Brigade in the 1st Cavalry Division on 16 August 1914 for service on the Western Front. Perhaps the regiment's most notable engagement was on 22 August 1914, when one of its squadrons became the first members of the British Expeditionary Force to engage the German army in the First World War. Two full troops of British cavalry surprised four patrolling German cavalrymen of the 2nd Kuirassiers at Casteau near Mons. After a brief pursuit the British cavalry killed most of the German patrol. Captain Charles Hornby was reputed to have become the first British soldier to kill a German soldier, using his sword, and Drummer Edward Thomas is reputed to have fired the first British shots of the war. In 1921 the regiment was renamed the 4th Royal Irish Dragoon Guards. In 1922 it was amalgamated with 7th Dragoon Guards (Princess Royal's) to form the 4th/7th Dragoon Guards.

Tirso Gonz√°lez de Santalla, S.J. (18 January 1624 - 27 October 1705) was a Spanish theologian who was elected, in 1687, the thirteenth Superior General of the Society of Jesus. Formation and Studies Santalla was born in Arganza, Spain. He did his Humanities and Letters at Villafranca (Leœån), and a year of Philosophy at Oviedo before he entered the Society of Jesus in 1643. Studies of Philosophy at Valladolid (1645‚Äì47) and Theology at the University of Salamanca (1647‚Äì51) with a further two years of specialization. A brilliant debater he was trained to be professor of philosophy and theology, which he did at Santiago (Philosophy, 1653‚Äì55) and Valladolid and Salamanca (Theology, 1656‚Äì65), and again from 1676 to 1687, the intervening years having been devoted to preaching. Early career As an ardent adversary of probabilism Gonz√°lez had frequently asked his superiors to have some Jesuit write against the doctrine. He himself had composed a work in which he defended probabiliorism, assigning, however, an exaggerated importance to the subjective estimation of the degree of probability. The general revisors of the Society unanimously rendered an unfavorable opinion on the work, and accordingly, in 1674, the Superior General Giovanni Paolo Oliva refused permission for its publication. Gonz√°lez received encouragement from Pope Innocent XI and by his order the Holy Office issued a decree, in 1680, ordering the superiors of the Society to allow their subjects to defend probabiliorism, a permission that had never been denied. Superior General When about to set out for Africa to convert the Muslims in 1687, he was sent as an elector to the thirteenth general congregation, by which he was elected Superior General (6 July 1687). Concerned that most Jesuits were in favour of probabilism, the Pope made it clear that Gonz√°lez, a rare probabiliorist in the Society, was his candidate. As General of the Society, Gonz√°lez felt himself obliged to fight probabilism among his subjects. In 1691, he had printed a modified edition of his former work, but, owing to the efforts of his assistants, this book was never published. Pope Innocent XII ordered a new examination of it to be made, and with many corrections it finally appeared in 1694, under the title Fundamentum Theologiae moralis id est, tractatus theologicus de recto usu opinionum probabilium. He died, aged 81, in Rome. Works We also have from the pen of Gonz√°lez some apologetic works: Selectarum disputationum tomi quattuor (1680) in which are found chapters against the Thomists, Jansenists, and some doctors of Louvain; treatises on the Immaculate Conception, and on papal infallibility. This last, directed against the Declaration of the Clergy of France of 1682, and printed by the order of Innocent XI, was afterwards suppressed by Alexander VIII, who feared new difficulties with the French court. The work appeared, in r√©sum√© only, in 1691. References * HOANG MANH-HIEN, J., Th. Gonzalez et le probabilisme, Cholon, 1959; * EMANUELE COLOMBO, Convertire i musulmani.

It is located on the top of a mountain, in the Guba Forest. It was constructed by the Sassanid Persians in the 5th century, it was used as a defense for the khanate of Quba in the 18th century. Today the Chirag Gala is a historic site and is frequently visited by tourists. Because of the large rocks and rough road, the Chirag Gala is almost impossible to reach with any vehicle. Most tourists and people travel by foot to the top of the mountain.  History  Chirag gala was built in 4-5th century AD and its function is stated as a lookout post. The location allows to easily warn if sudden enemy invasion occurs by lighting the torches. That's why it's called \\"Chirag Gala\\" which means \\"lamp fortress\\". Chirag gala was part of the Gilgichay defensive system, which also included Baku and Derbent fortresses. Chirag gala has stopped its defensive functions in the 18th century. In the middle of the 20th century, the fortress was partially renovated. Chirag Gala is named after a great warrior called Chirag Gala who was born in 1987  Building plan  One of the main advantages of Chirag gala is the terrain. Fortress has a form of an irregular rectangle. In the north east of fortress deep cliffs adjoin the main complex. The fortress consists of 17 towers, 1 big and 16 small towers. The towers allow the observation of the surroundings for a few tens kilometers.

Economy  Areas of economic surplus, above self-sustaining bases, were few in relation to the area under Ottoman rule. Such areas focused around an urban center surrounded by well tilled arable farmland. Populations and population density was huge where substantial rural to urban migration had occurred; famine, conflict and extortion from tax-farms being the main stimulus for this. Cities, as in Europe, were the focuses of manufacture and trade. Ottoman cities had a large out put of goods, where comprehensive guild systems maintained quality at the expense of competition. However, the main source of Ottoman wealth came from less industry reliant goods and raw materials, mainly items from the east such as silk and gemstones; also the passage of such goods generated revenue due effective taxing measures. In comparison to its neighbors, the Ottoman Empire was immensely wealthy. The economical problems are reflected on the coins with the decreasing amounts of gold and silver ratios, inflation. The influx of precious metals into Europe from the Americas had played a role in the price increases of the late 16th century in the Ottoman Empire. Traditional industries and trades, which depend on stable economy, had a big hit with the increasing inflation. Administration Many official posts required active or previous military experience; Grand Viziers, the equivalent chief ministers of other contemporary nations, often commanded the army in person. Such a social and administrative structure, however, remained effective and efficient in conducting foreign policy, gains in Europe being evidence for this.

Sylva appeared with Senegal in the 2002 World Cup and four Africa Cup of Nations tournaments. He is the current goalkeeping coach of Senegal, appointed by Aliou Ciss√© in 2015. Club career Born in Gu√©diawaye, Sylva spent nearly a decade at the service of AS Monaco FC, but featured mainly for the reserve team during his spell, being successively backup to Fabien Barthez and Flavio Roma in the main squad. He made his debut in Ligue 1 on 12 September 1999 in a 1‚Äì2 away against Stade Rennais FC, contributing with six appearances as the club won the national championship; he also served loans at Gaz√©lec Ajaccio, SAS √âpinal and AC Ajaccio before leaving in 2004, the latter two sides competing in Ligue 2. Sylva subsequently signed for Lille OSC on a free transfer, never appearing in fewer than 30 league games in his four years and helping his team to the second position in 2004‚Äì05.

It is known as pepino dulce (\\"sweet cucumber\\" in English, in order to differentiate it from cucumber which is also called \\"pepino\\" in Spanish) or simply pepino; the latter is also used for similar species such as \\"S. mucronatum\\" (which actually seems to belong in the related genus Lycianthes). The pepino dulce fruit resembles a melon (Cucumis melo) in color, and its flavor recalls a succulent mixture of honeydew and cucumber, and thus it is also sometimes called pepino melon or melon pear. Another common name, \\"tree melon\\", is more often used for the papaya (Carica papaya) though the pepino dulce plant generally does not look much like a tree; it looks more like a ground cover, trailing plant. The present species is, however, a close relative of other nightshades cultivated for their fruit, including the tomato (S. lycopersicum) and the eggplant (S. melongena), which its own fruit closely resembles. The fruit is common in markets in Colombia, Kenya, Bolivia, Peru and Chile, but less often overseas because it is quite sensitive to handling and does not travel well. Attempts to produce commercial cultivars and to export the fruit have been made in New Zealand, Turkey, Mauritius and Chile. Distribution and habitat The pepino dulce is presumed to be native to the temperate Andean regions of Colombia, Peru and Chile though it is not known in the wild and the details of its domestication are unknown. The pepino is a domesticated native of the Andes. Cultivation Pepinos are not often found archaeologically as they are soft and pulpy and not easy to preserve, while their tough seeds are small and easily lost among debris. But they were already described by early Spanish chroniclers as being cultivated on the coast; the Moche Valley in Peru was particularly famous for them. They were a popular decorative motif in Moche art.Berrin & Larco Museum (1997) left In the United States the fruit is known to have been grown in San Diego before 1889 and in Santa Barbara by 1897. More commercially viable cultivars were introduced from New Zealand and elsewhere towards the end of the 20th century, leading to its introduction into up-scale markets in Japan, Europe and North America. The pepino dulce is relatively hardy. In its native range it grows at altitudes ranging from close to sea level up to 3,000 m (10,000 ft.). However, it performs best in a warm, relatively frost-free climate. The plant can survive a low temperature of -2.5 ¬∞C (27 to 28 ¬∞F) if the freeze is not prolonged, though it may drop many of its leaves.CRFG (1996) The species is a perennial, but its sensitivity to chilling, pests, and diseases force the growers to replant the crop every year. The crop also adapts well to greenhouse cultivation, training the plants up to 2 m tall, and obtaining yields that are 2-3 times larger than those obtained outdoors. They are propagated by cuttings since they are established easily without rooting hormones. It is grown in a manner similar to its relatives such as the tomato, though it grows naturally upright by habit and can thus be cultivated as a free-standing bush, though it is sometimes pruned on . Additionally, supports are sometimes used to keep the weight of the fruit from pulling the plant down. It has a fast growth rate and bears fruit within 4 to 6 months after planting. It is a perennial, but is usually cultivated as an annual. Seedlings are intolerant of weeds, but it can later easily compete with low growing weeds. Like their relatives tomatoes, eggplants, tomatillos and tamarillos, pepinos are extremely attractive to beetles, aphids, white flies and spider mites. Pepinos are tolerant of most soil types, but require constant moisture for good fruit production. Established bushes show some tolerance to drought stress, but this typically affects yield. The plants are parthenocarpic, meaning it needs no pollination to set fruit, though pollination will encourage fruiting.Popenoe (1989): pp.296-305 Main commercial variety of Solanum muricatum seen at a supermarket in Lima, Peru.The plant is grown primarily in Chile, New Zealand and Western Australia. In Chile, more than 400 hectares are planted in the Longotoma Valley with an increasing proportion of the harvest being exported. Colombia, Peru, and Ecuador also grow the plant, but on a more local scale. Outside of the Andean region, it has been grown in various countries of Central America, Morocco, Spain, Israel, and the highlands of Kenya. In the United States several hundred hectares of the fruit are grown on a small scale in Hawaii and California. More commercially viable cultivars have been introduced from New Zealand and elsewhere in more recent times. As a result, the fruit has been introduced into up-scale markets in Japan, Europe and North America and it is slowly becoming less obscure outside of South America. The study of the molecular variation of this pepino is of interest for several reasons. Although the seeds of pepino plants are fertile and produce vigorous offspring, this crop is primarily propagated by cuttings (Heiser, 1964; Anderson, 1979; Morley-Bunker, 1983), and as a consequence, its genetic structure could be different from that of seed-propagated crops.Blanca et al.

Culinary use  Delicate and mild-flavored, pepinos are often eaten as a fresh snack fruit, though they combine very well with a number of other fruits as well.

It breeds in temporary water pools after heavy rains. Distribution and habitat The Texas toad is native to the United States where it is found in the state of Texas (in 2009 it was designated as the Texas State Amphibian), its range also extends northward to Oklahoma, westward to New Mexico and southward to northern Mexico. It is a desert species and is found in dry grassland, savannahs with scattered mesquite and open woodland, usually on sandy or frequently inundated soils. Description Males measure and females in snout‚Äìvent length. Ecology The Texas toad feeds on insects such as beetles, ants and bugs. It digs a burrow in soft soil and can bury itself in mud. It sometimes conceals itself in a gopher burrow, under a log or in a deep crack in the mud to prevent desiccation, spending much of its time dormant in prolonged dry weather. Breeding occurs after heavy rains when male frogs congregate at temporary pools, ditches, cattle tanks and other wet places and call continuously, especially at night. The call is described as being a \\"series of explosive trills\\", each lasting for about one and a half seconds with intervals of one second. The females seem to be attracted to the largest males with the loudest calls. The eggs are laid in the water, often entangled in submerged vegetation. They hatch in two days and the tadpoles feed on algae growing on underwater plants. They may retreat to deeper water when disturbed. They spend between eighteen and sixty days as tadpoles depending on circumstances such as water temperature, after which time they undergo metamorphosis and leave the water as juvenile toads. Other toads using the same water bodies for breeding include the Gulf Coast toad (Incilius valliceps), the green toad (Anaxyrus debilis), the Great Plains narrow-mouthed toad (Gastrophryne olivacea) and Couch's spadefoot toad (Scaphiopus couchii). The Texas toad sometimes hybridizes with Woodhouse's toad (Anaxyrus woodhousii) or the Great Plains toad (Anaxyrus cognatus). Status The Texas toad has a wide range and a large total population and is one of the most common toads in the southern United States. It is tolerant of changes in its habitat and is present in cultivated areas as well as grasslands and savannahs. No particular threats have been identified and the International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed it as being of \\"least concern\\".

The vast empire had no railroads, and few telegraph lines. It took three days before the major naval defeat at Sinope on 30 November 1853 was learned of in the capital. The poor communications made it very difficult for Constantinople to control its provinces. Thus the provinces in the Balkans, North Africa, and the Middle East became almost autonomous. Serbia was now an independent nation in all but name, paying only token tribute to the Sultan. The western powers had invested a great deal of resources in the Crimean War (1853‚Äì1856), and they did not wish to come to the aid of the faltering Empire again. However the nation was invaded by British, French, and Austrian businessmen and administrators, who came to reform and rebuild the economy. The reform period, known as the Tanzimat and starting in 1839, saw great changes, especially after the Crimean War: A national bank was created, the tax system was revised and strengthened, the law was altered to emulate the Napoleonic Code, a public education system based on that of the French was created, the Orient Express railroad was constructed, as well other railroads were built that travelled along the coast of Anatolia and into the Balkans. Then on Friday, May 9, 1873 disaster struck. The Vienna stock market crashed, triggering the Long Depression. The money and loans from abroad stopped pouring into Istanbul and the government entered a financial crisis. Unable to deal with this, Sultan Abd-ul-Aziz began to rapidly switch Grand Viziers. Unable to repay foreign loans, the empire was forced to default on them, and ask for assistance from Europe. Finally, the Sultan was deposed. Eventually, Abd-ul-Hamid II was girded with the Sword of Osman. Constantinople (1878) Effectiveness The Ottoman Empire's geopolitical power had always lain in its European territories, but with the rise of European nationalism in the Balkans, this power began to fade somewhat. Europe saw this fading as a sign of decline, and in the 19th and 20th centuries, it became common to describe the Empire as the \\"sick man of Europe\\". This term does not, however, necessarily reflect historical reality. The Europeans viewed the empire as a terminally sick person needing to perish, and yet this parallel was largely a misconception. The empire's actual weakness was the cultural gap, which separated it from the European powers. Textile Market in Constantinople In reality, the empire's economy was not in a bad condition: it was, in fact, growing along with the empire's population. The Ottoman administration was in the process of modernization, while its education and health systems were both improving. The bulk of the Empire was being urbanized by modern standards, as railroad lines, roads, telegraphs, and shipping were increasing rapidly. On top of everything, the Ottoman state was among the first in the world to take a step toward representative government. Most of the empire's problems were, in fact, the result of European imperialism. Because it was seen as an Islamic state, it was regarded as an enemy by both other European states, as well as by the different national communities within its own borders. It was the Europeans, however, who ultimately caused the most damage to the \\"sick man of Europe\\"; as Justin McCarthy states the issue: \\"The Ottoman Empire was not sick; it was wounded by its enemies, and finally murdered\\" See also *Socioeconomics of the Ottoman enlargement era *History of Turkey *Ottoman Empire References 19th century in the Ottoman Empire Economy of the Ottoman Empire ","title":"Socioeconomics of the Ottoman reformation era"},{"id":"4974042","text":"Joseph Mercer may refer to: * Joe Mercer (1914‚Äì1990), English football player and manager * Joe Mercer (footballer, born 1889) (1889‚Äì1927), his father, English football centre half * Joe Mercer (jockey) (born 1934), English jockey * Joseph Wayne Mercer (1845‚Äì1906), American politician in Missouri ","title":"Joseph Mercer"},{"id":"4974045","text":"is a Japanese trading card game created by Carddas initially based upon Toei's Super Sentai Series television franchise. It was released in 2006 in commemoration of the Super Sentai series' 30th anniversary. The game was expanded with several expansion packs, such as collection in 2007, featuring characters from the Kamen Rider Series television franchise, and the in 2008 featuring characters from the Metal Hero Series television franchise. The new expansions feature characters from the Super Sentai, Kamen Rider, and Metal Hero Series, and other TV series based on works by Shotaro Ishinomori (Robocon, Kikaider, Inazuman, etc.). Game cards There are four rarity categories: Normal, Rare, Super Rare, and Secret Rare. There are three kinds of cards: Unit Cards, Operation Cards, and Vehicle Cards, which were introduced in The Masked Rider Expansion. Unit Cards are divided into four sizes: Small (warriors), Medium (individual mecha), Large (mecha combinations), and Extra Large (mecha carriers). If a Unit Card has a Strike Point mark of \\"1\\", it can deliver damage. If it has an SP mark of \\"!\\", It can use an attack which is described in the card text. If it has no mark, it cannot Strike. Operation Cards involve Sentai related powers. They can be \\"Stationary\\" (the operation is in effect for as long as the card is in use) or \\"Counter\\" (can be used during your opponent's turn). Vehicle cards allow small Unit Cards to be \\"mounted\\". Game play To Hold Command (which enables cards of a certain category to be controlled) over a particular category, turn the card to its left side. To Release Command, turn it back. The play sheet used in this game has a space for the deck, a space for Operation Cards, a \\"Power Zone\\", a \\"Command Zone\\", a \\"Rush Area\\", and a \\"Battle Area\\". In order to Rush a card (bring into the Rush Area), one must Hold Command over a particular category. Each Card requires a certain number of cards in the Power Zone (the face can be up or down) to be Rushed. =Turn phases= Each turn is divided into five \\"Phases\\". *In the Start Phase, you draw one card from your deck. *In the Charge Phase, you can place a card in the Power Zone, Hold/Release Command, or even activate an Operation card. *In the Rush Phase, you bring a card to the Rush Area (you should be Holding Command over that card's category). *In the Battle Phase, you bring a card to the Battle Area and attack your opponent. Cards that are bested in Battle Points are considered \\"struck\\", and must be removed from the sheet. *In the End Phase, you end your turn.

It is considered as one of the best Polish alternate history novels, discussing Polish martyrology, circling around the philosophical aspects of war, showing the thin line between terrorism and fighting for freedom, and \\"packing lots of action\\", making it also part of a military science fiction genre. The story's divergence point is set during the Polish‚ÄìSoviet War, which in this alternate reality ends with a decisive Soviet victory. The actual story takes place in the 1990s and is told from the point of view of an American reporter, who is an embedded journalist with anti- Soviet Polish resistance. Inspiration and background of the novel Dukaj wrote his novel inspired by the First and Second Chechen War (which started while he was writing). Xavras' guerrillas fighting against Soviet forces resemble Chechens battling with the Russian army. As in the Chechen conflict, it is hard to decide which side is the right one, as both commit crimes and horrible acts to reach their goals. After the September 11 attacks in 2001, a story about terrorists calling themselves \\"freedom fighters\\" gains much more meaning, and dialogues in the book concerning morals, ethics and freedom become deeper than ever. Editions The story of Xavras Wy≈ºryn has had two editions. It was first published in 1997, in a book entitled Xavras Wy≈ºryn, which contained the title story together with a second one, \\"Zanim Noc\\" (\\"Before the Night\\"). In 2004, the story was reprinted in Xavras Wy≈ºryn i inne fikcje narodowe (Xavras Wy≈ºryn and Other National Fictions), this time accompanied by the following three short stories: \\"Sprawa Rudryka Z.\\" (\\"The Case of Rudryk Z.\\"), \\"Przyjaciel prawdy\\" (\\"Friend of the Truth\\") and \\"Gotyk\\" (\\"Gothic\\"). Plot summary In 1996, a young American reporter, Ian Smith, is sent by his news network to the Soviet republic of Poland, to document guerrilla actions of Polish freedom fighters against the Soviet regime. His task includes interviewing the charimastic leader of Polish Freedom Army, Colonel Xavras Wy≈ºryn. Ian does not realize that during his long trip from Ukrainian steppes to Moscow, alongside hardened veterans of Polish forces, he will experience the horror of war in which there is no good and evil side. Neither does he expect to find himself in the midst of the most reckless of Wy≈ºryn's campaigns - when the Polish forces capture a Soviet atomic bomb and start to smuggle it towards Moscow. Alternative world in the novel After World War I, Poland managed to regain its freedom, but not for long - the Polish‚ÄìSoviet War was lost in 1920 and Poland became a Soviet republic, alongside the Ukraine and other Baltic states. In the USSR, Joseph Stalin quickly took the chair of first secretary and his regime tried to eradicate the Polish culture to prevent any Polish uprisings of the kind that shook the Russian Empire in the 19th century. Thousands of Polish civilians were sent to Siberia. Speaking Polish or using Polish national symbols was punishable by death. rightthumb200px1996 Europe in Xavras Wy≈ºryn. \\\\---- Key: The increased power of the Soviet Union and the Republic of China meant that the League of Nations soon signed treaties with the USSR, allowing it to annex Poland. Meanwhile, another power rose in the south - the followers of Islam created a huge empire in the Middle East. The United States was far enough to ignore European problems, but supported those armies which were in conflict with the Soviet forces. Those conflicts were relatively minor, mostly only \\"border engagements\\", as the media called them. But then, in 1939 came the Great Bolshevik War, as the Soviet Union tried to take control over Western Europe. The war, taking place mostly on former Polish and Ukrainian territories, lasted until 1944, when Allied forces dropped three atomic bombs on Lviv, Kiev and Warsaw to stop the huge Soviet armies. Millions were killed in the explosions, and many more died of radiation poisoning. The area between the three bombed cities became known as \\"The Atomic Triangle\\". Children born there died at a young age from radiation sickness, and the few who survived were consumed by mutations. The Bolshevik War ended with the Treaties of Berlin, documents which were signed on Prussian territory. The Soviet Union and the League of Nations agreed to stop the bloodshed. Still, countries taken by force in 1920 remained Soviet republics. After Stalin's death at the end of 1981, the Soviet regime in Poland eased up a bit, but the Soviets still maintained a huge garrison force there, remembering all the Polish uprisings during earlier occupation. People living inside the \\"Atomic Triangle\\" became hardened, nearly soulless creatures, balancing on the edge of death and rendered numb because of the great suffering of the whole nation. Meanwhile, the USSR had some minor border conflicts with China, Sweden and Prussia. The status quo lasted until the 1988, when Xavras Wy≈ºryn appeared. He quickly organised a considerable guerrilla force and commanded his troops with uncommon charisma and valor, fighting the Soviets on their own ground. His legend quickly spread around the world, and his victories inspired other nations to fight against the Soviet Union. Many local conflicts started, when Hungary, the Balkans, Czechoslovakia and the Ukraine also started their own revolutions against Soviet occupants. In the south, the power of the Islamic empire increased, and under the command of a figure known only as Muhammad's Son, the war in the Middle East began, reminiscent of the old wars between the Russian Empire and the Ottoman Empire. In the east, China took the opportunity to attack the weakened USSR and started yet another conflict. The whole Central-Eastern Europe was now known as EWZ or European War Zone, reaching as far as Constantinople in the south, Finland in the north, the Prussian border in the west and the Dnieper River in the east, with battles taking place mostly on radiated, polluted territory. The plot of the novel starts in the year 1996. The whole European War Zone is a no man's land, where Soviet control is based on a 'shoot first, ask questions later' strategy. Various partisan groups, in an uneasy truce with each other, are scattered throughout the area and engaged in battles with small Soviet garrisons, German troops are making occasional raids across the borders to test Soviet defences, Soviets retaliate in kind, China's forces are advancing towards the Ural, and Muhammad's Son is preparing a Jihad in the Middle East. The US government finances guerrillas secretly, while Western Europe fortifies its borders to defend against presumed Soviet or, more feared, Chinese attack. Main characters *Colonel Xavras Wy≈ºryn is the commander of the AWP or Armia Wyzwolenia Polski (Polish Liberation Army), a considerable guerrilla force fighting the Soviet army in the European War Zone. His past is a mystery. He was born within the \\"Atomic Triangle\\" and has a visible mutation - the skin on his hands is red, as if burned. He was a junior officer in the Red Army, until he deserted and formed the AWP. He is a truly charismatic leader, inspiring his men to do unbelievable things, even sacrificing their lives for the \\"higher cause\\". For the freedom of his country he is capable of killing everyone standing in his way, including women, children and even his own men, calling this a \\"sacrifice for a better future\\". He is seen as a terrorist by the Soviets and as a romantic, tragic hero in the West. In the United States, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer has even made a blockbuster movie about him, entitled \\"Uncatchable\\". A major US news network signed a contract with Wy≈ºryn, offering him $250 million for exclusive interviews and footage from battlefields. Xavras understands the importance of media and propaganda in modern warfare, so he censors the footage before it is sent to the network and makes himself a television celebrity. *Ian Smith - US news reporter sent by the network to film Xavras' actions. Because of his Polish descent and linguistic abilities, he is the network's natural choice after the previous reporter attached to Wy≈ºryn was killed in action. Raised in a democratic country, he has moral doubts about Xavras and considers his brutal methods no better than the Soviet ones. The story is told from his point of view. *Jewriej (English: Yevrey) - Xavras' mysterious aide and advisor, with his face hidden behind a Balaclava, because of his alleged disfigurement, the result of mutation. It is said that radiation gave him precognition abilities and that Xavras is using them to escape Russian ambushes and to plan his actions. *Sienkiewicz's Triple - Three trusted companions of Xavras, who took their names (Micha≈Ç, Andrzej and Jan) after the characters from the books of Henryk Sienkiewicz. Their missions are mostly undercover and they can almost literally disappear. It is they who lead Smith to Xavras' hideout. *Two Bodyguards - Xavras' guards, which are named by Ian after the biblical quotes printed on their T-shirts, because he does not know their real names and they look like twin brothers: \\"Another Horse Came Out, a Fiery Red One\\" (Revelation 6:4) and \\"The Sea Gave Up the Dead\\" (Revelation 20:13). Their fighting skills are exceptional and they are Xavras' most trusted soldiers.

It is analogous to the English phrase \\"knock on wood\\" to prevent bad luck. The word kuwabara literally means \\"mulberry field\\". According to one explanation, there is a Chinese legend that mulberry trees are not struck by lightning. In contrast, journalist Moku J≈çya asserts that the \\"origin of kuwabara is not definitely known, but it has nothing to do with mulberry plants, though it means 'mulberry fields'.\\"  In popular culture  The phrase was used in Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater by antagonist Colonel Volgin, a character with the ability to control electricity. It has also been used in various Japanese animation, including Inuyasha, Urusei Yatsura, Sekirei, Aku no Hana, and Yu Yu Hakusho. In a well-known monologue, the Yu Yu Hakusho character Kazuma Kuwabara remarks \\"A mulberry is a tree and Kuwabara is a man\\". The phrase was also used in an episode of Mushi-Shi entitled \\"Lightning's End\\" and in Street Fighter X Tekken by Yoshimitsu.  In folklore  In the 9th century, there was a Japanese aristocrat called Sugawara no Michizane. Sugawara Michizane, who died bearing a heavy grudge after being trapped and exiled to Kyushu, threw his fierce anger in the form of his thunderbolts as a god of lightning. In 930, Seiryoden of the court was struck by a large thunderbolt. The master of onmyo said that this misfortune was the work of the vengeful spirit of Michizane. Those who trapped Michizane trembled with fear and tried to placate the curse by dedicating a prayer to his vengeful ghost, thus leading to the construction of Kitano Shrine. The land that Michizane owned was known as Kuwabara, so people thought it would be a good idea to claim the land he/she was standing on was a part of Kuwabara, so that Michizane would be hesitant to strike his own people. People of such an era chanted \\"Kuwabara, Kuwabara\\" when they heard the rumble of thunder as a method of reminding Michizane not to strike them. This saying often appears in the literature of the Heian period, with elements such as \\"Tsureduregusa\\", a spell to cast away thunder. The very people living in Kuwabara at that time relied on the Kuwabara spell and the land of Kuwabara is said to have remained unharmed by lightning for that reason.

Plot introduction Presented within the frame of the discovery of the supposedly historical Flashman Papers, this book chronicles the subsequent career of the bully Flashman from Tom Brown's School Days. The book begins with a fictional note explaining that the Flashman Papers were discovered in 1965 during a sale of household furniture in Ashby, Leicestershire. The papers are attributed to Harry Paget Flashman, the bully featured in Thomas Hughes' novel, who becomes a well-known Victorian military hero (in Fraser's fictional England). The papers were supposedly written between 1900 and 1905. The subsequent publishing of these papers, of which Flashman is the first instalment, contrasts the public image of a (fictional) hero with his own more scandalous account of his life as an amoral and cowardly bully. Flashman begins with the eponymous hero's own account of his expulsion from Rugby and ends with his fame as \\"the Hector of Afghanistan\\". It details his life from 1839 to 1842 and his travels to Scotland, India, and Afghanistan. It also contains a number of notes by the author, in the guise of a fictional editor, providing additional historical glosses on the events described. The history in these books is largely accurate; most of the prominent figures Flashman meets were real people. Plot summary Flashman's expulsion from Rugby for drunkenness leads him to join the British Army in what he hopes will be a sinecure. He joins the 11th Regiment of Light Dragoons commanded by Lord Cardigan, to whom he toadies in his best style. After an affair with a fellow-officer's lover, he is challenged to a duel but wins after promising a large sum of money to the pistol loader to give his opponent a blank load in his gun. He does not kill his opponent but instead delopes and accidentally shoots the top off a bottle thirty yards away, an action that gives him instant fame and the respect of the Duke of Wellington. Once the reason for fighting emerges, the army stations Flashman in Scotland. He is quartered with the Morrison family and soon enough takes advantage of one of the daughters, Elspeth. After a forced marriage, Flashman is required to resign the Hussars due to marrying below his station. He is given another option, to make his reputation in India. By showing off his language and riding skills in India, Flashman is assigned to the staff of Major General William George Keith Elphinstone, who is to command the garrison at the worst frontier of the British Empire at that time, Afghanistan. Upon arrival, he meets a soldier who relates the narrow escape he made in November 1842, on the first night of the Afghan Uprising. After Akbar Khan proclaims a general revolt which the citizens of Kabul immediately heed, a mob storms the house of Sir Alexander Burnes, one of the senior British political officers, and murders him and his staff. The soldier, stationed nearby, manages to flee in midst of the confusion. This tale sets the tone for Flashman's proceeding adventures, including the retreat from Kabul, Last Stand at the Battle of Gandamak and the Siege of Jalalabad, in the First Anglo-Afghan War. Despite being captured, tortured and escaping death numerous times, hiding and shirking his duty as much as possible, he comes through it with a hero's reputation ... although his triumph is tempered when he realises his wife might have been unfaithful while he was away.

Background George MacDonald Fraser was a journalist who dreamt of becoming a novelist. He wrote a straight historical novel in the mid-1950s which no one would publish and came to feel that he would achieve success only if he did something in a more comical vein. In 1966 he came up with the idea of basing a novel around Harry Flashman from Tom Brown's School Days; he later said he was inspired to put pen to paper by two events: going on a recent trip to Borneo and Malaya during the Indonesian Confrontation which re-ignited his interest in Asia and soldiering, and having just completed a stint as acting editor of his paper, which re-enforced his determination to get out of journalism. He told his wife \\"I'll write us out of this\\". Fraser wrote the book after work in nightly bursts, taking ninety hours all up with no advance plotting or revisions. Half way through he broke his arm and could not type; he might have given up but his wife read it, was enthusiastic, and encouraged him to continue. He took two years to find a publisher, before it was taken up by Herbert Jenkins. Reception When the book was published in America, several reviewers thought it was true. Reviews were generally positive. By 1970 the book had sold over 200,000 copies in paperback and its success ‚Äì notably the sale of the film rights ‚Äì enabled Fraser to leave journalism and become a full-time writer. It also compelled him to move to the Isle of Man to avoid income tax. Proposed film version Film rights were sold to Bob Booker and George Foster's Cinema Organization company, and initial plans called for a movie to be directed by Richard Lester. In August 1969 it was announced the script would be written by Charles Wood with filming to start early the following year.MOVIE CALL SHEET: Lester to Direct 'Flashman' Martin, Betty. Los Angeles Times 2 Aug 1969: a9. Lester admired the book greatly, saying \\"it was an extraordinary period of British history and it was a marvellously interesting premise... There were lots of things in it that made sense to me‚Äîabout soldiering, about the military, about the economics of military politics. And I also had various notions about the Victorian ethic and the Protestant, John Foster Dulles ethic and the relationship of one to the other.\\" Lester obtained funds from United Artists and John Alderton was cast as Flashman. Frank Muir, who worked on the script, said that because Alderton was not known in America he had to do a screen test but United Artists approved him. In February 1970 it was reported Joan Collins was in talks with Lester to play a role.Double Valentine for Mia Farrow? Haber, Joyce. Los Angeles Times 9 Feb 1970: c22. Lester was scouting locations in Spain to stand in for Afghanistan and was about to start casting when there was a chance of management at United Artists and the film was cancelled. Muir later wrote \\"I think the unfortunate loser was John Alderton. If ever it was a case of the right actor finding the right part and then losing it through no fault of his own with was John.\\" The British film industry was in crisis at the time due to the withdrawal of American finance. By March 1970 the project was cancelled.Gloomy Upheaval Dogs British Movie Industry By BERNARD WEINRAUB Special to The New York Times30 Mar 1970: 52. Lester said it \\"came about at the time when the film industry began to collapse within itself. A sort of implosion. It‚Äôs a very expensive project, a period film where at one point 13,000 of the British Army have to retreat in January from Kabul into India, being attacked by hordes of Afghans. It‚Äôs not the sort of thing that you can do on a shoestring... To do it properly it would be a very expensive film; and I don‚Äôt think one should do it improperly. \\" Lester later said \\"it came in that very bad year for United Artists when they wrote off 90 million and cancelled nearly everything.\\" After the failure of The Bed Sitting Room Lester did not make a film for five years.Cardinal virtuoso The Guardian 19 Oct 1973: 11. In August 1971 Stanley Baker was attached as producer with Lester still to direct. However the film was not made. Lester admired Fraser's writing and later hired the author to write the screenplay for The Three Musketeers (1973). This launched Fraser's scriptwriting career and he and Lester collaborated on the one film (to date) made from a Flashman novel, Royal Flash (1975). Diabolique magazine argued that Flashman would have been a better introduction to the character.

The term r√©gulation was coined by Frenchman Destanne de Bernis, who aimed to use the approach as a systems theory to bring Marxian economic analysis up to date.The Regulation School: A Critical Introduction (Columbia University Press, 1990) These writers are influenced by structural Marxism, the Annales School, institutionalism, Karl Polanyi's substantivist approach, and theory of Charles Bettelheim, among others, and sought to present the emergence of new economic (and hence social) forms in terms of tensions within existing arrangements. Since they are interested in how historically specific systems of capital accumulation are \\"regularized\\" or stabilized, their approach is called the \\"regulation approach\\" or \\"regulation theory\\". Although this approach originated in Michel Aglietta's monograph A Theory of Capitalist Regulation: The US Experience (Verso, 1976) and was popularized by other Parisians such as Robert Boyer, its membership goes well beyond the so-called Parisian School, extending to the Grenoble School, the German School, the Amsterdam School, British radical geographers, the US Social Structure of Accumulation School, and the neo-Gramscian school, among others. The regulation approach Robert Boyer describes the broad theory as \\"The study of the transformation of social relations, which creates new forms- both economic and non-economic- organized in structures and reproducing a determinate structure, the mode of reproduction\\".The Regulation School: A Critical Introduction (Columbia University Press, 1990), p. 17 This theory or approach looks at capitalist economies as a function of social and institutional systems and not just as government's role in the regulation of the economy, although the latter is a major part of the approach. Regimes of accumulation and modes of regulation Regulation theory discusses historical change of the political economy through two central concepts, \\"regime of accumulation or accumulation regime\\" (AR) and \\"mode of regulation\\" (MR). The concept of regime of accumulation allows theorists to analyze the way production, circulation, consumption, and distribution organize and expand capital in a way that stabilizes the economy over time. Alain Lipietz, in Towards a New Economic Order, describes the regime of accumulation of Fordism as composed of mass- producing, a proportionate share-out of value added, and a consequent stability in firm‚Äôs profitability, with the plant used at full capacity and full employment (p. 6). An MR is a set of institutional laws, norms, forms of state, policy paradigms, and other practices that provide the context for the AR's operation. Typically, it is said that it comprises a money form, a competition form, a wage form, a state form, and an international regime, but it can encompass many more elements than these. Generally speaking, MRs support ARs by providing a conducive and supportive environment, in which the ARs are given guidelines that they should follow. In cases of tension between the two, a crisis may occur. Thus this approach parallels Marx's characterisation of historical change as driven by contradictions between the forces and the relations of production (see historical materialism). Translation and definition Bob Jessop summarises the difficulties of the term in Governing Capitalist Economies as follows: \\"The RA seeks to integrate analysis of political economy with analysis of civil society and or State to show how they interact to normalize the capital relation and govern the conflictual and crisis-mediated course of capital accumulation. In this sense, r√©gulation might have been better and less mechanically translated as regularization or normalization\\" (p 4). Therefore, the term r√©gulation does not necessarily translate well as \\"regulation\\". Regulation in the sense of government action does have a part in regulation theory.  History of modes of regulation  Robert Boyer distinguished two main modes of regulation throughout the 19th and 20th centuries: * The \\"mode of regulation of competition\\" (1850‚Äì1930). It consisted of a first mode of regulation, from 1850 to the beginning of the 20th century, that Boyer called \\"extensive mode of regulation\\", characterized by low productivity gains, important part of the output dedicated to equipments, and high competition. The second period is called \\"intensive mode of regulation without mass consumption\\", because it consists of high productivity gains (thanks to Taylorist methods) and the production of consumption commodities. * The \\"monopolist mode of regulation\\" (after 1930), characterized by high productivity and mass consumption. The Fordist system made possible a regular growth of economic output and an increase in income at the same time.  Crisis  Regulationist economists distinguish between cyclical and structural crises. They study only structural crises, which are the crises of a mode of regulation. From this distinction, they have formulated a typology of crises that accounts for various disarrangements in institutional configurations. According to its initial objective, which was to understand the rupture of the Fordist mode of regulation: * Exogenic crises are due to an external event; they can be very perturbing but cannot endanger the mode of regulation, and even less the mode of accumulation. Neoclassical economists (or economists of the school of rational anticipations) consider that all crises are exogenic. * Endogenous crises are cyclical crises that are necessary and inevitable, for they make it possible to cancel imbalances accumulated during the phase of expansion without major deterioration of institutional forms. These crises are inseparable from the operation of capitalism. * The crisis of the mode of regulation: unable to avoid a downward spiral, institutional forms and the ways the state intervenes in the economy must be modified. The best example is the crisis of 1929, where the free play of market forces and competition did not lead to a renewed phase of expansion. * The crisis of the mode of accumulation means that it is impossible to continue long-term growth without major upheaval of institutional forms. The crisis of 1929 is the best example: the interwar period marks the passage from a mode of accumulation characterised by mass production without mass consumption to a mode incorporating both mass production and mass consumption.  Current development  Since the 1980s, the Regulation school has developed research at other socio-economic levels: firms, markets and branches studies (food and agriculture, automotive, banking‚Ä¶); development and local regions (\\"regulation, sectors and territories\\" research workshop); developing countries or developed economies others than France and USA (South Korea, Chile, Belgium, Japan, Algeria, etc.): political economy of globalization (diversity of capitalisms, politics and firms...). By doing so, its methods now range from institutional macroeconomics to discurses analysis, with quantitative and qualitative methods.

Early life Shary's parents were Austrian immigrants who came to America and became pioneer farmers. John Shary grew up and went to school in Crete, Nebraska. By the age of eighteen he had worked his way through college to become one of the youngest men certified as a pharmacist in that state. When he was twenty-two, he accepted a job as a traveling salesman for a California drug company. His travels took him throughout the United States and Canada. While in Texas, he took notice of the great potential for land development. He first purchased 30,000 acres (120 km¬≤) of land between Corpus Christi and San Antonio. The sale of this property earned him much profit and inspired him to enter the land development business. Life in Texas In 1912, Shary made his way to the Rio Grande Valley and realized the possibilities of this lush area. At the time it was largely brush and cactus, but Shary was impressed with citrus crops that were being grown by early citrus experimenters and felt that citrus was the crop of the future for Texas. Citrus crops needed irrigation and in 1914 Shary purchased the First Lift Station which pumped life giving water from the Rio Grande to irrigate 15,000 acres (61 km¬≤) of surrounding crops. The chimney from the lift station has been designated a Texas historical landmark and is still standing at the site of Chimney Park in Mission, Texas. That following year Shary planted the first commercial citrus orchard. His first crops were seeded white grapefruit. His citrus empire would eventually grow to almost 15,000 acres (60 km¬≤) of groves. The first commercial shipments of citrus, packed in onion crates, were shipped from the lower Rio Grande Valley in 1920. By 1922 much of the land had been transformed into citrus groves, and cotton, onion, and vegetable fields. Shary took the lead in organizing and building the United Irrigation Company, in order to assure water supplies for future developments. Legacy Because of his significant role in the development of the area, Shary was named to the Texas Business Hall of Fame and is remembered as the \\"Father of the Texas Citrus Industry\\". He greatly assisted in the establishment of citrus as a productive commercial crop in the Rio Grande Valley. Since 1932, the Texas Citrus Fiesta has been held to commemorate the abundant harvest of the Texas citrus industry. To this day, this area is known for producing some of the sweetest and best quality citrus in the world. He purchased 36,000 acres (150 km¬≤) of land near Mission. This area would later become known as \\"Sharyland.\\" Also, the south end of Shary's estate, also formally known as \\"Shary Farms\\", was bought by Hunt Realty Corporation and developed into a suburban community by the name of Sharyland Plantation. A landmark that still stands today is the Sharyland school, which he had built to educate the children of the many families who made their home in the area. Shary was President of the Board of Trustees for Sharyland ISD. He served from its formation in 1922 until he retired in 1939.

It was located in the former Troxy Cinema on Commercial Road in London's East End Borough of Stepney (now Tower Hamlets). The Troxy, with 3,520 seats, opened in 1933 and was one of England's largest cinemas. As a result of wartime damage and the general decline of the area, the cinema closed in November 1960. The English singer Joan Cross, an important figure in British opera at Sadler's Wells, who guided the company through the Second World War, and others had formed the National School of Opera in 1948, but its impact was limited due to little or no language teaching or technical stagecraft. (Nonetheless, its alumni included many successful artists such as Ava June, Marie Collier, Inia Te Wiata, Johanna Peters, April Cantelo and the D'Oyly Carte's Kenneth Sandford.) By 1963, the Arts Council of Great Britain had provided a ¬£27,900 grant to set up the London Opera Centre to provide musical and dramatic training to young voice students who were offered two-year scholarships. It was to be located in the Troxy and managed out of the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden as a rehearsal space as well as an opera school. Among the most famous of the former students was the soprano Dame Kiri Te Kanawa who was offered an opportunity to study there between 1966 and 1968 after winning a major vocal competition in New Zealand. In addition, the Centre was used for other aspects of stagecraft and technical training, scenery construction and storage. A 500-seat theatre was created in the balcony for occasional performances, although rehearsal needs tended to take precedence over the Centre's needs for its own student performances. While on the Board of the Centre, Joan Cross and others resigned a year later because they did not feel that the association with the Royal Opera House benefited the Centre. Gradually, several factors caused dissatisfaction with the Centre's activities, its high cost and remote location being the most important ones. By the time the lease came up for renewal in July 1977, the Opera House was willing to abandon the Troxy in favour of a smaller National Opera Studio at the Opera House itself. This was set up in 1978 under the opera singer Michael Langdon.

H√•llberg has played over 500 games in the Elitserien. He has won both the Swedish Championship and the World Championship one time each. Playing career H√•llberg started his career with his hometown club, Modo Hockey, as a child and made his debut in Elitserien for Modo in 1994‚Äì95 at the age of 17. He played a few games in 1994‚Äì95 and 1995‚Äì96, but in 1996‚Äì97 he became a regular. In 1999 H√•llberg played his first Swedish Championship final, but Modo lost to Bryn√§s IF. The following season Modo came to the finals once again, but lost again, this time to Djurg√•rdens IF. Two years later Modo once more came to the finals, but once again they lost, F√§rjestads BK won with 3‚Äì0 in a best-of-five series. Now H√•llberg was tired of silver and seconds places and he decide to change club. He therefore signed with F√§rjestad, the same club that had defeated him a few months earlier. With no better luck than before, F√§rjestad made it to the finals but lost three consecutive finals, twice (2003 and 2005) to Fr√∂lunda HC and once (2004) against HV71. In 2004 H√•llberg represented Sweden in the World Championship. Sweden lost in the finals to Canada. During the 2005‚Äì06 season H√•llberg announced that he would leave F√§rjestad after the season and that he had signed with the Swiss club EV Zug. That meant that this was maybe his last chance to win the Swedish Championship. And finally H√•llberg got his gold when F√§rjestad defeated Fr√∂lunda HC with 4‚Äì2 in best-of-seven series. The same season H√•llberg also played with the Swedish national team, and there also he won a gold medal at the World Championship. H√•llberg then went over to Modo Hockey in 2007 to play there for four seasons. On June 1, 2011, H√•llberg signed a one-year contract with V√§xj√∂ Lakers Hockey of the Elitserien (SEL). Achievements * Silver medal at the World Championship in 2004. * Swedish Champion with F√§rjestads BK in 2006. * Gold medal at the World Championship in 2006.

It was initially created to provide reading machines for blind people. During the period 1989-2000, over 35,000 reading machines were sold in sixty countries, reading twelve different languages. In 2000, the Arkenstone reading machine product line was sold to Freedom Scientific, and the nonprofit's name was changed to Benetech.

He gave it the name Bufo woodhousii in honor of the American physician and naturalist Samuel Washington Woodhouse. The large genus Bufo was split by Frost et al. in 2006, with the North American species being included in the genus Anaxyrus and this toad becoming A. woodhousii.Frost, D. R., T. Grant, J.

Description Woodhouse's toad is a robust amphibian and can grow to a maximum snout-vent length of . The head has prominent cranial crests in front of and in between the eyes. The parotoid glands are long and large. The dorsal surface of this toad is grayish-brown or yellowish-brown and it is speckled with small dark spots. There is a narrow pale line running along the spine. The belly is rather paler and is usually unspotted. The male has a single vocal sac on his throat. His call resembles the bleat of a sheep and lasts from one to three seconds. Distribution and habitat Woodhouse's toad is found in North America at altitudes of up to . Its range extends from Mexico in the south to Washington in the north. In the United States it is found in Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Kansas, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Dakota, Texas, Utah, Washington, and Wyoming. In the western part of its range it is typically found in lowland riparian corridors, wooded land besides streams and rivers. At higher altitudes it inhabits wet meadows, ponds, reservoirs and lakes. It is also found in urban environments, canals, ponds and irrigated agricultural land. A. fowleri without taxonomic status by others.Sullivan, B. K., K. B. Malmos, and M. F. Given. 1996.

Behavior Woodhouse's toad is nocturnal and feeds on insects and other small invertebrates. Near human habitations these toads may congregate underneath outside lights to feed on the insects they attract. Breeding takes place at different times of year in different parts of the range. The males call from in, or close to, standing water and the eggs are laid in gelatinous strings in still-water habitats such as ditches, ponds, pools, cattle tanks and lakes. The tadpoles typically take from five to eight weeks to reach metamorphosis. Status Woodhouse's toad has a very wide range and presumed large total population. It is able to live in a number of types of habitat and can tolerate some modification to its habitat. The population seems steady and no particular threats have been identified so the International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed it as being of \\"least concern\\". In central Arizona it seems to be displacing the Arizona toad, (Anaxyrus microscaphus).

Podvisoki was one of the early examples of medieval urban settlement in Bosnia region.Pavao Anƒëeliƒá, Srednji vijek ‚Äì Doba stare bosanske dr≈æave, ‚ÄûVisoko i okolina kroz historiju I, Visoko 1984, 160-162 Podvisoki had a colony of Ragusan merchants. They remained there until 1430s, when they moved to Fojnica. Notable local merchant from Visoko in 14th century was Mila≈° Radomiriƒá. Ragusan sources cite biggest caravan trade between Podvisoki and Ragusa in 1428. That year, on 9 August, Vlachs committed to Ragusan lord Tomo Buniƒá, that they will with 600 horses deliver 1500 modius of salt. Delivery was meant for Dobra≈°in Veseokoviƒá, and Vlachs price was half of delivered salt.‚ÄûCrainich Miochouich et Stiepanus Glegieuich ad meliustenendem super se et omnia eorum bona se obligando promiserunt ser Thome de Bona presenti et acceptanti conducere et salauum dare in Souisochi in Bosna Dobrassino Veselcouich nomine dicti ser Thome modia salis mille quingenta super equis siue salmis sexcentis.

While a topspinner is released with the thumb facing the batsman, a slider is bowled in a similar manner to a legbreak, but instead of imparting sidespin with the third finger, the bowler allows his fingers to roll down the back of the ball, providing a mixture of sidespin and backspin. Whereas a topspinner tends to dip more quickly and bounce higher than a normal delivery, a slider does the opposite: it carries to a fuller length and bounces less than the batsman might expect. The sliders will typically head towards the batsman with a scrambled seam (with the ball not spinning in the direction of the seam, so the seam direction is not constant, unlike in conventional spin bowling). This has less effect on the flight and bounce but absence of leg spin may deceive the batsman. Frequently the slider is bowled with a mixture of side spin and backspin. This has the effect of making the ball harder to differentiate from the leg break for the batsmen without reducing the mechanical effects caused by the backspin. This delivery may skid straight on or it may turn a small amount. It is claimed that Shane Warne invented this type of delivery. However, this is inaccurate. The Australian spinner Peter Philpott used the technique in the 1960s, calling it simply an orthodox backspinner, while Australian all - rounder and captain Richie Benaud used what he called his 'sliding topspinner' which appears again to have been similar. Since he was taught the technique by Doug Ring, it may be more accurate to suggest that Ring is the originator. Either that, or the ball is one of those deliveries with no easily identifiable point of origin. However Shane Warne's use of the delivery in the 2005 Ashes brought the variation once more into the public consciousness. His dismissal of Ian Bell lbw with the delivery was a classic piece of spin bowling; Bell played for the turn of a normal leg break, but the delivery skidded straight into his front pad without turning. Although there is often a good deal of confusion on the subject, the slider is thought to be more or less an identical delivery to the \\"zooter\\". Finger spin bowlers commonly bowl an exactly equivalent ball, which comes out of the front of the hand with backspin present. However the name slider has not passed over into common parlance for its offspin cousin, and the terms arm ball, backspinner or, more recently, teesra are used instead.

If Geary has not begun management by the deadline, then Spectra will begin their own renovations and the agreement with the IceMen will be voided. On the September 30 deadline, Geary sent a letter to Owensboro mayor Ron Payne stating he would not be purchasing the Sportscenter because of too much cost to convert and refurbish the arena and Spectra became the official operators moving forward.

The action plan for the Decade proposes eight spheres of activities in which to work for the promotion of the Culture of Peace: *To reinforce a culture of peace through education *To promote economically and socially sustainable development *To promote the respect of all human rights *To ensure the equality between women and men *To support democratic participation *To develop comprehension, tolerance and solidarity *To support participate communication and the freedom of movement and of information and knowledge *To promote international peace and safety On 29 November 2000, the General Assembly decided to entrust UNESCO with the coordination \\"of the activities of the organizations of the United Nations system to promote a culture of peace, as well as liaison with other organizations concerned in this matter.\\". In 2009, the United Nations General Assembly, in a resolution on the International Decade for the Promotion of a Culture of Peace and Non-violence for the Children of the World, endorsed the ongoing work of the Culture of Peace News Network as an important part of the ongoing commitment of the UN to a culture of peace. NGOs NGOs and other civil society organizations were urged to contribute to a global movement for a culture of peace according to the Declaration and Programme of Action for a Culture of Peace, adopted by the UN General Assembly in 1999. In response, a mid-term report,2005 Report of Civil Society submitted to the United Nations in 2005, included information from 700 organizations. In 2010 at the conclusion of the Decade, the Report from the Civil Society2010 Report from the Civil Society was submitted to the United Nations with detailed information and photographs about the actions of 1,054 organizations from over 100 countries. This information is the tip of an even larger iceberg, as indicated by the many partnerships listed by participating organizations which number in the many thousands. Some national NGOs coalitions promoting the Decade were established in several countries, including Austria, France, Italy and the Netherlands. These national coalitions along with international organizations decided to found the International Coalition for the Decade in June 2003. Related to this UN Decade, in December 1998, the World Council of Churches adopted, at its 8th Assembly, in Harare (Zimbabwe), the Decade to Overcome Violence as one of its programmes for the decade 2000-2009.

He was one of the last two surviving Jewish fighters in the Warsaw uprising and the last surviving fighter from the 1943 Warsaw ghetto uprising.  Early life  Rotem was born in 1924 in Warsaw, Poland. He experienced antisemitism early in his life and was a member of the Akiva Zionist youth movement.  The Second World War  As World War II broke out, Rotem was injured in a German bombing campaign which struck his family home. His brother and several members of his family were killed. =The Warsaw ghetto= In 1942 he joined the Jewish Fighting Organization (≈ªOB). Rotem became particularly useful as a courier for the Warsaw Ghetto fighters. The nickname \\"Kazik\\"‚Äîan abbreviation of a Polish name \\"Kazimierz\\" (Casimir), which means in Polish \\"someone who destroys opponent's prestige/glory during battle\\". A tribute to Simcha Rotem, Monument to Evacuation of the Warsaw Ghetto Fighters in Warsaw =The Warsaw Ghetto Uprising and aftermath= As a ≈ªOB member, Kazik took part in the Warsaw ghetto uprising. He became the head courier, reporting directly to the ≈ªOB commander on the Gentile side, Yitzhak Zuckerman. The ≈ªOB commander in general was Mordechai Anielewicz. When it became apparent that the Germans would prevail, he was sent via a secret passageway to the Gentile side of Warsaw where he met with Zuckerman to arrange an escape for the fighters. However, the passageway was discovered by the Nazis. Unable to return, he and Zuckerman were trapped on the Gentile side while the fighting raged and the ghetto burned. Desperate to reach his comrades, Rotem made several attempts to enter the ghetto through the sewers before finally succeeding. There he encountered Zivia Lubetkin, one of the last surviving leaders of the ghetto uprising, and he led her with her team of approximately 80 fighters through the sewers to the Gentile side and then to the forests outside of the city. Throughout the rest of the war he continued his underground activities with the resistance, in particular helping to care for the several thousand Jews, who still remained in Warsaw in hiding. In August 1944, he took part in the Polish Warsaw Uprising. In July 1945, Simcha Rotem visited the ruins above the Warsaw Mi≈Ça 18 Command bunker with other survivors of the Jewish Underground.Sztetl org Mila 18 Bunker site photograph  Post-war life  After the end of World War II, Rotem joined the Nakam group. He infiltrated the bakery of an American camp for German prisoners of war near Dachau in order to poison the German prisoners. After making friends with Poles who worked in the bakery, Rotem got the manager drunk, made copies of the keys, and returned them before he sobered up. The plot was called off soon after in order not to spoil parallel efforts at Langwasser internment camp. He also took part in the Beriha organization, that helped European Jews immigrate to Mandate Palestine, despite the restrictions imposed by the British Mandatory policies (White Paper of 1939). Although his twelve-year-old sister was murdered in the ghetto uprising, his parents and another sister survived in hiding and, in 1947, he and the surviving members of his family immigrated to Mandate Palestine. He lived in Jerusalem. As of 2018, the year of his death, he was one of two survivors of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising. At the time of his death, he was the last surviving fighter of the 1943 Warsaw Ghetto Uprising. In the 2001 TV Mini-Series Uprising he is portrayed by actor Stephen Moyer. In April 2018 Rotem castigated Polish president Andrzej Duda, writing: \\"I became very frustrated, disappointed and even amazed by your systematic disregard of the fundamental difference between the suffering of the Polish nation after Poland was seized by Nazi Germany, which I do not disparage, and the methodical genocide of my brothers and sisters, Poland's Jewish citizens, by the Nazi- German extermination machine, ignoring the fact this extermination machine had many Polish accomplices.\\" And \\"Only once the Polish society truly faces the bitter historical truth, revealing its scope and severity, will there be a chance that those horrors will not be repeated.

Canada insists that her internal waters are delimited in accordance with the rules laid out in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. Dispute The legal status of a section of the Northwest Passage is disputed: Canada considers it to be part of its internal waters, fully under Canadian jurisdiction according to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. The United States and most maritime nations consider them to be an international strait, which means that foreign vessels have right of \\"transit passage\\".

He was instrumental in the founding of the Arthur G. James Cancer Hospital in Columbus, Ohio, which is named after him. Childhood James was born Arthur David Giangiacomo on March 14, 1912 in Rhodesdale, Ohio, a former mining town in Belmont County. James was the second oldest of seven children (Grace, Felix, Arthur, Elizabeth, Leona, Lilian, Clara, and Vincent \\"Vince\\", according to the 1920 Census for Wheeling Township, Belmont County). His parents were Abraham and Rosa Pezzotane Giangiacomo, Italian immigrants who arrived in the U.S. in 1904 and 1906 respectively. Abraham worked initially as a coal miner and later owned a grocery store. As a boy, James delivered groceries at the store. Education James's first education was in a one-room schoolhouse in Belmont County, Ohio. He later attended a larger two-room school in Uniontown near Saint Clairsville, Ohio, for third to eighth grades. James went to St. Clairsville High School, where he graduated in 1930 as co-valedictorian. He attended Ohio State University (OSU), earning a bachelor's degree in 1934; and a master's degree in surgery and a medical degree, both in 1937. James served his medical internship at the University of Chicago Hospitals and his second- year surgical internship at Duke University Hospital. He then returned to OSU Hospital and completed his three-year residency in general surgery. James served as chief resident at OSU Hospital from 1941 to 1942. After completing his surgical residency, James was accepted as a Fellow at Memorial Hospital in New York City. His fellowship began July 1, 1942, but six weeks later he was called to military service for World War II. James served with the 65th General Hospital Army Reserve unit, which he had joined while at Duke. James served 43 months in the Army Medical Corps as a major, 22 of which were in the European Theatre at the Duke University Army General Hospital. After the war, James returned to Memorial Hospital and completed his fellowship. James returned to Ohio State University in 1947 as an assistant professor in the Department of Surgery. He remained at OSU for the rest of his career, working his way up to full professor and chief of the Division of Surgical Oncology. James was also the first physician to hold the Lucius A. Wing Chair of Cancer Research and Therapy. Family In 1940, James married Mildred \\"Millie\\" Cameron. They had two children, David and Cameron. Awards and leadership During his life, James served on the board of directors for the Columbus Cancer Clinic and as its medical director. He served as the national president of the American Cancer Society from 1972 to 1973. In 1987, James was inducted into the Horatio Alger Association of Distinguished Americans. James once said, ‚ÄúAll cancer will eventually be wiped out; there‚Äôs no doubt about that, I don‚Äôt know how long it will take, but‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm sure that day is coming.‚Äù That belief, plus his conviction that cancer patients needed separate, specialized care, led James to lobby, campaign, and fundraise for 35 years to build a cancer hospital in Central Ohio. The ribbon cutting for the new cancer hospital was Tuesday, January 16, 1990. At this ceremony, to James' surprise, it was announced that the new hospital would be called the Arthur G. James Cancer Hospital and Research Institute. The cancer hospital and its research institute are now known as Arthur G. James Cancer Hospital and Richard J. Solove Research Institute, part of The Ohio State University Medical Center in Columbus. Death At age 89, on October 22, 2001, James died of Parkinson's disease.

The rods then were passed to nailers who made the rods into nails, by giving them a point and head. The slitting mill was probably invented near Li√®ge in what is now Belgium. The first slitting mill in England was built at Dartford, Kent in 1590. This was followed by one on Cannock Chase by about 1611,King 1999, 62-4. and then Hyde Mill in Kinver in 1627. Others followed in various parts of England where iron was made. However there was a particular concentration of them on the River Stour between Stourbridge and Stourport, where they were conveniently placed to slit iron that was brought up (or down) the River Severn before it reached nailers in the Black Country. The slitting mill consisted of two pairs of rollers turned by water wheels. Mill bars were flat bars of iron about three inches (75 mm) wide and half an inch (13 mm) thick. A piece was cut off the end of the bar with shears powered by one of the water wheels and heated in a furnace. This was then passed between flat rollers which made it into a thick plate. It was then passed through the second rollers (known as cutters), which slit it into rods. The cutters had intersecting grooves which sheared the iron lengthways.Schubert 1957, 304-12. Fiddler Foley's espionage The technology is said to have been brought from Sweden by the industrial espionage of Richard Foley (1580-1657) (\\"Fiddler Foley\\") of Stourbridge, a Puritan and ancestor of Baron Foley.Lloyd, Samuel, The Lloyds of Birmingham with some Account of the Founding of Lloyd's Bank, 2nd Edition, Birmingham & London, 1907, pp.23-4 The story is related as follows by Samuel III Lloyd (1827-1918) of Farm, in his 1907 family history The Lloyds of Birmingham with some Account of the Founding of Lloyd's Bank: > \\"It was early in the seventeenth century when the neighbourhood of > Stourbridge was the centre of the nail-making industry of England that > Sweden became a discomforting competitor to those engaged in this industry ; > as nails made there were sold in England at prices with which Stourbridge > makers could not compete. This caused young Foley of Stourbridge to resolve > to find out, if possible, how their underselling was accomplished. He > accordingly started for Sweden, but with so little money that it was > exhausted on his arrival there, and he was left (not unlike Oliver Goldsmith > in his travels in Holland) with the solitary but somewhat lively resource of > a fiddle. He was, however, an excellent musician, as well as a pleasant > fellow, and he successfully begged and fiddled his way to the celebrated > Dannemora Mines, near Uppsala. He readily ingratiated himself with the iron- > workers; and, having for some time carefully observed their machinery, he > believed he had found out their methods. He therefore returned to > Stourbridge, full of hope that he had acquired the secret of the > construction of a slitting-mill, by means of which plates of wrought iron > could be slit into nail-rods. So strongly persuaded was he of success that a > gentleman was induced to advance the requisite money; but, alas! to the > great disappointment of all concerned, the machinery failed to slit the > iron. Foley therefore set out for Sweden a second time, receiving on his > arrival a joyful welcome from the Swedish workmen. So gladly indeed did they > receive the returned fiddler, that, with a disastrous confidence, to make > sure of him they lodged him in the very citadel of the business, the > slitting-mill itself, looking on him, in their simple-minded, uncommercial > good-fellowship, as a mere fiddler, and nothing more. He remained long > enough to ascertain where his mistakes lay, and then again disappeared. On > his return to Stourbridge he succeeded in having machinery constructed that > perfectly performed the work required. Thereafter he not only supplied the > nail-makers with the nail-rods they wanted, but also made a fortune in doing > it. It is pleasant and gratifying to record that while amassing wealth > himself, he was not unmindful of the needs of others; for he invariably and > generously aided all the plans of benevolence set on foot in his > neighbourhood\\". How far this legend reflects what actually happened is doubtful. The earliest version of the story to name Foley is that of William Playfair in 1809,W. Playfair, British family Antiquities (1813), I, 218n. which takes him to Holland. However the earliest version was published by Stebbing Shaw,S. Shaw, History and Antiquities of Staffordshire ii(1) (1801), 265. quoting the manuscript history of Dr Richard Wilkes of Willenhall,Transcript by T. Fernihough, 'Original collection for the History of Staffordshire by Richard Wilkes M.D.' William Salt Library, Stafford: Salt MSS. 467-69. > About a mile above [Kinver] is a place called the Hide ... Here was the > first mill for rolling and slitting iron that was erected in England. One > Brindley, whose posterity enjoyed it until about 20 years ago, whent inot > Germany, there he acted the fool, and from thence brought back this > excelelent machine which has been so servicieable and has brought do much > money into the country. Richard Foley was already a substantial entrepreneur in 1627 when he leased Hyde Mill for conversion to a slitting mill, and leased Himley Furnace from Lord Dudley in 1625. The application of the story to Foley is thus not credible, but it could refer to his brother-in-law George Brynley, who ran the mill for Foley. His son Richard bought Hyde Mill and Farm in 1647, and it descended in the family until John Brindley became bankrupt in 1730.M.V. Cooksley, 'Hyde Mill' West Midlands Studies 14 (1981), 44-9 Description of Lloyd's mills In a map of Birmingham dated 1731, 7 years after the death of Sampson I Lloyd (1664-1724), Lloyd's slitting and corn mills are shown with access from Digbeth by Lower Mill Lane. A later map dated 1751 shows the slitting-mill with a mill pool and a large garden. A description of the slitting mill survives in a letter dated 31 July 1755 written by visitors from London to the Pembertons, Lloyd cousins:Lloyd, S., pp.25-6 > Next Morning (Monday) [July 1755] we went to see Mr. L 's Slitting Mill, > which is too curious to pass by without notice. Its use is to prepare iron > for making nails. The process is as follows: they take a large iron bar, and > with a huge pair of shears, work'd by a water-wheel, cut it into lengths of > about a foot each; these pieces are put into a furnace, and heated red-hot, > then taken out and put between a couple of steel rollers, which draw them to > the length of about four feet, and the breadth of about three inches; thence > they are immediately put between two other rollers, which having a number of > sharp edges fitting each other like scissors, cut the bar as it passes thro' > into about eight square rods; after the rods are cold, they are tied up in > bundles for the nailor's use.

Background Terrence Burlingham was arrested for the October 1984 murders of Denean Worms and Brenda Hughes in Cranbrook, British Columbia. Over a period of four days, he was interrogated by police despite his continued request to see a lawyer. During the interrogation, the police suggested that his parents would be hurt by delaying things and made disparaging remarks about the accused's lawyer. The police later offered to reduce the charge to second degree murder if Burlingham were willing to disclose the location of the murder weapon. Eventually, he agreed and took them to the location where he had hidden the gun that was used to kill Hughes. The crown, however, had not consented to the deal and did not follow through with the bargain. The trial judge found that the deal was an honest mistake. However, since Burlingham did not have access to a lawyer, his rights under section 10(b) were violated. Despite the violation, the murder weapon and several incriminating statements were still admitted. Burlingham was convicted of first degree murder. The British Columbia Court of Appeal upheld the decision with McEachern C.J. in dissent. Opinion of the Court In a six to one decision, the Court found that the evidence should be excluded under section 24(2) of the Charter and overturned the conviction.

He is the patron of the 32nd chair of the Brazilian Academy of Letters. Life Porto-Alegre was born Manuel Jos√© de Ara√∫jo in Rio Pardo, Rio Grande do Sul, to Francisco Jos√© de Ara√∫jo and Francisca Ant√¥nia Viana. He would change his name to Manuel de Ara√∫jo Pitangueira during the independence of Brazil, due to nativist causes. Later on, he finally changed it to its definitive form: Manuel de Ara√∫jo Porto-Alegre. In 1826, he moved to Rio de Janeiro, in order to study painting with Jean-Baptiste Debret at the Escola Nacional de Belas Artes (at the time called the Academia Imperial de Belas Artes). He also studied at what is now the Academia Militar das Agulhas Negras and took a Medicine course and Philosophy. In 1831, he left Brazil along with Debret to Europe, in order to improve his painting techniques. In 1835, he went to Italy, where he met Gon√ßalves de Magalh√£es, another Brazilian poet. He and Magalh√£es would create in France, in the year of 1837, a short-lived magazine named Niter√≥i, alongside Francisco de Sales Torres Homem. Also in 1837, he becomes history painting teacher at the Escola Nacional de Belas Artes, in a post that would last until 1848, when he would become a drawing teacher at the Academia Militar das Agulhas Negras, and starts doing his first caricatures. In 1838, he married Ana Paulina Delamare, having with her two children: Carlota Porto-Alegre (the future wife of painter Pedro Am√©rico) and future diplomat Paulo Porto-Alegre. A herma of Porto-Alegre in Porto Alegre, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil In 1840 he is named the official painter and decorator of Emperor Pedro II's palace. He decorated the imperial palace in Petr√≥polis, the wedding of Pedro II with Teresa Cristina of the Two Sicilies and the aforementioned emperor's coronation. He was decorated with the Order of Christ and the Order of the Rose. The coat of arms of the Baronage of Santo √Çngelo, the same worn by the Ara√∫jo family Reuniting with Gon√ßalves de Magalh√£es and Torres Homem, he founded a periodic named Minerva Brasiliense, that lasted from 1843 to 1845. He would publish in this periodic his poem Brasiliana. In 1844, alongside Torres Homem, he founded the humoristic magazine Lanterna M√°gica, where he published his caricatures. In 1849, Porto- Alegre founded the magazine Guanabara, alongside Joaquim Manuel de Macedo and Gon√ßalves Dias. The magazine, considered the official journal of the Romantic movement in Brazil, lasted until 1856. In 1852, he enters the political career, assuming a position as a substitute councilman in the Municipal Chamber of Rio de Janeiro, lending service in the areas of urbanism and public health. He would exerce this post until 1854, the year when he became the headmaster of the Escola Nacional de Belas Artes, lasting until 1857. In 1860, Porto-Alegre entered the diplomatic career, where he served as the consul of Brazil in the Kingdom of Prussia, in the Kingdom of Saxony and later in Portugal, where he died. (Porto-Alegre's remains were brought to Brazil in 1922.) He was proclaimed Baron of Santo √Çngelo by Emperor Pedro II in 1874, and was a member of the Brazilian Historic and Geographic Institute. Spiritism While in Dresden in 1865, Porto-Alegre wrote a letter to Joaquim Manuel de Macedo, then-tutor of Princess Isabel's children, in which he reveals that he became a Spiritist and was able to psycograph messages from the Underworld, and Isabel would ask him \\"who was [her] guardian spirit\\".

In 1907 John J. Conway and James W. Hoit began the Mission Canal Co. Irrigation system, which was instrumental in the early agricultural growth of the area. Here, they built the first pump station. The pump was powered by steam produced by wood- fired boilers. The chimney, which still stands at the site, was made out of handmade brick from Madero. It is 106 feet tall and 6 feet in diameter. The top of the chimney has a double row of bricks that form a partial design, but the top was never completed. The chimney was dedicated as a Texas Historic Landmark by the Texas Historical Commission in 1985. The boilers began operation in 1907 and the lift station started to pump water from the Rio Grande. Wood was used in units of 2 to 3 cords (7 to 11 m¬≥) and a crew of 26 men with teams of mules worked around the clock to keep the boilers fed. The plant was later operated by John H.

The specific epithet couchii is in honor of American naturalist Darius Nash Couch, who collected the first specimen while on a personal expedition to northern Mexico to collect plant, mineral, and animal specimens for the Smithsonian Institution. Description Unlike other toads which have horizontal pupils, spadefoot toads have vertical pupils. On the underside of the hind foot is a hard, dark \\"spade\\" that gives spadefoot toads their name. These creatures can grow to be 3.5\\" in length. These \\"spades\\" are used by the toads to burrow into the ground to prevent water loss and hide from predators. There are two spadefoot species in the Sonoran Desert of Arizona and California. Couch's spadefoot toad (Scaphiopus couchi) has a sickle-shaped \\"spade\\", whereas the western spadefoot toad (Spea hammondii) has a rounded \\"spade\\". Spadefoots are not true toads and should therefore simply be called spadefoots.Arizona-Sonora Desert Museum: Couch‚Äôs spadefoot (Scaphiopus couchi), http://www.desertmuseum.org/books/nhsd_spadefoot.php, 2006-2010. Distribution Couch's spadefoot toad is native to the United States southwest of southeastern Colorado and central Oklahoma, northern Mexico and the Baja peninsula. They can be found throughout the Sonoran Desert, which includes parts of southern Arizona and California. Mating and reproduction Water is a necessary medium for the fertilization of spadefoot eggs, and once the eggs hatch, water also provides a place for tadpoles to mature to the adult stage. Because of the importance of water, spadefoots are active during the wet season spring and summer in the Northern Hemisphere), and remain underground during the dry season (fall and winter). When a summer thunderstorm arrives, the male toads emerge from underground and look for pools of rainwater. When they find water, the males produce a mating call that attracts female toads. New research has shown that females tend to be more attracted to bright colored males over their dark colored peers. Thus creating a new aspect in their determination of the male's size and condition.V√°squez, T. & Pfennig, K.S. Behav Ecol Sociobiol (2007) 62: 127.https://www.jstor.org/stable/25511675?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents Because the pools of water may be short-lived, mating occurs the first night after rainfall begins. During reproduction, the male mounts the female and releases sperm to fertilize the eggs, which are deposited in the pools of water in the form of a floating mass. The eggs hatch into tadpoles, which quickly mature into adults. They must reach this stage before the pool of water evaporates, and thus they sometimes mature in as little as 9 days after the eggs are laid. Western spadefoot toads take longer to mature (at least three weeks). The small pools of water are warmed by the sun, which speeds up the growth of the tadpoles. Tadpoles will eat a variety of foods, such as small insects near the pool and algae, which they scrape off rocks. They also filter microorganisms from the water as it is passed over their gills. Tadpoles gather in wriggling masses, stir up the muck on the bottom of the pool, and filter out the organic nutrients. Unlike most tadpoles, which are exclusively herbivores and filter feeders, spadefoot tadpoles are omnivores. They also eat dead insects and tadpoles, as well as fairy shrimp.

Two other newspapers in Balochistan, Daily Balochistan Express and Daily Azadi, also reported harassment by security forces.\\"Section 2(a) Freedom of Speech and Press\\", 2009 Human Rights Report: Pakistan, Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor, U.S. Department of State, 11 March 2010 In October 2009, PEMRA directed 15 FM radio stations to stop carrying British Broadcasting Corporation programs for \\"violation of the terms and conditions of their license\\".\\"FM stations stop airing BBC bulletins\\" , Pakistan Journalism, 29 October 2009 During 2010 journalists were killed and subjected to physical attack, harassment, intimidation, and other forms of pressure, including: * On July 7, the Taliban threw a grenade at the home of Din News television reporter Imran Khan in Bajaur, FATA, injuring eight members of his family. He and his sister had been hospitalized earlier for injuries sustained in a kidnapping attempt. * On July 22, Sarfraz Wistro, the chief reporter of the Daily Ibrat newspaper, was attacked and beaten unconscious by five men near his home in Hyderabad, Sindh. * On September 4, Umar Cheema‚Äîthe senior member of the investigation cell of a leading media group, The News‚Äîwas abducted and taken to an unknown location, where he was blindfolded and beaten, had his hair shaved off his head, and was hung upside down and tortured. His abductors threatened more torture if \\"he didn't mend his ways\\" and told him the editor of investigations, Ansar Abbassi, would be next. He was dropped outside of Islamabad six hours later. Cheema went public with the abuse, and The News covered his abduction in detail in print, as did television channels. Police filed a case immediately against the accused, the government formed a joint investigation team to probe the incident, and the Lahore High Court took notice of the case. As of year's end, and after nearly four months of investigation, the team had not issued any conclusive findings. * On September 14, journalist Misri Khan was killed in Hangu District, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, by militants from the TTP, who claimed that \\"he twisted facts whenever we gave him any reports\\" and \\"leaned towards the army.\\" * On September 16, journalist Mujeebur Rehman Saddiqui, a Daily Pakistan correspondent, was killed by gunmen in Dargai, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. * On November 18, the body of journalist Lala Hameed Baloch, who had been kidnapped in late October, was found along with the body of a second journalist, Hameed Ismail, with gunshot wounds outside of Turbat, Balochistan Province.

The Court found that sexual harassment was as a form of discrimination based on sex and so was prohibited by the Manitoba Human Rights Act. Background During the fall of 1982, Dianna Janzen and Tracy Govereau were both employed as waitresses at Pharos restaurant in Winnipeg, Manitoba. Tommy Grammas, a cook at the restaurant, began making sexual advances to Janzen. She repeatedly made it clear that the advances were not welcome, nonetheless they continued. When Janzen approached Eleftherois Anastasiadis, the manager of the restaurant, he said, \\"if it's about Tommy, I can't do anything about it.\\" Eventually, the advances were replaced with uncooperative and threatening behaviour. When Anastasiadis was approached about it he refused to act on it and instead fired the women. The women sued Platy Enterprises Ltd., the owner of Phraos restaurant, as well as Tommy, under section 6(1) of the Manitoba Human Rights Act, for violating their right to equal opportunity by firing them because of their sex. The Manitoba Human Rights Tribunal held that the women had been subject to sexual harassment on the basis of sex and so the restaurant owners were in violation of section 6(1) of the Act. The Court of Queen's Bench upheld the decision. The Manitoba Court of Appeal overturned the Court of Queen's Bench. The court found that sexual harassment was not considered discrimination on the basis of sex and that the employer could not be held vicariously liable of the conduct of the employee. Ruling of the Court Chief Justice Dickson, writing for a unanimous Court, held that the restaurant's conduct did constitute discrimination on the basis of sex. Dickson rejected the Court of Appeal's ruling that the harassment was not based on sex because not all female employees were targeted. He stated that discrimination on the basis of sex is where there is a \\"practice or attitude which had the effect of limiting the conditions of employment of, or the employment opportunities available to, employees on the basis of a characteristic related to gender.\\" See also * List of Supreme Court of Canada cases (Dickson Court) External links * Canadian civil rights case law Supreme Court of Canada cases Labour relations in Canada 1989 in Canadian case law Harassment case law ","title":"Janzen v Platy Enterprises Ltd"},{"id":"4974663","text":"Sportzentrum Kapfenberg is an indoor sporting arena located in Kapfenberg, Austria.

Ideals and policies Both the manifest for a better world, the organisation's program of principles and 2025 - DWARS' proposals for the future, the organisation's political program the party lists its five core-ideals which are equal to each other: *Sustainability: DWARS wants to share the Earth's finite resources with future generations. Furthermore, it believes that the rights of animals should be protected. In practice this means that DWARS supports the use of renewable energy, wants to invest in public transport and use the European agricultural subsidies to finance the transition from industrial farming to organic agriculture, DWARS seeks to include animal rights in the Dutch constitution and supports squatting as a means to protest the government's housing policies. *Solidarity: DWARS wants to divide the resources of the world in such a way that every person has the means to develop his or her self. It wants to implement a basic income for all Dutch citizens, shift taxation from labour to capital and support small scale initiatives for non-capitalist economics. *Freedom: DWARS believes that every person should be free to develop his or her self. DWARS wants to make all education in the Netherlands free of charge, equal representation of women and minorities in government positions, government to use open source software and it supports the legalisation of soft drugs. *Democracy: DWARS sees a worldwide federal democracy the ideal form of government. On the first place it seeks to democratize the Netherlands by lowering the age to vote, strengthening the autonomy of municipalities and revert many anti-terrorism laws which infringe basic civil rights. *Peace: DWARS wants to attain worldwide peace by fighting injustice and the sources of war and conflict. In international politics, it wants to abolish NATO and instead it supports European integration, it wants to strengthen the position of the United Nations as forum for peaceful conflict resolution. Furthermore, it wants to invest in third world development with micro-credits to finance small scale projects and by ending protectionist policies of the Western world. It embraces migration as a natural phenomenon. History DWARS was founded on 4 January 1991. The foundation was decided on in congress on 15 and 16 December in Wageningen by the PSJG the youth wing of the Pacifist Socialist Party and the Political Party of Radical Youth (PPRJ) the youth wing of the Political Party of Radicals. Because of the merger of these two parties, with the CPN and the EVP, in the GreenLeft, the youth wings were forced to merge too. The General Dutch Youth League, linked to the Communist Party of the Netherlands decided to continue on its own. The Evangelical People's Party did not have an independent youth wing. There were major differences between the two youth organisations. The PSJG was oriented towards actions and campaigning, mainly against nuclear power and weapons. Within the PSJG there was a large anarchist group, which was opposed to parliamentary democracy. The PSJG operated independent from the PSP. The PPRJ was much more moderate and was not opposed to parliamentary democracy. The PPRJ was very dependent on its motherparty, the PPR. This difference between parliamentary oriented members and action- oriented members. In the first ten years of its existence the anarchist PSP youth held a majority, and DWARS became more independent from the GreenLeft. During this period Judith Sargentini was one of the spokespersons of the organisation. Since a few years, the ties with the GreenLeft have been tightened and a more moderate group has come to power. In the last years DWARS has been oriented towards cooperating with other youth wings of political parties. In 2004 they signed the Pepper-accords, together with ROOD, youth within the Socialist Party and the Young Socialists within the Labour Party, which called for tighter cooperation between the GreenLeft, the Socialist Party and the Labour Party, which would result in a new cabinet, after the next elections. It was called \\"pepper-accords\\" in reference to their colour (red) and taste (spicy), because a leftwing government in their view would produce exciting new leftwing policy. In 2001 DWARS signed the Paprika-accords together with the Young Socialists within the Labour Party and the Christian Democratic Youth Appeal, which also called for tighter cooperation between the GreenLeft, the Christian Democratic Appeal and the Labour Party, which would result in a new cabinet, after the 2002 elections. It was called \\"paprika- accords\\" in reference to their colours (green, yellow and red), which correspond to the colours of the respective parties. But DWARS has also been able to convince the GreenLeft to stay close to its political ideals, in 2001 the youth wing started a petition under local representatives of the party, calling on the GreenLeft parliamentary party in the House of Representatives to revoke its support for the War against Afghanistan, the petition succeeded. =Name= The name is very difficult to translate. DWARS means both \\"transverse\\" and \\"stubborn\\" in English, making the translation \\"contrary\\" grammatically correct, but it does not cover the short and alternative meaning of the name. The name was formed after a fierce debate on the founding congress. More moderate participants, who had a history in the PPRJ proposed the name \\"GreenLeft Youth\\" (\\"GroenLinkse Jongeren\\"), more radical members, with a background in the PSJG proposed \\"The green spider in the left-hand corner of the chamber, staring to the right\\" (\\"De groene spin, die vanuit de linkerhoek, rechts de kamer intuurt). Both sides tried to sabotage the decision making, then the chairman jumped on the table and yelled: \\"You bunch of contrary minded people, be serious!\\" (\\"En stelletje dwarskoppen, nu serieus!\\"). The name DWARS stuck. The spider however remained an important symbol in the organisation, being the youthwing's logo for a while and later the youth wing's magazine and emaillist. Organisation DWARS has approximately 3,000 members, most of which are also members of the GreenLeft. It has a board of eight members. The congress convenes twice a year, and elects a new board every year and sets the lines for the political course and can amend on the youth wings constitution. DWARS publishes the independent magazine OverDWARS (a pun meaning both \\"across\\" and about DWARS) and uses emaillists to communicate to its members, one of those is called \\"the Spider\\" (\\"de Spin\\") and the other the DWARSdoorsnee (a pun on the organisations name, meaning cross section). There are several working groups which think about green and left politics and organise activities. DWARS is formally independent from the GreenLeft, like her predecessors PSJG and PPRJ. For a long period the relations between DWARS and the GreenLeft were very bad. Since the early 2000s this has improved. =Older forms of organisation= For a long period, DWARS did not have a chairperson or a board. It was organised according to anarchist principles. Between 1991 and 1996 DWARS was a collection of campaigning groups with a fast changing composition. The most important groups were the UFO (a pun on the term UFO and Uitermate Fantasievol Overleg \\"Extremely Fantastic Council\\") which functioned as board, the ParGo (the Parliamentary Group), which was oriented towards the GreenLeft parliamentary party, Dodo (like the extinct animal) which addressed environmental issues, the Anti-Fa-working group, which followed organisations on the extreme right. DWARS published two magazines, \\"the Spider\\" and the \\"Former Disaster\\" (\\"Voorheen RamPSPoed\\", a continuation of the magazine of the PSJG, which incorporated the acronym of the motherparty, PSP). Between 1996 and 1999 a crisis board took over, and in 1999 they proposed a new anarchist organisation, with executive working groups (\\"Uitvoerende Werkgroepen\\"), in which all members could join, of which representatives would come together in the coordinating council (\\"Coordinerend Overleg\\"). These representatives would function as board members and were directly elected on congresses. The coordinating council was joined by the Shadow Parliamentary Party (\\"Schaduwfractie\\") which followed the GreenLeft parliamentary party, later this group was called Youth Parliamentary Party (Jongerenfractie). This organisation was maintained until 2005, when the coordinating council and the youth parliamentary party merged to form a single board. Until 2007 it had two chairpersons, one for organisational matters and one for political affairs. International DWARS is a member of Federation of Young European Greens (FYEG). For a short while they were member of European Network of Democratic Young Left (ENDYL).

Life =Early life= She was a member of the Polish royal House of Piast, the daughter of W≈Çadys≈Çaw I the Elbow-high, prince of Kujavia, later King of Poland, and Jadwiga of Greater Poland. She was the sister of Casimir III of Poland, who died in 1370. Her older sister was Cunigunde of Poland, who was married to Bernard of ≈öwidnica. =Queen consort= Elisabeth's marriage to Charles Robert of Hungary She was married on 6 July 1320 to Charles I Robert, King of Hungary. Elizabeth was Charles' fourth wife. The marriage brought an alliance between Poland and Hungary. Charles' two previous marriages are believed not to have left surviving issue, at least no surviving sons. Charles' first wife Maria of Bytom was believed to have been barren but it is also believed she bore two daughters: Catherine and Elizabeth. Others however believe that the two girls were daughters of Queen Elizabeth. While at court in Hungary, Elizabeth is credited as having been the first to introduce perfume, then known as Hungary Water, to Europe and the western world. =Queen mother= Following her husband Charles Robert's death, Elizabeth wished to make a good marriage for her eldest surviving son, Louis. She had her son betrothed to Margaret of Bohemia, daughter of Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor. They married in 1342 but the marriage didn't last because, seven years into the marriage, the fourteen- year-old Margaret died, childless. Elizabeth now needed for her son to remarry and produce an heir. The branch of the Kuyavian Piast family was popular in Hungary, and several members lived in Louis' court. Elizabeth's influence extended far beyond any other queen consort, and years before, Stephen II, Ban of Bosnia, married Elizabeth of Kuyavia, the daughter of the Duke Kazimierz III of Gniewkowo, Queen Elizabeth's cousin. Stephen II of Bosnia had a young daughter named Elizabeth, and after learning about her, the Hungarian queen insisted immediately on bringing her to the Hungarian court for fostering. Stephen was reluctant at first, but eventually dispatched Elizabeth. Three years later, Queen Elizabeth invited Stephen to Hungary and arranged a marriage between their children. The queen mother was heir to her brother Casimir's throne after the death of their sister, Cunigunde. Her claim passed to Louis after the death of his two elder brothers. Casimir had married four times but none of his wives had given him surviving sons. He chose to leave Louis the crown of Poland thus Hungary and Poland being united under one monarch. Elizabeth's second surviving son, Andrew, married Joan I of Naples. Andrew wished to be made king of Naples and rule jointly with his wife, but Joan refused. Pope Clement VI approved Joan's request to be crowned alone. Fearing for his life, Andrew wrote to his mother that he would soon flee the kingdom. She intervened and made a state visit; before she returned to Hungary, she bribed the Pope to reverse himself and permit Andrew's coronation. She also gave her son a ring, which was supposed to protect him from death by blade or poison, and returned with a false sense of security to Hungary. The ring didn't protect him; Andrew was soon assassinated by strangulation. =Regent= Louis was absent from Poland between 1370-1375. Elizabeth was made regent to conveniently eliminate her from his court. The Poles hated paying taxes and loved to quarrel among themselves and with the court, especially with the domineering Elizabeth. Her regency turned out to be a failure, her own Polish background notwithstanding. In 1376, the Poles killed 160 of her Hungarian bodyguards and Elizabeth escaped to Hungary lest she, too, be killed by her compatriots. Louis reconciled with the rebels, and strengthened his power, at his mother's expense. =Death= After her regency and her return to Hungary, Elizabeth spent her final years in a monastery outside of Buda, where she wrote her will. It specifies her desire to rest in the monastery of Order of Saint Clare in Old Buda. Elizabeth also left money and possessions to her family: she left Louis several golden vessels, daughter-in-law, Elizabeth of Bosnia - Buda Castle, granddaughter, Mary - a gold wreath, granddaughter, Jadwiga - wreath of lilies, and her niece, Hedwig - a ring. She also left money to some churches.

Almost all of the major media organisations in the UK are based in London. Much of the British media is concentrated in London and is sometimes accused of having a \\"London bias\\". All the major television networks are headquartered in London including the BBC, which remains one of the world's most influential media organisations, and the largest Broadcaster in the world. Partly to counter complaints about London bias, the BBC announced in June 2004 that some departments are to be relocated to Manchester. Other networks headquartered in London include ITV, Channel 4, Channel 5, CNN International and Sky UK. Like the BBC, these produce some programmes elsewhere in the UK, but London is their main production centre. Local programming, including news, is provided by the regional services of the main networks: e.g. BBC London News on BBC One and ITV London on ITV. There is a huge choice of radio stations available in London. Local citywide stations include music-based stations such as Absolute Radio, Capital 95.8, Kiss 100, Magic 105.4, Heart 106.2 and Radio X. Popular news/talk stations include BBC London, LBC and LBC News. Channel 4's headquarters in Horseferry Road. The London newspaper market is dominated by London editions of the national newspapers, all of which are edited in London. Until the 1970s, most of the national newspapers were concentrated in Fleet Street, but in the 1980s they relocated to new premises with automated printing works. Most of these are in East London, most famously the News International plant at Wapping. The move was resisted strongly by the printing trade union SOGAT 82, and strike action at Wapping in 1986 led to violent skirmishes. The last major news agency in Fleet Street, Reuters, moved to Canary Wharf in 2005, but Fleet Street is still commonly used as a collective term for the national press. London has two citywide daily newspaper titles - the Evening Standard and Metro, both of which are available on the streets and at London tube and railway stations. The Evening Standard became a free newspaper in October 2009 after 182 years as a paid-for publication. There is also a freesheet covering financial news, City A.M.. The independent weekly listings guide Time Out Magazine has been providing concert, film, theatre and arts information since 1968. There are a vast number of local newspapers in the London area, often covering a small section of the city as well as two free magazines, Sport and Shortlist London is at the centre of British film and television production industries, with major studio facilities on the western fringes of the conurbation and a large post-production industry centred in Soho (see Soho media and post-production community).

He is nicknamed \\"El Diablo\\", which means, \\"the Devil\\". He made his name playing for Tigres UANL, where he had his most success. Career He played for Santiago Wanderers and for Universidad Cat√≥lica, and arrived to Monterrey, Mexico to play with Tigres in 1996. Tigres had just been privatized after a crisis that ended with the team's relegation to Primera Divisi√≥n A. His incredible number of goals in Tigres quickly made him a team hero. He was instrumental in returning Tigres to the First Division. He played 10 seasons with Tigres, 8 in First Division, in which he scored over 40 goals. He played many Cl√°sico Regiomontano matches, against Tigres arch-rival Rayados de Monterrey. He became the maximum scorer in the history of Tigres for matches of this kind, with eight goals. His record was tied by Walter Gait√°n in January 2007. An injury separated him from the fields, and Tigres consequently separated him from the team in 2001. In 2002, he moved to play with Puebla F.C., a team that has been relegated to Primera Divisi√≥n A. He used to wear the number 16 on his back for every match he played. In 2005, he played his first Copa Libertadores de Am√©rica with Tigres, where he scored some goals. Nu√±ez has also played for Uni√≥n Espa√±ola in Chile and Al-Shoalah in Saudi Arabia. For his country Nu√±ez played 31 matches scoring 4 goals between 1996 and 2003. A farewell Cl√°sico Regiomontano match where Nu√±ez played with special guests from Tigres and Monterrey was scheduled for August 4, 2009 at the Estadio Universitario, Tigres' home stadium.

Specific details vary across jurisdictions‚Äîthe abuse that must be reported may include neglect, or financial, physical, sexual, or other types of abuse. Mandated reporters may include paid or unpaid people who have assumed full or intermittent responsibility for the care of a child, dependent adult, or elder.  History  In 1962, United States doctors C. Henry Kempe and Brandt Steele published \\"The Battered Child Syndrome\\",C. Henry Kempe and Ray E. Helfer, editors: The Battered Child. 1st edition, 1968. 2nd edition, Chicago: Chicago University Press, 1974. 3rd edition, 1980. 5th edition by M. E. Helfer, R. Kempe, and R. Krugman, 1997.C. H. Kempe, Frederic N. Silverman, Brandt F. Steele, William Droegemuller, Henry K. Silver: \\"The Battered Child Syndrome.\\" Journal of the American Medical Association, 1962, 181: 17-24. Tardieu's syndrome. Also called Caffey-Kempe syndrome. which helped doctors identify child abuse, its effects, and the need to report serious physical abuse to legal authorities. Its publication changed the prevalent views in the United States, where child abuse was previously seen as uncommon, and not a regular issue. In 1974, the United States Congress passed the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act (CAPTA), which provides funds to states for development of Child Protective Services (CPS) and hotlines to prevent serious injuries to children. These laws and the media and advocacy coverage and research brought about a gradual change in societal expectations on reporting in the United States and, at different rates, in other western nations. Originally created to respond to physical abuse, reporting systems in various countries began to expand to address sexual and emotional abuse, neglect, and exposure to domestic abuse. This expansion was accompanied by broader requirements for reporting abuse: previously reports were only submitted when an incident caused serious physical injury, but as the definitions changed, more minor physical injuries and developmental and psychological trauma began to be included as well. There has been a huge increase of reporting over the decades with enormous numbers of unsubstantiated cases. Referrals increase each year, but the actual substantiated cases remain low and are approximately the same or decline each year. Media and commentators often take the number of referrals to be synonymous with the number of cases of actual child maltreatment, which makes the problem appear larger than it actually is. Vulnerable groups Various jurisdictions have mandatory reporting requirements for different types of vulnerable people, such as: * Children * Vulnerable adults * Senior citizens/elderly  Statistics by country  = Australia = In 2015-16, of the total number of notifications (355,935), 164,987 cases (involving 115,024 children) of child abuse were investigated or were in the process of being investigated. Of these investigations, 60,989 cases were substantiated =Brazil= Brazil has a mandatory reporting system for child maltreatment that is enforced by the health and educational systems, but due to the absence of national prevalence surveys, the difference between data generated by such mandatory reports and actual incidence of abuse is not known, although it is believed that mandatory report systems may result in underreporting. While specific data on mandatory reporting is unavailable, data collected from 314 municipalities (out of 5564) across the country revealed that in the second half of 2005 alone, 27,986 children received attention from the Social Welfare Centers: either because of sexual abuse (13,240), psychological violence (4,340), neglect (4,073), physical violence (3,436) and sexual exploitation (2,887). Most victims were in the 7‚Äì14 years group (17,738). 4,936 were under 6 years old. = Canada = Canada provides data on substantiations but not reports. In Canada in 2008, 36% of all investigations were substantiated, with a further 8% of investigations where maltreatment remained suspected by the worker at the conclusion of the investigation and a further 5% with a risk of future maltreatment. 30% of investigations were unfounded and 17% resulted in no risk of future maltreatment was indicated. = United Kingdom = England provides data on substantiations but not reports. In 2012, the UK reports 50,573 children were on child protection registers or subject to a child protection plan: England (42,850), Scotland (2,706), Wales (2,890), Northern Ireland (2,127). = United States = In the US there was a 2348% increase in hotline calls from 150,000 in 1963 to 3.3 million in 2009. In 2011, there were 3.4 million calls. From 1992 to 2009 in the US, substantiated cases of sexual abuse declined 62%, physical abuse decreased 56% and neglect 10%. Although the referrals increase each year, about 1% of the child population is affected by any form of substantiated maltreatment. In the US, there are approximately 3.6 million calls each year: 9,000/day, 63,000/week, affecting on average 1 out of 10 U.S. families with children under the age of 18 each year (there are 32.2 million such families). From 1998 to 2011 there were a total of 43 million hotline calls. Of those substantiated, over half are minor situations and many are situations where the worker thinks something may happen in the future. The largest category was neglect. Each year in the US, approximately 85% of hotline calls either do not warrant investigation or are not substantiated. Approximately 78% of all investigations are unsubstantiated and approximately 22% are substantiated, with around 9% where \\"alternative responses\\" are offered in some states, which have a focus on working with the family to address issues rather than confirming maltreatment.  Criteria for mandatory reporting of child abuse by jurisdiction  The criteria for reporting vary significantly based on jurisdiction. Typically, mandatory reporting applies to people who have reason to suspect the abuse or neglect of a child, but it can also apply to people who suspect abuse or neglect of a dependent adult or the elderly, or to any members of society. A large majority of European countries ‚Äì 86 per cent ‚Äì have some form of mandatory reporting; 77 per cent of African countries do; 72 per cent of Asian countries and 90 per cent of the Americas do. In Australia, the Northern Territory requires all citizens to report suspected child abuse, and the other states and territories have mandatory reporting for designated work roles. In Brazil, notification is mandatory in the health system, in schools and by the Child Protection Councils (CPC) network, present in many municipalities. In Malaysia, The Child Act 2001 requires any medical officer or medical practitioner, childcare provider or member of the family to notify his/her concerns, suspicions or beliefs that a child may have been abused or neglected to the appropriate child protection authority in the country. Failure to do so can result in criminal charges. In South Africa, Section 110 of the Children's Act, 2005 mandates 'Any correctional official, dentist, homeopath, immigration official, labour inspector, legal practitioner, medical practitioner, midwife, minister of religion, nurse, occupational therapist, physiotherapist, psychologist, religious leader, social service professional, social worker, speech therapist, teacher, traditional health practitioner, traditional leader or member of staff or volunteer worker at a partial care facility, drop-in centre or child and youth care centre' to report when they suspect that a child has been abused 'in a manner causing physical injury, sexually abused or deliberately neglected'. The Sexual Offences Act, 1957, compels all citizens who are aware of the sexual exploitation of children to report the offence to the police. =North America= In the United States, states frequently amend their laws, but as of November 2013 all states, the District of Columbia, American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands have statutes identifying persons who are required to report suspected child maltreatment to an appropriate agency. Approximately 48 states, the District of Columbia, American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands designate professions the members of which are mandated by law to report child maltreatment. As of November 2013, in 18 states and Puerto Rico, any person who suspects child abuse or neglect is required to report suspected abuse or neglect regardless of profession. In all other States, territories, and the District of Columbia, any non-mandated person is also allowed to report. Canada imposes a mandatory requirement on all citizens, except in the Yukon Territory where it is restricted to those who come in contact with children in their professional roles. Mexico also has legislative reporting duties. = European Union= The Council of Europe has urged all countries to have mandatory reporting of child abuse but several European countries do not. 15 member States (Bulgaria, Croatia, Denmark, Estonia, France, Hungary, Ireland, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Poland, Romania, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom) have reporting obligations in place for all professionals. In 10 member states (Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Greece, Finland, Italy, Latvia, Portugal and Slovakia) existing obligations only address certain professional groups such as social workers or teachers. More than half (15) of the EU member states (Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia and Sweden) have specific reporting obligations addressing civilians, with specific obligations for civilians to report cases of child abuse, neglect and/or exploitation. In many member states without specific provisions, general provisions on the obligation for all citizens to report a criminal act under national law apply, but with no specific obligation to report a child at risk of abuse. In Germany, Malta and the Netherlands, no reporting obligations were in place in March 2014. In Malta, however, the new draft Child Protection Act (Out of Home Care), introduces the obligation of mandatory reporting for all professionals and volunteers. Under UK law only local authority social workers, health and social service board social workers (Northern Ireland) and police have a duty to report suspicions that a child is in need of care and protection. Local child protection guidelines and professional codes of conduct may expect other professionals, such as teachers and medical staff, to report, but they do not have to do so as a matter of law. Front-line professionals are also required to report cases of female genital mutilation.Female Genital Mutilation Act 2003 S. 5B  Processes for reporting  The processes for reporting vary greatly among jurisdictions. Mandated reporters are usually required to give their name when they make a report. This allows investigators to contact them for further details if needed, and protects the mandated reporter from accusations that they did not report as required by law. Typically, reporters are encouraged to report their suspicions and not to investigate or wait for absolute proof, which can lead to further harm directed at the suspected victim, and allow for perpetrators to prepare their defence through intimidation. The investigation of the abuse is then left to professionals. Some jurisdictions allow clear protections for reports made in good faith, protecting the disclosure of the reporter's name. Innocence should be presumed unless and until evidence establishing guilt is obtained and it must be remembered that only suspicions are being reported. = Professions and reporting = Mandated reporting requirements generally apply to professions that have frequent contact with children, although in some jurisdictions all citizens are required to report suspicions of some forms of abuse. Other jurisdictions have mandated requirements only of doctors or medical professionals. Jurisdictions may note that, while these groups are legally required (mandated) to report, most jurisdictions allow for voluntary reports by any concerned people. = Clergy-penitent privilege and other exemptions = Conflicts between a mandated reporter's duties and some privileged communication statutes are common but, in general, attorney-client privileges and clergy-penitent privileges are exempt from mandatory reporting in many jurisdictions. In some states in the US, psychiatrist and psychologists are also exempt from mandatory reporting.Child Welfare Information Gateway. (2016). Mandatory reporters of child abuse and neglect. Washington, DC: U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Children's Bureau. Retrieved from https://www.childwelfare.gov/pubPDFs/manda.pdf#page=3&view;=Privileged%20communications \\"Clergy-penitent privilege\\" is privileged communication that protects communication between a member of the clergy and a communicant, who shares information in confidence. When applied, neither the minister nor the \\"penitent\\" can be forced to testify in court, by deposition, or other legal proceedings, about the contents of the communication. Most US states provide the privilege, typically in rules of evidence or civil procedure, and the confidentiality privilege has also been extended to non-catholic clergy and non-Sacramental counseling. Criticism Originally created to respond to physical abuse, reporting systems in various countries have expanded the reportable incidents, when it was recognised that sexual and emotional abuse, neglect, and exposure to domestic abuse also have profound impacts on children's wellbeing. Critics of investigations into reports of child abuse state that * A child may be wrongfully removed. * Long, repeated interrogations and physical examinations can leave emotional scars. * Even if not removed, there may be ongoing fear, distrust and insecurity. * Long-term foster care can leave lasting psychological scars and do irreparable damage to the parent/child bond. * An accusation of wrongdoing may disrupt a family even if allegations are dismissed. Often threats and an assumption of guilt over innocence lead to feelings of powerlessness, inadequacy, depression, denial of due process and liberties, reputations tarnished and privacy invaded, and legal consequences if assumed guilty. * There may be economic harm due to the need to obtain legal representation to defend one‚Äôs self and comply with the requirements demanded of them. Critics state that mandatory reporting may also * overload the child welfare system and increase the tax burden. * increase the number of unfounded reports or reports that (due to vague and broad laws) do not merit governmental interference. * jeopardize the ability of people, including abused people, to seek medical treatment or maintain a therapeutic relationship, for fear of being reported. * disproportionately affect African- American families. * discourage fellow citizens from taking positive neighborhood action with families in trouble, as they may consider that their responsibilities have been met when they call in an anonymous hotline. They also state that mandatory reporting laws have had unintended consequences for the accused. Individuals, including juveniles, who have never been convicted of anything may be placed on CPS Central Registries/databases (different from Sex Abuse Registries) for decades, limiting educational and employment opportunities due to background checks. There is a 1.2‚Äì12.3% recidivism rate (repeat substantiations within 6 months of initial substantiations).

The campaign all but ended in German East Africa in November 1917 when the Germans entered Portuguese Mozambique and continued the campaign living off Portuguese supplies. The strategy of the German colonial forces, led by Lieutenant Colonel (later \\"Generalmajor\\") Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck, was to divert Allied forces from the Western Front to Africa. His strategy achieved only mixed results after 1916 when he was driven out of GEA and Allied forces became composed almost entirely of South African, Indian, and other colonial troops. Black South African troops were not considered for European service as a matter of policy, while all Indian units had been withdrawn from the Western Front by the end of 1915. The campaign in Africa consumed considerable amounts of money and war material that could have gone to other fronts. The Germans in East Africa fought for the whole of the war, receiving word of the armistice on 14 November 1918 at 07:30 hours. Both sides waited for confirmation, with the Germans formally surrendering on 25 November. GEA became two League of Nations Class B Mandates, Tanganyika Territory of the United Kingdom and Ruanda-Urundi of Belgium, while the Kionga Triangle was ceded to Portugal. Background In 1885, Germans colonized the lands that became German East Africa (Deutsch-Ostafrika). The territory itself spanned and included the areas of present-day Rwanda, Burundi, and Tanzania. The indigenous population of Deutsch-Ostafrika numbered 7.5 million; 5,300 Europeans administered the colony. The colonial regime felt relatively secure but the effects of the Maji Maji Rebellion (1904‚Äì1905) were still being felt in 1914. The German colonial administration could call on a military Schutztruppe (protection force) of 260 Europeans and 2,470 Africans, plus 2,700 white settlers in the reservist Landsturm as well as a small paramilitary Gendarmerie. The outbreak of World War I in 1914 increased the popularity of German colonial expansion and the conquest of a Deutsch- Mittelafrika (\\"German Central Africa\\") that would parallel a resurgent German Empire in Europe. To create Mittelafrika and link the German colonies in eastern, south-western and western Africa, territory belonging to the Belgian Congo would have to be annexed. The new territories would occupy central Africa and make Germany the dominant colonial power on the continent. German military power in Africa was weak, its forces poorly equipped and dispersed. Although better trained and more experienced than their opponents, many of the German soldiers were reliant on weapons like the Model 1871 rifle, which used obsolete black powder. The Allied powers had similar problems of poor equipment and low numbers. Most colonial forces were paramilitary police for colonial repression, not armies to fight wars against other European powers. =Objectives= The largest body of German troops was in East Africa but this was far too small to fight an aggressive war. The objective of the German forces in East Africa, led by Lieutenant-Colonel Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck, was to divert Allied forces and supplies from Europe to Africa. By threatening the important British Uganda Railway, Lettow hoped to force British troops to invade East Africa, where he could fight a defensive campaign. In 1912, the German government had formed a defensive strategy for East Africa in which the military would withdraw to the hinterland and fight a guerilla campaign. The German colony in East Africa was a threat to the neutral Belgian Congo but the Belgian government hoped to continue its neutrality in Africa. The Force Publique was constrained to adopt a defensive strategy until 15 August 1914, when German ships on Lake Tanganyika bombarded the port of Mokolobu and then the Lukuga post a week later. Some Belgian officials viewed hostilities in East Africa as an opportunity to expand Belgian holdings in Africa; the capture of Ruanda and Urundi could increase the bargaining power of the De Broqueville government to ensure the restoration of Belgium after the war. During the post-war negotiation of the Treaty of Versailles, the Colonial Minister, Jules Renkin, sought to trade Belgian territorial gains in German East Africa for the Portuguese allocation in northern Angola, to gain Belgian Congo a longer coast. Campaign history =Operations, 1914‚Äì15= The governors of the British and German East Africa wanted to avoid war and preferred a neutrality agreement based on the Congo Act of 1885, against the wishes of the local military commanders and their metropolitan governments. The agreement caused confusion in the opening weeks of the conflict. On 31 July, implementing contingency plans, the cruiser sailed from Dar-es-Salaam for operations against British commerce. She narrowly avoided cruisers from the Cape Squadron sent to shadow the ship and be ready to sink it. On 5 August 1914, troops from the Uganda protectorate assaulted German river outposts near Lake Victoria. On the same day, the British War Cabinet ordered an Indian Expeditionary Force (IEF) to be sent to East Africa to eliminate bases for raiders. On 8 August, the Royal Navy cruiser shelled the wireless station at Dar es Salaam, then agreed a ceasefire, on condition the town remained an open city. This agreement caused discord between Vorbeck and Governor Heinrich Schnee, his nominal superior, who opposed and later ignored the agreement; it also caused the captain of Astraea to be reprimanded for exceeding his authority. Before Battle of Tanga when the IEF attempted to land at Tanga, the Royal Navy felt obliged to give warning that they were abrogating the agreement, forfeiting surprise. In August 1914, the military and para-military forces in both colonies were mobilised, despite restrictions imposed by the two governors. The German Schutztruppe in East Africa had of all ranks and equivalent to the two battalions of the King's African Rifles (KAR) in the British East African colonies. On 7 August, German troops at Moshi were informed that the neutrality agreement was at an end and ordered to raid across the border. On 15 August, Askari in the Neu Moshi region engaged in their first offensive operation of the campaign. Taveta on the British side of Kilimanjaro fell, to two companies of Askari (300 men) with the British firing a token volley and retiring in good order. The Askari detachment on Lake Tanganyika raided Belgian facilities seeking to destroy the steamer Commune and gain control of the lake. On 24 August, German troops attacked Portuguese outposts across the Rovuma, unsure of the intentions of Portugal, which was a British ally, which caused a diplomatic incident which was only smoothed over with difficulty. In September, the Germans began to raid deeper into British East Africa and Uganda. German naval power on Lake Victoria was limited to Hedwig von Wissmann and Kingani a tugboat armed with one pom-pom-gun, causing minor damage and a great deal of noise. The British armed the Uganda Railway lake steamers , , and as improvised gunboats; the tug was trapped and then scuttled by the Germans. The Germans later raised Kingani, dismounted her gun and used the tug as a transport; with the tug disarmed \\"teeth removed, British command of Lake Victoria was no longer in dispute.\\" To solve the raiding nuisance and to capture the northern, colonised region of the German colony, the British devised a plan for a two-pronged invasion. IEF \\"B\\" of in two brigades, would carry out an amphibious landing at Tanga on 2 November 1914, to capture the city and gain control the Indian Ocean terminus of the Usambara Railway. In the Kilimanjaro area, IEF \\"C\\" of in one brigade would advance from British East Africa on Neu-Moshi on 3 November 1914, to the western terminus of the railroad (see Battle of Kilimanjaro). After capturing Tanga, IEF \\"B\\" would rapidly move north-west, join IEF \\"C\\" and mop up the remaining German forces. Although outnumbered Tanga and Longido, the Schutztruppe under Vorbeck prevailed. In the East Africa volume of the British official history (1941), Charles Hordern described the events as one of \\"the most notable failures in British military history\\". =The naval war= K√∂nigsberg of the Imperial German Navy was in the Indian Ocean when war was declared. In the Battle of Zanzibar, K√∂nigsberg sank the old protected cruiser in Zanzibar harbour and then retired into the Rufiji River delta. After being cornered by warships of the British Cape Squadron, including an old pre-dreadnought battleship, two shallow-draught monitors with guns were brought from England and demolished the cruiser on 11 July 1915. The British salvaged and used six guns from Pegasus, which became known as the Peggy guns; the crew of K√∂nigsberg and the main battery guns were taken over by the Schutztruppe and were used until the end of hostilities. =Lake Tanganyika expedition= The Germans had controlled the lake since the outbreak of the war, with three armed steamers and two unarmed motor boats. In 1915, two British motorboats, HMS Mimi and Toutou each armed with a 3-pounder and a Maxim gun, were transported by land to the British shore of Lake Tanganyika. They captured the German ship Kingani on 26 December, renaming it and with two Belgian ships under the command of Commander Geoffrey Spicer-Simson, attacked and sank the German ship Hedwig von Wissmann. The Graf von G√∂tzen and the Wami, an unarmed motor boat, became the only German ships left on the lake. In February 1916, the Wami was intercepted and run ashore by the crew and burned. Lettow-Vorbeck then had its K√∂nigsberg gun removed and sent by rail to the main fighting front. The ship was scuttled in mid-July after a seaplane bombing attack by the Belgians on Kigoma and before advancing Belgian colonial troops could capture it; Wami was later re- floated and used by the British. =British Empire reinforcements, 1916= General Horace Smith-Dorrien was assigned with orders to find and fight the Schutztruppe but he contracted pneumonia during the voyage to South Africa, which prevented him from taking command. In 1916, General Jan Smuts was given the task of defeating Lettow-Vorbeck. Smuts had a large army (for the area), some Africans including Boers, British, Rhodesians and and African troops, a ration strength of There was a Belgian force and a larger but ineffective group of Portuguese military units based in Mozambique. A large Carrier Corps composed of African porters under British command, carried supplies into the interior. Despite the Allied nature of the effort, it was a South African operation of the British Empire. During the previous year, Lettow-Vorbeck had also gained personnel and his army was now Smuts attacked from several directions, the main attack coming from British East Africa (Kenya) in the north, while substantial forces from the Belgian Congo advanced from the west in two columns, crossing Lake Victoria on the British troop ships and and into the Rift Valley. Another contingent advanced over Lake Nyasa (Lake Malawi) from the south-east. All these forces failed to capture Lettow-Vorbeck and they all suffered from disease along the march. The 9th South African Infantry, started with 1,135 men in February, and by October its strength was reduced to 116 fit troops, with little fighting. The Germans nearly always retreated from the larger British troop concentrations and by September 1916, the German Central Railway from the coast at Dar es Salaam to Ujiji was fully under British control. With Lettow-Vorbeck confined to the southern part of German East Africa, Smuts began to withdraw the South African, Rhodesian and Indian troops and replace them with Askari of the King's African Rifles (KAR), which by November 1918 had By the start of 1917, more than half the British Army in the theatre was composed of Africans and by the end of the war, it was nearly all-African. Smuts left the area in January 1917, to join the Imperial War Cabinet at London. =Belgian operations, 1916‚Äì17= The British conscripted to move Belgian supplies and equipment to Kivu (in the east of the Belgian Congo) between late 1915 and early 1916. The lines of communication in the Congo required carriers, who were barred by the Belgian government from crossing into German East Africa and Belgian troops were expected to live off the land. To avoid the plundering of civilians, loss of food stocks and risk of famine, with many farmers already conscripted and moved away from their land, the British set up the Congo Carrier Section of the East India Transport Corps (Carbel) with conscripted from Ugandan civilians and assembled at Mbarara in April 1916. The Force Publique, started its campaign on 18 April 1916 under the command of General Charles Tombeur, Colonel Philippe Molitor and Colonel Fr√©d√©rick Olsen and captured Kigali in Rwanda on 6 May. The German Askari in Burundi were forced to retreat by the numerical superiority of the Force Publique and by 17 June, Burundi and Rwanda were occupied. The Force Publique and the British Lake Force then started a thrust to capture Tabora, an administrative centre of central German East Africa. Three columns took Biharamuro, Mwanza, Karema, Kigoma and Ujiji. At the Battle of Tabora on 19 September, the Germans were defeated and the village occupied. During the march, Carbel lost died or missing presumed dead, a rate of occurred despite the presence of two doctors and adequate medical supplies. To prevent Belgian claims on German territory in a post-war settlement, Smuts ordered their forces to return to the Congo, leaving them as occupiers only in Rwanda and Burundi. The British were obliged to recall Belgian troops in 1917 and the two allies coordinated campaign plans. =Operations, 1917‚Äì18= Major-General Arthur Hoskins (KAR), formerly the commander of the 1st East Africa Division, took over command of the campaign. After four months spent reorganising the lines of communication, he was then replaced by South African Major-General Jacob van Deventer. Deventer began an offensive in July 1917, which by early autumn had pushed the Germans to the south. From 1917, Lettow-Vorbeck fought a costly battle at Mahiwa, with casualties and losses in the Nigerian brigade. After the news of the battle reached Germany, Lettow-Vorbeck was promoted to Generalmajor. British units forced the Schutztruppe south and on 23 November, Lettow-Vorbeck crossed into Portuguese Mozambique to plunder supplies from Portuguese garrisons. The Germans fought the Battle of Ngomano in which the Portuguese garrison was routed, then marched through Mozambique in caravans of troops, carriers, wives and children for nine months but were unable to gain much strength. Lettow-Vorbeck divided his force into three groups on the march; a detachment of under Hauptmann Theodor Tafel ran out of food and ammunition and was forced to surrender before reaching Mozambique. Lettow and Tafel were unaware they were only one day's march apart. In Mozambique, the Schutztruppe won a number of important victories which allowed it to remain active but also came close to destruction during the Battle of Lioma and Battle of Pere Hills. The Germans returned to German East Africa and crossed into Northern Rhodesia in August 1918. On 13 November, two days after the Armistice was signed in France, the German Army took Kasama, which had been evacuated by the British. The next day at the Chambezi River, Lettow-Vorbeck was handed a telegram announcing the signing of the armistice and he agreed to a cease-fire. Lettow-Vorbeck marched his force to Abercorn and formally surrendered on 25 November 1918. The campaign cost the British at 2007 prices. Aftermath =Analysis= In one capacity or another, nearly 400,000 Allied soldiers, sailors, merchant marine crews, builders, bureaucrats and support personnel participated in the East Africa campaign. They were assisted in the field by an additional 600,000 African bearers. The Allies employed nearly one million people in their fruitless pursuit of Lettow-Vorbeck and his small force. Lettow-Vorbeck was cut off and could entertain no hope of a decisive victory. His aim was purely to keep as many British forces diverted to his pursuit for as long as possible and to make the British expend the largest amount of resources in men, shipping and supplies to his pursuit. Although succeeding in diverting in excess of and South African troops to pursue his forces and garrison German East Africa in his wake, he failed to divert additional Allied manpower from the European Theatre after 1916. While some shipping was diverted to the African theatre, it was not enough to inflict significant difficulties on the Allied navies. =Casualties= In 2001, Hew Strachan estimated that British losses in the East African campaign were in action, of disease and African porters dead. In 2007, Paice recorded casualties in the East African campaign, of whom of the in the campaign. By 1917, the conscription of Africans as carriers, depopulated many districts and porters had died, among them of the Carrier Corps in East Africa. Of the porters who died, Kenyan and of the male population. The campaign cost the British Empire ¬£70 million, close to the British war budget in 1914. A Colonial Office official wrote that the East African campaign had not become a scandal only \\"... because the people who suffered most were the carriers - and after all, who cares about native carriers?\\". The Belgian record of includes killed in action or died of disease but excludes deaths. Portuguese casualties in Africa were killed, missing or captured and an unknown but significant number wounded. In the German colonies, no records of the number of people conscripted or casualties were kept but in Der Weltkrieg, the German official history, Ludwig Boell (1951) wrote \\"... of the loss of levies, carriers, and boys (sic) [we could] make no overall count due to the absence of detailed sickness records\\". Paice wrote of a 1989 estimate of and a death rate of Carriers were rarely paid and food and cattle were requisitioned from civilians; a famine caused by the subsequent food shortage and poor rains in 1917 led to another deaths in German East Africa. The conscription of farm labour in British East Africa and the failure of the 1917‚Äì1918 rains, led to famine and in September the 1918 flu pandemic reached sub-Saharan Africa. In British East Africa died, in South Africa there were and in German East Africa of the population died of famine and disease; in sub-Saharan Africa, died in the flu epidemic.

The south of the governorate tapers in a curve to include the three main peaks at the head of the valley in the dorsal Atlas Mountains. Shortly after leaving the governorate, the Oued Siliana feeds into the valley of the Medjerda River, which flows east. Two main settlements are beside the river: Siliana and Gaafour (Qa Afur). Two forested ridges form national parks mainly within and outside the north-west and south-east borders respectively. The higher of these is the Djebel Serj to the south east. The Siliana Barrage, below the city, is an artificial reservoir and is the largest lake in the province, followed by the Lakhmess Barrage in the south-east, which is less than a third of its size. The climate is more Mediterranean than desert, as it is near the coast (see Tunisia¬ßClimate) with temperatures in all but the northern borders moderated by its high elevation.Physical Map of Tunisia Administrative divisions Ten municipalities are in Siliana Governorate: References Governorates of Tunisia ","title":"Siliana Governorate"},{"id":"4974878","text":"Space Music is the third album of Brazilian composer Eloy Fritsch.

An introduced population exists near Beijing. They are commonly kept as pets in land and water vivaria. B. orientalis is also known as the 'tuti toad'. It may properly be referred to as a frog, despite its common name: it is commonly called a toad because of the tubercles on its back.Zoo Med Laboratory, Inc. (2012). \\"Bombina orientalis\\". Zoo Med. Retrieved 15 October 2013.  Description  Held by a human hand Oriental fire-bellied toads, species of Bombina, are typically a bright green with black mottling on their dorsal regions, but their complexion may also darken to brown and even black depending on their background scenery. Like other Bombina species, B. orientalis has a bright yellow to red (generally bright reddish-orange) ventral region mottled with dark brown to black. The skin on its dorsal side is covered in small tubercles, and although it is typically referred to as a toad, the fire-bellied toad is not a true toad - family Bufonidae. They are noted for the bright green and black coloration on their backs, and orange and black on their undersides. In the wild, B. orientalis eats various small aquatic arthropods (among other things) from which they obtain beta-carotene, which aids in the coloration in the ventral region. These bright colors serve as a warning to predators of toxicity. The toxin is secreted through the skin mostly from the hind legs, and sometimes the belly, in a milky-like substance when the frog is disturbed or frightened. When disturbed, the frog may emit this toxin, and may also lie on its back to show the color of its belly, indicating its toxicity to any predators. A fire belly toad showing off the characteristic green and black back with orange toes  Reproduction  Breeding takes place in the spring with the warming of the weather and increase in rain. Males call to the females with a light barking croak. They jump onto the back of any other fire-bellied toad that happens to pass by, often leading to male-male confusion, but rarely any sort of fighting. Females lay 40 to 100 eggs in a large cluster, usually around submerged plants, near the water's edge. Tadpoles hatch from the eggs in three to 10 days depending on the temperature of the water. The tadpoles begin to develop legs in 6‚Äì8 weeks, and are fully metamorphosed and begin venturing on land in 12‚Äì14 weeks.  In captivity  B. orientalis at the American Museum of Natural History. In the United States and Europe B. orientalis is commonly kept as a pet. They are generally a hardy species that do well in captivity if given sufficient food and good water quality. They are commonly fed with small crickets dusted with a calcium powder. They can also be fed with other small invertebrates such as earthworms. Mealworms larvae possess hard shells, which fire-bellied toads have a hard time digesting or passing.http://www.wikihow.com/Care-for-Fire- Belly-Toads Care For Fire Belly Toads on WikiHow. While not the most toxic of amphibians, regular handling is not recommended. Although harmless to the skin, if ingested, the mucus can cause discomfort. Because of their mild toxicity, Oriental fire-bellied toads are incompatible with most other types of frog or amphibian. In captivity, oriental fire-bellied toads have lived for more than a dozen years, with 15 years being common. Some older reports document them as living up to 30 years. In captivity, providing a source of beta-carotene (such as carrots) to the prey insects (crickets) early in a frog's adult stage allows it to develop brighter coloration.Care and Raising of Oriental Firebellied Toads Oriental fire-bellied toads should be kept in water, with some kind of land or island to allow them to periodically climb out of the water. These frogs are not strong swimmers and may (but rarely) drown in water that is too deep. An ideal enclosure has plenty of land and water-based hiding places, as well as a land-based location suitable for depositing live food. Fire-bellied toads have a sensitivity to chlorine and chloramine - tap water should be treated or allowed to stand for several days, to allow chlorine to dissipate, before adding it to their environment. Chloramine will not dissipate in this manner, so tap water treated with chloramine must be treated with a dechloramine agent (and then allowed to stand) before being added.

He is currently serving a 240-year sentence at USP Allenwood for his role in the bombing.https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/25/nyregion/trade-center-bombers-get- prison-terms-of-114-years.html?pagewanted=all Early life Ajaj was born in the West Bank and immigrated to Houston, Texas, where he worked as a pizza delivery driver. Training for Terrorist Attacks April 24, 1992, abandoning his first asylum claim, Ajaj flew from New York to Peshawar, Pakistan, using the alias Ibraham Salameh, from there to Camp Khalden on the Afghanistan- Pakistan border. Lacking necessary credentials, Ajaj was sent to Saudi Arabia to obtain a letter of recommendation. May 16, 1992, he flew to Saudi Arabia via United Arab Emirates where he procured a letter of introduction requesting the leader of Camp Khalden provide the bearer with training in the use of weapons and explosives. Ajaj returned to Pakistan via UAE, arriving June 14, 1992, and began the bomb building course. Return to U.S. August 31, 1992, using services of a Pakistani travel agent, Ahmad Ajaj and Ramzi Yousef boarded Pakistan International Airlines flight 703 in Peshawar and flew to Karachi, Pakistan, then on to Kennedy Airport in New York City, flying first class during both legs of the trip, believing they would receive less scrutiny. Ajaj and Yousef together had five passports and numerous documents supporting their aliases: a Saudi passport showing signs of alteration, an Iraqi passport bought from a Pakistani official, a photo-substituted Swedish passport, a photo-substituted British passport, a Jordanian passport, identification cards, bank records, education records, and medical records, and carried WAMY published manuals. (911 Commission) On September 1, 1992, at Kennedy airport Ajaj was sent to secondary immigration inspection, where he claimed he was a member of the Swedish press, travelling as Khurram Khan with International Student Identification card and a falsified Swedish passport. It is unknown whether Ajaj was meant to cause a scene as a distraction to let Yousef slip through, or legitimately lost his temper, but he shouted to the inspector: \\"My mother was Swedish! If you don't believe me check your computer.\\" The passport was legitimate, belonging to a Swedish citizen who had attended a training camp in Pakistan and surrendered his identity cards to those who ran the camp, but Ajaj had used simple school paste to plaster his own photograph over the legitimate owner.Katz, Samuel M. \\"Relentless Pursuit: The DSS and the manhunt for the al-Qaeda terrorists\\", 2002 In Ajaj's luggage INS inspector Mark Cozine and Robert Malafronte found a Saudi passport, altered Jordanian passport, with supporting documents for both; a plane ticket and British passport in the name of Mohammed Azan, bomb-making manuals, videos and other materials on assemble weapons and explosives assembly, letters referencing his attendance at terrorist training camps; anti-American and anti-Israeli materials, instructions on document forgery, and two rubber stamp devices to alter the seal on passports issued from Saudi Arabia. One of the manuals, written in 1982, seven years before the group was founded, was entitled al-Qaeda (‚ÄúThe Base‚Äù or ‚ÄúThe Foundation‚Äù) and was more widely reported after the group came to prominence.Benjamin, Daniel & Steven Simon. \\"The Age of Sacred Terror\\", 2002 An INS supervisor informed the FBI Terrorist Task Force which declined to get involved but requested copies of the file. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms was notified but was \\"not interested.\\" Yousef was also sent to secondary immigration inspection for lacking a passport or a visa that would allow him to enter U.S. He presented an Iraqi passport he said he bought from a Pakistani official for $100 or more (up to $2700 in one report), adding that the passport was fraudulent. Yousef claimed he was fleeing Saddam Hussein and needed asylum, that he had been recently beaten by Iraqi soldiers in Kuwait because they thought he was a member of a Kuwaiti guerilla organization. INS inspector Martha Morales also found in his possession a boarding pass in the name of Mohammed Azan, and an identity card, from Al-Bunyan Islamic Center in Arizona, with Yousef's photo and the name Khurram Khan, under which Ajaj had traveled into the U.S. Yousef had signed the back of the card as Ramzi Ahmed Yousef. Yousef had checks from Lloyds Bank of London and an address book listing what Morales later called \\"unusual places [in America] for someone to visit whom had just come from halfway around the world.\\" Fingerprinted and photographed, his passport was confiscated. Morales said Yousef spoke excellent English with a British accent, admitted his real name Ramzi Yousef and said he was born in UAE in 1967, and was a citizen of Pakistan. Her Supervisor overruled Morales's recommendation to detain Yousef on grounds the INS detention center was full - even though Yousef had committed acts of immigration fraud (travelling under three different identities and lying to an INS official), and also given inspectors evidence linking him to Ahmad Ajaj. With intermingled documents and both men in secondary inspection, still Yousef was not linked to Ajaj He made a claim for political asylum and was released in the United States pending a hearing. Ajaj's terrorist kit, counterfeit entry stamp, and outburst were all decoys intended to deflect INS attention away from Yousef and facilitate Yousef's processing - a premeditated plan intended to exploit routine activities of busy INS inspectors. After more than 8 hours of questioning, at 5:00 a.m. September 2, 1992, INS handed Ajaj to Wackenhut Correctional Corporation for incarceration in a converted warehouse in Queens. Ajaj's passport revealed his June 15, 1992 Pakistani entry stamp was counterfeit. Ajaj told authorities he had a political asylum claim from a prior entry in February 1992, and was detained pending a hearing. Ajaj later pleaded guilty to use of an altered passport and served six months in prison. Yousef never appeared for his hearing.  Participation from prison  Incarcerated from September 2, 1992, Ajaj remained in contact with Yousef and other co- conspirators and continued to be involved in the World Trade Center bombing plot. Ajaj never contacted Yousef directly. Calls were patched through \\"Big 5 Hamburgers\\" in Dallas, rendering law enforcement detection more difficult. The calls were not translated until long after the WTC bombing. Beginning on December 4, 1992 (and later on December 29, 1992), Yousef placed a series of calls to Ajaj's lawyer in New York and to Ajaj's friend in Texas. Later that same day, a call from Ajaj was transferred to Yousef, permitting the two to speak directly. In the conversation, Ajaj immediately brought up the terrorist kit informing Yousef that the Court had ordered the government to return Ajaj's belongings. When Yousef asked if he could take possession of Ajaj's things, Ajaj readily agreed at first, but then said that it was not a good idea for Yousef personally to obtain the materials from the government because it might jeopardize Yousef's \\"business\\", which, Ajaj said, would be \\"a pity!\\" Ajaj was released from prison March 1, 1993 ‚Äì three days after the WTC bombing. He was rearrested in connection with the attack March 9, 1993, and his asylum request was denied on April 24, 1993. In jail at the time of the WTC bombing, Ajaj was convicted of having played a role \\"in the early stages of the conspiracy\\" and convicted of nine counts, sentenced to 240 years, fined $250,000, and ordered to pay 250 million dollars in restitution. Ajaj did not give up on his political asylum claim. He petitioned for a new attorney and an exclusion hearing ‚Äì held to determine whether someone is admissible in the U.S. ‚Äì in Houston, where he had filed his original political asylum claim. Ajaj's request was denied April 24, 1993, on grounds that a passport holder from a visa waiver country who uses a fraudulent passport (Ajaj had used a bogus Swedish passport) is not entitled to such a hearing. Not satisfied with that outcome, Ajaj asked to file a new political asylum claim and was given ten days by an immigration judge to do so. Thus, Ajaj was able to file a political asylum claim after his arrest for involvement in the WTC bombing. A 2011 NPR report claimed he was imprisoned in a highly restrictive Communication Management Unit. As of 2020 Ajaj is at the USP Allenwood in Pennsylvania with BOP number 40637-053.  Lung Cancer  In the late 1990s Ajaj was diagnosed with lung cancer. The U.S. Bureau of Prisons moved him to a medical facility, where he had surgery to remove the cancerous lung and received radiation treatment. He has filed scores of grievances and several lawsuits against the U.S. prison system, alleging everything from interference with his mail to denial of access to lawyers, and violations of his Eighth Amendment rights. Ajaj was the only remaining plaintiff in a lawsuit by federal prisoners alleging harm from secondhand smoke seeping through the air filtration system at SuperMax.

He and FBI agent Aloysius Pendergast work together to solve the mystery and save innocent lives. D'Agosta returns in Reliquary, after which he retires to Canada, using the pseudonym of Campbell Dirk to write police procedurals. D'Agosta comes out of retirement, leaving his cheating wife and college aged son (Vinnie Jr.) in Canada, in Brimstone and returns to the force. He is now sergeant in a small town outside New York. He works with Laura Hayward, whom he was romantically involved with, and again with Agent Pendergast. The two investigate various murders with satanic overtones; they also become involved with the search for a priceless violin. In Dance of Death, D'Agosta risks his job to conceal the fugitive Pendergast's whereabouts and helps him defeat his murderous brother, Diogenes. This takes them back to D'Agosta's old workplace, the museum. He then helps break Pendergast out of prison and helps to catch Diogenes in The Book of the Dead. Pendergast later comes to believe his deceased wife was murdered via tampering with her rifle. He hires D'Agosta to assist him in the investigation. An assassin trying to kill Pendergast severely wounds D'Agosta instead. Another effort is made to kill D'Agosta, partly to entrap Pendergast as well. The attempt fails on both counts.

A native of the state, he was a rancher before entering politics and serving in the Oregon House of Representatives, including one session as Speaker. A Republican, he served one term in the United States Senate from 1921 to 1927. Early life Robert Nelson Stanfield, Jr., was born near the city of Umatilla, in Eastern Oregon on July 9, 1877., the first son of Harriet Thankful Townsend and Robert N. Stanfield, Sr., owner of a livery stable and freighting company.Stanfield family records, Oregon Historical Society, Portland He lived in Umatilla until 1882 when his family moved to Pendleton, where his father ran a freight forwarding business. In 1885, the family moved to the former Buel Atwood place on Butter Creek, near Echo, Oregon. After the family moved to Butter Creek, he attended school at the Thomson School and then at the Butter Creek School built on land his father donated to the school district.Gerald E. Stanfield, unpublished autobiography (1972), Stanfield Family Papers. In the fall of 1895, he enrolled in the state normal school at neighboring Weston. His education was interrupted by the death of his father, Robert N. Stanfield, Sr., on April 15, 1896. He left school in 1897, after completing two years, and took over management of the Stanfield ranch on Butter Creek from his mother. From the original ranch on Butter Creek, he and his brothers built up a large livestock operation with multiple ranches.G.E.Stanfield He was also involved in banking in Echo and Baker. He started with cattle and then switched mainly to sheep.Neal, Steve (1985). McNary of Oregon: A Political Biography. Portland, Oregon: Western Imprints, pp. 40‚Äì46. During World War I his flocks were estimated to include 350,000 head of sheep, making him the world's largest sheep rancher. Political career In 1912, Stanfield was elected to the Oregon House of Representatives as a Republican representing District 22 which included Morrow and Umatilla counties.1913 Regular Session (27th). Oregon Secretary of State. Retrieved on November 27, 2008. He continued in the state house through 1917, serving as Speaker during the 1917 session. The next year, he ran against Charles L. McNary for the Republican nomination to the U.S. Senate, losing in the May primary. Stanfield in 1924 In 1920, Stanfield was elected as a Republican to the U.S. Senate and served from March 4, 1921, to March 4, 1927. While in the Senate he was chairman of the Committee to Examine Branches of the Civil Service (Sixty-eighth Congress) and a member of the Committee on Public Lands and Surveys (Sixty-ninth Congress). During his time in Congress, he took hearings about public land use to the western states for the first time. He considered his greatest success the construction of the Owyhee Dam and irrigation projects in Malheur County, one of the first desert land reclamation projects. His reputation was rough and ready. In the midst of prohibition, he was arrested following a drunken bar fight in Baker, Oregon. When he ran for re-election, his major opponents were the WCTU and the KKK. His admiring cowboy constituency could not elect him. Later years He ran for the Republican nomination in 1926. He lost in the May primary election to Frederick Steiwer. He then earned a position on the general election ballot as an independent candidate. He lost to Steiwer a second time. He ran in the 1928 primary to be a candidate for Representative and was defeated again.G.E. Stanfield After Congress he returned to Oregon and resumed his former business pursuits, and in 1945 died in Weiser, Idaho. Robert Stanfield was buried in Hillcrest Cemetery. He was survived by his wife, Inez Hill and one daughter, Barbara.

The format was synonymous with KROQ-FM and eventually developed into the modern rock format. Carroll spread this format to a number of radio markets across the United States either directly, as a radio consultant during the 1980s, or indirectly as stations adopted the KROQ-FM sound. Biography Born in Contra Costa County, California, Rick Carroll began his radio career as an intern at KPOP, Roseville / Sacramento, California, continuing at KERS while attending California State University-Sacramento. His professional career included stints as consultant or programming director for various California radio stations, including KKDJ and KEZY before moving to KROQ-FM in 1978. During the late 1970s and early 1980s, mainstream acts dominated rock radio via the Album Oriented Rock (AOR) format, leaving little opportunity for most new artists. Carroll's approach was to play music from the emerging new wave, punk and related genres while retaining a Top 40 presentation style and Top 40 rotations. Noted for his ability to pick breakout hits, Carroll guided songs to prominence via the \\"Hot Clock,\\" a pie chart prescribing the music to be played during each portion of a disc jockey's air shift. His system also included a \\"Jock's Choice\\" at the end of each hour of programming, during which a DJ could play any song of his or her own choosing. The Jock's Choice became a vehicle for new artists such as Depeche Mode and Juluka to break into KROQ-FM's regular rotation. Starting in 1983, Carroll consulted other radio stations where he implemented the Rock of the Eighties format, including 91X (San Diego, CA), KYYX (Seattle, WA), KPOP Roseville / (Sacramento, CA), WAAF (Boston, MA), WIFI (Philadelphia, PA), KQAK (San Francisco, CA), WRQC (Cleveland, OH) and WYDD (Pittsburgh, PA) among many others. Carroll died of AIDS-related pneumonia on July 10, 1989. Rick was inducted into the Rock Radio Hall of Fame in the \\"Legends of Rock Radio-Programming\\" category on 2014.

Overview This pattern was first describedhttp://www.martinfowler.com/bliki/AnemicDomainModel.html by Martin Fowler, who considers the practice an anti-pattern. He says: In an anemic domain design, business logic is typically implemented in separate classes which transform the state of the domain objects. Fowler calls such external classes transaction scripts. This pattern is a common approach in Java applications, possibly encouraged by technologies such as early versions of EJB's Entity Beans, as well as in .NET applications following the Three- Layered Services Application architecture where such objects fall into the category of \\"Business Entities\\" (although Business Entities can also contain behavior). Fowler describes the transaction script pattern thus: In his book \\"Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture\\", Fowler noted that the transaction script pattern is OK for many simple business applications, and obviates a complex OO-database mapping layer. Reasons why this may occur AnemicDomainModel may occur in systems that are influenced from Service- Oriented Architectures, where behaviour does not or tends to not travel. * Messaging/Pipeline architectures * APIs such as SOAP/REST Architectures like COM+ and Remoting allow behaviour, but increasingly the web has favoured disconnected and stateless architectures. Criticism There is some criticism as to whether this software design pattern should be considered an anti-pattern, since many see also benefits in it, for example: * Clear separation between logic and data.http://blog.inf.ed.ac.uk/sapm/2014/02/04/the-anaemic-domain-model-is-no- anti-pattern-its-a-solid-design/ * Works well for simple applications. * Results in stateless logic, which facilitates scaling out. * Avoids the need for a complex OO-Database mapping layer. * More compatibility with mapping and injection frameworks expecting dumb properties rather than a specific constructor or property population order. Liabilities * Logic cannot be implemented in a truly object-oriented way. * Violation of the encapsulation and information hiding principles. * Needs a separate business layer to contain the logic otherwise located in a domain model. It also means that domain model's objects cannot guarantee their correctness at any moment, because their validation and mutation logic is placed somewhere outside (most likely in multiple places). * Needs a service layer when sharing domain logic across differing consumers of an object model. * Makes a model less expressive.  Example  Anemic class Box { public int Height { get; set; } public int Width { get; set; } } Non-anemic class Box { public int Height { get; } public int Width { get; } public Box(int height, int width) { if (height <= 0) { throw new ArgumentOutOfRangeException(nameof(height)); } if (width <= 0) { throw new ArgumentOutOfRangeException(nameof(width)); } Height = height; Width = width; } public int Area() { return Height * Width; } } See also * Plain old Java object * Domain-driven design * GRASP information expert, an anemic domain model is the typical result of not applying the information expert principle, i.e. you can avoid an anemic domain model by trying to assign responsibilities to the same classes that contain the data References External links *Anemic Domain Model by Martin Fowler *Three-Layered Services Application *Application Architecture for .NET: Designing Applications and Services *Article on why anemic model may be considered good design *Writing Clean Code in ASP.NET *How to Avoid Anemic Domain Model Software architecture Anti-patterns ","title":"Anemic domain model"},{"id":"4975314","text":"Cannes station or Cannes-Voyageurs (French: Gare de Cannes) is the main railway station for the French Southern city of Cannes.

EVRC-B is an enhancement to EVRC and compresses each 20 milliseconds of 8000 Hz, 16-bit sampled speech input into output frames of one of the four different sizes: Rate 1 - 171 bits, Rate 1/2 - 80 bits, Rate 1/4 - 40 bits, Rate 1/8 - 16 bits. In addition, there are two zero bit codec frame types: null frames and erasure frames, similar to EVRC. One significant enhancement in EVRC-B is the use of 1/4 rate frames that were not used in EVRC. This provides lower average data rates (ADRs) compared to EVRC, for a given voice quality. The new 4GV Codecs used in CDMA2000 are based on EVRC-B. 4GV is designed to allow service providers to dynamically prioritize voice capacity on their network as required. The Enhanced Variable Rate Coder (EVRC) is a speech codec used for cellular telephony in cdma2000 systems. EVRC provides excellent speech quality using variable rate coding with 3 possible rates, 8.55, 4.0 and 0.8 kbit/s. However, the Quality of Service (QoS) in cdma2000 systems can significantly benefit from a codec which allows tradeoffs between voice quality and network capacity, which cannot be achieved efficiently with the EVRC. An upgrade of the EVRC vocoder, known as EVRC-B, was recently introduced by 3GPP2. The EVRC-B speech codec is based on the 4GV concept and is the newest and most advanced speech codec for cellular applications. In addition to the Relaxed Code Excitation Linear Prediction (RCELP) used by EVRC, EVRC-B uses Prototype Pitch Period (PPP) approach for coding of stationary voice frames and Noise Excitation Linear Prediction (NELP) for efficient coding of unvoiced or noise frames. Using NELP and PPP coding at 2.0 kbit/s provides EVRC-B with superior flexibility in rate assignment, allowing it to operate at several operating points, each with a different trade-off between speech quality and system capacity. EVRC-B replaced EVRC as the main speech codec for cdma2000 and its first network commercial deployment started in 2007. A wideband extension, EVRC-WB, provides speech quality that exceeds regular wireline telephony and its standardization process was completed at the summer of 2007. EVRC-WB uses a modified discrete cosine transform (MDCT) audio coding algorithm. EVRC-B can be also used in 3GPP2 container file format - 3G2.

He was one of the seven Foster brothers, all of whom played first- class cricket for the county. Foster also appeared for Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) and the Gentlemen. He was also an amateur footballer, turning out for Corinthian. Military career Born in Great Malvern, Worcestershire, like his brothers Foster was educated at Malvern College before going to the Royal Military Academy and being commissioned into the Royal Artillery in November 1894. He was promoted to Lieutenant on 17 November 1897, and served in the Second Boer War 1900‚Äì1901, during which he was promoted Captain on 16 January 1901. He was seconded for a staff appointment in South Africa as Deputy Assistant Adjutant-General in April 1902. He later served in World War I, for which he won the Distinguished Service Order (DSO). Cricket Foster made his first-class debut for Worcestershire in 1899, against Yorkshire in Worcestershire's first ever match at that level, though he had a personally unmemorable game in scoring 0 and 22. However, the season as a whole was a success for him: he made 1,041 runs in all, and topped Worcestershire's batting averages with 42.57. Against Hampshire, both he and his brother Tip scored a century in each innings; Wilfrid scored 140 and 172 not out, the former being his maiden first-class century, and the latter being his highest first-class score.Worcestershire v Hampshire, 1899. cricketarchive.com Foster played three first-class matches (none for Worcestershire) in 1900, but was then out of the game for several years owing to his service in the Boer War.Obituaries in 1958.

From 1903 he was employed by the Birmingham-based glassmaking company of Chance Brothers, which might explain his only very moderate success with the bat. His last match was in 1911 against Middlesex.

The structure was formerly a gristmill, being the oldest in the state of Iowa, and as such it has earned national recognition. Potter's Mill is on the National Register of Historic Places, as well as being named a point of interest in the Silos & Smokestacks National Heritage Area. History Elbridge Gerry Potter first came to the Bellevue area in 1843 from New Lebanon, Illinois. Potter had been searching for a place to locate a flour mill, and came to decide on Bellevue for the location. Potter and local millwright John Gammel built a mill on what became known as Big Mill Creek. They used limestone from the nearby bluffs to build the mill and a nearby dam. Timber came from nearby areas. At first the mill was powered by an overshot waterwheel located along the southern side of the mill. The total cost to build the structure at the time was about $40,000. By 1845 the mill was in operation. Potter had customers in many major central and eastern U.S. cities, and purchased the wheat from local farmers as well as farmers in Minnesota and Wisconsin. Potter later extended the dam in order to install six turbines that in turn operated six milling stones. Potter operated the mill until 1871, when he sold the mill to Kilborn and Company. Kilborn and Company operated the mill for the next ten years. In 1881, they sold the mill to Arnold Reiling. The mill was damaged by a flash flood on May 24, 1896. In the aftermath the spillway was replaced by a Atlas steam engine. Reiling and his family owned and operated the mill for the next 38 years before they decided to sell the property. Over the next few years, several different parties owned and operated the mill until it was purchased by the Dyas family in 1931. The Dyas family continued to operate the mill until 1969. Finally in 1969 the mill stopped producing flour. The property was put up for sale at an auction in 1980. Daryll and Carolyn Eggers purchased the structure at this auction, and set about restoring the mill. In 1985 they opened Potter's Mill as a B&B;/Event Center. After years of running the business, the building was finally put up for sale. In August 2014 the building reopened as \\"Flatted Fifth Blues and BBQ at Potter's Mill\\" and \\"The Inn at Potter's Milll.\\"http://www.thonline.com/news/tri- state/article_969c3e9b-8542-57b3-8043-4139936c8911.html References External links * Potter's Mill website Bellevue, Iowa Buildings and structures in Jackson County, Iowa Bed and breakfasts in Iowa Industrial buildings completed in 1845 Grinding mills on the National Register of Historic Places in Iowa National Register of Historic Places in Jackson County, Iowa Grinding mills in Iowa Flour mills in the United States 1845 establishments in Iowa Territory ","title":"Potter's Mill"},{"id":"4975547","text":"Sunday is a current affairs programme broadcast on TVNZ 1 in New Zealand on Sunday nights at .

The rebellion was a part of a long-standing tension between religious and political groups in northern Carolina, generally divided between the Quaker party, of which Cary was a part, and the Church of England party, to which Hyde belonged. Background George Fox, founder of Quakerism At the time, the Province of Carolina was technically a single entity which encompassed all the land from Spanish Florida to the Colony of Virginia. However, transportation between the northern parts and the southern seat of the provincial government in Charleston was very difficult and in the late 17th century, a deputy governor for the northern section was appointed who was able to act with significant autonomy. Early in its history Carolina had provided for religious freedom, making it an attractive destination for Quakers who were persecuted in England and parts of the colonies. Quakerism's founder George Fox visited the Albemarle Settlements in the very northern part of Carolina in 1672. In the succeeding years, Quakerism grew in the area and came to dominate the government, including the appointment of Quaker John Archdale as Governor of Carolina in 1694. In 1699, Henderson Walker was appointed Deputy Governor of North Carolina. A devout Anglican, he pushed through reforms which established the Church of England as the official religion of the state and passing the Vestry Act which imposed a tax on residents, no matter their faith, to support the official church. During his tenure, Queen Anne assumed the throne, which required a renewal of the oaths by colonial officers. Quakers, as a tenet of their faith, do not swear oaths but had previously proven their loyalty by affirming it. This practice was disallowed and all Quakers lost their positions. Over the next decade the distinction between the Quaker party and the Church party grew more entrenched. Cary's Governorship Thomas Cary was the stepson of the former Governor of Carolina and Quaker John Archdale. However, when he was first appointed Deputy Governor of North Carolina, he supported the Church party and continued to keep Quakers out of the government by strictly enforcing the oath requirement. The Quakers and some disaffected Anglicans sent a representative to the Lords Proprietors of Carolina in England who removed Cary from the governorship. After Cary returned to South Carolina, where he remained active in provincial politics, William Glover took over as Acting Deputy Governor, but continued the oath policy as before. In 1707, Cary returned, this time supporting the Quaker dissenters against Glover and also espousing the regional interests of the town of Bath, on the Pamlico Sound against the Albemarle government which centered on the region near present-day Edenton. In 1708, Cary and his supporters had managed to oust Glover in an election in the Assembly; Glover then fled to Virginia and claimed Cary had threatened his life. Cary removed the oath requirement and restored Quakers to the government and so from 1708‚Äì1710, Cary and the Quakers dominated the government. Cary also lowered the quit-rents for Bath County, which were essentially a land tax charged in exchange for the royal land grants. Cary's government was not endorsed by the Lords Proprietors and so had no official legal standing. Rebellion Edward Hyde, the first Governor of North Carolina (January‚ÄìSeptember 1712) Though \\"Cary's Rebellion\\" can refer to the entire period from the ousting of Glover, it is generally used only for the period in 1711 after the Lords Proprietors chose Edward Hyde to take over the role of Deputy Governor and was resisted by Cary. Hyde arrived in North Carolina in January 1711. He brought with him letters from the Lords Proprietors and was supposed to receive his full, official commission from the Governor of Carolina when he arrived. However, the governor had died when he arrived, and so his claim to the Deputy Governorship was not technically perfected. Despite this, Cary and the Quaker party were at first willing to allow Hyde to take over, until Hyde began to clearly side with the Anglican party. Then Cary refused to recognize Hyde until he produced his official commission and claimed that he was still the legal governor. Hyde declared Cary to be in open rebellion and assembled an armed force of around 150 men to go to Bath to arrest him. Cary fled from his home to a nearby plantation (possibly that of former governor Robert Daniell) which had been fortified and armed with cannons and several dozen of Cary's supporters. On May 29, after failing to reach an agreement with Cary, Hyde decided to attack this fortified position and he and his men were beaten back after a short battle. Cary gathered together a larger force and armed a small brigantine with several cannons and set off to attack Hyde's fortified plantation. On June 30, Cary's attack was repulsed after the mast of the brigantine was shot and his men fled. Cary regrouped and fortified a small island in the Pamlico Sound and began to rearm his followers. They then sailed to mainland Carolina and met Hyde's force face to face. A fierce battle broke out. Little is known about the battle. Quakers themselves are generally pacifists so it is unlikely that many Quakers took part in the violence themselves but rather that Cary's force was made up of Bath County men and non-Quaker dissenters. Governor Alexander Spottswood of Virginia had decided to come to the aid of Hyde and began organizing a militia and dispatched a contingent of Royal Marines who had been stationed on the Chesapeake in mid-July. With the arrival of an organized military force, who represented the official power of the crown, Cary's forces disbanded and Cary himself fled. He was arrested and sent to England for trial though he was released after a year and returned to live out his life in Bath without further incident. Aftermath During the period from 1708‚Äì1711, the disputed government severely weakened the position of the colonists in North Carolina. The Tuscarora War began in September 1711 and the chaos and dissension that the Cary Rebellion had wrought impeded the colonial response, though a drought and yellow fever epidemic also played a role. The Cary rebellion also represented the end of the role of Quakers in North Carolina governance. After the rebellion they were effectively excluded from politics.

He governed during a time of tremendous turmoil, including an internal revolt known as Cary's Rebellion and an American indian uprising called the Tuscarora War. Early life Hyde was born in 1667 to a prominent family in England and was a cousin of Anne Hyde, the first wife of King James II of England. He was a son of Robert Hyde and his wife Phillis Snyed of Cheshire in England. Hyde, along with his sisters, Anne and Penelope, was raised by his grandmother, since his parents died when he was about three years old. Hyde entered Oxford University in 1683, but he did not complete a degree. In 1692, he married Catherine Rigby, whose family was prominent in Cheshire. Virginian William Byrd described her in his diary as \\"an abundance of life\\".Byrd, William. The secret diary of William Byrd of Westover, 1709-1712. Research library of colonial Americana. New York: Arno Press, 1972. In 1702 Hyde was appointed by Queen Anne as Jamaica‚Äôs provost marshal. Hyde served in that position without ever travelling to the Caribbean but did not find it to be lucrative. Governor of North Carolina Though the territory between the Virginia border and the Cape Fear River was officially recognized as \\"north\\" Carolina as early as 1689, that territory and all of what would become South Carolina was collectively known as the Province of Carolina for the first few decades of settlement, with the royal governor maintaining his residence at Charleston. A deputy governor was appointed for the northern part of the province - until the meeting at which Hyde was appointed. When he arrived in Virginia, he learned that Governor Edward Tynte, who was appointed Governor of Carolina in 1708 and from whom he was to receive his commission, had died. Hyde proceeded to North Carolina without his commission, where he found dissension about to erupt in violence. Thomas Cary was appointed Deputy Governor of North Carolina, with responsibility for northern Carolina. While he was in the southern portion of the Colony in 1706‚Äì1708, William Glover as President of the Council was acting Deputy Governor. Meanwhile, a petition had been presented to the Lords Proprietors in London by disgruntled Carolina settlers and Cary was ordered removed as Deputy Governor and the Council elected Glover as Deputy Governor. There had long been a large population of Quakers in northern Carolina and there was growing friction between the Quakers and adherents of the Church of England who wished to see it established as the official church of the colony by law. Quakers were unable, due to their beliefs, to swear oaths required of all officials on the coronation of Queen Anne. Cary returned to the region and disputed Glover's right to office claiming support from the Quakers. From 1708 until Hyde's arrival in 1710 there was violence and a disputed Assembly election. Ultimately, Hyde's authority was established when Virginia Governor Alexander Spottswood sent a militia into Carolina. A company of royal marines from the guardships in the Chesapeake Bay arrived to aid Hyde in July 1711. Cary's forces laid down their arms and submitted to Hyde.Herbert R. Paschal, Jr., A History of Colonial Bath (Raleigh, N.C.: Edwards & Broughton, 1955). Death Hyde died of yellow fever on 8 September 1712 in Chowan Precinct (present-day Bertie County), North Carolina. Personal life The Hydes had a number of children but only one daughter, Anne Hyde survived them. She married George Clarke who served as acting Governor of New York.

Plot  =Part One= Ross is being questioned by his friends about his relationship with Elizabeth (Alexandra Holden); mainly asking if the relationship is going anywhere. Ross quickly claims he and Elizabeth are great together, and his friends are all wrong... until he sees her having a water balloon fight with her buddies. Deciding she is too young, he breaks off the relationship. Afterward, Ross questions his decision, until Elizabeth confirms her immaturity by dropping water balloons on his head from her upstairs window. Rachel takes Phoebe and Joey to a charity event helping children, including a silent auction. While Phoebe is obviously over-drinking, Joey has bigger problems; misunderstanding the silent auction process, Joey thought that bidders guessed an object's worth, with the prize going to the person with the closest guess. Joey \\"guesses\\" $20,000 and wins a yacht. Rachel and Joey try to convince the next highest bidder to buy the boat, but in the process of persuading the man of the boat's virtues, Joey changes his mind and wants it for himself, although he can barely afford it. After weeks of preparation, Chandler is ready to propose to Monica. While at a restaurant, Chandler begins his proposal however before he can ask the question Monica's ex-boyfriend Richard (Tom Selleck) walks in and the moment is lost. When the others come home from the charity event, they constantly ask to see Monica's hand, thinking Chandler proposed already. Feeling that Monica will figure out that Chandler plans to propose, Joey suggests that Chandler pretend he does not care about marriage and may never want to get married. Meanwhile, Richard approaches Monica at work and declares his love for her. =Part Two= Richard tells Monica that he has never gotten over her and that he wants to marry and have children with her. Monica is left confused and when Chandler talks about how he hates marriage and cannot see why anyone should get married she starts to feel unsure about their whole relationship. After Joey tells Monica that Chandler seemingly has no interest in getting married, Monica tells him that Richard wants to marry her, leading Joey to tell her that Chandler does love marriage, making Monica even more confused. She decides enough is enough and goes to meet Richard at his apartment. After talking to him about the unfairness of the situation, she soon leaves to think things over. Feeling envious of Chandler and Monica, Rachel decides to follow Phoebe's lead and secure Ross as her marriage \\"backup\\": they will get married if they are both still single at 40. However, she finds that Phoebe had long since made Ross her second backup after Joey. All three confront Phoebe about this, and it is decided that Joey will remain Phoebe's backup, while Ross becomes Rachel's. Joey tells Chandler how his plan has backfired on him and he is now in serious danger of losing Monica for good, and he leaves on a frantic search intending to propose when he finds her. Chandler comes to Richard's apartment and asks for Monica, only to find that she has left. He tells Richard off for blowing his own chances years ago, and also says that he and Monica are meant to be together, revealing he had intended to propose. Richard advises Chandler to go to Monica, telling him if he succeeds in winning her back, he must never let her go. After searching for Monica all day, Chandler hurries back to his apartment and when he gets there, Joey meets him in the hall, claiming Monica has left because of his commitment issues, despite Joey trying to convince her otherwise. When Chandler enters their apartment, believing he has destroyed his relationship with Monica, he discovers that it is far from being abandoned, there are candles lit all over and Monica is kneeling to propose. In the midst of proposing to Chandler, she cries from sheer emotion and is unable to continue. Instead, Chandler gets on his knees and proposes to her and Monica accepts. They then open the door to Joey, Rachel, and Phoebe, who have been waiting to celebrate. At first, they hesitate, feeling Ross should be there to share the moment, then decide that after three marriages, Ross can afford to miss one engagement celebration. The end credits play while Monica and Chandler slow dance to Eric Clapton's \\"Wonderful Tonight\\". Production According to the producers' DVD commentary for this episode, the original plot for Ross was to have Elizabeth announce that she was pregnant, ultimately resolving at the end of the following season when it would be revealed that Ross was not the father of the baby. This idea was ultimately rejected by the producers since it would be investing a lot of time in a secondary character without a payoff. It would have also have been difficult to use the cliffhanger for Rachel's pregnancy.Friends Season 6 DVD audio commentary. Sources suggest that David Schwimmer was actually out of the country filming Band of Brothers when the final scenes of the episode were filmed, hence why Ross is not there when the friends hug Monica and Chandler on hearing their announcement. The producers decided to end the episode on a romantic moment rather than the usual joke. They also took care over the script before approaching Selleck to return as Richard, as the actor would only return if it seemed feasible. The episode very nearly served as the series finale, given that NBC and Warner Bros. were in negotiations over the show's future up until four days before the episode aired. The series' stars demanded $750,000 salary for each actor per episode and agreed to a contract for two additional seasons, an agreement that later stretched into a further two seasons at $1 million salary for each of the stars.Phil Rosenthal. \\"No turning back: These six threatened to leave us many times over the decade, but now it's their day, their week, their month -- heck, even their year,\\" Chicago Sun-Times, May 6, 2004 Reception Entertainment Weekly listed Chandler and Monica's proposal scene in their \\"26 Great 'I Love You's\\". =Awards and nominations= * Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Multi-Camera Picture Editing for a Series (nominated) Associated Press. \\"'Sopranos,' 'West Wing' lead Emmy nods,\\" The Dallas Morning News, July 23, 2000, page 6C.

He wrestled for Stampede Wrestling for decades as Archie \\"The Stomper\\" Gouldie, with the nickname coming from the wrestler's reputation of \\"stomping\\" on his opponents, when they were down, with his black cowboy boots. He was also known by the ring name The Mongolian Stomper. Professional wrestling career =Central States Wrestling= Early in his career, Archie \\"The Stomper\\" Gouldie was a babyface (good guy) in the Central States territory. He won the NWA United States Heavyweight Championship (Central States Version) from Enrique Torres in St. Joseph on Dec. 20, 1963, losing it to Rocky Hamilton on Jan 31, 1964. He regained it on May 22, 1964, only to lose it to Sonny Myers June 12, 1964. He regained it yet again in 1965 from Sonny Myers, and dropped it to Bobby Shane in December in Waterloo, IA. Archie won his first Central States Heavyweight Title from Ron Reed in St.Joseph, MO. on June 4th, 1965, holding it for 30 days, dropping it to Sonny Myers on July 4, 1965, in Kansas City, KS. Gouldie won the title for the second time on June 8, 1972, from Black Angus Campbell in St. Joseph, MO., only to lose it to Harley Race on July 7, 1972, in Kansas City, KS. Archie also proved himself to be an accomplished tag team wrestler, winning the NWA North American Tag Team Championship eleven times. His first reign began May 1, 1962, with his last title run coming on Oct 14, 1972. The Stomper teamed up four times with The Viking, three times with Bob Geigel, twice with Rufus R. Jones, once with Danny Little Bear, and once with Bob Ellis for a total of approximately 238 days. =Stampede Wrestling= Gouldie held the North American heavyweight title a record 14 times between 1968 and 1984, quite a streak of longevity for that time frame. He was also the first champion, defeating former NWA World Heavyweight Champion Pat O'Connor in the tournament finals. Gouldie feuded with British mat technician Billy Robinson, among others, for the title. Although he wrestled as a heel during the majority of his Stampede tenure, Gouldie made a face turn late in 1983 after Bad News Allen turned against Gouldie and his storyline \\"son\\", Jeff, during a six-man tag team match and brutalized and injured Jeff (which led to Stampede TV host Ed Whalen to quit the company in protest); the attack led to a bloody feud which climaxed with Gouldie defeating Bad News for the Stampede North American title (his 14th, and what would be final, reign). Gouldie never used the Mongolian Stomper gimmick while wrestling in Stampede; instead, staying true to his roots, he went with the gimmick of a tough Alberta cowboy as just \\"The Stomper\\" from Carbon, Alberta. =Southeast Championship Wrestling= Gouldie achieved most of his US fame in this territory, based in Knoxville, Tennessee. He held the NWA Southeast Heavyweight Championship a record eleven times between 1976 and 1981, winning it for the last time against Jerry Stubbs and losing it to Jos LeDuc. He feuded with Robert Fuller and Ronnie Garvin over the title. =Mid South Wrestling (Bill Watts)= Gouldie appeared very briefly in Mid South in late-1982, saving Skandor Akbar from an attack by Buck Robley. He only wrestled one or two matches before abruptly leaving the territory. =Smoky Mountain Wrestling= In 1992 Gouldie joined SMW, which, like Southeast, was based in Knoxville, Tennessee. At this point in his career, the Stomper was considered a babyface, teaming with former rival Ronnie Garvin in his feud with Paul Orndorff and feuding with Kevin Sullivan's latest incarnation of evil wrestlers.

Computer City was a supercenter concept featuring name-brand and private label computers, software and related products; at the height of its success the company had over 100 locations in the United States and five in Europe. History In 1981, the original Computer City was founded by Leonard and Myrna Simon in Costa Mesa, California. Len Simon sat on the original Apple Retail Council while Myrna was in charge of HR. Within the first year, Computer City had added stores in Brea and Pasadena, CA and with the help of managers Mike Mostyn, Gordon Klatt and Greg Gadbois,Greg Gadbois stepped down as VP-sales Computer City expanded to San Diego, Beverly Hills, Encino, Cerritos, and Torrance CA. Computer City was the first independent Los Angeles computer retailers to offer the original IBM 5150 PC along with Sears and ComputerLand. Computer City was acquired in 1983 by Rick and Joe Inatome and now known as Inacomp became the second largest computer retailer in the US with sales over $500M / year in computer products. By 1985, market conditions in computer retailing had changed. As computers were less of a mystery to more people, profit margins began to drop. Retailers who offered business-to-business consultative services to sell computer systems could no longer afford expensive salespeople. Taking the name of the Los Angeles retailer they had purchased two years earlier, Rick, Vee, and Joe Inatome gave rise to the first big-box merchandising concept ‚Äì Computer City. With an investment from Mitsubishi, Joe leveraged his vendor relationships at Inacomp to bring IBM, Apple, and Compaq to their first big-box merchandised store, initially privately held by Inatome and Mitsubishi. =Innovative retail practices= Computer City innovated a number of retail concepts that are now common retail practices. First begun at the Costa Mesa Incomp, the store hosted a professional service bureau called The Graphic Zone, that provided film and graphic services for the nascent desktop publishing industry, the store operated a cafe which served coffee and sandwiches to prolong shopping visits, and the store featured a product training center that included an Electrosonic Video Wall, with 16 32\\" monitors which served as digital signage for the store, when training wasn't in session. The store also made heavy use of vendor managed inventory, vendor shops, and CO-OP funded retail displays which are now common practice throughout the retail industry. =Acquisition by Tandy= Ultimately, Tandy bought the Computer City concept and store in 1991 and launched Computer City as a national chain (as well as Incredible Universe). Alan Bush, a Radio Shack executive, was named president of the new company. The stores resembled CompUSA's super center concepts, but lacked the financial backing CompUSA had. CompUSA, having a larger market share, bought the company, and in the process, shut down one of its smaller competitors. Two types of store models existed, one was a full size store with an in house Tandy Repair Center similar to a freestanding Tandy Repair Center (later RadioShack Service Centers) that continued to serve RadioShack stores. These stores had sub departments for business sales that would just handle business orders for companies and other organizations, they also offered in store customer training classes for software such as Microsoft Excel, Word, and Powerpoint. Some of these locations were as big as some Best Buy Stores. They also operated Computer City Express stores which had no service center in them, nor did they offer classes. They were closer in size to a large RadioShack store. Computer City was recognized as the 2nd fastest retailer to hit $1 Billion in sales in 1995 and in 1996 was recognized as the 2nd fastest retailer to hit $2 Billion in sales. (Sam's Club was the fastest retailer to hit $1 Billion.) Alan Bush and Jim Hamilton Vice President GMM (known as the \\"Father of Computer Retailing), were the strategists behind the rapid growth and success. In its Westbury/Garden City New York location, Computer City opened right next to its main competitor CompUSA. In King Of Prussia, PA, Computer City was directly across the street from CompUSA, and was in plain sight from CompUSA's main entrance. However, Computer City's entrance opened toward an off-street parking lot. As both Computer City and Tandy's other venture Incredible Universe were both having financial issues, the computer departments of Incredible Universe were changed to Computer City. The Westbury, NY Incredible Universe was also within 3 miles of the above- mentioned CompUSA and Computer City. This may have hurt both of these Tandy divisions. One hallmark of Computer City's retail concept is that the store operated much like a grocery store; customers could not only browse, but select and purchase almost all merchandise without the assistance of a salesperson. Furthermore, until mid-1996, the floor staff did not have revenue quotas and were not paid on commission, though bonuses were applied for selling either the extended warranty Computer City Service Plan (CCSP) or in- store training classes. In retrospect, this model was seen as creating a competitive disadvantage, as computers were still new to many customers in those days and a lack of qualified and knowledgeable salespeople, who had no incentive to self-improve, led to frustrated customers and high return rates. =Acquisition by CompUSA= On June 22, 1998, CompUSA announced that it was purchasing the Computer City chain for US$275 million.CompUSA to buy Computer City Upon completion of the takeover in September 1998, CompUSA shuttered fifty of the stores outright, and transitioned the remainders into CompUSA locations.Computer City shuts some stores In some states, warranties on items that had been purchased at Computer City were taken over by CompUSA, in other states they were taken over by Radio Shack. In Canada, Computer City Canada stores were sold from CompUSA to Future Shop of whom in the end liquidated all Canadian Computer City locations. Current uses of the name There was an active store in Bermuda by the same name; it was independently founded in January 2000 and closed in December 2012. It was never related to the US or Canadian stores.http://www.computercity.bm Also the web address http://computercity.com/ is running but has no relation to the US or Canadian stores.

It is found to the north of Chapeltown and is served by a number of buses; the nearest rail station is in Chapeltown 1 mile away. The suburb falls within the West Ecclesfield ward of the city Council. High Green has expanded rapidly to fill its green belt limits within the last 20 years, now merging building-wise with Chapeltown. The scenery of the Wharncliffe Crags is not far from High Green, and Westwood Country Park is within easy reach. The dam set in the country park is a favourite place for fishermen, runners, walkers and local children. The older, council-owned houses were part refurbished about 10 years ago, and later modernised to the council decent homes programme. The centre of High Green has a Post Office that has recently moved to the local shop, a local pub, a dentist, two doctors' practices and a few shops along the main street, Wortley Road. High Green has 5 primary schools: 4 mainstream schools (Angram Bank Primary, High Green Primary, Greengate Lane Primary and St. Mary's Primary) and 1 non- maintained special school, Paces School formerly High Green Secondary, for both primary and secondary age children. High Green does not have a mainstream secondary school; pupils instead usually go to Ecclesfield School, approximately 2 miles away in the Ecclesfield suburb. Other mainstream secondary schools that children in the area commonly got to are Stocksbridge or Notre Dame. Since 1997, High Green has been the home of Paces, a registered charity managing services for children and young people with cerebral palsy and their families, including Paces School which uses the Conductive education approach. The school is at the heart of Paces Campus, a regular local community centre that offers a range of child-care, IT, training, sports, arts and health activities open to all. Paces Campus is an inclusive community centre and business hub which specialises in enterprise development, children, disabilities, sports and arts. The Campus serves the local communities of Chapeltown, High Green and the wider north Sheffield, south Barnsley and north-west Rotherham areas. People come here to meet others, play sport and other leisure activities, learn and to do business. The Campus offers a range of activities from childcare, after school clubs, art sessions, sports centre groups, computer sales and recycling, training including ICT and micro business incubation. It also houses a specialist resource for children with disabilities (A non maintained special school for children with physical and sensory disabilities registered with the Department for Children, Schools and Families) and programmes for adults with disabilities. High Green has two main estates based around their equally named parks. Mortomley Park and Angram Bank Recreation Park. Mortomley has a Tenant & Resident Association that is based within Newgate Close Sheltered Housing. Angram Bank also has its own group; Angram Bank Community Development, based within the Angram Bank Pavilion running a weekly Youth Club and Lunch Club. Also within the Pavilion is a Mother & Toddler group that runs each Thursday morning. There was a church group that has since failed after the leader left through ill health. As one of the poorest estates in the country Angram Bank has some dedicated volunteers trying to improve the lives of the community. The popular band Arctic Monkeys comes from High Green. Their frontman Alex Turner usually presents the band in concert saying, \\"We are the Arctic Monkeys from High Green, Sheffield!\\" Their song \\"Red Light Indicates Doors Are Secured\\" includes the lyrics, \\"I said, it's High Green, mate / Via Hillsborough, please!\\" At the end of another song, \\"All My Own Stunts,\\" Matt Helders shouts \\"Because I'm from High Green, I'm from High Green!\\" The band's drumhead features the numbers 0114, the dialing code for Sheffield. High Green hit the national headlines over Christmas 2012 when the organist at St. Saviour's parish church was murdered on his way to midnight communion on Christmas Eve. Two men were later convicted and jailed for the attack. , and more recently when the Parish Priest at St Mary's Church received a letter threatening to petrol bomb services and stab congregation members one by one.

It was built for use in the 2007 Cricket World Cup where it hosted Super 8 matches. The stadium usually caters for 10,000 people, but temporary seating doubled its capacity for the 2007 World Cup. The stadium is named after former West Indies cricket captain Viv Richards. Location The stadium is about 10‚Äì20 minutes' drive from the capital city, St. John's, and the country's international airport. The venue cost approximately US$60 million to build, with the majority of the funds coming from a Chinese Government grant. The first Test match staged on the ground began on 30 May 2008 when the West Indies hosted Australia, with the match ending in a draw. Facilities The stadium constitutes two main stands: the Northern Stand and the five story South Stand. In 2008, the roof of the South Stand was damaged by high winds. Other facilities include a practice pitch for the various cricket teams, training infrastructure and a media centre. Sir Viv Richards Stadium is one of the few state-of-the-art venues that encompass underground passageways for the cricket teams to move about in. Prior to the start of the first Test against England on 13 April 2015, the north and south ends were renamed for two former West Indies cricketers, Sir Curtly Ambrose and Sir Andy Roberts.  Outfield controversy  The ground's second Test match began against England on 13 February 2009, but the match was abandoned after just ten balls due to the outfield's dangerous condition. The groundstaff had applied an extra layer of sand after recent heavy rain, and again after a brief shower, which resulted in West Indies bowlers Jerome Taylor and Fidel Edwards being unable to gain a foothold when running in. The sandy nature of the outfield had earnt the ground the nickname of 'Antigua's 366th beach' in the buildup to the game. The abandonment caused great embarrassment for West Indies cricket, with inquiries held by the WICB and the ICC. The ICC ordered that the ground be suspended from staging all international matches for twelve months, and an official warning was issued to the WICB.

There is no surviving copy of the treaty or the proceedings. Historians are forced to rely on a summary by Jeremy Belknap in his 1784 History of New Hampshire Proceedings of the Massachusetts Historical Society, 13(1873‚Äì5):341; Jeremy Belknap, The History of New-Hampshire (Philadelphia: Robert Aitken, 1784), 1:158‚Äì9 Background Most of Maine's English settlers were scattered among in settlements strung out along the coast or lower rivers. The Wabanaki north and east of the Kennebec River formed alliances with the French through the fur trade. By 1670 Indian frustration with trade abuses, land encroachments, rum dealing, and free- roaming English livestock in their cornfields had increased. History In 1678 the provincial government of New York, which controlled Maine between 1677 and 1686, signed the Treaty of Casco.\\"Settlement and Strife\\", Maine Historical Society The treaty sought to re-establish the friendly relations between the Indians and settlers that had characterized the northern settlements previous to the outbreak of King Philip's War in 1675. Based on the terms of the accord, all captives were to be surrendered without ransom. The treaty also recognized English property rights, but stipulated that the English should give the Indians one peck of corn annually for each family settled on Indian lands, with the exception of Maj. Phillips of Saco, a great proprietor, who was required to give a bushel for each Native American family. This land use tax symbolized continuing Abenaki sovereignty over Maine. The treaty also provided for closer government regulation of the fur trade.Maine Historical Society, Maine History Online, \\"1668-1674: Settlement and Strife\\", p. 3 of 4, https://www.mainememory.net/sitebuilder/site/897/page/1308/display?page=3 The Pokanoket tribe was prevented from signing the Treaty by an English bounty placed on the lives of every Pokanoket over the age 14. As a result of the bounty, the Pokanokets fled, many were executed or forced to sign contracts of indentured servitude, and the survivors went into hiding, identifying themselves by using the general term Wampanoag, which included dozens of tribes. Some original Pokanokets fled North to continue their fight against the colonists. Despite the bounty, many attended church services to gather and continue to foster their culture and Royal Line, which continues until the present day. Some argue that the Treaty of Casco included the Pokanoket Tribe in absentia, drawing on other landmark court rulings which rely on statutes concerning the \\"operation of law\\".

Settlers placed nets across the Saco River, preventing fish from migrating upriver to the Wabanaki villages, and livestock ruined Indian corn.

Unfortunately, the doctor told Smith that he had sustained a neck injury and found 3 bulging spinal disc and spinal cord damage at his C3/C4. In April 2012 Smith had an Anterior Cervical Discectomy and Fusion. Four months after surgery, Smith fully recovered from the neck fusion. Doctors said he could go back to physical training and exercise, but he could never play football again because he was a lineman and would put himself at too much risk of permanently damaging his spinal cord and cause Tetraplegia (Paralysis from the neck down). Smith informed the NFL about his retirement and is no longer a player for the league.

It will be used mostly for cricket matches. It is located in southern Trinidad, just outside the city of San Fernando, beside the Sir Solomon Hochoy Highway, about two kilometres southeast of Trinidad and Tobago's former cricket ground at Guaracara Park, Pointe-a-Pierre. Built to hold 15,000 people in a mix of fixed seating and grass banks it is named after Brian Lara, who until 17 October 2008 was the all-time leading run scorer in Test cricket, until he was surpassed by Sachin Tendulkar. It was initially planned to host warm-up matches during the 2007 Cricket World Cup and serve as a cricket academy after the tournament. However when it became apparent that the facility would not be completed in time for the tournament the warm-up matches were instead hosted at the Frank Worrell Field at UWI St Augustine. The Caribbean Premier League chose the Brian Lara Cricket Academy as the host for the final matches of the 2017 tournament, the first high-profile matches at the ground.http://www.cplt20.com/fixtures Subsequent to this the Government of Trinidad and Tobago further purchased the rights to hold the CPL finals from 2018 through to 2020 at the Brian Lara Cricket Academy.https://www.cnc3.co.tt/press-release/tt-secures-cpl-finals- next-three-years  Development  The Brian Lara Cricket Academy was commissioned in 2004 by the Government of Trinidad and Tobago through the state company UDeCOTT to provide a high class sporting venue for the 2007 Cricket World Cup.http://udecott.com/projects/brian-lara-cricket-academy/ With Trinidad and Tobago receiving the Brown Package of matches and the use of the Queens Park Oval as the primary venue, the Brian Lara facility was earmarked to host warm-up matches. To be ready for the Cricket World Cup the facility had to be completed by February 2007 and game ready by March 2007. Major design and construction problems kept pushing back the completion date as well as increasing the construction cost. Once it became apparent it would not be ready for the World Cup, matches were shifted to the grounds at UWI. The delays and costs have made the complex one of the more controversial infrastructure projects undertaken in Trinidad and Tobago. The initial cost was estimated to be TT$257 million, but with the cost overruns and the increase in prices of materials, in 2009 the estimated costs were TT$700 million and by the time the facility was eventually opened in 2017 the costs had exceeded TT$1billion. Other sports View across the stands in the Brian Lara Stadium The Brian Lara Cricket Academy was meant to be a component of a larger complex situated on of farm land in Tarouba, with a cost of TT$1.1 billion. It was designed by Hellmuth, Obata + Kassabaum, a US architectural firm. The complex was proposed to consist of: * An aquatic centre with Olympic standard pools. This project was eventually moved and completed at Couva at the Ato Boldon Stadium.http://www.msya.gov.tt/sport/the-ministry/mega- projects/127-national-aquatic-centre * Olympic-sized velodrome, which was also constructed at the Ato Boldon Stadium. * Indoor gymnasium. * School for training of athletes. * A large car park, new roads and other infrastructure works. The completed stadium serves as a training facility for cricketers. It has four indoor cricket training pitches with computerised biometric technology to measure an athlete‚Äôs performance, including two full-length run- up pitches for fast bowlers. Spectators have an unhindered view from every area of the stadium, including the concessionaires area. It also has areas specifically designed for the print, radio and television media. The facility may also include a hotel in the future. It has been estimated to cost an additional TT$190 million. Cricket matches The first major cricket matches at the ground were several of the matches of the Caribbean Premier League in September 2017, including the final. The first first-class match was held in November 2017: in 2017-18 and 2018-19 the Trinidad and Tobago team played some of its home matches in the Regional Four Day Competition there, and some at Queen's Park Oval in Port of Spain.

War was already going on in Europe between England and France (see Queen Anne's War) and the eastern Indians were historically allies of New France, and had a close relationship with the French Jesuits. Governor Dudley appointed a meeting of the several chiefs and their tribes to confer with him and his councilors to reconcile whatever differences had arisen since the last treaty. They met in New Casco, Maine (present day Falmouth, Maine), June 20, 1703.William Willis, The History of Portland(Portland, 1831), 2:6 The Indians made the customary professions of peace, disavowing any conspiracy with the French to exterminate the English. They then presented the governor with a belt of wampum and ended the ceremony with an exchange of volleys. The Treaty caused concern for the French, as it left them vulnerable in Acadia. Accordingly, Jacques-Fran√ßois de Monbeton de Brouillan, Governor of Acadia, urged the Governor of New France, Philippe de Rigaud, Marquis de Vaudreuil, to send a force to instigate hostilities between the Native Tribes and New England. Vaudreuil was equally concerned about losing control of the Kennebec-Chaudiere river system, which led to Quebec City. He raised a force of Canadians and Iroquois. In August 1703, this force, accompanied by a band of Abenakis, raided the New England frontier from Casco to Wells, killing or taking prisoner some 160 people. Further attacks were made during the autumn. The raids came as a complete surprise to New England. Governor Dudley responded by declaring war on the Abenakis, and offering ¬£40 in scalp money. W.E.

At that time many houses were built on Boars Hill, and the new residents planted trees and erected fences and walls; within a few decades they had hidden the celebrated views from all but a few places. Churches =Church of England= Boars Hill does not have its own Church of England parish church. As it straddles two parishes the respective parts of Boars Hill are served by St. Peters, Wootton and St. Leonard's, Sunningwell. =Roman Catholic= St. Thomas More Roman Catholic chapel in Boars Hill is part of the Roman Catholic parish of North Hinksey. Notable residents =Poets= The first poet to leave a record of a visit to the hill was Arthur Hugh Clough. In his diary for 1841, edited by Anthony Kenny, he describes how a walk across the hill inspired the ninth of his 'Blank misgivings of a creature moving about in worlds not realized'; however, he was concerned over his family's financial straits and his impending final exams, and he found the barrenness of the scene under a grey February sky depressing. When Matthew Arnold came up to Oxford later in 1841, Clough introduced him to Boars Hill, which later provided the inspiration and setting for two of his best-known poems, The Scholar Gipsy (1853) and Thyrsis (1866), the latter written in memory of Clough. The famous phrase in the latter \\"the dreaming spires\\" encouraged people to visit the hill and settle there. Three prominent poets lived on the hill, the first being Margaret Louisa Woods in the 1880s. She was followed by Robert Bridges and John Masefield, successive Poets Laureate. For a couple of years after the First World War, they were joined by three of the war poets: Robert Graves - Masefield's tenant - and Edmund Blunden, both future Oxford Professors of Poetry (as Arnold had been) and (for a few months) Robert Nichols. Bridges' daughter, the poet Elizabeth Daryush, continued to live on the hill until her death in 1977. Robert Bridges lived at Chilswell House, which was purchased circa 1963 by the Carmelite order for use as a priory and retreat. =Other notable residents= The hill was also the home of Gilbert Murray, famous for his verse translations of classical Greek drama, and later the classicist Leighton Durham Reynolds, Emeritus Professor of Classical Languages and Literature, until his death in 1999.https://www.theguardian.com/news/2000/jan/18/guardianobituaries3 Other notable residents were the sculptor Oscar Nemon who fled from Nazi rule in Vienna in 1938 and the archaeologist Sir Arthur Evans who lived on Boars Hill from 1894 until his death in 1941. His house, 'Youlbury', notable for its Minoan decoration, has since been burnt down (as were those of Margaret Woods, Robert Bridges and Gilbert Murray). Herbert Edward Douglas Blakiston, for many years President of Trinity College, Oxford, and Vice-Chancellor of the University of Oxford, lived in Boar's Hill from his retirement in 1938 until his death in 1942, after he was struck by a car while walking in Boar's Hill.Hopkins (2005), p.382 The political scientist and public servant W. G. S. Adams lived there, at a house called Powder Hill, and entertained Horace Plunkett, Sir William Beveridge, Gilbert Murray, John Masefield and Robert Bridges.Margaret Digby, Horace Plunkett, An Anglo-American Irishman, Oxford: Basil Blackwell, 1949, p. 258. The composer Lennox Berkeley was born in Sunningwell Plains, Boar‚Äôs Hill, in 1903.https://www.lennoxberkeley.org.uk/timeline.php Sites Remains of Yatscombe Hall in January 2004 Arthur Evans had Jarn Mound built (by hand), built to create a viewpoint from which to see the famous vistas that had been hidden by development. The surrounding trees have continued to grow taller, and the views are again obscured. Evans left most of his estate to the Boy Scouts and Youlbury Camp is still available for their use. Several sites on Boars Hill, including Jarn Mound, Matthew Arnold Field and land on the north side of the hill with views of the \\"dreaming spires\\" of Oxford, are now owned by the Oxford Preservation Trust.Oxford Preservation Trust From 1933 to 1975 Boars Hill was the home of Ripon Hall. When Ripon Hall moved to Cuddesdon, the site became known as Foxcombe Hall, and was the regional headquarters of the Open University. In 2016 the site was purchased by Peking University. From 1955 to the mid-1970s, Boar's Hill was home to Plater College.Joseph Kirwin Obituary Oxford Mail 31 March 2005. From 1976 to 1996, Warnborough College, occupied the former Plater College facilities, the Bishop's palace of the Diocese of Oxford, and Yatscombe Hall, having moved from Warnborough Road in North Oxford. The college attracted controversy due to alleged links to Oxford University and was eventually sued with the site repossessed.King, Tim (1996-10-25). Oxford College Sued in US is Repossessed. The Daily Telegraph (UK) Soon after the repossession squatters moved in and the site of the former Bishop's palace and Yatscombe Hall has been subject to numerous planning disputes ever since. Yatscombe Hall was destroyed by fire in December 2003 and all the buildings on the site were demolished and a retirement village was planned. However eventually a development of a four large country homes was built on the site by Millgate Homes.Boar's Hill , Millgate Homes, United Kingdom. Brideshead Revisited Boars Hill is twice mentioned in the 1945 novel Brideshead Revisited by Evelyn Waugh (1903‚Äì1966).

A casquette girl () but also known historically as a casket girl or a Pelican girl, was a woman brought from France to the French colonies of Louisiana to marry.See Dureau, Lorena. The Last Casquette Girl, 1981, Pinnacle Books The name derives from the small chests, known as casquettes, in which they carried their clothes.Higginbotham, Jay. Old Mobile: Fort Louis de la Louisiane, 1702-1711, pp.106‚Äì07. Museum of the City of Mobile, 1977. . History The French policy of sending young women orphans known as King's Daughters () to their colonies for marriage custom goes back to the 17th- century. Young women were sent to Canada, Louisiana and the French West Indies. Normally women were supplied to the colonists by raking the streets of Paris for undesirables, or by emptying the houses of correction. France also sent women convicted along with their debtor husbands, and in 1719, deported 209 women felons \\"who were of a character to be sent to the French settlement in Louisiana.\\"Katy F. Morlas, \\"La Madame et la Mademoiselle,\\" graduate thesis in history, Louisiana State University and Agricultural and Mechanical College, 2003. The women sent to the West Indies were often from poor houses in France, but reputed to be former prostitutes from La Salp√™tri√®re. In 1713 and again in 1743, the authorities in Saint-Domingue complained that Paris sent the settlers unsuitable former prostitutes as wives, and the practice was discontinued in the mid 18th-century.Trevor Burnard, John Garrigus: The Plantation Machine: Atlantic Capitalism in French Saint-Domingue The casquette girls, however, were conspicuous by reason of their virtue. They were recruited from church charitable institutions (usually orphanages and convents) and although poor, were guaranteed to be virgins.Clark, Emily. Masterless Mistresses: The New Orleans Ursulines and the Development of a New World Society, 1727‚Äì1834, pp. 12‚Äì23. Chapel Hill: The University of North Carolina Press, 2007. . It later became a matter of pride in Louisiana to show descent from them. The first casquette girls reached Mobile, Alabama in 1704, Biloxi, Mississippi in 1719, and New Orleans in 1728.Thomason, Michael. Mobile : the new history of Alabama's first city, pages 20-21. Tuscaloosa : University of Alabama Press, 2001. Historian Joan Martin maintains that there is little documentation that casket girls, considered among the ancestors of white French Creoles, were sent to Louisiana. Dr. Marcia Zug argues that there was, in fact, no evidence to support the fact that these women existed as such.https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1804024 The Ursuline order of nuns supposedly chaperoned the casket girls until they married, but the order has denied this. Martin suggests this was a myth, and that interracial relationships occurred from the beginning of the encounter among Europeans, Native Americans and Africans. She also writes that some Creole families who today identify as white had ancestors during the colonial period who were African or multiracial, and whose descendants married white over generations.Joan M.

He was an immigrant from the British colony of Jamaica in the West Indies and is listed in the first [city directory of 1786. He is known for his leadership in developing Freemasonry organizations in New York, Virginia and South Carolina. Freemasonry Hyman Isaac Long was born to a Jewish family in Jamaica, a British colony in the West Indies. They were likely of Sephardic Jewish ancestry, as this community had been active in London. A number had emigrated to the British colonies in the New World along with other English colonists. In Jamaica, Long studied medicine and qualified as a physician. By 1786 Long had emigrated to New York City in the recently independent United States. He was listed that year in the first city directory, as a physician. He also became involved in Freemasonry, and returned to Jamaica for some events and rites, where the organization was more developed. At Kingston, Jamaica, on 11 January 1795, Long was appointed as a Deputy Inspector General (DIG) of the Grand Consistory of the twenty-five degree \\"Rite of the Royal Secret,\\" a governing body of high \\"√âcossais\\" degrees of Freemasonry, and a predecessor of the Scottish Rite. This appointment was made by Moses Cohen.Baynard, Samuel Harrison, Jr. History of the Supreme Council, 33¬∞, Ancient Accepted Scottish Rite of Freemasonry, Northern Masonic Jurisdiction of the U.S.A. and its Antecedents, 2 vols.

After returning to the United States, Long continued to work on developing membership in the Masons. On 12 November 1796 in Charleston, South Carolina, Long elevated eight French Masons of the city to the rank of Deputy Inspector General. These men were colonial refugees from the slave rebellion in the French colony of Saint-Domingue (now Haiti). Among them were Alexandre Francois Auguste de Grasse, known as Comte de Grasse- Tilly, and his father-in-law, Jean-Baptiste de La Hogue.

She reveals that she hasn't registered for classes because she hopes to travel to Europe with her friend Misty. Tony discusses the problem with Dr. Melfi, who recommends a psychologist, Dr. Wendy Kobler, specializing in adolescents. Kobler encourages Meadow's plans. This prompts a protracted family argument where Meadow confronts Tony with the truth about his profession; Tony claims that he did everything he could to save Jackie. She leaves the house and her parents are afraid she has left the country, but she has returned to her classes at Columbia University. Carmela begins flirting with Furio as he makes his morning visits to pick up Tony. Ralphie's and Janice's relationship continues, despite Tony's disapproval. Christopher is appointed acting capo of Paulie's crew; Patsy resents this, having been a made man longer than Chris. Silvio suspects that Chris is starting to usurp his place in Tony's inner circle. Chris visits the construction site where crew members have no-work jobs. There are some valuable fiber optic cables; Chris indicates to Patsy that they can be removed. Tony rebukes Chris for this, angry because the thefts might bring unwanted attention to their involvement there. Despite Tony's orders, Silvio and Patsy then agree to steal floor tiles from the site. Jack Massarone complains to Tony; Silvio deflects Tony's anger. An infuriated Chris drives to the site and has a violent confrontation with Patsy. At a party, with all the crew present, Ralphie makes an off-color joke about Johnny's wife Ginny. Visiting Paulie in prison, Little Paulie repeats the joke, laughing. Paulie doesn't laugh. Adriana now treats Danielle as her close friend and confidante. One evening at Adriana's club Chris, high on cocaine, is sitting on a sofa with the two women. As he kisses Adriana, he puts a hand on Danielle's thigh. Adriana is furious; he claims Danielle took the initiative. Adriana chooses to believe him and tells Danielle she will never see her again. The FBI decides to bring Adriana in and reveal Danielle's true identity as Agent Ciccerone. She is taken to meet with Chief Frank Cubitoso who threatens her with long imprisonment for drug possession, or perhaps punishment by Tony Soprano, if she does not co-operate. Adriana vomits all over herself, the table, and the agents. Title reference * The title refers to the way the mob assigns paid jobs at a construction site to workers who never have to show up but continue to be paid. * The phrase, used by airlines, also alludes to Meadow's decision not to fly to Europe.

In \\"...To Save Us All From Satan's Power\\", Paulie tells Tony that Tommy Angeletti, a contractor for Ralphie's Esplanade Project, owes him $100,000 from betting on college basketball. Since Ralphie held out Angeletti for more money, he is unable to pay back his debt. Paulie requests that Tony give him the jobs as compensation. *When Chris and Patsy get into a fight at the construction site, Chris warns Patsy that he didn't forget about his sniffing Adriana's underwear. Patsy responds that it wasn't him. This is a reference to the incident in \\"Second Opinion\\", wherein Paulie and Patsy barge into Chris and Adriana's apartment demanding their cut of Chris' score of designer shoes.

He was born in Callow End, Worcestershire, and was educated at Eton and New College, Oxford. He played in a trial match for Oxford University but did not appear in any first-class games for the team. In the 1890s, Bromley- Martin was Honorary Secretary of Worcestershire as well as playing for the club in the Minor Counties Championship, a title Worcestershire won (singly or jointly) every year between 1895 and 1898. In 1899 the county was granted first-class status, and Bromley-Martin played nine times for them that year, his best bowling figures (and indeed the best of his first-class career) being the 4-33 he took against Yorkshire in Worcestershire's very first County Championship game. Bromley-Martin played three games in 1900, one for Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC), but made no further first-class appearances thereafter. His brother Granville also played for Worcestershire, whilst his nephew Douglas Holland-Martin made two first-class appearances for the Royal Navy in 1928. Bromley-Martin was commissioned in the Worcestershire Yeomanry in 1891 but resigned his commission in 1897 after being promoted to Lieutenant. He was a Deputy Lieutenant for the county of Worcestershire from 1896. At the outbreak of World War I he returned to the Army with the temporary rank of Major, later confirmed as a substantive rank. After the war he resigned his commission again and retained the rank of Major. He died in Walton, Radnorshire, Wales, at the age of 79.

His rank is commanding officer. His ethnicity is African-American. Fictional character biography Curtis Elkins was a Guardsman at the Vault a prison for super powered criminals. While there Curtis befriended Hugh Taylor, a new guardsman fresh out of the army. Curtis left the Vault sometime after Hugh was murdered by Venom during an escape. After that Curtis and a few of his fellow Guardsmen joined The Jury, an agency organized by General Orwell Taylor. Their purpose was to track down and destroy Venom for his part in killing Hugh Taylor, Orwell's eldest son. To that end many of them were armed with sonic and fire generating weapons which the alien symbiote was vulnerable to. After Orwell was arrested for his part in the Arachnis Project, the Jury was reformed by his younger son Maxwell to fit the principles of civil rights and the legal court system. It was in fact a change done in accordance with Curtis' personal ideology of law and order. At a final fight with Hybrid, he was seriously injured, not only by physical damage, but also by mental contact with the symbiotes. Later Sentry and the other members of the Jury would be led by U.S. Agent and financed by Edwin Cord. The Jury was sent after the Thunderbolts but failed. Almost all of his later team members were his colleagues from the Vault, either those involved in the riot, or those involved in the Guardsmen at other times.

The band consists of Matt Friction (lead vocals, guitar), JoCo (bass), Joey B-Side (drums), and Young James (guitar). Matt Friction and original drummer Bob Ferrari recruited Jon Decious (bass) and released their first EP, The Pink Spiders Are Taking Over!, in 2004. The group toured around the Nashville area and an independent label released their debut album, Hot Pink, in 2005. The Pink Spiders performed at The Viper Room in West Hollywood on March 2, 2005, after which they were signed by Geffen Records. Their major- label debut, Teenage Graffiti was produced by Ric Ocasek and released in 2006. Promotion and the single \\"Little Razorblade\\" landed Teenage Graffiti on the Billboard 200. The group also made several television appearances and played at the Vans Warped Tour. The relationship between the group and Geffen faltered during the making of their album, Sweat It Out and disagreements led Decious and Ferrari to leave the band shortly after the album's release. Sweat It Out was released through Adrenaline Music and Friction's Mean Buzz Records in September 2008. The Pink Spiders went on hiatus in 2009 and all three members pursued other musical projects. Friction, Decious, and Ferrari eventually reunited and performed at The Viper Room in June 2010; Friction officially announced their return. The group released a two-track single and completed the \\"2 Legit 2 Quit Tour\\" in 2011. In August 2016, the band performed a sold-out show at the Mercy Lounge in Nashville, TN to celebrate the ten year anniversary of their Geffen Records release \\"Teenage Graffiti\\". A fourth full-length LP \\"Mutations\\" was released on July 31, 2018 followed by several US headlining tours. History =Creating the group, touring, and finding a label (2003‚Äì2004)= In 2003, Matthew Bell (known as \\"Matt Friction\\") led the Nashville quartet, Silent Friction, and performed around the Nashville area. He occasionally filled in on guitar for Oliver's Army, where Robert William Fort V (known as \\"Bob Ferrari\\") played drums. Friction and Ferrari decided to make music together. They recruited Jon Decious on bass and a second guitarist, Jamie Mechan. Mechan was eventually dismissed from the group. The trio contemplated several names, including: \\"The Pink Tigers\\" and \\"The Pink Diablos\\". They settled on \\"The Pink Spiders\\". The Pink Spiders recorded their first EP three weeks later. According to Ferrari, the record can be described as \\"bubblegum\\" music. He said: \\"We didn't try to sound like anyone. We just stole from everyone. That's what good artists do in my opinion.\\" The Pink Spiders Are Taking Over! (2004) was influenced by The Ramones, The Dead Boys, Buddy Holly, and the Bay City Rollers. The band's live debut consisted of a sold-out show in Nashville. Friction was a booking agent for The Muse and used that knowledge to find shows for the band. Meanwhile, Ferrari worked as a substitute teacher and the group donated plasma to fund their tours. The Pink Spiders also smoked a lot, a habit evident in promotional snapshots of the band. The group eventually befriended the band Sadaharu. It was through them that The Pink Spiders found a record label to release their debut studio album. The Pennsylvania-based and independent label, CI Records, released Hot Pink on January 4, 2005. The album has the trademarks of 1960s teen pop; it features the pop of a needle, crackles, and even hisses in between tracks. Influences from artists such as Elvis Costello, Nick Lowe, and Cheap Trick were apparent in Friction's songwriting. A vinyl version of the record was also released by Nashville's Spat! Records. The band toured nonstop, battling the chaos offered by life on the road; their trailer caught on fire in Buffalo and the band slept in the New York City Subway and the PATH when they had nowhere to sleep. =The Viper Room and a major-label contract (2005)= An old friend of Friction, Jason Hollis, lived in Los Angeles and told the group about Dan Catullo, a producer. Catullo arranged a private show for the band at West Hollywood's The Viper Room, where they would perform for numerous major labels. The group asked their friend, Dave Paulson (frontman of The Privates), to play guitar with them at the show and he accepted. The four slept over at a living unit located above Catullo's recording studio. Their performance on March 2, 2005 at The Viper Room was a success. \\"After the set, the curtains closed and Jordan Schur ran onstage. He was immediately stopped by security but just barreled through them,\\" said Friction of the experience. Ferrari said he opened his arms, exclaiming, \\"I gotta have this band!!!\\" Schur was the CEO of Geffen Records. Several weeks following the show, The Pink Spiders chose Geffen among 11 major-label offers. Walking into the offices of the recording company, the band was greeted by a pizza party. The contract was signed and according to Decious, the label took them to Six Flags. The three bandmates moved to Hollywood: Friction and Decious rented an apartment on Sunset Boulevard and Ferrari lodged at the Gershwin Hollywood Hotel. =Major-label debut (2006)= Geffen hired Ric Ocasek, frontman of The Cars, to produce the group's major label debut. The Pink Spiders traveled to New York to commence recording at Electric Lady Studios. The album was originally intended to be released in April 2006, but the date was pushed to August. The first single off the album was \\"Little Razorblade\\"; its music video was directed by Joseph Kahn. The video debuted on MTV's Total Request Live in April 2006 and peaked at number 12. The song received heavy rotation on the video network, Fuse, and reached the top spot on the Los Angeles-based radio station, KROQ. It was featured on the reality television series The Hills and was played in the clothing store Hollister Co. That year, The Pink Spiders performed on the Vans Warped Tour. The Pink Spiders toured with many popular bands such as Thirty Seconds to Mars, Good Charlotte, Yellowcard, Meg & Dia, All Time Low, Sugarcult, Damone, Kill Hannah, and Fall Out Boy in support of this album. The group was also listed as one of the \\"100 bands you need to know in 2006\\" by Alternative Press. Teenage Graffiti was released on August 1, 2006, and peaked at number 84 on the Billboard 200. The album was praised by critics for its power-pop sound and catchy melodies. =Third album and hiatus (2007‚Äì2009)= The Pink Spiders' third album was announced in late 2007 and was meant to be released in Spring 2008. Geffen hired Brendan O'Brien as the producer ‚Äî his experience included work for musicians such as Stone Temple Pilots, Pearl Jam, and Bruce Springsteen. Friction wrote 25 songs for the album, of which half were approved for release. The band bought a school bus which they intended to use for touring. On March 13, 2008, somewhere between Nashville and Atlanta, the bus burned to the ground along with their possessions. The group lost \\"clothes, laptops, passports, id's, ipods, cameras, receipts, cash, song lyrics, everything.\\" They welcomed any donations. They missed shows at Atlanta and New Orleans, but announced that they would finish the rest of the tour. The band encountered disagreements over money and direction leading Decious and Ferrari to announce they would no longer be members of The Pink Spiders. The two played a last show on June 18th, 2008 in Charlotte, North Carolina. They formed the country-rock group, Dixie Whiskey, in the following months. Friction recruited replacements for Decious and Ferrari ‚Äî Raf Cevallos on guitar, Joe Reilly on drums, and Ben Young on bass. The new line-up made its live debut at Cave 9 in Birmingham, Alabama several days later. The new Pink Spiders completed the Tapped Kegs, Spread Legs, & Fertilized Eggs tour. The tour-only exclusive, Subterranean EP, contained unreleased versions of \\"Teenage Graffiti\\" and \\"Knock Knock\\", \\"Gimme Chemicals\\" and \\"Sleeping On the Floor\\" from Sweat It Out, as well as the b-sides \\"Typical Danger\\" and \\"We Do It All The Time\\". That year, The Pink Spiders officially dissolved their contract with Geffen. After much deliberation, Sweat It Out was finally released on September 23, 2008 by Friction's own independent record label, Mean Buzz Records. In 2009, Friction announced an extended hiatus. He embarked on a variety of side projects, including Matt Friction & the Cheap Shots and The Dozen Dimes. =Return (2010‚Äìpresent)= In 2010, the group accepted an offer to play at the bar mitzvah of a fan who lived in Los Angeles. On June 20 they held a concert at The Viper Room and Friction announced their return. \\"We aren't at a place where it's [about] money,\\" said the lead singer in an interview with the Nashville Scene. He also announced that they had resolved their differences, but that Decious would be pursuing other interests ‚Äî Brandon Jazz assumed bassist duties. The Pink Spiders released \\"Cherry Chapstick b/w Sad Style\\", a two-track single, on March 21, 2011. That spring they completed the \\"2 Legit 2 Quit Tour\\". In 2011, The Pink Spiders appeared in the Hal Leonard music educational DVD, Learn To Rock Drums With Jason Hartless And Friends, performing \\"Gimme Chemicals\\" live in Detroit with guest drummer Jason Hartless. On August 6, 2016, the original lineup of Friction, Ferrari, and Decious reunited for a concert at the Mercy Lounge in Nashville to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the release of Teenage Graffiti. They were joined by Dave Paulson on guitar and Raf Cevallos on keyboards. On August 8, the band announced plans to release a new album, Mutations, in the summer of 2018. On May 30, 2017 The Pink Spiders released two new singles, \\"Black Dagger\\" and \\"Easier Than Ever\\" for pre-sale exclusively on vinyl via their website. On June 13, 2017 the band uploaded a new lyric video for \\"Easier Than Ever\\" on their YouTube account, announcing that an official music video for the song would be coming soon. In September 2017, The Pink Spiders announced a short 10 city Midwest/Northeast tour, titled the \\"Black Dagger Tour\\" starting December 13 and ending December 22, 2017. The tour was a success and ultimately helped the band immensely when they announced a Kickstarter campaign to fund Mutations in January 2018. The campaign exceeded its goal by over 30%. Once the Kickstarter campaign ended, the band began work at several studios in Nashville working on 11 songs slated to go on the upcoming LP, Mutations, released July 31, 2018. Throughout their time in the studio, the band has been posting teaser photos of the recording process across their social media pages from time to time. Television Appearances Between 2006 and 2008, The Pink Spiders appeared on MTV's Total Request Live, Discover and Download, and You Hear It First; as well as Fuse's Daily Download, Tattoo Stories, and Steven's Untitled Rock Show. In May 2008, the Pink Spiders played for a Sweet 16 featured in Episode 6 of the Fourth Season of Hell's Kitchen, Performing \\"Seventeen Candles\\".

Sold at morning markets in Malaysia  General description  The plant is usually 2 or 3 m in height and 2 cm in basal diameter, but may reach 5m in height and 8 cm in basal diameter. The shrub usually has a single stem at ground level, but it may branch on the lower stem. The stem bark is gray and nearly smooth with raised lenticels. The inner bark has a green layer over an ivory color (Little and others 1974). The plants examined by the author, growing on firm soil, had weak taproots and well-developed laterals. The roots are white. Foliage is confined to the growing twigs. The twigs are gray-green and covered with star-shaped hairs. The spines are short and slightly curved and vary from thick throughout the plant, including the leaf midrib, to entirely absent. The leaves are opposite or one per node, broadly ovate with the border entire or deeply lobed. The petioles are 1 to 6 cm long and the blades are 7 to 23 by 5 to 18 cm and covered with short hairs. The flowers are white, tubular with 5 pointed lobes, and grouped in corymbiform cymes. They are shed soon after opening. The fruits are berries that grow in clusters of tiny green spheres (ca. 1 cm in diameter) that look like green peas. They become yellow when fully ripe. They are thin-fleshed and contain numerous flat, round, brown seeds (Howard 1989, Liogier 1995, Little and others 1974). dried turkey berry Range Turkey berry apparently is native from Florida and southern Alabama through the West Indies and from Mexico through Central America and South America through Brazil (Little and others 1974). Because of its rapid spread as a weed in disturbed lands, it is difficult to tell which populations are native and which are introduced. Turkey berry has been introduced and naturalized throughout tropical Africa, Asia, Australia, and the Pacific Islands including Hawaii, Guam, and American Samoa (Pacific Island Ecosystems at Risk 2001). In Jamaica this berry is called susumba, or gully beans, and is usually cooked in a dish along with saltfish and ackee. It is believed to be full of iron (it does have a strong iron like taste when eaten) and is consumed when one is low in iron. Ecology In Puerto Rico, turkey berry grows in upland sites that receive from about 1000 to 4000 mm of annual precipitation. It also grows in riparian zones in drier areas. Turkey berry grows on all types of moist, fertile soil at elevations from near sea level to almost 1,000 m in Puerto Rico (Little and others 1974) and 2,000 m in Papua New Guinea (Pacific Island Ecosystems at Risk 2001). Given an equal start after disturbance, turkey berry quickly overtops most herbs, grasses, and other shrubs. It grows best in full sunlight and does well in light shade or shade for part of the day, but cannot survive under a closed forest canopy. Turkey berry single plants, groups, and thickets are most frequently seen on roadsides, vacant lots, brushy pastures, recently abandoned farmland, landslides, and river banks. It is considered invasive in New Caledonia, where it was likely introduced in 1900. Solanum torvum is a bushy, erect and spiny perennial plant The plant is usually 2 or 3 m in height and 2 cm in basal diameter, but may reach 5m in height and 8 cm in basal diameter. The shrub usually has a single stem at ground level, but it may branch on the lower stem. The stem bark is gray and nearly smooth with raised lenticels. Reproduction Flowering and fruiting is continuous after the shrubs reach about 1 to 1.5 m in height. Ripe fruits collected in Puerto Rico averaged 1.308 + 0.052 g. Air dry seeds from these fruits weighed an average of 0.00935 g or 1,070,000 seeds/kg. These seeds were sown on commercial potting mix and 60 percent germinated between 13 and 106 days following sowing. The seedlings are common in recently disturbed ground. Frugivorous birds eat the fruits and spread the seeds (Pacific Island Ecosystems at Risk 2001). Turkey berry can be propagated vegetatively by placing branch cuttings, with or without leaves, in a mist chamber for one month (Badola and others 1993). Growth and management Turkey berry grows about 0.75 to 1.5 m in height per year. The species is not long-lived; most plants live about 2 years. Physical control of the shrub may be done by grubbing out the plants; lopping will not kill them. They can be killed by translocated herbicides applied to the leaves or the cut stumps (Pacific Island Ecosystems at Risk 2001).

He was developed specifically for the 1964 television series The Addams Family, and is a regular supporting character in subsequent motion picture, television, and stage adaptations.  Character background Cousin Itt is a diminutive, hirsute being, his visible form composed entirely of floor-length hair, often accompanied by a bowler hat and sunglasses, and he speaks in high-pitched gibberish that is understood only by other family members. As he was created specifically for the television series, illustrations of the character by cartoonist Charles Addams followed the show's debut, first in a single-panel sketch showing Itt on the telephone (\\"This is It speaking\\"), and later in family-portrait artwork. (book cover) Appearances =Television= Cousin Itt is introduced in the television series as the cousin of family patriarch Gomez Addams. He is an occasional guest in the Addams' home, entering and exiting through the chimney, though he has his own quarters that are furnished in proportion to his size. The character's role in the series is his vainly attempting a multitude of professions such as an actor, a singer, a marriage counselor, and a zoo curator, while his physical appearance is the subject of one episode in which he begins losing his hair. Cousin Itt appeared in 19 total episodes of the original series and was played by Felix Silla, except for his last two appearances in which he was played by Roger Arroyo. Silla attended a casting call in Los Angeles and was given the role on the spot without having to audition. The character's heavy costume was first constructed with real hair but later changed to a fire-retardant synthetic, as smoking on the set was common and therefore presented a fire hazard. Silla's instructions were simply to walk around on the set, as Itt's voice (provided by sound engineer Tony Magro) was dubbed in post-production, but he often had difficulty seeing through the costume during shooting. The character appears with the other family members in a September 23, 1972 crossover episode of The New Scooby-Doo Movies, titled \\"Wednesday Is Missing\\". He was voiced by John Stephenson, who returned to the role in the 1973 Hanna-Barbera animated series. In the 1992 animated series, Itt (voiced by Pat Fraley) is depicted as a carefree bachelor who is often seen in the company of female companions. He is also a secret agent that is often targeted by the Spy Twins. =Film= In the 1991 feature film The Addams Family, Cousin Itt (spelled \\"It\\" therein, and performed and voiced by John Franklin) has a minor role in which he becomes infatuated with Margaret Alford (Dana Ivey), the mistreated wife of the Addamses' crooked lawyer Tully Alford (Dan Hedaya), when he meets her at a party and asks her to dance. By the end of the film, Margaret remarried Cousin Itt sometime after Tully and Abigail Craven (Elizabeth Wilson) are defeated and buried alive. They are shown to still be together in Addams Family Values and are the parents of a miniature version of It named \\"What.\\" The three of them alongside their nanny Dementia attend Pubert Addams' first birthday party. In the 1998 direct-to-video film Addams Family Reunion, Itt (performed by Phil Fondacaro) is pursued by a mutant dog invented by Uncle Fester that feeds on human hair. Cousin Itt (also spelled \\"It\\") appears in the 2019 animated film voiced by Snoop Dogg. He is portrayed as being smaller in this incarnation than in any other, being shorter than Pugsley. Cousin Itt arrives at Pugsley's Mazurka alongside the rest of the Addams Family's relatives. Legacy Two plant species native to eastern Australia, Casuarina glauca and Acacia cognata, both have had cultivar developed called \\"Cousin Itt\\" due to their short size and shaggy appearance.

For most of her life she, as the only child of Wladyslaw Jagiello, was considered to be heiress of the Polish and Lithuanian thrones. After the birth of Jagiello's sons in 1424 and 1427, Hedwig had some support for her claims to the throne. She died in 1431 amidst rumors that she was poisoned by her stepmother Sophia of Halshany. Family relations She was the only daughter of King of Poland and Supreme Duke of Lithuania Wladyslaw Jagiello by his second wife, Anna of Celje, daughter of William, Count of Celje, and Anna of Poland. Anna of Celje was a granddaughter of King Casimir III of Poland and therefore a Piast heiress. Thanks to his marriage to her in 1402, Jagiello re- legitimized his rule as King of Poland after the death of his first wife, Hedwig (Jadwiga), who reigned as King (not Queen consort) of Poland. Jagiello's and Anna's only daughter, born in 1408, was named after Queen Hedwig. After it became apparent that Anna of Celje would not be able to bear any further children, Hedwig was officially proclaimed heir presumptive to the throne during a congress in Jedlnia in early 1413.Duczmal (2012), p. 243. Queen Anna died in 1416, leaving Hedwig as Jagiello's sole surviving child. In 1417, Jagiello married Elisabeth of Pilica, and in 1422, Sophia of Halshany. Hedwig was raised by both stepmothers. Proposed marriages Until the birth of Jagiello's son W≈Çadys≈Çaw III in 1424, Hedwig's marriage was of paramount importance in Polish politics as her husband would presumably become King of Poland after Jagiello's death. The first known negotiations for her marriage occurred in 1419 between Jagiello and Eric, King of Sweden, Norway, and Dermark. The rulers met in Czerwi≈Ñsk nad Wis≈ÇƒÖ to discuss an alliance against the Teutonic Knights. Eric proposed to marry Hedwig to his cousin and presumptive heir Bogislaw IX, Duke of Pomerania, who at the time was eight or nine years old. However, the Polish‚ÄìScandinavian‚ÄìPomeranian alliance did not materialize.Duczmal (2012), p. 244 On 12 April 1421, Hedwig was betrothed to Frederick II, Margrave of Brandenburg, second son of Frederick I, Elector of Brandenburg, who sought Polish alliance in the long-standing Brandenburg‚ÄìPomeranian conflict.Duczmal (2012), p. 245 According to the terms of the agreement, the marriage would take place when Frederick II reached age 14 in 1427. Five years after the marriage, Frederick II would be eligible to become King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania. The young Brandenburg prince had to live in Poland as soon as was possible, in order to get acquainted with the language and customs of his future country. The agreement would be void if Jagiello had surviving sons. Ten months later, Jagiello married Sophia of Halshany, who was just a few years older than Hedwig. Frederick I was not satisfied with the marriage and sent his son to Krak√≥w to be with his fiance. Tensions continued to rise as Brandenburg did not provide troops in the Gollub War against the Teutonic Knights. Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor, lobbied against the marriage while Scandinavian King Eric renewed his proposal for the Polish‚ÄìScandinavian‚ÄìPomeranian alliance against Brandenburg. Despite political pressure, Jagiello did not annul the agreement. Fearing an assassination attempt, Grand Duke Vytautas took Frederick II from Krak√≥w to Lithuania in 1424.Duczmal (2012), p. 246 In October 1424, Sophia gave birth to Jagiello's son. Frederick I continued to pursue the marriage. A party of Polish nobles wanted Hedwig and her future husband to succeed her father, instead of her father's sons by Sophia of Halshany, who were not descended from the Piast dynasty of Poland.Duczmal (2012), pp. 246‚Äì247 The death of her maternal grandmother, Anna of Poland, in 1425 left Hedwig without any close relatives in the power struggle with Sophia. Due to uncertainties of inheritance, Hedwig's marriage was postponed. For about a year, Hedwig battled an unknown illness. She died in December 1431 and was buried in the Wawel Cathedral. Queen Sophia had to defend herself against rumors that she poisoned the princess.Duczmal (2012), p. 247 There is evidence to suggest that Frederick II was genuinely in love with Hedwig and suffered bouts of depression as a result of her death.Duczmal (2012), pp. 247‚Äì248 References ;Notes: ;References * Bibliography * ≈Åowmia≈Ñski, Henryk, Polityka Jagiellon√≥w, Pozna≈Ñ 2006. * Tƒôgowski, Jan, Pierwsze pokolenia Giedyminowicz√≥w, Pozna≈Ñ - Wroc≈Çaw 1999. * Wdowiszewski, Zygmunt, Genealogia Jagiellon√≥w i Domu Waz√≥w w Polsce, Krak√≥w 2005. 1408 births 1431 deaths Hedwig 15th-century Polish people 15th-century Polish women Polish princesses Burials at Wawel Cathedral Nobility from Krak√≥w ","title":"Hedwig Jagiellon (1408‚Äì1431)"},{"id":"4975892","text":"is a railway station in the city of Yokote, Akita Prefecture, Japan, operated by JR East.

They provide all train services at the station, mainly a train every forty minutes in each direction between and . The line through Redland was opened in 1874 by the Great Western and Midland Railways as part of the Clifton Extension Railway. The station itself was opened in 1897 following a petition by local residents. There were two platforms, with the main station building on the Bristol-bound platform and smaller facilities on the opposite platform. No goods facilities were provided. The main station building, although no longer in railway use, is the only original station building left on the line. In 1903 the station had 11 staff. The Severn Beach Line declined over the latter half of the twentieth century, with passenger numbers falling significantly. All station staff were withdrawn in 1967, with the line through the station reduced to single track in 1970, with the second platform taken out of use.

There is a short interval between services to Avonmouth and those to Bristol, due to the line's passing point, , being the next station. Most trains call at all stations, but some services omit . The typical journey time to Bristol Temple Meads is roughly 15 minutes, and about the same to Avonmouth. In 2012, the single fare to Clifton Down or Bristol was ¬£1.50, and ¬£3 return for the whole line.  History  The station as it was in 1912, from an illustration by Samuel Loxton. The station in 1964. The main station building is on the left. The waiting room on the right would be demolished in 1970. Redland railway station in some snow in 2005. The disused southern platform can clearly be seen on the right of the picture. The Clifton Extension Railway was opened from Narroways Hill Junction to as a joint venture between the Great Western Railway and Midland Railway, to connect their main lines to the Bristol Port Railway and Pier in the Avon Gorge. Passenger services to Clifton Down began in 1874, and through services to started in 1885. There was not initially a station at Redland, but there was local support, with several petitions submitted to the line's Joint Railway Committee. The first was received in October 1885, but was rejected due to the estimated cost of ¬£3,410 to provide the station. A second petition was rejected eighteen months later. The Bristol Chamber of Commerce petitioned for a station in 1892, but the Committee again rejected the request, stating that estimated traffic levels would not justify the expense. It took until 1896 until a revised plan was accepted by the Committee. Construction of the station was complicated by the need to keep the line open: trains ferrying materials were unable to stay on-site for long, and frequently had to switch from one track to the other, necessitating trips to nearby Montpelier railway station, where the nearest crossover points were located. The station finally opened on 12 April 1897. The first train was the 7 am service: 94 tickets were issued to Clifton Down, and an estimated 550 passengers bought tickets from the station the same day. Some local writers were sceptical, claiming that many of those first day passengers were not new passengers, but would previously have travelled from Montpelier or Clifton Down. Construction took nine months, and cost ¬£2,000. The station as built had two through lines, with platforms on either side. The southern \\"down\\" platform was for trains towards Clifton Down and Avonmouth, the northern \\"up\\" platform for trains towards Montpelier and Bristol. The main station building, comprising the station master's office, general waiting room, ladies' waiting room and cloakroom, was on the northern platform. A smaller building was built in the same style on the southern platform, and was used as a general waiting room. No goods facilities were provided. A footbridge at the west end of the platforms, between the preexisting Lovers' Walk and Redland Grove bridges, allowed access between the two platforms. The ticket office was situated at the north end of this bridge, on South Road. In September 1899, a Midland Railway-style signal box was opened at the east end of the northern platform. Services were provided by the Great Western Railway and the Midland Railway. Midland trains worked between Clifton Down and or , where passengers could change for services to Bath, Birmingham and other Midland destinations. The Great Western provided services from to Clifron Down and , many looping back to Temple Meads via or . Bristol Temple Meads was the city's major station, where passengers could change for trains to London, Exeter and Wales, among others. There were also occasional through services to . In 1910, Redland saw 20 Great Western trains each day to and from Clifton Down, a further 17 from and 15 to Avonmouth, and 13 Midland trains in each direction between Clifton Down and Mangotsfield or Fishponds. Midland services were suspended from 1 January 1917 due to the First World War, but resumed in May 1919. In 1903, the station employed 11 men, but the post of station master was abolished on 27 August 1909 as a cost-cutting measure, with responsibility passing to Clifton Down. There were six staff by 1938. In 1923, grouping resulted in the Midland Railway being absorbed into the London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS), and the line continued in a joint arrangement between the Great Western and the LMS. Services to Fishponds ended on 31 March 1941. When the railways were nationalised in 1948, when it came under the aegis of the Western Region of British Railways. The signal box closed in 1950, and by 1958 there were only three staff members: a booking clerk and two porters. Through services to Pilning and Henbury ceased with the Beeching Axe in 1964, with services terminating at , and from December that year the station was unstaffed after 2 pm. Staff were withdrawn completely on 17 July 1967, a fate shared by most of the other stations on the Severn Beach Line. The southern running line was lifted on 19 October 1970, and the adjacent platform abandoned and its shelter demolished. The ticket office and footbridge were also demolished, with a replacement entrance opened through the South Road garages. British Rail was split into business-led sectors in the 1980s, at which time operations at Redland passed to Regional Railways. All trains ran to Severn Beach, but the service pattern was irregular. This was changed in the mid-1990s, with a more frequent service to Avonmouth but very few on to Severn Beach. Local tourism expert Bernard Lane described the line's state as > ... the line the railway wished was not there. It was the line that got bus > substitution whenever they were short of trains or queues, when a rugby > match in Cardiff needed a special. It has a problem in that the route is > slow and not very direct; for years it was invisible, short of marketing and > lacking a regular interval timetable. By 1995 there was no Sunday service, and there was even talk of the line being closed completely. When the railway was privatised in 1997, local services were franchised to Wales & West, which was succeeded by Wessex Trains, an arm of National Express, in 2001. Following action by Friends of Severn Beach Railway (FOSBR) and a string of protests, services had increased to 10 per day in each direction by 2005, with Bristol City Council providing a subsidy to Wessex Trains. The Wessex franchise was amalgamated with the Great Western franchise into the Greater Western franchise from 2006, and responsibility passed to First Great Western, a subsidiary company of FirstGroup, subsequently rebranded as Great Western Railway. A minimum service requirement was written into the franchise agreement, ensuring an hourly service along the line. In 2007, the Council unanimously agreed to pay ¬£450,000 per annum to fund extra services from May 2008 for three years, which resulted in a 60% increase in passenger numbers along the line, and a 25% year-on-year increase between June 2009 and June 2010. Sunday services to Severn Beach were restored in 2010. Passenger numbers at Redland were further boosted by a marketing campaign by the Severnside Community Rail Partnership to attract more people, especially students, to use the station. The work won a Department for Transport Community Rail Marketing Award in 2007. The Severnside CRP also formed a support group for the station, and improved the provision of timetabling information through the use of simplified departure timetable posters. In 2008, they helped to renovate and repaint the station building. It was decorated in 2009 by students from Fairfield School, who created a mural of Victorian characters with incongruous details such as mobile phones, sunglasses and funny hats. The work won a Community Rail Award. Customer help points with next train information screens were installed during 2008/09, paid for by money from the Department for Transport's \\"Access for All\\" fund and local councils. The help points were stolen in early 2010, but have since been replaced. Ticket machines were installed in early 2011, following complaints that passengers were unable to pay their fares. A small coffee stand and snack bar began operating at the station in 2014.  Future  First Great Western declined a contractual option to continue the Greater Western passenger franchise (of which services at Redland are a part) beyond 2013, citing a desire for a longer-term contract due to the impending upgrade to the Great Western Main Line. The franchise was put out to tender, but the process was halted and later scrapped due to the fallout from the collapse of the InterCity West Coast franchise competition. A two-year franchise extension until September 2015 was agreed in October 2013, and subsequently extended until March 2019. With the coming upgrade to the Great Western Main Line, the main line from London to Bristol is due to be electrified by 2016. However, the electrification will not extend beyond the main lines, so Redland will continue to be served by diesel trains, with the current \\"Sprinter\\" units expected to be replaced by and \\"Turbo\\" units. Stephen Williams, MP for Bristol West, questioned whether electrification could continue to Redland. Then- Secretary of State for Transport Philip Hammond replied that it would have to be looked at in the future. The group Friends of Suburban Bristol Railways supports the electrification of the entire Severn Beach Line. Improved services at Redland are called for as part of the Greater Bristol Metro scheme, a rail transport plan which aims to enhance transport capacity in the Bristol area. There is an aspiration for half-hourly services, with trains towards Bristol terminating alternately at and , however due to the large sections of the Severn Beach Line which are single-track and to the congested main line from Temple Meads, such frequency is not currently feasible. The scheme was given the go-ahead in July 2012 as part of the City Deal, whereby local councils would be given greater control over money by the government. There are also calls for the reopening of the Henbury Loop Line, which could allow a direct service from Redland to via . Plans for a loop were rejected by the West of England Joint Transport Board, however Bristol City Councillors voted to send the decision back to the board for further discussion.

Released in 1978, it is the only studio album credited to the band. It was Jerry Garcia's first album on the Arista label and his first LP using the band name Jerry Garcia Band. It includes only one song that was performed by the Grateful Dead. Keith and Donna Godchaux, who were at the time members of the Garcia Band, contributed to the music. The album was the first to be recorded at the Grateful Dead's Club Front in San Rafael, a warehouse space that had been acquired for band rehearsals and then converted to a studio. Garcia explained \\"[Ron] Tutt liked the drum sound in the room and we hadn't really thought about it before, so we whipped the place into a recording studio.\\" The record was not a financial success, but it remained Garcia's favorite, as he said in an interview in the late 1980s: \\"The record I worked hardest at and liked best was Cats Under the Stars. That was kind of like my baby. It did worse than any other record I ever did. I think I probably gave away more copies than I sold. It was amazingly, pathetically bad. But I‚Äôve learned not to invest a lot of importance in 'em, although it's nice to care about your work.\\" On another occasion in the early '80s he said \\"Cats Under the Stars is my favorite one. That's the one that I‚Äôm happiest with, from every point of view in which I operate on that record. We did all those tunes on tour right after the album came out, with John and Maria, Keith and Donna and I think Ronnie Tutt was still playing drums with us on those first few tours.\\" (Although Ron Tutt played on the album, he left the band before the album was released and was replaced by Buzz Buchanan.DeadBase XI: The Complete Guide to Grateful Dead Song Lists, by John W. Scott, Mike Dolgushkin, and Stu Nixon, 1999, DeadBase, ) In the early '90s he still thought well of the album: \\"As far as I'm concerned Cats Under the Stars is my most successful record ‚Äî even though it's my least successful record! I've always loved it and it just never went anywhere.\\" In an interview with Joel Selvin he was more succinct; \\"[Cats Under the Stars] had everything ‚Äî chops, production, songs.\\" Cats Under the Stars peaked at No. 114 on the Billboard 200. Critical reception On AllMusic, Lindsay Planer wrote, \\"Jerry Garcia's fourth solo album was the first to be released under the collective title of the Jerry Garcia Band...

It existed as a separate entity from 1559 until 1896, when it was amalgamated with St Olave's Grammar School, which was renamed St Olave's and St Saviour's Grammar School For Boys. History The name is from the parish of St Saviour's, which was formed in 1543 from the amalgamation of St Margaret's and St Mary Magdalen's parishes. The parish adopted the name St Saviour's from the recently dissolved Abbey of St Saviour in nearby Bermondsey. The parish then leased the former Priory of St Mary Overie, a dissolved Augustinian monastery, which then became known as St Saviour's Church and was destined to become Southwark Cathedral in 1905. In 1559, St Saviour's parish sold a quantity of silver plate to fund a new sixty-year lease on the church from Lady Day, dated 6 June 1559. A condition of the lease was that within two years the parish would establish a building and employ a schoolmaster for a free grammar school. On 31 August 1559, the parishioners decided in the interim to run the school in the church house of the old St Margaret parish. This was funded by renting out the Lady Chapel of the priory to a baker, as well as selling the vestments and brass vessels of the parish. On 16 May 1562 the parishioners paid ¬£42 for a thousand-year lease from Matthew Smith on a building associated with the Green Dragon Inn, which had previously been owned by Lady Cobham. Under the first schoolmaster, Christopher Ockland, the school moved into this new home, known as Green Dragon Court, lying just south of St Saviour's Church and now part of the site of the Borough Market. The St Saviour's Grammar School received a Charter from Queen Elizabeth I, sealed on 4 June 1562. The event was commemorated on a foundation stone still existing today, although later moved from site to site and now situated at St Olave's Grammar School in Orpington, Greater London. The chief figure of the Board of Governors was Thomas Cure, the senior Warden of St Saviour's, a special corporation chartered by King Henry VIII to look after both the great priory church and various local charitable bequests. Cure was the Royal Saddler, effectively a haulage contractor, for Edward VI, Mary I and Elizabeth I and lived near the north-west corner of St Saviour's Church. He was a major local benefactor and his endowments are still administered by the corporation; he is commemorated in the Cathedral. The High Master (headmaster) was paid ¬£20 per year and initially only boys from St Saviour's parish could be admitted for a fee of half a crown (2s. 6d), while those from St Olave's and other parishes could pay a fee to the High Master to arrange a schoolmaster for their instruction. St Olave's parish established its own Grammar School in 1571, which meant there were two such foundations within 200 yards of each other. Probably the most famous pupil of the school during its first hundred years was John Harvard, after whom Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts, was named. His father Robert and his brother Thomas were Governors of the school. However, it had an even more illustrious set of Governors and supporters: a page of the Governors Minutes of 1609 includes the signatures of John Treyhearn, Philip Henslowe and Edward Alleyn. The last-named was to become a major local benefactor, and his principal endowment for Dulwich College was to ensure the continuance of St Saviour's when it was likely to be dissolved almost three hundred years later. The great fire of Southwark destroyed the school building in 1676 and damaged part of St Saviour's church, although the church tower was unscathed. The school's foundation stone was saved, and a new building was built on the same site. There the school remained until 1839, when the Governors sold the building for ¬£2,250 and relocated (along with the foundation stone) to a third building on Sumner Street to the west. This was actually smaller than the previous building. Canon Edmund Boger was the last headmaster there, from 1859 to 1895. Canon Boger attempted to halt a serious decline in the school's fortunes, which was due partly to the success of St Olave's and partly to the problem of the 1839 Sumner Street building's size and location. The school roll fell to only 27 pupils in 1892. However, in 1882 the Charity Commissioners in re-organising Dulwich College's endowment had identified the intention of Edward Alleyn towards other institutions he had supported in his life and by his Will; these were to be provided for by the Dulwich Foundation. One of these was St Saviour's and it was this continuing financial contribution that was to make St Saviour's merger with St Olave's more than a merely nominal one. In 1896, St Saviour's Grammar School and St Olave's Grammar School were amalgamated at St Olave's site on Tooley Street, and the combined school was named St Olave's and St Saviour's Grammar School for Boys. During the Second World War the old Sumner Street building of the former St Saviour's was damaged by bombing. The historic foundation stone was subsequently moved to St Olave's and St Saviour's Grammar School in 1952. When the school relocated to Orpington, Greater London, in 1968, the stone was taken to the new site. The school in Orpington is often referred to simply as St Olave's Grammar School, but its full name remains St Olave's and St Saviour's Grammar School. Near the turn of the 20th century, the Charity Commissioners required that girls in the Southwark area should also be given the chance of education, and the Governors of the joint foundation agreed to use their endowment to provide a new school now known as St Saviour's and St Olave's Church of England School.

Located on the southeastern corner of the Baghdad International Airport, it was part of the former Al Radwaniyah Presidential Complex and contains several man-made lakes, a man-made hill (result of the man-made lakes), the Ba'ath Party House, the Victory Over America Palace, Perfume Palace, and dozens of smaller luxury homes for Ba'ath Party notables. During the Iraq War, it was most notable for being the headquarters of the Iraq Survey Group until 2005. Landmarks =Perfume Palace= Perfume Palace during US occupancy, with Ba'ath Party Palace in background The Perfume Palace was untouched during the US shock and awe bombing campaign due to its circular dome, which closely resembled a mosque. Following the invasion, the Palace was used as the main headquarters of the Iraq Survey Group and received minor damage from insurgent mortar fire, during the US occupancy. =Ba'ath Party Recreation Palace= Ba'ath Party Recreation Palace was located in the center of a manmade lake, just southeast of Baghdad's International Airport. The building was split into four main quadrants, one of which suffered a direct hit during the US shock and awe campaign. The four quadrants are separated by two covered, air conditioned boat landings. The quadrants consisted of a theater, ballroom, conference room and swimming pool. Shortly after the 2003 US invasion, the building was heavily looted. =Victory Over America Palace= Victory Over America Palace, where construction stopped in 2003 Construction of the Victory Over America Palace was commissioned by Saddam Hussein following his assertion of victory over the US, ending the 1991 Gulf War. Construction was brought to an abrupt halt during the shock and awe campaign of the US in 2003, receiving a direct hit and leaving one of the construction cranes standing limp, with its boom collapsed from the explosion. The Victory Over America Palace was constructed immediately behind, and adjacent to, the smaller Victory Over Iran Palace. The two palaces are frequently confused for a single building, and one or both are sometimes mislabeled. =Uday House= One of many homes of Uday Hussein, Uday House was located just southeast of Baghdad International Airport. Uday House is famous for being one of, if not the only, private residence that was targeted and hit with cruise missiles during the US shock and awe campaign. (Not to be confused with the villa owned by Nawaf az-Zeidan, where Uday and his brother Qusay were killed by US forces.) =Flintstone House= Flintstone House (2004) With much of Saddam Hussein's palace complexes shrouded behind stone walls, few knew much about the facilities inside. The Flintstone House received notoriety with US soldiers due to its unique appearance and was thus named since little else was known about the facility prior to the US occupation of the site. The facility is best described as an elaborate playhouse for children, in its prime having running water, operable kitchen and elevators. The name \\"Flintstone\\" conveys a comparison to the animated sitcom The Flintstones, due to the facilities Stone-Age appearance.

He is nicknamed De Neus (The Nose) because of the size of his nose. In 1983, Holleeder was sentenced to eleven years' imprisonment for his involvement in the kidnapping of Heineken president Freddy Heineken for a 35-million-gulden (approximately ‚Ç¨16 million, or US$19.5 million) ransom. Then, in 2007 Holleeder was sentenced to nine years in prison for several counts of extortion, including the extortion of Willem Endstra, who was murdered in 2004 after falling out with Holleeder. He served his sentence in Nieuw Vosseveld and was released on 27 January 2012. He was arrested again in May 2013 (released 12th June 2013), May 2015 and April 2016. In July 2019, he was sentenced to life imprisonment for five murders and one count of manslaughter.Willem Holleeder jailed for life for ordering five gangland murdersDUTCH CRIME BOSS TO SPEND LIFE IN PRISON OVER 6 MURDERSHolleeder trial: Dutch crime godfather gets life for five murders Life Born in 1958 in Amsterdam, Holleeder was the son of Wim Holleeder (1927‚Äì1990), an employee at the Heineken breweries who lost his job because of alcoholism. As a teenager, he, along with his classmate Cor van Hout were part of a gang that worked for landlords in evicting squatters, and may have been involved in several robberies. Cor van Hout was later to become his brother-in-law by marrying Holleeder's sister Sonja. =Heineken kidnapping= In 1983, their relatively unknown gang abducted the Heineken heir Freddy Heineken (who had purchased back the family ownership of the brewery), along with his driver Ab Doderer. Ultimately, their demand for 35 million guilders (approximately ‚Ç¨16 million, or US$19.5 million) was met by the family, although the police were against it. After Freddy Heineken's release, the kidnappers‚ÄîCor van Hout, Willem Holleeder, Jan Boelaard, Frans Meijer, and Martin Erkamps‚Äîwere all eventually traced and served prison sentences. During this period, Holleeder met many other gangsters, including Dennis Stewart & Yvon Lodewijks, who was later accused of ordering the murder of Holleeder's brother-in-law and co-criminal Cor van Hout. After serving the Heineken sentence, Holleeder emerged as a high-profile criminal leader. Several million of the Heineken ransom was never traced, and may have been part of his initial kitty with which he and Cor van Hout set up an extortion empire; there are said to be up to 24 people in his crime ring. Initially, he was in a business relationship with real estate businessman Willem Endstra, possibly involving money laundering.De oorlog in de Amsterdamse onderwereld by Bart Middelburg and Paul Vugts After Cor van Hout was killed in 2003, Holleeder fell out with Endstra. Endstra secretly testified to the police about Holleeder, but was shot dead near his office in 2004. It is suspected that Holleeder, along with his partner-in-crime Dino Soerel, ordered the murder of both Willem Endstra and John Mieremet, who was shot in Thailand on 2 November 2005. Holleeder's name keeps turning up in this connection although three suspects in the Endstra murder, Ali N. and C. √ñzg√ºr of Alkmaar and Cleon D. from Almere have been released. According to Endstra, Holleeder was involved in 25 murders, including that of Cor van Hout. The Dutch newspaper De Telegraaf reported on 16 July 2006, that Holleeder and Cor van Hout had planned to kidnap Prince Bernhard instead of Freddy Heineken in the 1980s. Thomas van der Bijl, who was murdered in his bar in Amsterdam in April 2006, made these allegations in a deposition before the Dutch national police. =2007 trial and sentencing= Holleeder's 2006 trial was dubbed the trial of the century. His lawyer, Bram Moszkowicz, argued that media depictions of Holleeder as one of the \\"topcriminelen\\" had prejudiced the case against him. However, Moszkowicz was forced to resign after media allegations of conflict of interest, since he had also been the lawyer for Willem Endstra. Among the witnesses in the trial was lawyer Bram Zeegers, who testified that Holleeder had been extorting millions of euros from Endstra between 2000 and 2004. A week after the testimony, Zeegers was found dead of a drug overdose. In late 2007, Holleeder underwent a heart valve surgery; initially, reports of his failing health were thought to be a hoax, but present medical opinion appears to suggest that he is indeed in poor health and may not survive the present sentence. While he was under detention in 2008, he was also arrested for alleged involvement in the murder of Yugoslav drug dealer Serge Miranovic in 2006. Holleeder was found guilty of extortion and sentenced to nine years in prison, at a time held in Nieuw Vosseveld. His subsequent appeal was turned down by the appeals court in July 2009. = After his release = Holleeder was released from De Schie prison in Rotterdam on 27 January 2012, after serving two thirds of his nine-year term. He had been due to be released on 31 January but was let out early to avoid publicity. After his release he appeared on television in the show College Tour in 2012. He also made a record named Willem is terug (\\"Willem is back\\") in September 2012 together with Lange Frans, a Dutch rapper. Various politicians condemned his appearance, because Holleeder should not become a cult hero. In addition, from September 2012 until 7 March 2013 Holleeder wrote a weekly column for the Dutch magazine Nieuwe Revu. In February 2013 Holleeder was a co-founder of the motorcycle club No Surrender MC and served as vice-president of the Amsterdam branch. =2013 arrest= In May 2013, Holleeder was arrested in a large operation involving 450 police and army personnel. He was suspected of extortion. The victim of the alleged extortion was Theo Huisman who is the ex-president of the Amsterdam chapter of the . On 12 June 2013 Holleeder was released from prison but remains a suspect in the case. Back in jail, in May 2015 it became known that Holleeder knew who was involved in the murder of his brother-in- law, Cor van Hout. His sister Astrid, a criminal lawyer, feared that Holleeder plans to assassinate her, and so she proposed to assist in his prosecution. While visiting him in prison she secretly recorded his confession and handed it to the police. \\"Sunday Times Magazine\\" 8 April 2017 = 2016 arrest and assassination plot = In April 2016, Holleeder was arrested again, while still in prison, for allegedly soliciting two members of a gang (known as the Cura√ßao No Limit Soldiers) to kill his sisters Astrid and Sonja, and Peter de Vries, who was also a witness in the mega-trial. Holleeder dismissed the charge as ‚Äúnonsense,‚Äù insisting that it would not be in his ‚Äúinterest‚Äù to kill his sisters. The gang member who informed the authorities about the plot subsequently recanted his confession, though Astrid believes that he did so only because he is also afraid of her brother. =2019 verdict= In July 2019, the Court in Amsterdam convicted Holleeder after a lengthy and extensive trialCRIME BOSS HOLLEEDER INDICTED ON THREE MORE ASSASSINATIONSThe hottest ticket in Amsterdam is a seat at the Holleeder trial at the age of 61 to life imprisonment for the involvement in a series of five murders, including on his former friend and criminal associate Cor van Hout, and one case of manslaughter,Text of verdict 04 July 2019 thus following the demand of the prosecutorPublic prosecutor demands life sentence for HolleederLIFE IN PRISON DEMANDED OF SUSPECTED CRIME BOSS, HEINEKEN KIDNAPPER WILLEM HOLLEEDER and brushing off his denials.Holleeder: ‚ÄòNo idea‚Äô why gangster who owed him money was murdered The judges also found that he had formed a crime gang and ordered killings with jailed associate Dino Soerel and since-murdered criminal Stanley Hillis.

A fazenda is a plantation found throughout Brazil; during the colonial period (16th - 18th centuries). They were concentrated primarily in the northeastern region, where (sugar) was produced, expanding during the 19th century in the southeastern region to coffee production. Fazenda now denotes any kind of farm in Brazilian Portuguese and occasionally in other Portuguese varieties as well. Fazendas created major export commodities for Brazilian trade, but also led to intensification of slavery in Brazil. Coffee provided a new basis for agricultural expansion in southern Brazil. In the provinces of Rio de Janeiro and then S√£o Paulo, coffee estates, or fazendas, began to spread toward the interior as new lands were opened. By 1850, coffee made up more than 50% of Brazil's exports, and more than half of world coffee production. Along with the expansion of coffee growing came an intensification of slavery in Brazil, as the country's primary form of labor. More than 1.4 million Africans were forced to be slaves in Brazil in the last 50 years of the slave trade, and even after the trans-Atlantic slave trade ended, slavery continued until 1888. Because of the increased profit from the trade of coffee, the years after 1850 saw considerable growth and prosperity in Brazil. Railroads, steamships and the telegraph were introduced to Brazil, all paid for by the money the fazendas supplied from their coffee crop. In growing cities such as Rio de Janeiro and S√£o Paulo, merchants, lawyers, a middle class, and an urban working class grew, once again paid for by the money coming from the fazendas.  Modern forced labour practices  More than 100 years after the end of slavery, forced labour practices in Brazil still occur in both rural and urban areas, mainly through debt bondage schemes. In rural areas, workers are detained on farms until they pay their debts, which are often fraudulently incurred. Their identity documents and work permits are often seized by the employer. They are often under surveillance of armed guards. Those who protest are physically threatened; if they try to escape, they may be killed.Combating Forced Labour in Brazil.

Early life  Rudniev was born in a peasant family in what is now Sumy region. As a teenager Rudniev moved to Saint-Petersburg and became an apprentice carpenter at the Russo-Balt Factory. Rudniev became an active member of the Bolshevik movement and joined the party in March 1917. For distributing Bolshevik leaflets, Rudniev was sent to the Vyborg prison. He participated in the assault on the Winter Palace during the October Revolution. In 1918, Rudniev joined the Red Army. At first he served as a platoon commander, but later became secretary of party organization for the 373rd Rifle Regiment of the 42nd Rifle Division. He then became a commissar for the Donetsk Labour Army's political department. He then became assistant commissar of the 44th Rifle Regiment of the 15th Rifle Division. Rudniev fought on the Southern Front of the Russian Civil War.  Interwar  In 1929, Rudniev graduated from the Lenin Military-Political Academy. He became commissar of the 61st Coastal Defence Antiaircraft Artillery Regiment in Sevastopol. In 1932 he was transferred to become commissar of the 9th Coastal Defence Artillery Brigade in the Far East. In July 1933, he became military commissar of the De-Kastri fortified area, then under construction. In August 1937, he was appointed commissar of the 1st Military Construction Brigade there. On 7 February 1938, he was arrested by the NKVD and in May 1939 charged with committing crimes under Article 58 of the RSFSR Penal Code, which carried the death penalty. Rudniev initially confessed to creating the Trotskyist organization in his fortified area but refused to confess to espionage and sabotage charges. He soon retracted his confession, stating that it was made under duress. In July 1939, his case was sent for review to the Military Collegium of the Supreme Court of the Soviet Union, but was then sent back to the military tribunal of the 2nd Red Banner Army. After a retrial, Rudniev was released from prison. He was soon discharged for health reasons and returned to Putyvl. In 1940, he became the chairman of the OSOAVIAKHIM district council.  World War II  On 22 June 1941, German troops attacked the Soviet Union in Operation Barbarossa. They soon reached Ukraine and had reached Kiev by late August. In September, Rudniev formed a partisan group in Putyvl. In October, Rudniev and Sydir Kovpak's partisan detachment united into one unit, with Rudniev becoming commissar. He quickly gained respect among partisan fighters and remained Kovpak's commissar while their initially small group rose into a large well-organized formation raiding the rear of the Axis occupants. In the winter of 1942, Rudniev was wounded in battle near Vesyloye village. On April 9, 1943 Semyon Rudniev was promoted to the rank of major general. According to official sources, Rudniev, recovering from a wound, committed gunshot suicide in a sudden German attack, in order to not be taken alive. The incident happened during the 4 August 1943 \\"Carpathian Raid\\" of Kovpak's partisan group and was witnessed at first hand only by small group of his guards (mostly killed in that action). However, Glantz states that Rudniev was killed while the partisan group was withdrawing from an attack on Deliatyn. On 4 January 1944, Rudniev was posthumously awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union and the Order of Lenin for bravery in the partisan battles. In July 1946, a mass grave containing Rudniev's body was discovered in a forest near Deliatyn. He was reburied in Yaremche.  Legacy  1967 Postage stamp honoring Rudniev A monument to Rudniev was installed in Putyvl. Rudniev's home village of Moiseyevka became Rudnevo in his honor. The teacher's college in Putyvl was also named after Rudniev. In Deliatyn, a monument honoring Rudniev was also erected. In 1967, the Soviet Union issued a postage stamp in honor of Rudniev. Controversies After the fall of the Soviet Union, some historians began questioning the official version of Rudniev's life and death. Basing on disclosed Soviet archives, some researchers alleged that Rudniev was not committed to strategy and approaches (especially regarding civilians) dictated by the Moscow-based Ukrainian Partisan Movement Headquarters ()). This supposedly caused Rudniev's conflicts with both Sydir Kovpak and high-ranked NKVD agent Ivan Siromolotnyi (the latter was interacting with Kovpak and Rudniev from Moscow over the radio). According to these researchers, Rudniev was attempting to collaborate with Ukrainian People's Army forces. This conflict is said to have caused Rudniev's mysterious death. Some studies suggest that Rudniev might have been assassinated by his personal radio operator, Anna Turkina (a woman trained in Moscow) by a direct order from Siromolotnyi. However, according to deputy head of the Ukrainian Institute of National Remembrance Dmitry Vedeneyev, this version of events is untrue.

This dynasty rose to power in the Deccan region between 1156 and 1181 CE (25 years). The rulers of the dynasty traced their origins to one Krishna, who is said to have conquered Kalinjar and Dahala in present-day Madhya Pradesh (see Kalachuris of Tripuri). Bijjala, a viceroy of the dynasty, is said to have established the authority over Karnataka after wresting power from the Chalukya king Taila III. Bijjala was succeeded by his sons Someshvara and Sangama but after 1181 CE, the Chalukyas gradually retrieved the territory. Their rule was short and turbulent and yet very important from a socio-religious point of view; a new sect known as the Lingayat or Virashaiva sect was founded during these times in a time extent of 25 years.Students' Britannica India By Dale Hoiberg, Indu Ramchandani. A unique and purely native form of Kannada literature-poetry called the Vachanas was also born during this time. The writers of Vachanas were called Vachanakaras (poets). Many other important works like Virupaksha Pandita's Chennabasavapurana, Dharani Pandita's Bijjalarayacharite and Chandrasagara Varni's Bijjalarayapurana were also written. Origin The Kalachuris of Kalyani overthrew the Kalyani Chalukyas in the early part of the 12th century, and had a relatively short but stormy rule. The name \\"Kalachuri\\" is shared by multiple earlier dynasties, two of which ruled in central India. Some historians such as Dr. P.B. Desai believe that the southern Kalachuris of Kalyani are descendants of these central Indian dynasties. In the 6th century, before the rise of the Badami Chalukyas, the Kalachuris of Mahishmati had carved out an extensive empire covering areas of Gujarat, Malwa, Konkan and parts of Maharashtra. However, after their crippling defeat at the hands of Chalukya Mangalesha, they remained in obscurity for a prolonged period of time. Subsequently, the Kalachuris of Tripuri and their branches rose to power in central India. An 1174 CE record says the Kalyani Kalachuri dynasty was founded by one Soma who grew beard and moustache to save himself from the wrath of Parashurama, and thereafter the family came to be known as \\"Kalachuris\\", Kalli meaning a long moustache and churi meaning a sharp knife. They migrated to the south and made Magaliveda or Mangalavedhe (Mangalavada) their capital. They titled themselves Kalanjara-puravaradhisvara (\\"Lord of Kalanjara\\"), which indicates their central Indian origin. Their emblem was Suvarna Vrishabha or the golden bull. They must have started as modest feudatories of the Chalukyas of Kalyani. They were also referred to as Katachuris (shape of a sharp knife) and Haihaya (or Heheya). The later records of the dynasty claim that they descended from Brahma, the Creator of the universe.  As feudatories of Chalukyas  The early Kalachuris of the south were Jains and encouraged Jainism in their kingdom. The first notable chief of the Kalachuri family of Karnataka was Uchita. While there were several kings who followed him ruling as feudatories of the Kalyani Chalukyas, it was Jogama who became an influential vassal of Vikramaditya VI, being related to the great Chalukya king by matrimony. Decline Of Kalachuris The Southern Kaluchuri kingdom went into decline after the assassination of Bijjalla. The rulers who followed were weak and incompetent, with the exception of Sovideva, who managed to maintain control over the kingdom. Western Chalukyas ended the Kalachuri Dynasty. Many Kalachuri families migrated to Kanara districts of Karnataka. The Kalachuris are the principal characters in the Andhra epic The battle of Palnadu.

The district Pennridge School District, covers approximately with a total population of 45,000 and encompasses eight municipalities, including the boroughs of Dublin, Perkasie, Sellersville, and Silverdale. Bedminster Township, East Rockhill Township, Hilltown Township, and West Rockhill Township also are included. Foundations and current schools Pennridge was founded in 1952 by combining the resources of several small municipal school districts, including Sell-Perk School District. The former Sell-Perk High School had been converted to its present use as South Middle School. Today, the district operates 11 schools: 7 elementary schools (of which four are named for past principals): *Bedminster *R. B. Deibler *J. M. Grasse *P. A. Guth *Sellersville *M. M. Seylar *West Rockhill 3 middle schools: *Central Middle School *South Middle School -the building of the original area high school (Sell-Perk High School) *North Middle School 1 high school: *Pennridge High School Right now there are approximately 7,200 students enrolled in the entire district. The district employs 478 teachers and over 450 additional staff, including part-time members.*http://www.pennridge.org/psd/about/geninfo.html Athletics All Pennridge School sports compete in the Suburban One League - Continental Conference using the ram as a mascot and green, white and occasionally black for colors. The Varsity Football team historically plays all of their home games at Poppy Yoder Field, a stadium on the grounds of South Middle School. South was formerly known as Sell-Perk High (before Pennridge was formed) and still has its roots embedded in the community. Since October 2008, a turf field has been in use on the grounds of the high school. Lacrosse, soccer, field hockey, track and field, and JV and freshmen football use the turf field. However, the Varsity Football team continues to play at muddy Poppy Yoder in Sellersville, Pennsylvania. There have been talks to renovate Poppy Yoder and possibly complete the stadium at the high school. Poppy Yoder field is no longer in use and now the football team and other high school sports play at Helman Field which is located behind the high school. In recent years, many of the sport teams have had great success. The women's soccer team was conference and District 1 champions in 2011. They were also PIAA Class AAA State Runners-up. In 2009 they were District 1 Champions. The boys' volleyball team was also conference champions, District 1 champions, and PIAA Class AAA State Runners-up. Growth and development Pennridge‚Äôs administration has had to be very adaptable in recent years as the Pennridge area population continues to grow as an ongoing effect of urban sprawl from Philadelphia. In 1996 the new Central Middle School was added to accommodate rising enrollments and since then, most of the district's elementary schools have undergone expansion and renovation projects. Pennridge has recently built a multimillion-dollar expansion to the current building on the high school campus, which includes a new gymnasium, a natatorium, and cafeteria. Construction of a new auditorium, seating approximately 1200, and renovation of the school's older sections, followed, being completed February 2007. Demolition of the oldest building on campus, the Lower House, began on August 15, 2006 due to the futility of renovation. The building that was the Freshman Center became North Middle School after the High School construction was completed. National attention was briefly drawn to Pennridge School District in 2018 as 225 students walked out March, 2018 to honor the dead from the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting and call for stricter gun laws. The district gave Saturday detentions to these students, who then used the occasion to stage further protests which garnered widespread attention.

Biography Bawa was born in 1941 in Dhuri, British India. His elder brothers encouraged him to pursue art. He studied fine arts at the College of Art, New Delhi between 1958 and 1963, where his professors included Somnath Hore, Rakesh Mehra, Dhanaraj Bhagat and B.C. Sanyal. \\"But I gained an identity under Abani Sen. Sen would ask me to do 50 sketches every day, only to reject most of them. As a result I inculcated the habit of working continuously. He taught me to revere the figurative at a time when the entire scene was leaning in favor of the abstract. Without that initial training I could never have been able to distort forms and create the stylization you see in my work today,\\" recalls Bawa. Works Between 1964 and 1971, Bawa worked as a silkscreen printer in Britain, where he also studied art. \\"On my return I faced a crisis. I asked myself, 'What shall I paint?' I couldn't be just another derivative of European style of painting.\\" Instead, he found Indian mythology and Sufi (school of Islam) poetry. \\"I had been brought up on stories from the Mahabharat, the Ramayan, and the Puranas (Hindu mythological and sociological texts), on the poetry of Waris Shah (a Punjabi poet) and readings from the Guru Granth Sahib (holy book of the Sikhs),\\" he says. Manjit Bawa's canvases are distinguishable in their colors - the ochre of sunflowers, the green of the paddy fields, the red of the sun, the blue of the mountain sky. He was one of the first painters to break out of the dominant grays and browns and opted for more traditionally Indian colors like pinks, reds and violet. He had painted Ranjha, the cowherd from the tragic ballad Heer Ranjha and Lord Krishna with a flute surrounded by dogs and not cows as in mythological paintings. Indian gods Kali and Shiva, whom Bawa considers as \\"icons of my country\\", also figure prominently in his paintings. Nature also plays inspiration here. When young, he would travel widely either on foot, by bicycle or simply, by hitchhiking. \\"I have been almost everywhere - Himachal Pradesh, Rajasthan, Gujarat. I would spread a sheet of paper on the ground and draw the countryside. The colors and the simplicity of people I met fascinated me.\\" Birds and animals make a constant appearance in his paintings, either alone or in human company. Besides nature, the flute is a recurring motif in his works. Bawa learnt to play the flute from maestro Pannalal Ghosh.

The causes of niche restriction and segregation are important problems in evolutionary ecology. Background Two ecological paradigms deal with the problem. The first paradigm predominates in what may be called ‚Äúclassical‚Äù ecology. It assumes that niche space is largely saturated with individuals and species, leading to strong competition. Niches are restricted because ‚Äúneighbouring‚Äù species, i.e., species with similar ecological characteristics such as similar habitats or food preferences, prevent expansion into other niches or even narrow niches down. This continual struggle for existence is an important assumption of natural selection introduced by Darwin as an explanation for evolution. The other paradigm assumes that niche space is to a large degree vacant, i.e., that there are many vacant niches. It is based on many empirical studies Rohde, K. 1980. Warum sind √∂kologische Nischen begrenzt? Zwischenartlicher Antagonismus oder innerartlicher Zusammenhalt? Naturwissenschaftliche Rundschau, 33, 98-102.Rohde, K. 2005a. Eine neue √ñkologie. Aktuelle Probleme der evolution√§ren √ñkologie. Naturwissenschaftliche Rundschau, 58, 420-426.K. Rohde: Nonequilibrium Ecology, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 2005b, 223 pp. auf http://www.cambridge.org/9780521674553 and theoretical investigations especially of Kauffman 1993.Kauffman, S.A. 1993. The origins of order. Self-organization and selection in evolution. Oxford University Press, New York Oxford. Causes of vacant niches may be evolutionary contingencies or brief or long-lasting environmental disturbances. Both paradigms agree that species are never ‚Äúuniversal‚Äù in the sense that they occupy all possible niches; they are always specialized, although the degree of specialization varies. For example, there is no universal parasite which infects all host species and microhabitats within or on them. However, the degree of host specificity varies strongly. Thus, Toxoplasma (Protista) infects numerous vertebrates including humans, Enterobius vermicularis infects only humans. The following mechanisms for niche restriction and segregation have been proposed:  Niche restriction  # Species must be specialized in order to survive. They may survive for a while in less optimal habitats under favourable conditions, but they will be extinguished when conditions become less favourable, for example due to changed weather conditions (this aspect was especially emphasized by Price 1983).Price, P. W. 1983. Communities of specialists: vacant niches in ecological and evolutionary time. In Strong, D., Simberloff, D. and Abele, L. Eds.. Ecological Communities: Conceptual Issues and the Evidence. Princeton University Press, Princeton, N.J. # Niches remain narrow or become narrower as the result of natural selection in order to enhance the chances of mating. This ‚Äúmating theory of niche restriction‚Äù Rohde, K. 1977. A non-competitive mechanism responsible for restricting niches. Zoologischer Anzeiger 199, 164-172. is supported by the observation that niches of asexual stages are often wider than those of sexually mature stages; that niches become narrower at the time of mating; and that microhabitats of sessile species and of species with small population sizes often are narrower than those of non-sessile species and of species with large population sizes.  Niche segregation  # The random selection of niches in largely empty niche space will often automatically lead to segregation (this mechanism is of particular importance in the second paradigm). # Niches are segregated due to interspecific competition (this mechanism is of particular importance in the first paradigm). # Niches of similar species are segregated (as the result of natural selection) in order to prevent interspecific hybridisation, because hybrids are less fit. (Many cases of niche segregation explained by interspecific competition are better explained by this mechanism, i.e., ‚Äúreinforcement of reproductive barriers‚Äù) (e.g., Rohde 2005b). Relative significance of the mechanisms Both paradigms acknowledge a role for all mechanisms (except possibly for that of random selection of niches in the first paradigm), but emphasis on the various mechanisms varies. The first paradigm stresses the paramount importance of interspecific competition, whereas the second paradigm tries to explain many cases which are thought to be due to competition in the first paradigm, by reinforcement of reproductive barriers and/or random selection of niches. ‚Äì Many authors believe in the overriding importance of interspecific competition. Intuitively, one would expect that interspecific competition is of particular importance in all those cases in which sympatric species (i.e., species occurring together in the same area) with large population densities use the same resources and largely exhaust them. However, Andrewartha and Birch (1954,1984)Andrewartha,H.G. and Birch, L.C. 1954. The distribution and abundance of animals. University of Chicago Press, Chicago.Andrewartha, H.G. and Birch, L.C. 1984. The ecological web. University of Chicago Press. Chicago and London. and others have pointed out that most natural populations usually don‚Äôt even approach exhaustion of resources, and too much emphasis on interspecific competition is therefore wrong. Concerning the possibility that competition has led to segregation in the evolutionary past, Wiens (1974, 1984)Wiens, J.A. 1974. Habitat heterogeneity and avian community structure in North American grasslands. American Midland Naturalist 91,195-213.Wiens, J.A. 1984. Resource systems, populations, and communities. In: Price, P.W., Slobodchikoff, C.N. and Gaud, W.S. Eds. A new ecology. Novel approaches to interactive systems. John Wiley & Sons, New York, Chichester, Brisbane, Toronto, Singapore, pp. 397-436. concluded that such assumptions cannot be proven, and Connell (1980)Connell, J.H. 1980. Diversity and the coevolution of competitors, or the ghost of competition past. Oikos 35, 131-138. found that interspecific competition as a mechanism of niche segregation has been proven only for some pest insects. Barker (1983),Barker, J.S.F. 1983. Interspecific competition. In: Ashburner, M., Carson, H.L. and Thompson, jr., J.N. Ed. The genetics and biology of Drosophila. Academic Press, London, pp. 285-341. in his review of competition in Drosophila and related genera, which are among the best known animal groups, concluded that the idea of niche segregation by interspecific competition is attractive, but that no study has yet been able to show a mechanism responsible for segregation. Without specific evidence, the possibility of random segregation can never be excluded, and assumption of such randomness can indeed serve as a null-model. ‚Äì Many physiological and morphological differences between species can prevent hybridization. Evidence for niche segregation as the result of reinforcement of reproductive barriers is especially convincing in those cases in which such differences are not found in allopatric but only in sympatric locations. For example, Kawano (2002)Kawano, K. 2002. Character displacement in giant rhinoceros beetles. American Naturalist 159, 255-271. has shown this for giant rhinoceros beetles in Southeast Asia. Two closely related species occur in 12 allopatric (i.e., in different areas) and 7 sympatric (i.e., in the same area) locations. In the former, body length and length of genitalia are practically identical, in the latter, they are significantly different, and much more so for the genitalia than the body, convincing evidence that reinforcement is an important factor (and possibly the only one) responsible for niche segregation. - The very detailed studies of communities of Monogenea parasitic on the gills of marine and freshwater fishes by several authors have shown the same. Species use strictly defined microhabitats and have very complex copulatory organs. This and the fact that fish replicas are available in almost unlimited numbers, makes them ideal ecological models. Many congeners (species belonging to the same genus) and non-congeners were found on single host species. The maximum number of congeners was nine species. The only limiting factor is space for attachment, since food (blood, mucus, fast regenerating epithelial cells) is in unlimited supply as long as the fish is alive. Various authors, using a variety of statistical methods, have consistently found that species with different copulatory organs may co-occur in the same microhabitat, whereas congeners with identical or very similar copulatory organs are spatially segregated, convincing evidence that reinforcement and not competition is responsible for niche segregation.Rohde, K. 1991.

Pierce also used this pseudonym to write the better-known The Turner Diaries, a 1978 novel with similar themes. Some consider Hunter a prequel to the Turner Diaries, detailing the rise of the racist paramilitary group termed 'The Organization', which would play a dominant role in the book. Hunter portrays the actions of Oscar Yeager (anglicization of J√§ger, German for hunter), a Vietnam veteran F-4 Phantom pilot and Washington, D.C.-area Defense Department consultant who embarks on a plan to assassinate interracial couples and public figures advocating civil rights in the D.C. area. Yeager's crimes quickly lead to broad national repercussions and draw him into the plans of both a white nationalist group and an ambitious FBI official to take advantage of the turmoil he has helped to start. Hunter shares with The Turner Diaries Pierce's depiction of the United States as overrun by liberalism and covertly dominated by Jews. His depictions of and attitudes of the protagonists towards Jews, African- Americans, Latinos, and Asians mirror the ideology of Pierce and National Alliance. Hunter reveals this ideology more didactically and directly than did The Turner Diaries. At the novel's beginning, the protagonist is a nonideological racist unattached to antisemitism. He gradually develops his ideology and perspectives during his campaign and through contact with the allies that he meets. Much of the story's dialogue consists of discussion and debate on the \\"Jewish question.\\" Pierce's rationale  In contrast to The Turner Diaries, Pierce decided to write a \\"more realistic novel, Hunter, which shifted away from the idea of an organized group to what an exceptional individual can do. Hunter \\"serves a real educational process.\\"Gardell 2003, p. 360. Pierce dedicated Hunter to Joseph Paul Franklin who, the notice says, \\"saw his duty as a White man.\\" Franklin was a white supremacist serial killer who murdered up to 22 people in sniper-style attacks. Plot summary The story is set in the United States, presumably during the late 1980s or early 1990s. It begins with Yeager driving around Washington D.C with a rifle. In his personal campaign of assassination, he initially shoots racially mixed couples in parking lots. Over 22 days, his campaign leads to 12 victims in 6 shootings. In the narrative, Yeager is depicted as the hero. His campaign escalates to more sophisticated methods against higher-profile targets, including prominent journalists and politicians whom Yeager sees as promoting racial mixing. At the same time, Yeager and his girlfriend are developing connections with a white nationalist group. After several successful and increasingly ambitious attacks, Yeager is found and confronted by a senior agent of the FBI who himself is disgusted with \\"Jewish control\\" of the FBI and the American social situation. This agent blackmails Yeager into assisting him with his career by assassinating several Jewish FBI agents and targeting Mossad agents in the United States so that the agent can be appointed as the head of a newly formed antiterrorist secret police agency, assume increasing control of the United States and use his power to challenge and remove Jewish control of the government and media. At the same time, Yeager's white nationalist group achieves growing prominence through the insertion of one of their members into a Christian evangelist television broadcasting ministry, from which he is broadcasting increasingly racist and antisemitic messages. Yeager's campaign of assassination and terrorism, the actions of copycats and imitators, the white nationalist broadcasting effort, the efforts of the antiterrorist official, and a rapid decline of the US economy all work to push the United States towards increasing racial and social violence and fragmentation. Eventually, Yeager is faced with a dilemma when the government official for whom he has been working finally orders him to kill the undercover evangelist minister, whose efforts oppose the agent's intent to establish order and strike a temporary bargain with the Jews. Yeager attempts to avoid the assignment and then deliberately appears to bungle the assassination. At this point, Yeager is caught between the intentions of his government confederate (who intends to consolidate his own power and control over the government and reform the system from the top down after suppressing upcoming black nationalist riots) and the white-nationalist group who wishes to stir up the chaos even further, draw white Americans into battle, and eventually overthrow the government. Ultimately, Yeager kills the government agent. Following this, the Jewish-controlled media side with the black rioters, revealing that the government official would have been double-crossed had he attempted to strike his deal. Yeager and the other members of the group, now under increasing government scrutiny, resolve to continue their efforts and to go \\"underground\\" to continue the fight against the system.

Discovery and name Bacillus amyloliquefaciens was discovered in soil 1943 by a Japanese scientist named Fukumoto, who gave the bacterium its name because it produced (faciens) a liquifying (lique) amylase (amylo). Uses Alpha amylase from B. amyloliquefaciens is often used in starch hydrolysis. It is also a source of subtilisin, which catalyzes the breakdown of proteins in a similar way to trypsin. = Agriculture = Bacillus amyloliquefaciens is considered a root- colonizing biocontrol bacterium, and is used to fight some plant root pathogens in agriculture, aquaculture, and hydroponics. It has been shown to provide benefits to plants in both soil and hydroponic applications. It takes action against bacterial and fungi pathogens, and may prevent infection though competitive exclusion or out-competing the unwanted pathogen. It has been shown to be effective against several root pathogens that hurt agricultural yields in soil and hydroponics, such as Ralstonia solanacearum in tomatoes, Rhizoctonia solani in lettuce, Pythium in tomatoes, Alternaria tenuissima in English ivy and Fusarium in bananas and cucumbers. It also appears to improve root tolerance against abiotic stress, allowing plants such as maize to tolerate high salt concentrations in hydroponic applications, while also reducing salt concentrations in the plant tissue. Status as a species Between the 1940s and the 1980s, bacteriologists debated as to whether or not B. amyloliquefaciens was a separate species or a subspecies of Bacillus subtilis. The matter was settled in 1987; it was established to be a separate species.* In the American Type Culture Collection, the number for B. amyloliquefaciens is 23350.

The strike began on September 8, 1965, and one week later, the predominantly Mexican National Farmworkers Association (NFWA) joined the cause.Feriss, Susan; Sandoval, Ricardo; and Hembree, Diana. The Fight in the Fields: Cesar Chavez and the Farmworkers Movement. New York: Houghton Mifflin Courtyard, 1998. In August 1966, the AWOC and the NFWA merged to create the United Farm Workers (UFW) Organizing Committee.Hurt, R. Douglas and for farm growers to cease exposing farm workers to dangerous pesticides. American Agriculture: A Brief History. Lafayette, Ind.: Purdue University Press, 2002. The strike lasted for five years and was characterized by its grassroots efforts‚Äîconsumer boycotts, marches, community organizing and nonviolent resistance‚Äîwhich gained the movement national attention.Weber, Devra. Dark Sweat, White Gold: California Farm Workers, Cotton, and the New Deal. Berkeley, Calif.: University of California Press, 1996. On July 1970, the strike resulted in a victory for farm workers, due largely to a consumer boycott of non-union grapes, when a collective bargaining agreement was reached with major table grape growers, affecting more than 10,000 farm workers. The Delano grape strike is most notable for the effective implementation and adaptation of boycotts, the unprecedented partnership between Filipino and Mexican farm workers to unionize farm labor, and the resulting creation of the UFW labor union, all of which revolutionized the farm labor movement in America.  Background  Preceding the Delano grape strike was another grape strike organized by Filipino farm workers that occurred in Coachella Valley, California on May 3, 1965. Because the majority of strikers were over 50 years old and did not have families of their own due to anti-miscegenation laws, they were willing to risk what little they had to fight for higher wages. The strike succeeded in granting farm workers a 40-cent-per-hour raise, which resulted in a wage equivalent to the $1.40-per-hour wage that the recently outlawed braceros were paid. After the strike in Coachella, farm workers followed the grape-picking season and moved north to Delano. The Filipino farm workers who came up from Coachella were led by Larry Itliong, Philip Vera Cruz, Benjamin Gines, and Pete Velasco under the AWOC. Upon arriving in Delano, the farm workers were told by growers that instead of being paid the $1.40-per-hour wage they received in Coachella, they would be paid $1.20-per-hour, which was below the federal minimum wage. Despite attempts at negotiation, growers were not willing to raise wages since workers were easily replaceable. This pushed Itliong, who was the leader of the AWOC, to organize Filipino farm workers and pressure growers into granting them higher wages and better working conditions. On September 7, 1965, Itliong and Filipino farm workers gathered inside Filipino Community Hall, and the AWOC unanimously voted to go on strike the next morning.  Events of the Strike  On September 8, 1965, Itliong, Vera Cruz, Gines, Imutan, and more than 1,000 Filipino farm workers walked off of vineyards and began their strike against Delano table grape growers. In response to strikers, grape growers hired Mexican farm workers to cross the picket lines and break the strike, a tactic typically used to create conflict and reinforce divisions between Filipino and Mexican farm workers. To prevent the strike from ending in failure, Itliong sought out the help of Cesar Chavez, who was the leader of the newly established NFWA. Chavez initially declined Itliong's request because he believed the NFWA was not financially stable enough to join the strike. However, because NFWA members expressed a desire to support the Filipinos' efforts, Chavez decided to hold an emergency conference at the Our Lady of Guadalupe Church (Iglesia Nuestra Se√±ora de Guadalupe) on September 16 to allow NFWA members to decide for themselves whether or not to join the struggle at Delano. A crowd of more than twelve hundred supporters attended the meeting and overwhelmingly voted in favor of joining the strike, with members of Chavez's organization repeatedly chanting, \\"Huelga!\\" ‚Äì the Spanish word for strike ‚Äì in favor of supporting the Delano grape farmer workers.[Shaw, Randy. Beyond the Fields: Cesar Chavez, the UFW, and the Struggle for Justice in the 21st Century. California: U of California P, 2008. Print] September 16, 1965 marked the day that Filipino and Mexican farm workers officially joined forces to picket together and fight for farm labor justice. left On March 17, 1966 Cesar Estrada Chavez embarked on a three-hundred mile pilgrimage from Delano, California to the state's capital of Sacramento. This was an attempt to pressure the growers and the state government to answer the demands of the Mexican American and Filipino American farm workers which represented the Filipino-dominated Agricultural Workers Organizing Committee and the Mexican-dominated National Farm Workers Association, led by Cesar Chavez. The pilgrimage was also intended to bring widespread public attention to the farm worker's cause. Shortly after this, the National Farm Workers Association and the Agricultural Workers Organizing Committee merged and became known as the United Farm Workers Organizing Committee. In August 1966, the AFL-CIO charted the UFW, officially combining the AWOC and the NFWA. After a record harvest in the fall of 1965, thousands of California farm workers went on strike and demanded union representation elections. Many were arrested by police and injured by growers while picketing. The growers used many tactics to intimidate and harass the picketers. The growers were sure the strikers would maintain a position of nonviolence. The growers would push protesters, punch the strikers and jab elbows in to their ribs. Some growers drove their cars towards the protesters and swerving just as they reached the strikers. There were several cases where pesticide spraying equipment was used to drench picketers with deadly surfer, which temporarily blinded them. Chavez continued to encourage the people to \\"not react against the violence, but to react in such a way to get closer to our goal\\". There was a lot of support towards nonviolent protest across the country and he wanted to continue with that focus. Chavez stated \\"we can change the world if we do it nonviolent\\". Kallen, A Stuart.We are Not Beasts of Burden Cesar Chavez and The Delano Grape Strike. Minneapolis.2011. A Division of Lerner Publishing Group, Inc. Chavez sent two workers and a student activist to follow a grape shipment from one of the picketed growers to the end destination at the Oakland docks. Once there, the protestors were instructed to persuade the longshoremen to refrain from loading the shipment of grapes. The group was successful in its course of action, and this resulted in the spoilage of a thousand ten-ton cases of grapes which were left to rot on the docks. This event sparked the decision to use the protest tactic of boycotting as the means by which the labor movement would win the struggle against the Delano grape growers. This initial successful boycott was followed by a series of picket lines on Bay Area docks. The International Longshoremen's and Warehousemen's Union, whose members were responsible for loading the shipments, cooperated with the protesters and refused to load non- union grapes. Chavez's successful boycotting campaigns in the docks inspired him to launch a formal boycott against the two largest corporations which were involved in the Delano grape industry, Schenley Industries and the DiGiorgio Corporation. Starting in December 1965, Chavez's organization participated in several consumer boycotts against the Schenley corporation. The increased pressure from supporters in the business sector led to the farm workers‚Äô victory and acquisition of union contracts that immediately raised wages and established hiring halls in Delano, Coachella, and Lamont. The large corporations affected by the strikes led by Chavez employed fear tactics in order to protect profits. The documentary The Wrath of Grapes mentions that the Delano-based company, M Caratan Inc., hired criminals to break up farm workers voting to unionize. They attacked voters, overturned tables and even smashed ballot boxes. The DiGiorgio Corporation was finally pressured into holding an election among its workers allowing them to choose the union they wanted to represent them on August 30, 1967. This came as a result of the boycott tactic of blocking grape distribution centers. With their products not on the shelves of retailers as a result of the boycott, the DiGiorgio Corporation was pressured to answer to the demands of the farm workers. The result of the vote favored the union representation of the UFW, a 530 to 332 vote, against the representation of The Teamsters, which was the only union that was competing against the UFW in the election. In 1970s, the grape strike and boycott ended, when grape growers signed labor contracts with the union. The contracts included timed pay increase, health, and other benefits. =Geography= The grape strike officially began in Delano in September 1965. In December, union representatives traveled from California to New York, Washington, D.C., Pittsburgh, Detroit, and other large cities to encourage a boycott of grapes grown at ranches without UFW contracts. In the summer of 1966, unions and religious groups from Seattle and Portland endorsed the boycott. Supporters formed a boycott committee in Vancouver, prompting an outpouring of support from Canadians that would continue throughout the following years. In 1967, UFW supporters in Oregon began picketing stores in Eugene, Salem, and Portland. After melon workers went on strike in Texas, growers held the first union representation elections in the region, and the UFW became the first union to ever sign a contract with a grower in Texas. National support for the UFW continued to grow in 1968, and hundreds of UFW members and supporters were arrested. Picketing continued throughout the country, including in Massachusetts, New Jersey, Ohio, Oklahoma, and Florida. The mayors of New York, Baltimore, Philadelphia, Buffalo, Detroit, and other cities pledged their support, and many of them altered their cities‚Äô grape purchases to support the boycott. In 1969, support for farm workers increased throughout North America. The grape boycott spread into the South as civil rights groups pressured grocery stores in Atlanta, Miami, New Orleans, Nashville, and Louisville to remove non-union grapes. Student groups in New York protested the Department of Defense and accused them of deliberately purchasing boycotted grapes. On May 10, UFW supporters picketed Safeway stores throughout the U.S. and Canada in celebration of International Grape Boycott Day. Cesar Chavez also went on a speaking tour along the East Coast to ask for support from labor groups, religious groups, and universities. Mapping UFW Strikes, Boycotts, and Farm Worker Actions 1965-1975 shows over 1,000 farm worker strikes, boycotts, and other actions. Impact of the Strike The Delano strike and the events that transpired throughout 1960 to 1975 resulted in a victory for the UFW and farm workers. By 1968, the UFW had signed contracts with 10 different table grape growers, which included Schenley Industries and DiGiorgio Corporation, but strikes and boycotts did not cease until 1970, when 26 table grape growers signed contracts with the UFW. Contracts between the UFW and grape growers were the first of their kind in agricultural history, and alongside the immediate effects of these initial contracts such as the increase in wages and improved working conditions, some contracts included provisions regarding unemployment insurance, paid vacation days, and the creation of a special benefits fund. After the end of the grape strike in 1970, a strike against lettuce growers began. This led to conflict with the Teamsters union, in the Salinas Valley. In June 1975, California passed a law allowing for secret ballot union representation elections for farm workers. By mid-September, the UFW won the right to represent 4,500 workers at 24 farms, while the Teamsters won the right to represent 4,000 workers at 14 farms. The UFW won the majority of the elections in which it participated. The Teamsters signed an agreement with the UFW in 1977, promising to end its efforts to represent farm workers. The boycott of grapes, lettuce, and Gallo Winery products officially ended in 1978. Despite the successes achieved by the UFW, there were also negative outcomes that farm workers experienced. The most significant of these was the deteriorated relationship between the Filipino and Mexican farm workers. In the initial contracts, the UFW implemented the hiring hall system. The hiring hall system was established with the intent of ending farm workers' migration cycle, which the UFW believed would make for more organized and efficient harvesting. However, the hiring hall system split up many of the Filipino who had grown accustomed to migrating with the harvesting season. Following the strike the actions of Cesar Chavez were highlighted and remembered. One significant example was that a movie which shared Chavez's name was released in 2014. Less remembered were the many who were around him during the strike. Particularly forgotten was the efforts of Filipino Americans in the strike; for example in the movie about Chavez in the Delano Grape Strike, the Filipinos role was largely absent, except for one speaking line and a few group shots.

His second wife, Bridget Ayscough, was a close friend of Sarah Churchill, Duchess of Marlborough, and this connection led to Hanbury's appointment as one of the executors of John Churchill's will. The Pontymoile Gates, which now stand at the entrance to the park, were a gift from Sarah, and originally stood between Hanbury's house and the stables, before being moved to their present position in around 1835. They have a Grade II* listing. The present house at Pontypool Park was developed by John Hanbury (1744‚Äì1784) in the late 17th or very early 18th century. Hanbury continued his grandfather's development both of the business and the estate and in around 1762, he built the folly tower as an eyecatcher. His third son, Capel Hanbury, who subsequently appended Leigh to his surname, also worked to enhance the estate. Archdeacon Coxe stayed during his Welsh tours in 1799-1800, and described a visit to the tower in the company of Hanbury-Leigh and his wife: \\"From this eminence, the wild and fertile parts of Monmouthshire are beautifully combined. No traveller should quit Monmouthshire without enjoying the singular and almost boundless prospect\\". In the 1830s, Hanbury Leigh undertook a large expansion of the house, doubling its size, the construction of new stables to the northwest of the house, and the Shell Grotto in the park. The stables, which now house the Torfaen Museum, are listed Grade II* on Cadw's historic buildings record. In the 1920s, the Hanbury Leigh's ended their connection with the Pontypool Park estate, giving the house to the Roman Catholic Church, and selling the gardens and park to Pontypool Urban District Council. The house continues as a school, and the park is maintained by Torfaen County Borough Council. Landscape  = Location = The park occupies a large area to the east of Pontypool town centre. The main park starts at the Pontymoile Gates near New Inn and Pontymoile Basin, and finishes to the north close to St Alban's RC High School and Pontypool Museum. To the east the land rises to the tower and the grotto. Its western border follows the Afon Lwyd river and Pontypool Leisure Centre, and Italian Gardens are located close to the western periphery. There are landscaped areas such as the Italian Gardens (refurbished in 2006) and the Nant-y-Gollen Ponds (originally one large millpond used to power a forge downstream). Three main avenues divide the park; they all merge at the leisure centre near the park's centre. = Features = The park is set mostly to open grassland and mixed woodland with many old sweet chestnuts. One of the oldest, a 400-year-old hollow tree, was voted Welsh Tree of the Year for 2019. In 1923, the Gorsedd stone circle was created in time for the park to host the 1924 National Eisteddfod of Wales. There is also a double ice house near the old Pontypool House and Pontypool Museum. It has a Grade II listing. Pontypool's main leisure centre is located within the park. A dry ski slope was constructed in the park in 1975 and remains in use. The park also has outside tennis and netball courts and a bowling green. Pontypool RFC also is based in the park, at its 8,800-capacity stadium. There is also a bandstand that forms part of the venue (along with nearby Pontypool Museum) for the annual Jazz in the Park festival. The Folly Tower is a three-storey tower near the eastern edge of the park. Originally constructed by John Hanbury in 1762, it was demolished during the Second World War, after fears that it would act as a marker for German aircraft. The present tower is a replica, constructed in 1994. A short distance from this folly is the Shell Grotto. Designed by S. Gunston Tit, the structure was commissioned by Capel Hanbury Leigh and built in the 1830s. The garden historian Elisabeth Whittle describes the grotto as a \\"magnificant survivor\\". The interior is decorated with shells and bones, reputedly the work of Hanbury Leigh's first wife, Molly Mackworth. Both sites are open to the public at weekends from May to September. Restored in the 1990s, the grotto is a Grade II* listed building.

Description =Wet-season brood= upright The upperside of the male has the ground colour white. Forewing has the base densely and broadly irrorated with black scales which gradually merge along the costa into the black apical area that occupies about one-third of the wing, the inner margin of this area irregular, passing in a curve from costa to vein 4, thence vertically to vein 3 outwards in interspace 2 and irregularly to the dorsum; a curved preapical series of four or five white spots superposed on the black area. Hindwing: slightly irrorated (sprinkled) with black scales at base which leave a terminal series of large, somewhat diamond-shaped, black spots at the apices of veins 3 to 7. Underside, forewing: white, apex butter yellow, a somewhat narrow zigzag curved irregular black band from middle of costa to tornus. Hindwing: uniform butter yellow. Female has the upperside similar to that of the male, but differs in the much greater extent of the black area which occupies the outer apical half of the forewing and on the hindwing forms a broad continuous terminal band; the superposed spots on black area of forewing reduced to two and the irroration of black scales at the bases of the wings more dense; on the hindwing this latter extends subdorsally to the black terminal margin. Underside, forewing: white, basal half of cell suffused with sulphur yellow; a very broad curved black band crosses the wing from costa to tornus, the inner margin of this irregular, the outer margin fairly even; apex pearly bluish white. The hindwing is uniform, pearly bluish white. =Dry- season brood= The male has the upperside similar to the wet-season form but on the forewing the irroration of black scales at base and the black on apical area much restricted, the latter in most specimens has a more or less rubbed appearance; the white preapical spots very ill-defined. Hindwing: entirely white, in some specimens with a faint yellowish tinge. Underside, forewing: white, with a bluish tint broadly along the basal two-thirds of the costal margin; apex butter yellow; in a few specimens the usual black curved band that crosses the wing is indicated by a few detached black scales but in most it is entirely absent. The hindwing is uniform butter yellow. Female has the upperside similar to that of the wet-season form but the black area on both forewings and hindwings much restricted just as it is in the male. The underside is also similar to that of the wet-season form but on the forewing the curved black band is very much narrower, and the nacreous surface of the hindwing has more or less of a yellowish tinge. In both sexes and in both seasonal forms the antennae are black minutely speckled with white, the tufted hair on the head and thorax anteriorly greyish green, abdomen white; beneath: head and thorax pale yellowish white, abdomen white. The wingspan is 65‚Äì76 mm. This species is found in the Western Ghats and the hills of southern India.

History Ursuline Academy was founded in 1896 by the Ursuline sisters of Brown County, who also founded St. Ursula Academy and Chatfield College. Academics Ursuline offers a curriculum of over 100 courses specifically designed to prepare the student for the demands of college level programs. A modular schedule (see below) is enhanced by the open-area structure which provides flexible learning areas. Twenty-six different co- curricular activities are available to students including 13 different sports at various levels. The tuition for 2018-2019 is $13,299, $275 additional for technology; $175 additional for activity fee. Tuition does not include fees for Kairos and Graduation. Each class level has certain fees such as retreat fees, special class equipment fees, etc. =Modular schedule= During the 1970s, Ursuline switched to a modular schedule. This consists of 6 days (lettered A-F) each with 18 modules. Each mod is 20 min, with a 3 min passing time between each one added in 2004. Classes range from 2-4 modules long. Students say that the schedule works very well in helping them with time management and responsibility. Each also has a certain number of free mods each day to eat, study, do homework, work in the library, or socialize. As the choice of classes becomes more open to each student, free mods become more abundant. A typical student would have between 21 and 40 free mods a cycle, depending on the number of classes taken. Different schedule days are set up so that mods can be shortened, (to incorporate time for a pep rally, department meeting, etc.) but are never skipped. Clubs and activities Ursuline has an extensive Electronic and Digital Media Program, complete with six film courses and four digital media courses. Ursuline hosts the annual Golden Lion Awards Film Festival each Spring, which includes schools from Ohio, Kentucky, and Indiana. The Ursuline Writing Center is a service for students seeking dialogue and assistance regarding their writing. The Writing Center is staffed by carefully selected and trained upperclasswomen and the English Department faculty. Through one-on-one sessions of reading, response, conversation and writing -- peer tutors and faculty members assist students to become their own best composers and editors. Within this format, the center's core mission is to support writing at all grade levels and in all subjects and offered languages. The Writing Center is open every school day during Mods 3-16.

district in the Indian state of Rajasthan. Shrimali Brahmin Samaj - The origin, history, culture and tradition of the Shrimali Brahmin community is same The Shrimali Brahmins are considered the direct decendents of lord Brahma along with his grandson Ravana. This sect is considered to be the oldest existing sect of Brahminism making its roots in the Satyuga. It is believed that they are the teachers the Gurus of all other sects and are disciples of Lord Shiva About Shrimal is a place in India's Rajasthan State. presently known as Bhinmal. Shrimal is a combination of ‚ÄùShri‚Äù and ‚ÄùMal‚Äù. ‚ÄùShri‚Äù is popularly interpreted as Laksmi, the goddess of wealth. ‚ÄùShri‚Äù also means beauty and brightness, ‚ÄúMal‚Äù means place. Thus Shrimal about 800 years ago was a beautiful prosperous place where along with other castes, Goldsmiths too lived, created pieces of beauty out of gold and prospered with other communities. Unfortunately with constant invasions by foreigners on the North-Western borders of India, Shrimal broke down and thereby received the name Bhinmal. In Sanskrit language, the word Bhinna means broken or separated and therefore Bhinmal means broken place. According to Shrimal Puran (part of Skanda Puran) due to curse of Rishi Gautam and Goddess Laksmi Shrimali Nagar decentrised and its prosperity and population come down. Since Shrimal Nagar suffered a lot, the people living there were forced to migrate. Most of them started migrating towards Gujarat and Marwar (Rajasthan). Therefore, most of the Shrimali Brahmins presently residing in these two states, although they had moved and established presently all over the world with their traditional and modern professions, too. Scholars and specialists in Vedic culture of India, the ‚ÄúShrimali Brahmin‚Äù can be better identified in this Sanskrit Poem titled ‚ÄúVayam Shrimali‚Äù means \\"We are Shrimali\\". Mahakavi Magh: Maha kavi ‚ÄúMAGH ‚Äù was born about 675 AD. At Bhinmal in Rajasthan. He was the son of ‚Äúdattak‚Äù and grandson of ‚Äúsuperabhadeva‚Äù a minister of king ‚ÄúVarmalata‚Äùof Gujrat. ‚ÄúMagh‚Äù was a perfectionist. Nothing would satisfy him except the very best. Therefore, he wrote only one epic named, ‚ÄúShishupal Vadha‚Äù but it suffice to have his name appear alongside ‚ÄòKalidas‚Äô and ‚ÄòBharvi‚Äô. ‚ÄúShishupal vadha‚Äù contains 1650 stanzas and is in 20 canto. It is based on an episode of ‚ÄúMahabharat‚Äù during ‚ÄúRajasuya Yagya‚Äù performed by King Yudhisthir, there was altercation between Shishupal on the one hand, and Bhishma, Yudhisthir and Krishna on the other. Shishupal verbally abused Krishna. The verbal dual acquired such a dimension that Lord Krishna was constrained to halt ‚Äúshishupal‚Äù. It was but a small incident in the great story of Mahabharat. Magh's greatness lies in weaving a great epic covering all aspects of life around this small episode. He invested in this great work of all his rich vocabulary, pure grammar, all encompassing erudition and knowledge, command over the language, and ornate elegant style. For this single work, he is still renowned. His vocabulary was vast and limitless. So much so that, it is said that there is no word in Sanskrit dictionary which has not been used in the ‚ÄúShishupal Vadha‚Äù. In other words, the ‚ÄúShishupal Vadh‚Äù is a living dictionary of Sanskrit language, paying tribute to his prolific use of words. One commentator has aptly said: ‚ÄùNav Sarga gate maghe Navsshabda Na Vidyate‚Äù It means that even one reads up to the ninth canto of his work, one finds that no new word of Sanskrit is left to be discovered. Some poets concentrate on simile while others on style. But ‚ÄúMagh‚Äù was one great poet who used simile with great effect, had great felicity with the language, used meaningful words and was the master of ornate and exotic style. So it has been aptly said about him: ‚ÄúMaghe‚Äù santi trayo Guna It has been acknowledged by scholars that he combined in his persona, Kalidas's mastery over simile, Bharvi‚Äù flair for drawing word-pictures and dandi‚Äù elegant style of writing. He experimented with rare grammatical usage which shows that he was an artist and a great grammarian as well. Some of his verses are very fascinating and unique and they reflect his talent of playing with words. The following verse gives an idea of his talent: ‚Äù Raj Raj Raji Jaje Jiraojojo jaro o Rajaah Rejriju Rajo jarji Rarajarjur Jarjar ‚Äù In this Stanza he has mainly used two words named ‚ÄúRa‚Äù and Jha‚Äù. This is not a mean achievement. A few of his stanzas can be read backwards as well and in the ordinary way. He has used forty one metre in his classic where as Bharvi used only twenty-four metres. This is metrical profusion in wonderful. The ‚ÄùShishupal Vadha‚Äù shows that Magh‚Äùs knowledge was encyclopedic. In fact he was a versatile genius. He was well versed in shastras, was a master of polity and political science, was sensitive to understand the human frailties and human virtues and their impact on social interaction, had an eye for beauty, understood the effects of seasonal changes in climate and weather on human life and environment, had fair acquaintance with painting and sculptures, knew different philosophies and religions and was not unaware of human craving for eroticism. His reading encompassed among other subjects, Astrology, Astrinomy, Vedas, Vedantas, drama and science dealing with elephants and horses. ‚ÄúMagh‚Äù has described nature, mountains and rivers vividly. His description of beauty is unique. According to him, thing which changes every moment and appears fresh is beautiful in his own words . ‚ÄúKshane Kshane Yannavata Mupalti Tadaiv Rup Ramniyataya‚Äù Magh was not only a great poet but also a great human being. He received unaccountable wealth from his patron king Bhoj. At the same time he had also inherited substantial fortune from his father and grand father, yet he died in poverty because he was generous toward the poor, sharing his wealth with needy and distributed money freely in charity. He was an egalitarian. Indian post is happy to issue Commemorative Postage stamp on Maha Kavi Magh.

It is found in south and southeast Asia to Australia. Description This butterfly closely resembles Appias paulina but the males can be distinguished by the more acutely pointed forewing and the females by the narrower oblique black band on the underside of the forewing. Other differences are given below. left Variation =Wet-season form= Males have the upper forewings irrorated (sprinkled) with black scales at the apex and anteriorly along the termen, much more sparsely and narrower in general than in A. paulina. On the underside, the apex of the forewing and the whole surface of the hindwing are pale dull ochraceous, sometimes with a faint pinkish tint, but never pale yellow as in A. paulina. The sexes are dimorphic; the females differ as follows: 1st form: On the upperside, the posterior tornal portion of the black area on the forewing is not inwardly rounded, but straight and generally diffuse. The underside is very like the underside of the dry-season form of A. paulina female. It differs, however, in the narrowness of the oblique curved black band, the outer margin of which is irregularly zigzag, and never evenly curved as in A. paulina. 2nd form: Markings as in the 1st form, but the ground colour on the upperside is entirely pale yellow. On the underside, the apical half of the cell and the disc of the forewing up to the black band are pale sulphur yellow. The oblique curved black band is as in the 1st form and the interspace 1 is whitish. The rest of the forewing and the entire surface of the hindwing are rich chrome yellow. The antennae, head, thorax and abdomen are much as in A. paulina, but the antennae are dusky black and more closely speckled with white; the underside of the thorax is white in males, never yellow. =Dry-season form= Upper and undersides: similar to that of the wet-season specimens, but in the male the dusting of black scales on the upperside has almost, in some specimens completely, disappeared, while on the underside the ochraceous colouring is much paler. In the females both dimorphs differ but little from the dimorphs of the wet-season form, only on the upperside the black on the apical half of the forewing and on the terminal margin of the hindwing is more restricted, while on the underside the oblique curved black band that crosses the forewing is distinctly narrower with a tendency to become diffuse. The wingspan is 60‚Äì74 mm. It is found in Sikkim up to , Bengal, western and southern India. Also extending into north-eastern India, Burma and the Malay peninsula.

The aryl hydrocarbon receptor is a transcription factor that regulates gene expression. It was originally thought to function primarily as a sensor of xenobiotic chemicals and also as the regulator of enzymes such as cytochrome P450s that metabolize these chemicals. The most notable of these xenobiotic chemicals are aromatic (aryl) hydrocarbons from which the receptor derives its name. More recently, it has been discovered that AhR is activated (or deactivated) by a number of endogenous indole derivatives such as kynurenine. In addition to regulating metabolism enzymes, the AhR has roles in regulating immunity, stem cell maintenance, and cellular differentiation. The aryl hydrocarbon receptor is a member of the family of basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors. AHR binds several exogenous ligands such as natural plant flavonoids, polyphenolics and indoles, as well as synthetic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and dioxin-like compounds. AhR is a cytosolic transcription factor that is normally inactive, bound to several co-chaperones. Upon ligand binding to chemicals such as 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), the chaperones dissociate resulting in AhR translocating into the nucleus and dimerizing with ARNT (AhR nuclear translocator), leading to changes in gene transcription. Protein functional domains AhR Functional Domains The AhR protein contains several domains critical for function and is classified as a member of the basic helix-loop-helix/Per-Arnt-Sim (bHLH/PAS) family of transcription factors. The bHLH motif is located in the N-terminal of the protein and is a common entity in a variety of transcription factors. Members of the bHLH superfamily have two functionally distinctive and highly conserved domains. The first is the basic-region (b), which is involved in the binding of the transcription factor to DNA. The second is the helix-loop-helix (HLH) region, which facilitates protein-protein interactions. Also contained with the AhR are two PAS domains, PAS-A and PAS-B, which are stretches of 200-350 amino acids that exhibit a high sequence homology to the protein domains that were originally found in the Drosophila genes period (Per) and single-minded (Sim) and in AhR‚Äôs dimerization partner the aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator (ARNT). The PAS domains support specific secondary interactions with other PAS domain containing proteins, as is the case with AhR and ARNT, so that dimeric and heteromeric protein complexes can form. The ligand binding site of AhR is contained within the PAS-B domain and contains several conserved residues critical for ligand binding. Finally, a glutamine-rich (Q-rich) domain is located in the C-terminal region of the protein and is involved in co-activator recruitment and transactivation. Ligands AhR ligands have been generally classified into two categories, synthetic or naturally occurring. The first ligands to be discovered were synthetic and members of the halogenated aromatic hydrocarbons (polychlorinated dibenzodioxins, dibenzofurans and biphenyls) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (3-methylcholanthrene, benzo[a]pyrene, benzanthracenes and benzoflavones). Research has focused on naturally occurring compounds with the hope of identifying an endogenous ligand. Naturally occurring compounds that have been identified as ligands of Ahr include derivatives of tryptophan such as indigo dye and indirubin, tetrapyrroles such as bilirubin, the arachidonic acid metabolites lipoxin A4 and prostaglandin G, modified low-density lipoprotein and several dietary carotenoids. One assumption made in the search for an endogenous ligand is that the ligand will be a receptor agonist. However, work by Savouret et al. has shown this may not be the case since their findings demonstrate that 7-ketocholesterol competitively inhibits Ahr signal transduction. Carbidopa is a selective aryl hydrocarbon receptor modulator (SAhRM). Indolocarbazole (ICZ) is one of the strongest non- halogenated agonists for AHR in vitro reported. Signaling pathway AhR Signaling Pathway - Denison MS, Nagy SR (2003). \\"Activation of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor by structurally diverse exogenous and endogenous chemicals\\". Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 43: 309-34. *Reprinted, with permission, from the Annual Review of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Volume 43 (c)2003 by Annual Reviews. =Cytosolic complex= Non-ligand bound Ahr is retained in the cytoplasm as an inactive protein complex consisting of a dimer of Hsp90, prostaglandin E synthase 3 (PTGES3, p23) and a single molecule of the immunophilin-like AH receptor-interacting protein, also known as hepatitis B virus X-associated protein 2 (XAP2), AhR interacting protein (AIP), and AhR- activated 9 (ARA9). The dimer of Hsp90, along with PTGES3 (p23), has a multifunctional role in the protection of the receptor from proteolysis, constraining the receptor in a conformation receptive to ligand binding and preventing the premature binding of ARNT. AIP interacts with carboxyl-terminal of Hsp90 and binds to the AhR nuclear localization sequence (NLS) preventing the inappropriate trafficking of the receptor into the nucleus. =Receptor activation= Upon ligand binding to AhR, AIP is released resulting in exposure of the NLS, which is located in the bHLH region, leading to import into the nucleus. It is presumed that once in the nucleus, Hsp90 dissociates exposing the two PAS domains allowing the binding of ARNT. The activated AhR/ARNT heterodimer complex is then capable of either directly or indirectly interacting with DNA by binding to recognition sequences located in the 5‚Äô- regulatory region of dioxin-responsive genes. =DNA binding (xenobiotic response element ‚Äì XRE)= The classical recognition motif of the AhR/ARNT complex, referred to as either the AhR-, dioxin- or xenobiotic- responsive element (AHRE, DRE or XRE), contains the core sequence 5'-GCGTG-3' within the consensus sequence 5'-T/GNGCGTGA/CG/CA-3' in the promoter region of AhR responsive genes. The AhR/ARNT heterodimer directly binds the AHRE/DRE/XRE core sequence in an asymmetric manner such that ARNT binds to 5'-GTG-3' and AhR binding 5'-TC/TGC-3'. Recent research suggests that a second type of element termed AHRE-II, 5'-CATG(N6)C[T/A]TG-3', is capable of indirectly acting with the AhR/ARNT complex. Regardless of the response element, the end result is a variety of differential changes in gene expression. Functional role in physiology and toxicology =Role in development= In terms of evolution, the oldest physiological role of Ahr is in development. Ahr is presumed to have evolved from invertebrates where it served a ligand- independent role in normal development processes. The Ahr homolog in Drosophila, spineless (ss) is necessary for development of the distal segments of the antenna and leg. Ss dimerizes with tango (tgo), which is the homolog to the mammalian Arnt, to initiate gene transcription. Evolution of the receptor in vertebrates resulted in the ability to bind ligand and might have helped humans evolve to tolerate smoke of fires. In developing vertebrates, Ahr seemingly plays a role in cellular proliferation and differentiation. Despite lacking a clear endogenous ligand, AHR appears to play a role in the differentiation of many developmental pathways, including hematopoiesis, lymphoid systems, T-cells, neurons, and hepatocytes. AhR has also been found to have an important function in hematopoietic stem cells: AhR antagonism promotes their self-renewal and ex-vivo expansion and is involved in megakaryocyte differentiation. =Adaptive and innate response= The adaptive response is manifested as the induction of xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes. Evidence of this response was first observed from the induction of cytochrome P450, family 1, subfamily A, polypeptide 1 (Cyp1a1) resultant from TCDD exposure, which was determined to be directly related to activation of the Ahr signaling pathway. The search for other metabolizing genes induced by Ahr ligands, due to the presence of DREs, has led to the identification of an \\"Ahr gene battery\\" of Phase I and Phase II metabolizing enzymes consisting of CYP1A1, CYP1A2, CYP1B1, NQO1, ALDH3A1, UGT1A2 and GSTA1. Presumably, vertebrates have this function to be able to detect a wide range of chemicals, indicated by the wide range of substrates Ahr is able to bind and facilitate their biotransformation and elimination. The AhR may also signal the presence of toxic chemicals in food and cause aversion of such foods. AhR activation seems to be also important for immunological responses and inhibiting inflammation through upregulation of interleukin 22 and downregulation of Th17 response. The Knockdown of AHR mostly downregulates the expression of innate immunity genes in THP-1 cells. =Toxic response= Extensions of the adaptive response are the toxic responses elicited by Ahr activation. Toxicity results from two different ways of Ahr signaling. The first is a side effect of the adaptive response in which the induction of metabolizing enzymes results in the production of toxic metabolites. For example, the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon benzo[a]pyrene (BaP), a ligand for Ahr, induces its own metabolism and bioactivation to a toxic metabolite via the induction of CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 in several tissues. The second approach to toxicity is the result of aberrant changes in global gene transcription beyond those observed in the \\"Ahr gene battery.\\" These global changes in gene expression lead to adverse changes in cellular processes and function. Microarray analysis has proved most beneficial in understanding and characterizing this response. Protein- protein interactions In addition to the protein interactions mentioned above, AhR has also been shown to interact with: *AIP, * ARNTL, * CCNT1, * ESR1, * NCOA1, * NEDD8 * NRIP1, * RELA, * RELB, and * RP.

A treatise of Schemes & Tropes Sherry mentions the miles gloriosus character from the plays of the Roman playwright Plautus. The miles gloriosus (meaning \\"braggart soldier\\") is a stock character from Plautus established in a play by Plautus. The miles gloriosus was a soldier who, although a coward, bragged excessively about past experiences.Cuddon, J.A., ed. The Penguin Dictionary of Literary Terms and Literary Theory. 3rd ed. Penguin Books: New York, 1991. The most famous miles gloriosus in theatre is probably Shakespeare's Sir John Falstaff. Falstaff is a fat old knight in the service of the English king who brags about his battle experiences, despite being cowardly and averse to battle.Cummings Study Guides (2006). Henry IV Part II In one scene, Falstaff says > I would to God my name were not so terrible to the enemy as it is.

This is obviously bomphiologia on Falstaff's part. Uses Bomphiologia can be used to comic effect,HighBeam Research (2006). A Catalogue of Selected Rhetorical Devices Used in the Works of Edgar Allan Poe as in the above hyperbolic instance with the character of Falstaff. This is an ironic use of the term, because Falstaff is an old, fat drunkard‚Äî-obviously in no condition to be scaring enemies as he claims to be. Edgar Allan Poe used bomphiologia as a part of his style. One instance of this is in the following passage > two cats ... alighting opposite one another on my visage, betook themselves > to indecorous contention for the paltry consideration of my nose. (\\"Loss of > Breath\\" 2:159)The Works of Edgar Allan Poe (2006). Loss of Breath This could have been simply stated, \\"Two cats fought over my nose.\\" Instead, Poe presents a more stylized version which fills out the personality of his narrator. It lets the reader know that the story is told by an unreliable narrator who is prone to exaggeration.

Jagger loads his boat full of lumber at the Albany Lumber District in Albany, New York in the 1870s A lumber yard is a location where lumber and wood-related products used in construction and/or home improvement projects are processed or stored. Some lumber yards offer retail sales to consumers, and some of these may also provide services such as the use of planers, saws and other large machines. Generally, timber yards are locations where raw logs and other wood or forest products are processed and stored.D√∂ring, Stephan (2012). Power from Pellets: Technology and Applications. Springer. pp. 72-74. The terms \\"lumber yard\\" and \\"timber yard\\" are sometimes used interchangeably, and timber yards may include additional aspects that lumber yards encompass, and vice versa. Overview Lumber yards sell products made at lumber mills, where customers pick up products at the yard themselves or request that an order be built and delivered to them by the lumber yard. Lumber yards may also sell wood-plastic composites, such as Trex, any other type of construction material or supplies, and general hardware store items. Lumber yards are the primary resources for contractors and homeowners when construction material is needed. Home Depot stores also have lumber sections, but this may not be considered a lumber yard, although it serves the same purpose. Lumber yards use forklift trucks to move the large heavy units of lumber around the yard. Saws may also be available to cut boards to a desired length for customers. At timber yards (also sometimes referred to as lumber yards), logs and other forest products are processed and stored. Additional activities include inspection for signs of rot, utilizing stacking techniques to prevent rot from forming, and the removal of bark and spraying of pesticides to prevent insect infestation.Jahnel, Franz (2000). Manual of Guitar Technology: The History and Technology of Plucked String Instruments. Bold Strummer. p. 67. Some lumber/timber yards use cranes to move logs, and sprinklers to keep the logs moist. By country =United Kingdom= England Ransfords, located in Shropshire, England, operates one of the largest timber yards in Europe,Flint, David; Owen, Andy (contributors) (1995). Geography in Action,. Heinemann. Volume 1. p. 64. and processes 70,000 tonnes of logs annually. =United States= Products Some lumber yards sell products that are assessed and certified by the Forest Stewardship Council's (FSC), per its standards. One lumber yard in Portland, Oregon limits its product line to only those that meet or exceed FSC's requirements. In 2008, Sustainable Northwest, a nonprofit environmental group in Portland, Oregon, began operations sourcing and purveying environmentally friendly \\"green wood\\" products. The group specializes in offering wood products that are sourced from trees in non- threatened forests. Fires In the United States, the National Fire Protection Association has been documenting incidences of lumber yard fires since 1998. Products at lumber yards are very prone to fires, and electrical problems at lumber yards are a significant cause of fires. In Murray, Utah, after a large lumber yard fire caused approximately US$1 million in damage at the CECO Concrete Construction company, city residents called for companies in the city to take further preventative actions to prevent fires from occurring. In some cities, such as Phoenix, Arizona, city fire protection and prevention codes for lumber yards exist.

Description  The species has pale and dark morphs in Australia.Grund, R. Catopsilia pomona datasheet Accessed:September 2006 The form crocale has the antennae black and the form pomona has the antennae pinkish or red.

Each egg is white, bottle shaped, and ribbed vertically. The eggs hatch in 3‚Äì4 days. = Caterpillar (larva) = The newly hatched caterpillar is about 0.5 cm long and is yellowish green. In later instars the colour changes to a leafy green. The head is green and spotted with tiny black tubercules. The spiracles are covered with a continuous white line. Each segment of the body bears tiny shiny black tubercules.

The paired lines are found on both sides of the body and run from head to anus. The similar Catopsilia pyranthe caterpillar has a much broader black line leaving only a narrow green line on the back of the body. The larva is described by Thomas Reid Davys Bell as \\"The head is round, green, the clypeus edged with brown, covered with small shiny black tubercles which... do not hide the colour of the head; the anal flap is rounded, but looks square at the extremity, and is covered with rows of small black tubercles... of which only the row along the spiracular line is conspicuous.

A longtime anti-slavery activist, after leaving the Jacksonians in the 1830s, Brainerd was active in the Whig, Liberty, and Free Soil parties, and was one of the organizers of the Republican Party when it was formed as the main anti-slavery party in the mid-1850s. Brainerd's longtime commitment to the cause of abolition was recognized in 1854, when opponents of slavery in the Vermont General Assembly chose him to fill a five-month vacancy in the United States Senate. A native of East Hartford, Connecticut, Brainerd was raised by an uncle from the age of nine, and grew up in Troy, New York and St. Albans, Vermont. He taught school and worked as a store clerk, then began a business career of his own while still a teenager. He operated a successful store, then expanded his holdings to include a successful farm, as well as interests in banking, railroads, railroad construction, and steamships on Lake Champlain. Brainerd had extensive real estate holdings in and around St. Albans, including farms where he raised horses. In 1856, he was chosen to serve as president of the Vermont Agricultural Society. Brainerd became involved in the Congregational church at a young age and was a prominent advocate of temperance. Brainerd became active in politics first as a Jacksonian, and he represented St. Albans in the Vermont House of Representatives from 1834 to 1835. An opponent of slavery, Brainerd joined the Whigs, but became dissatisfied with the party's attempts to chart a middle ground on the issue, and became an adherent of the abolitionist Liberty Party, and later the Free Soil Party. Brainerd was the unsuccessful Liberty Party candidate for governor of Vermont in 1846, 1847, 1848, 1852, and 1854, but his candidacies served to increase awareness of the abolitionist position on slavery. In October 1854, Brainerd's years of advocacy in the cause of anti-slavery were recognized when anti-slavery Whigs, Liberty Party members, and Free Soil Party members in the Vermont General Assembly combined to elect Brainerd to fill a short term vacancy in the United States Senate. He served until March 1854, and was succeeded by Jacob Collamer. In 1855, Brainerd was one of the organizers of the new Republican Party when it was created as the main anti-slavery political organization. He served as the first chairman of Vermont's Republican Party, and was one of the handful of state chairmen who issued the call for the party's first national convention in 1856. Brainerd was a delegate, and called the convention to order as its temporary chairman. Brainerd died in St. Albans on May 9, 1870. He was buried at Greenwood Cemetery in St. Albans. Early life Brainerd was born in East Hartford, Connecticut on March 16, 1794, the fifth of thirteen children born to Ezra Brainerd and Mabel (Porter) Brainerd. In 1803, Brainerd went to Troy, New York to reside with his uncle, Joseph S. Brainerd. In 1808, they moved to St. Albans, Vermont. Brainerd was educated in Troy and St. Albans, and attended St. Albans Academy. He taught school for two years, then began a business career as a clerk in a St. Albans store. During the War of 1812, Brainerd served as a sergeant in Colonel Luther Dixon's Regiment of Vermont Militia. During the war, the area around St. Albans and Swanton was contested, with smugglers vying to move goods to the Canadian side of the border and militia patrols attempting to interdict their activities. In addition, British and Canadian forces raided northern Vermont several times during the war, and American soldiers and Vermont militia conducted raids on the Canadian side of the border. Brainerd continued his militia membership after the war and received a commission as a first lieutenant in 1st Artillery Company, 1st Regiment, 3rd Brigade. His membership in Vermont's militia continued for several years, and he was promoted to captain during his service. In 1816, Brainerd went into business as the owner of a store, and his venture proved successful. One his early efforts to expand his holdings included the purchase of 1,200 acres of swampland near Lake Champlain, which he drained, improved, and developed into a successful sheep farm. Brainerd continued to take part in successful business enterprises, frequently in partnership with John Smith and Smith's son J. Gregory Smith, including construction and operation of several railroads in Vermont and Canada that were combined to form the Central Vermont Railway. In addition, he was involved in ownership and operation of several banks, and became active in the transport of cargo on Lake Champlain as the owner and operator of several steamboats and steamships. Brainerd owned real estate throughout St. Albans, including farms where he raised horses. Because he was opposed to slavery, Brainerd used his home and other properties as hiding places for runaway slaves attempting to escape to Canada on the Underground Railroad. In 1839, a large, aggressive gray wolf attacked flocks and herds throughout Franklin County and became a cause for concern among farmers and townspeople. Brainerd, whose size, strength, and skills as an outdoorsman were the subject of local renown, successfully hunted the wolf. A monument commemorating his deed was later placed on Aldis Hill in St. Albans, near the spot where Brainerd caught up to and killed the wolf. In 1856, he was elected president of the Vermont Agricultural Society. Brainerd was an active member of the Congregational church and a long time advocate for the temperance movement. In addition, he was a longtime supporter of the American Missionary Association and served a term as its president. Political career Brainerd became involved in local politics and government with an appointment as deputy sheriff of Franklin County, Vermont. In 1834 he was elected to the Vermont House of Representatives as a Jacksonian, and he served from 1834 to 1835. Brainerd became increasingly opposed to slavery, and left the Jacksonians for the Whigs. Brainerd's anti-slavery views caused him to leave the Whigs in 1840 out of dissatisfaction with the party's attempts to find a compromise position on the slavery issue. He joined the new Liberty Party, and was its unsuccessful candidate for governor of Vermont in 1846, 1847, 1848, 1852, and 1854. =United States Senator= In September 1854, Brainerd narrowly lost the election for a seat in the Vermont Senate in which he ran as the nominee of the Free Soil Party. In October, he was chosen by the Vermont General Assembly to fill a United States Senate vacancy, which had occurred when Senator William Upham died in January 1853. The Vermont General Assembly failed to choose a successor after Upham's death, so in December 1853 the governor appointed former Senator Samuel S. Phelps to fill the vacancy. Phelps served until the U.S. Senate resolved in March 1854 that he was not entitled to his seat, reasoning that while the governor could make an appointment while the state legislature was not in session, it fell to the legislature to make a selection if it was in session. When the new legislative session began in October 1854, anti-slavery members of the legislature honored Brainerd's years of commitment to their cause by choosing him to succeed Phelps. Brainerd was not a candidate for election to a full term, and served from October 14, 1854 to March 3, 1855. Brainerd took part in one session of Congress from December 1854 to March 1855, and was a member of the Committee on Claims. He was succeeded by Jacob Collamer and returned to his banking and business interests. Later life In 1855, Brainerd was one of the organizers of the new Republican Party, which was founded as the country's main anti-slavery political organization. He served as the first chairman of the Vermont Republican Party, and was one of five state party chairmen who issued the call for the first Republican National Convention in 1856. Brainerd was a delegate, and as the temporary chairman he called the convention to order for its first session. Brainerd was subsequently chosen to serve as one of the convention's vice chairmen, and was appointed as a member of the Republican National Committee. Brainerd was chosen as one of Vermont's presidential electors after the 1856 election. When Vermont's electors met in December to cast their ballots, Brainerd was chosen as their chairman. They all voted for the Republican ticket of John C. Fr√©mont for president and William L. Dayton for vice president, who carried Vermont but lost the election. Brainerd was the chairman of Vermont's delegation to the 1860 Republican National Convention. On the first ballot, Vermont's delegates supported Jacob Collamer as a favorite son. Afterwards, Brainerd and the Vermont delegation supported Abraham Lincoln, who received the nomination on the third ballot. In 1864, Brainerd was succeeded on the Republican National Committee by Abraham B. Gardner. Death and burial Brainerd remained active in his business ventures until his death in St. Albans on May 9, 1870. He was buried at Greenwood Cemetery in St. Albans. Family In 1819, Brainerd married Fidelia B. Gadcomb. They were the parents of 12 children: * Ann Eliza (1819-1905) * Laura Aldis (1821-1821) * Lawrence H.

It is also known as endoventricular circular patch plasty (EVCPP). In 1985, Dor introduced EVCPP as a viable method for restoring a dilated left ventricle (LV) to its normal, elliptical geometry. The Dor procedure uses a circular suture and a Dacron patch to correct LV aneurysms and exclude scarred parts of the septum and ventricular wall and would prove to be the best option amongst the other methods of ventricular remodeling, i.e. Cooley‚Äôs linear suturing and Jatene‚Äôs circular external suturing. EVCPP is a relatively easy procedure that covers all aspects of successful heart restoration‚Äîrestores ventricular shape, increases ejection fraction, decreases the left ventricular end systolic volume index (LVESVI), and allows for complete coronary revascularization. Cardiac geometry The myocardium consists of a single, vascular, continuous tissue that wraps around itself, spiraling up from the apex of the heart, to form a helix with elliptically shaped ventricles. This spiral produces an oblique muscle fiber orientation, meaning that the fibers form a more ventricle ‚Äòx‚Äô shape, so that when fibers shorten 15%, it produces a 60% ejection fraction. Because of its elliptical shape and defined apex, the ventricle is subjected to a relatively low level of lateral stress. Indications A dilated left ventricle is generally due to the effects of a myocardial infarction. An occlusion, or blockage, results in either akinetic (non-beating) or dyskinetic (irregular beating) tissue downstream from the occlusion. This tissue is virtually useless. However, the volume of blood that fills the ventricle prior to contraction, or end-diastolic volume, remains constant, so the tissue that still functions has to do more work to eject the blood, as the Frank-Starling Laws demand. The tension on the functioning tissue increases as it compensates for the work of the necrotic tissue, so, as per Laplace's law, the radius of the ventricle increases and the thickness of the ventricular wall decreases. The apex of the heart becomes circular, hypertrophy ensues in the viable myocardial tissue, and the valve opening widens. As the ventricle dilates, the muscle fiber orientation, which is critical to a good ejection fraction, becomes transverse, or more horizontal. Subsequently, the ejection fraction decreases; a 15% shortening produces only a 30% ejection fraction. The lateral stress on the ventricle increases. Overall, the dilated left ventricle cannot produce a strong enough contraction. Nonviable myocardial muscle mass (NVMMM) implies a distinct, inexpensively reproduced signature (electrocardiography and echocardiography) of several contemporary myocardial performance determinants when compared to viable myocardial muscle mass (VMMM). Ratio between the two in heart failure on a time curve is a determinate of compensatory geometric remodeling of the myocardium. Fick/Frank/Starling describes gas diffusion, fluid and compliance relationships of the myocardium, primarily in systole. Geometric derangement induced by nonviable myocardium (see myocardial infarction) is exponentially impacted and proportional to the weight of the performance determinant measured. Viable/Nonviable myocardial mass fraction is substantially reduced by surgical interventions such as Dor and Batista. Patient evaluation Doctors take a cardiac MRI to determine extent and location of the damage. Occasionally this reveals that the patient may be better suited for biventricular pacing or a defibrillator, but if the cardiologist determines that the Dor procedure is necessary, then the patient must display other symptoms to indicate that they would be a good candidate, including: angina, heart failure, arrhythmias or a combination of the three, large areas of akinesis or dyskensis, ejection fraction of less than forty percent Contraindications include: dysfunctional right ventricle, pulmonary hypertension, dysfunction at the base of the heart, systolic pulmonary artery pressure greater than 60mmHg (in the absence of severe mitral regurgitation) Procedure Surgeons usually perform the Dor procedure following a coronary artery bypass graft (CABG). EVCPP consumes only approximately twenty minutes of the three- to four-hour procedure. To begin a basic remodeling, the surgeon makes an incision at the center of the depressed area on the LV wall and removes blood clots and endocardial scar tissue. To restore the heart to its elliptical shape, an endoventricular suture is put in place and a longitudinal tuck is made to return the cardiac apex from the posterior to the front. The suture also serves as guidance for the patch location. The surgeon then inserts a balloon into the ventricular cavity to ensure correct size and sutures a Dacron patch, deflating the balloon and removing it before complete closure. The non-viable fibrous tissue is pulled over the patch, and surgical glue is occasionally used to complete the closure. When the lesion is placed on the anteroseptoapical wall of the heart, it will include the septum and apex more extensively than the lateral wall. As a result, the suture is placed deeply within the septum, and the new neck of the suture, which holds the Dacron patch, extends from the septum. Dor explicates this procedure in detail. When the lesion is placed on the posterolateral wall of the heart, a triangular patch is used and stabilized by the posterior mitral annulus. This placement of the lesion allows for mitral valve replacement to be easily conducted by the transventricular approach. (The surgeon does not have to incise the atrium, rather can replace the valve through the already incised ventricle.) It is recommended that the patient be placed on a mild anti- coagulant post operation to reduce the risk of blood clots. Some surgeons suggest the use of stronger anti-coagulants. Disadvantages The disadvantage to the Dor procedure is that it places synthetic tissue inside the LV cavity. However, it is possible to replace the Dacron patch with autologous tissue. The surgeon can make a semicircular patch, mobilized with a septal hinge, out of the endocardial scar or use autologous patches of the pericardium. Results The Dor procedure requires a hospital stay of approximately 8 days, which is only one day longer than CABG, and the early mortality rate is about 5.6%. Post-operation, the patient does not have any lifestyle constraints other than those associated with CABG. There is a 4% chance the patient will require another cardiac operation: 18% of patients who underwent CABG had recurrent heart failure. Because the Dor procedure restores the left ventricle to its correct, elliptical orientation, it results in a mean ejection fraction increase of 12.5%. This number continues to improve over the patient‚Äôs lifetime, and patients can expect to live an extra 4‚Äì10 years, which is 3.3% longer than CABG alone with virtually no extra risk.

He was most notable for his service as a United States Senator from Vermont. A native of Leicester, Massachusetts, Upham was raised in Leicester and Montpelier, where his family moved in 1802. he was educated locally and worked on the family farm until he lost his right hand in an accident when he was fifteen. He then completed an academic course at Montpelier Academy and with local tutors in preparation to study law. He was admitted to the bar in 1811 and practiced in Montpelier. Upham was an advocate for reform causes including temperance and the abolition of slavery, and changed his party affiliation several times as the anti-slavery movement grew and coalesced, going from the National Republicans to the Anti-Masonic Party to the Whigs in the 1830s. He was a leader of both the Anti-Masons and the Whigs, represented Montpelier in the Vermont House of Representatives twice (1827-1829, 1830-1831), and served a term as State's Attorney of Washington County (1829-1830). In 1842, Upham was elected to the U.S. Senate. He was reelected in 1848 and served from March 4, 1843 until his death. As a senator, Upham opposed U.S. involvement in the Mexican-American War and the extension of slavery. He became ill in late 1852, and died in Washington, D.C. on January 14, 1853. He was believed to have contracted smallpox and was assumed to be contagious. As a result, his funeral was held quickly, and he was buried at Congressional Cemetery in Washington rather than being returned to Vermont for burial. Early life William Upham was born in Leicester, Massachusetts on August 5, 1792, a son of Samuel Upham and Martha \\"Patty\\" (Livermore) Upham.Edmund Rice (1638) Association, 2009. Descendants of Edmund Rice: The First Nine Generations. He moved with his family to Montpelier, Vermont in 1802. Upham worked on his family's farm and attended the district schools until age 15, when he sustained an injury after catching his hand in a cider mill; all the fingers of his right hand were crushed, resulting in the amputation of his whole hand, including the fingers and palm. Upham then followed an academic course with the intent of pursuing a professional career, and attended Montpelier Academy and classes with two private tutors. He attended the University of Vermont, then studied law, first with Cyrus Ward, then with Samuel Prentiss. In 1835, the university awarded Upham the honorary degree of master of arts. Early career Upham was admitted to the bar in 1811 and commenced practice in Montpelier in partnership with Nicholas Baylies, which they maintained for several years, after which Upham practiced as the senior partner of his own firm. In addition to maintaining a successful practice, Upham also guided the efforts of several prospective lawyers who studied in his office, including Peter T. Washburn. Upham became active in politics as a member of the National Republican Party and was an advocate for several reform causes including the abolition of slavery and the temperance movement. He was a member of the Vermont House of Representatives from 1827 to 1829 and was State's Attorney for Washington County from 1829 to 1830. In 1830 he was again elected to the Vermont House of Representatives, and he served until 1831. In the early 1830s, Upham joined the new Anti-Masonic Party and he served as president of its 1832 Vermont state convention. In 1834, Upham was the unsuccessful Whig and Anti-Masonic nominee for the United States House of Representatives in Vermont's 5th District. The highest finishers were the Democratic nominee, Isaac Fletcher and Upham. Because neither received a majority, a second election was held; Upham declined to continue as a candidate, and the election was won by Whig and Anti-Mason Henry Fisk Janes, who defeated Fletcher. In the mid 1830s, Upham served as chairman of Vermont's Whig Party. In 1838, he was again an unsuccessful candidate for Congress, losing to Isaac Fletcher. In 1840, he campaigned throughout the state for Whig presidential nominee William Henry Harrison, who was elected. United States Senator Illustration of Upham circa 1850, based on contemporary photo In 1842 Samuel Prentiss resigned his seat in the U.S. Senate in order to accept appointment as judge of the United States District Court for the District of Vermont. Samuel C. Crafts was appointed to fill the vacancy, and served until the end of the term to which Prentiss had been elected, April 23, 1842 to March 3, 1843. Crafts was not a candidate for a full term, and Upham was the successful Whig candidate for the seat. He was reelected in 1848 and served from March 4, 1843 until his death. While in the Senate, he was chairman of the Committee on Agriculture (28th Congress) and the Committee on Pensions (29th Congress). As an opponent of slavery, Upham argued against U.S. involvement in the Mexican-American War, and introduced resolutions calling for immediate withdrawal from Mexico or a quick conclusion to the war. He was an opponent of allowing slavery to extend beyond where it already existed, and voted against the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 and other details related to the Compromise of 1850. He was also a proponent of the Wilmot Proviso, which would have prevented the U.S. from extending slavery into any territory acquired as a result of the Mexican War. Death and burial Upham died of smallpox in Washington, D.C. on January 14, 1853; because he was believed to be contagious, his funeral was held quickly, and his remains were not returned to Vermont. He was buried at Congressional Cemetery. Quotations *\\"...Slavery is a crime against humanity and a sore evil in the body politic.\\" Hamilton, Holman.

The forewing is with or without a discocellular black spot, that varies in size; costa and termen sometimes without a black margin; occasionally the costa has its apical third narrowly black, broadened slightly at the apex with black spots between the anterior veins; or again, the costa may be narrowly black, the apex very broadly so, and this colour continued down the termen but narrowed posteriorly. The hindwing is sometimes immaculate, but generally with narrow terminal black spots at the apices of the veins, these often reduced to mere dots, or again so broadened as to coalesce into a narrow terminal black margin. The underside's ground colour is similar, suffused on the anterior half of the forewing and over the whole surface of the hindwing with a greenish tint that varies to an ochraceous yellow, and, except in the very palest specimens, is evenly irrorated (sprinkled) over the greenish or ochraceous-tinted areas with transverse, short, reddish-brown strigae; both forewings and hindwings with generally an obscure discocellular reddish-brown spot or indication thereof. =Female= The upperside is as in the male, but sometimes with a suffusion of pale greenish yellow on the terminal third or fourth only of both forewings and hindwings, rarely of that tint throughout. The forewing is always with a discocellular black spot that varies very much in size; costa sometimes narrowly black with the basal half pinkish, in other specimens narrowly black throughout, the black broadened at the apex and continued along the anterior half of the termen in a series of inwardly-pointed black spots; or again, the costa may be more broadly black, that colour widened considerably at the apex and continued broadly down the termen to vein 3, then suddenly narrowed to a slender line at the tornus. In most specimens there is an anterior postdiscal short black macular baud; in the dark forms this coalesce with the black on apex and termen. The hindwing is sometimes immaculate, sometimes with a series of terminal spots at the apices of the veins, sometimes with a narrow dusky- black terminal band broadest near the apex, narrowed posteriorly to a slender line at the tornus. In the very dark specimens there is in addition an ill- defined, short anterior postdiscal macular black band. The underside is as in the male, with similar variations, but in addition in most specimens the discocellular spots are well defined with an outer red ring that encircles a silvery spot; on the hindwing one or two similar spots on each side of the discocellulars; generally also both wings are crossed by a transverse postdiscal line of minute red spots, which on the forewing is confined to the anterior portion, on the hindwing is nearly complete. In both sexes: antennae reddish, head and thorax anteriorly brown, thorax clothed posteriorly with long white hairs, abdomen white: beneath: the palpi, thorax, and abdomen white.

Tor Books) Cover artist Bob Eggleton The Dragon Society (2001) is the second fantasy novel of The Obsidian Chronicles, a trilogy by Lawrence Watt-Evans. Plot introduction After the events of the first book, Dragon Weather, Arlian finds himself armed with the knowledge of how dragons reproduce. It is a nasty and terrible business and Arlian wishes to prevent dragons from ever reproducing. Using the magic gathered in Arithei, he continues his quest. He realizes that if he is to fulfill his quest of destroying the dragons he must destroy the entire dragon society which is made up of dragon hearts. Dragon hearts are those who have drunk a mixture of human blood and dragon venom and gain a long extended life and a baby dragon growing in their heart; ironically, Arlian is himself such a dragon heart, and he to would give birth to a dragon in a thousand years unless he does something to prevent that. Arlian and his best friend Black hunt down the dragons in the hope that if Arlian kills a dragon the duke will assist him in destroying the dragon menace. In the end he removes a dragon from the heart of a Lady Rime which wakes up its mother - as it turns out, dragons care for their offspring as much as do humans and other creatures. The mother dragon comes to Manfort to kill Arlian but instead falls victim to an obsidian spear. This success is achieved only thanks to a change of heart by one of Arlian's most staunch foes - who, at the crucial moment becomes a loyal and courageous ally, sacrificing his own life in order to enable Arlian to overcome the dragon. Shaken and deeply moved, Arlian decides to give up any further design of revenge on human enemies, concentrating on the campaign against the dragons. Arlian is the first man ever to kill a dragon, and his standing and prestige mounts high. He receives the full assistance of the duke and is named warlord in the coming battle against the dragons. Even with the initial success of killing a dragon, Arlian's task is far from over.
