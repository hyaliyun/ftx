Kelly was taken to St. Vincent's Hospital with serious head injuries and remained in intensive care for two days. He never regained consciousness, and died at 7:59pm on July 9, 2012. His attacker, nineteen year old Kieran Loveridge, was charged and convicted of manslaughter in 2014. Kelly's death caused public outrage and received widespread media coverage. The case helped initiate legal reforms to New South Wales drinking laws, which saw the introduction of mandatory sentencing and lockout laws in 2014. These changes have been criticised by legal experts and members of the public, who believe they will not be effective deterrents and may impact Sydney's nightlife economy.  Incident  Kings Cross at night On July 7, 2012, Kelly was on a night out with his girlfriend and another female companion. At 10:03pm the group passed the Mercure Hotel when a drunken Kieran Loveridge stepped out and punched the head of Kelly as he spoke on a mobile phone. Loveridge struck Kelly near the nose area which forced him to fall backwards and collide with the pavement, inducing a state of unconsciousness. The two young men were unknown to one another, and the attack was unprovoked and random. The impact of the concrete on Kelly's skull inflicted a fatal fracture and subsequent brain trauma. Immediately following the assault, Kelly became limp and comatose as a pool of blood formed around him. Shortly after the incident a witness observed Loveridge fleeing in the direction of the Victoria Street and Darlinghurst intersection. A second witness stated that Loveridge appeared \\"angry and possibly intoxicated\\". At about 10:10pm, paramedics responded to a call that a young male had been punched and was now unresponsive on Victoria Street in Sydney. They arrived on the scene seven minutes after the attack occurred, with one paramedic describing Kelly's condition as ‘’severe and life threatening’’. He was fixed with a spinal collar and transferred to a stretcher before being taken to St. Vincent's Hospital by ambulance at 10:33pm. Hospital staff intubated and ventilated the heavily unconscious Kelly, where he then underwent emergency surgery after a cranial scan uncovered acute hemorrhaging and a severe skull fracture. Kelly was placed in the Intensive Care Unit for two days until his family consented to switching off his life support. Preceding the attack, Loveridge had been involved in a string of other violent and aggressive altercations. At about 7:30pm, Loveridge and his friends arrived at the Star City Casino, having already consumed a substantial amount of alcohol. The group then traveled to the Cargo Bar in Darling Harbour where security denied them entry. The five males were then admitted to another bar where more alcohol was consumed. Following this, the group took a taxi to Brougham Street in Kings Cross, where they continued to move between nightclubs. At about 9:45pm, Loveridge appeared to become agitated and on edge.The first assault took place at 10:00pm as Marco Compagnoni walked along Victoria Street with other companions. The two males were complete strangers and as they approached one another Loveridge proceeded to elbow Compagnoni on the left eye which lacerated the skin and drew blood. This encounter occurred shortly before and near the area where Kelly was attacked. At 10:15pm, soon after the assault on Kelly, David Nofoaluma arrived on Bayswater Road outside The Club, where he attempted to greet a disgruntled Loveridge. Loveridge commenced to swing at Nofoaluma's head, before being restrained by another companion and then apologising. Loveridge then stated, \\"I swear I'm going to bash someone tonight\\". Over the remainder of the evening, Loveridge assaulted three other males: Matthew Serrao, Rhyse Saliba and Aden Gazi. All three victims were unknown to Loveridge prior to the attacks. Loveridge was on conditional bail at the time of the assaults.  Court proceedings  Loveridge made several comments regarding the death of Kelly in the days following the attack. On July 8, 2012, a news story on Kelly's condition was broadcast on television, to which Loveridge appeared worried, asking \\"was that one of my fights? I don't know\\". He also expressed concern over whether he matched the description of the offender's appearance. On July 12, 2012, Loveridge confided in the coach of his rugby league team, making statements such as \\"I don't remember what happened that night, it could have been me. I was drunk\\". = Arrest = On July 18, 2012, police arrested Loveridge at the Belmore Sports Ground at 7:20pm. He was charged with the murder of Kelly at the Campsie police station. In March 2013, representatives of Loveridge offered a guilty plea to manslaughter and four counts of assault if the charge of murder was revoked. After deliberation, the Director of Public Prosecutions accepted the deal and Loveridge was committed to the Central Local Court for sentencing before being submitted to the Supreme Court on September 6, 2013. = Trial = Loveridge pleaded guilty to all counts he was charged with and the trial went directly to sentencing. The judge considered both aggravating and mitigating factors when deciding on a penalty. Loveridge's previous criminal record, the unprovoked nature of the attacks and drunken conduct were deemed as aggravating the circumstances of the crime. Loveridge's disadvantaged background, remorse and prospects for rehabilitation were considered as a point of leniency. Loveridge received a 25% sentencing discount for pleading guilty. At the conclusion of the hearing, the judge sentenced Loveridge to a total of seven years and two months, with parole eligibility after five years and two months. The sentences for the four other assaults amounted to a fixed term of eighteen months imprisonment. The individual sentence for the death of Thomas Kelly consisted of a non-parole period of four years, with an additional two-year term. Loveridge would be eligible for release on parole on November 18, 2017. The initial sentence was met with frustration from Kelly's parents, who branded the punishment \\"an absolute joke\\". Loveridge was remanded in custody up until the lodging of an appeal in 2014 by the Director of Public Prosecutions.  Appeal  In response to public outcry, the original sentence was appealed in 2014 by the Director of Public Prosecutions on behalf of the Crown. The appeal contended that the original sentence was \\"manifestly inadequate\\" and failed to consider the need for general deterrence. Other grounds of the appeal included errors in the examination and classification of Loveridge's crimes. A hearing was held in the NSW Court of Criminal Appeal on May 7, 2014, and was conducted by a three-judge panel lead by Chief Justice Thomas Bathurst. The hearing found several errors in the original sentence imposed by Justice Campbell. The Crown overturned the previous legal ruling to uphold the grounds of the appeal and re-sentenced Loveridge for all five of his offences. He was handed down a seven-year non-parole internment for the death of Kelly, while the overall penalty was increased to a minimum term of ten years and two months. He will be eligible for parole on November 18, 2022. In reasoning the outcomes of the appeal, the judges issued a statement: > \\"The use of lethal force against a vulnerable, unsuspecting and innocent > victim on a public street in the course of alcohol-fuelled aggression … > called for express and demonstrable application of the element of general > deterrence as a powerful factor on sentence in this case\\". These outcomes were met with relief from Kelly's family. At the conclusion of the appeal, Kathy Kelly stated \\"at last we can focus on our family and on the memory of our son, rather than on the whole court process\\". Loveridge is currently serving his sentence in the Silverwater Correctional Complex, where he has since been involved in a brawl with another inmate. He was charged with affray and referred to the Burwood Local Court.  Reforms  There was widespread community backlash at the death of Kelly and NSW drinking laws came under heavy scrutiny. The death of Daniel Christie in 2014 also contributed to growing demand for law reform. In response to mounting pressure, the NSW government committed to introducing \\"one-punch\\" laws to regulate and deter alcohol-fueled violence. On the 5 February 2014, the government passed the Crimes and Other Legislation Amendment (Assault and Intoxication) Bill 2014 (NSW). The legislation introduced a minimum eight-year sentence for alcohol- related assaults causing death, 10:00pm closing times for bottle shops and 1:30am lockouts and enforced 3:00am closing times for all licensed venues within the CBD and Kings Cross. These changes exempted the Star Casino, which has one of the highest violence rates in Sydney. Police were also given the power to search any persons suspected of committing a drug or alcohol-fueled offence. Barry O'Farrell, the NSW Premier at the time, said of the reforms \\"I'm confident that the package that cabinet approved yesterday will make the difference and start the change that the community seeks to have implemented\\". Those in support of mandatory sentencing argue that it provides legal consistency, incapacitation and general deterrence. Since 2014, there has been a 26% reduction in alcohol-fueled violence in lockout zones. However this has coincided with a 17% increase in assaults outside these areas. In 2016, the NSW government declared that it would be adjusting lockout laws for live music venues by half an hour. In May 2019, the NSW parliamentary committee announced it would review Sydney's lockout laws. The commission will determine if the laws require maintenance in order to balance both a safe city and the need for a nighttime economy. Premier Gladys Berejiklian said of the review, \\"after five years of operation, it makes sense for us to now take stock and examine whether any further changes should be made\\".  Opposition to law reform  These legislative changes were met with skepticism by some legal experts. Mandatory sentencing was accused of minimising judicial discretion and impacting on the sentencing process. Those in opposition argue that compulsory sentences deny offenders the right to equality by removing proportionate punishment. Phillip Boulten, President of the NSW Bar Association, said of the new laws \\"it isn't effective, it's not a deterrent, it just leads to more people being locked up for no good purpose\\". There has been strong opposition to lockout laws, particularly from owners of nightclubs and pubs in Sydney's CBD and Kings Cross.The reforms have been criticised for attempting to reduce violence by restricting the liberties of law-abiding individuals. The Australian Hotels Association claimed that stricter laws will impact on nighttime economy in the Sydney area. Since the introduction of these reforms, several bars and nightclubs have closed with owners blaming lockout laws for damaging the nightlife industry. On September 5, 2015, a collective of 1000 members from Reclaim the Streets protested lockout laws. The group claimed that harsher legislation had not reduced alcohol-fueled violence but rather forced it into neighboring suburbs, such as Newtown. In October 2015, Keep Sydney Open organised a protest attended by 15,000 people in opposition to lockout laws. A second rally was organised in 2016, and was attended by 4,000 people. A third rally was planned for 2017 but was then shut down by police.

He is founder and director of the Dunedin Museum of Natural Mystery, a private museum of natural history and ethnographic objects and curios.  Life  Mahalski was born in Dunedin, New Zealand, the only child of two academics; his father, Dr E. R. Nye, was a physician and researcher at Otago Medical School, and his mother Pauline Mahalski was a teacher of psychology. Both were collectors of biological curiosities and ephemera, and Mahalski credits them with inspiring his own collecting. From the age of eight he collected shells, fossils, insects, crabs, and bones, and the skins of small animals. As a teenager, Mahalski worked as an unofficial intern at the Otago Museum and dreamed of opening his own museum one day. Mahalski graduated with a science degree and worked for a time in fisheries research.  Music  Manu Ika Bird Man Mask, a life-size mask made from fish and bird bones Mahalski fronted several bands in the 1980s. In 1983 with Mike Weston he formed Crystal Zoom!, and they were joined in 1984 by Robin Murphy (bass) and Barry Blackler (drums), both from Dunedin band The Idles. Crystal Zoom! had two 1984 cassette releases, and in 1985 a single on the Flying Nun label called Dunedin Sound on 45, a medley of Dunedin bands set to the hand-clap disco beat well known from 1980s albums such as Hooked on Classics. Dunedin musicians Martin Phillipps and David Kilgour played their own compositions in the medley. Mahalski and Weston moved to Waiheke Island, Auckland in 1985 and reformed Crystal Zoom! with a new rhythm section. They began to experiment with four-track recording, incorporating masks, photography, and slide shows in their live performances. The band was less successful, and Mahalski moved back to Dunedin, reuniting with Robin Murphy and other former Idles to form Let's Get Naked. The first Let's Get Naked album, Something Like That (1987), was the third release of Dunedin non- profit label Rational Records. It included the minor hit 'Funky Dunedin'.  Art  Kiribati Warrior (2013), a life-size bust made from animal bones, fish spines and crushed bone When Crystal Zoom moved from Dunedin to Auckland in 1985, Mahalski began drawing the strip cartoon Zak Water Buffalo, about a musician and music journalist, for BiFM magazine. The strips later appeared in Rip It Up and Otago University's Critic magazine, and Mahalski collected his cartoons in a self published compilation called Biohazard in 1990. Mahalski has been exhibiting and selling art since 1996, exhibiting screen-printing, sculpture, painting, and photography. He is a lifelong pacifist and environmentalist, and both of these are themes in his art. \\"Sometimes I feel overwhelmed by my social conscience. I’m not talking about my love for humanity. It’s the world of nature that’s screaming in my ear.\\" = Bone art = Mahalski creates what he calls \\"textural bone art\\": assemblages of animal skulls and bones. \\"I started seeing bones as like paint\\", he told film-maker Michael Hall. His artworks occasionally include human bone, to make the point that humans are just another animal: \\"I don't accept that there's any spiritual distinction between the bone of a human and the bone of a sheep or a rat.\\" Skulls to Mahalski are special, connecting humans to the rest of nature and acting as a link to our biological past. \\"I see skulls and these objects as like spiritual telephones to other dimensions.\\" He is strongly influenced by collections of ethnological art and the works created by societies before Western contact. The raw materials for Mahalski's bone art are sourced from collecting trips on the beach and countryside, or found as roadkill. His first bone art show, 2005's Full Spectrum Dominance, covered plastic machine guns with tiny bones to protest the War on Terror and the militarisation of children's toys. By 2010 he was specialising in textural bone sculptures. In 2014 Mahalski collaborated with the Wellington luthier David Gilberd to build a functioning slide guitar completely covered with animal bones, including 35 skulls, using trimmed cow ribs as frets. = Street art = Fish with Big Teeth (2016), mural on the side of a fish and chip shop in Wellington, New Zealand Mahalski has created numerous street murals, often depicting animals or the marine environment. His 2012 mural Electric Soup in Orchard Place, London, depicts marine animals, including electric rays (referencing the nearby laboratory site of electromagnetism pioneer Michael Faraday).Save the Plankton, a 2016 street mural in Ōwhiro Bay, Wellington, New ZealandMahalski has also been a keen sponsor of other's work, raising money to bring British street artists like Phelgm and Cityzenkane to work and collaborate in New Zealand through his group Vivid Wellington. Mahalski organised the creation of a mural of New Zealand artist Rita Angus in Bond St, Wellington, painted by street artist Askew One (Elliott O'Donnell). It was completed in January 2019. In 2019 Mahalski began a series of animal murals on Dunedin streets, referencing the specimens on display in Otago Museum's \\"Animal Attic\\". Animals depicted include badgers, sharks, an argonaut, a secretary bird, and a porcupine fish. = Museum of Natural Mystery = See Dunedin Museum of Natural Mystery After moving back to Dunedin in 2017, Mahalski converted the front of his Royal Terrace house into a private museum of \\"biological curiosities, ethnological art and unusual cultural artefacts\\". He believes the roles of artist and collector cannot be separated and sees his entire collection as a work of art.  Publications  * Hilton, Craig and Bruce Mahalski. (2018).

He is now best known for the sectarian slant he adopted the 1930s, aimed at Irish-Scots, and as an activist working on behalf of the Scottish Party. His biographer George McKechnie wrote \\"His modern Scottish reputation is grounded almost exclusively on his obsessive campaigns against Irish Catholics.\\" Life He was born in Leith on 2 August 1899 into a Presbyterian family, the eldest son of the journalist Charles Thomson and his wife Mary. His parents belonged to the United Free Church. He attended Daniel Stewart's College from age 10, and was a student at Edinburgh University from 1919 to 1922. In his final university year, he founded with another undergraduate, Roderick Watson Kerr, the Porpoise Press. Kerr in 1922 went to work on The Scotsman, and in 1926 moved to the Liverpool Daily Post. The same year, following his marriage, Thomson moved to London to work as a journalist, and write books. His early books attracted the attention of Lord Beaverbrook, and he joined Beaverbrook Newspapers in 1931. He acted as Principal Private Secretary to Beaverbrook, who was in government during World War II. In 1990 Thomson was awarded an OBE for services to journalism. He died in June 1996, in Hampstead. Scottish nationalist Caledonia (1927) had dwelt on Irish immigration to Scotland, as did Andrew Dewar Gibb's Scotland in Eclipse (1930), with the connected theme of slum housing in Glasgow. The two authors described a perceived threat in the influence of the Roman Catholic Church. At this time, the newly-joined United Free Church and Church of Scotland were leading a campaign against Irish-Scots Catholics, now seen as racist. Gibb and Thomson repeatedly denounced the same group. Their position has been described as a \\"strident, racially oriented nationalism which was politically to the far right and had quasi-fascist tendencies.\\" The context, identified by Stewart J. Brown, was the \\"exclusivist racial nationalism\\" of Presbyterians, dating from the early 1920s and their distancing from the UK Labour Party, and associated with the Church union in Scotland. In terms of party politics, the National Party of Scotland, of the left, was first countered by the Scottish Party set up in 1932, of the right, by Gibb and James Graham, 6th Duke of Montrose, with others. Then with the mediation of Thomson and Neil Gunn, the two parties merged in 1934, to form the Scottish National Party, with the exclusion of some radical nationalists. Electorally the Scottish Protestant League peaked in Glasgow local government in 1933. Fascist ideology made no further advances in Scotland. Gibb and Thomson went on to found the Saltire Society, concerned with Scottish culture and heritage, in 1936. For Thomson, 1935 and the publication of his book Scotland: That Distressed Area marked the end of his involvement in Scottish politics that had been pursued covertly. Lord Beaverbrook as his employer required him to sign an agreement that he would cease these activities. Works *Caledonia: or the Future of the Scots (1927), in the To-day and To-morrow series.

Borland (born September 2, 1971) is an American NASCAR crew chief. He currently works at Germain Racing as the crew chief for the No. 13 Chevrolet, driven by Ty Dillon in the NASCAR Cup Series. Starting his career as a crew chief for Ryan Newman in 2000, he has worked with teams such as Team Penske, Stewart-Haas Racing, and Richard Childress Racing. Early life Born on September 2, 1971, in Big Rapids, Michigan, Borland later attended the GM Institute and graduated with a degree in mechanical engineering before pursuing a career in Motorsports. Career During the 2000 season, after an impressive season with Ryan Newman in the ARCA Bondo/Mar-Hyde Series, Borland and Newman made their NASCAR Cup Series debuts driving for the No. 02 Kranefuss-Penske Racing Dodge at Phoenix, starting in 10th and finishing 41st after having engine issues. In 2001, Newman and Borland teamed up again for 7 races, again for the No. 02 team. In May, at Charlotte, Newman would qualify pole for the Coca-Cola 600, giving both Newman and Borland their first poles in cup competition. For the 2002 season, Borland became the crew chief of the No. 12 Penske Racing South Dodge, driven by Ryan Newman during his rookie season. The pair would prove throughout the season that they could work well together, racking up a win at New Hampshire, 6 poles, 22 top tens, 17 top fives by the end of the season, finishing 6th place in the overall standings and winning the NASCAR Rookie of the Year in the process. The pair returned to the No. 12 team for the 2003 season. The season didn't start very well, as Newman got involved in a wreck early on in the 2003 Daytona 500, finishing 43rd. However, the team would bounce back in March, winning the race at Texas, along with two poles at Atlanta and Bristol. The team would have a bad string of races in April, finishing outside of the top 35 four races in a row. Again the team bounced back getting the pole at Charlotte and also winning both the pole and the race a week later at Dover. Over the course of the season, the team would get 6 more wins and 7 more poles. However, inconsistency plagued the team during the season, and despite having the most poles and wins through the season, they finished 6th overall in the standings. The 2004 season brought the pair back together again, this time for only 2 wins, and 9 poles, finishing 7th in the standings. In 2005, the team's stats decreased again, this time only winning once at New Hampshire, and getting 8 poles to their name. This would a lead to a 6th in the point standings. 2006 would be the last season for Borland at Penske Racing South. This season, for the first time in his full-time career, Newman would go win-less. The team would also only get 2 poles, 2 top fives, and 5 top tens throughout the season. At Phoenix, Borland also would miss his first race of his career since going full-time with Newman in 2002. For 2007, Borland would join Michael Waltrip Racing for 10 races, taking over the crew chief position for the No. 44 team, driven by Dale Jarrett. The team would struggle, only finishing in the top 25 one time. Throughout the 2008 season, Borland would be the crew chief for 3 different drivers. Starting at Pocono, Borland joined Haas CNC Racing, becoming crew chief for the No. 66 team, driven by Scott Riggs. However, midway through the stint with Riggs, Max Papis was brought in to race the No. 66 car at Sonoma where he finished 35th. After 2 more races with Riggs, Borland left the team and joined No Fear Racing for one race at Daytona, joining the No. 60 car, driven by Boris Said. The pair would eventually finish 35th after getting caught up in a wreck. In 2012, Borland would return to NASCAR, rejoining Haas CNC Racing, now known as Stewart-Haas Racing, for 3 races. This would reunite Borland with Ryan Newman as Borland was put in charge of the No. 39 team, which was being driven by Newman. The pair would finish off the season with a 3rd place at Homestead, and Newman would finish the season 14th in the standings. For 2013, Borland replaced Tony Gibson as Ryan Newman's crew chief as Gibson moved over to the No. 10 team. The team would dominate and win at Indianapolis, Newman's hometrack, clinching themselves into the chase. Over the course of the season, the team would get 1 win, 2 poles, 6 top-fives, and 18 top-tens leaving Newman with an 11th place finish in the point standings. This would be the last season at Stewart-Haas Racing for Newman, as he would go to Richard Childress Racing the following to replace Jeff Burton. However, for Borland at the time, there was no room for him. During the 2016 season, Borland was brought to Richard Childress Racing, becoming the crew chief for a race for both Ty Dillon and Paul Menard. The following season, Borland would join the No. 27 team, driven by Paul Menard, full-time. The team would only get 3 top-tens and 2 top-fives, leading to a 23rd place finish in the point standings. In 2018, Borland was moved to Germain Racing, which fielded the No. 13 car, that was going to be driven by Ty Dillon. Over the course of Dillon's rookie season, the team would only get 1 top ten during the July race at Daytona, where they finished 6th. Borland returned to Germain Racing in 2019. During the season, the team racked up two stage wins. On August 26, 2019, he was indefinitely suspended for violating NASCAR's Substance Abuse Policy. Borland was tested positive for the banned substance DMAA; he and Germain Racing owner Bob Germain Jr. said a derivative of DMAA was an ingredient in the diet coffee he was drinking for six months prior to the suspension. Germain Racing confirmed that Justin Alexander, who serves as crew chief for the part time No. 21 Xfinity Series car for RCR (who Germain has an alliance with), would serve as interim crew chief beginning at Darlington and until Borland’s suspension was lifted. On September 24, NASCAR reinstated Borland after he completed the Road to Recovery Program.

He started work at the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh in 1903 prepared illustrations for lectures by Isaac Bayley Balfour, becoming a permanent employee in 1914 and working there until his retirement. He was the official artist to the Botanical Society of Edinburgh and provided photographic illustrations for books, articles and calendars. He developed all his photographs himself, amassing a large collection of plates and prints that he sold to D. C. Thomson who subsequently donated it to the University of St Andrews in 1987. Early life and family Robert Adam was born on 1 January 1885 at the Evangelical Union manse in Carluke, Lanarkshire, Scotland, to the reverend John Adam (1841 – c. 1916) of the Evangelical Union church, and his wife Isabella Adam (née Moyes).Adam, Robert Moyes.

He studied science at Heriot-Watt College and drawing at the Edinburgh College of Art. He married Anne Stewart and they had two children. Career Robert Moyes Adam (left) on a Scottish Alpine Botanical Society expedition c. 1929 with Regius keeper William Wright Smith. (2nd from right). Beinn Fhada and Glen Affric Adam began work at the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh in 1903 where one of his early jobs was to prepare illustrations for lectures by Isaac Bayley Balfour. He studied botany at the University of Edinburgh and became a permanent employee of the botanic gardens in 1914 as assistant in charge of the studio. He was promoted to botanist in 1915, a grade he held until the end of his career. During the First World War he served in the Royal Garrison Artillery as a gunner and later as a photographer in the Royal Flying Corps. His older brother was killed during the war. He was official artist to the Botanical Society of Edinburgh and secretary of its offshoot, the Scottish Alpine Botanical Society which combined botany with mountain climbing. In 1929, he campaigned to protect Glen Affric from damage by a proposed hydro-electric scheme by photographing the natural beauty of the area and sending the prints to the newspapers and each Scottish member of Parliament. His work resulted in significant changes to the proposals. He photographed the botanic gardens and provided photographic illustrations for books, articles and calendars. His work covered botany, landscapes, and the people and life of the Highlands. In 1905, he was one of the last people to photograph the island of Mingulay before it was abandoned.\\"A Great Photographer, a tribute to Robert M. Adam who, for half a century, recorded the Scottish scene with artistry and devotion\\" by Robert Daw in The Scots Magazine, February 1968, pp. 420-431 (p. 430).A Pioneering Photographer. Katrina Patrick, The Scots Magazine, 24 October 2017. Retrieved 12 August 2019. His work appeared in Picture Post, The Scots Magazine, and The Scotsman.

Using 6 × 4 inch glass plates and mounted on a wooden tripod, the whole weighed around 30 lbs. The weight of the camera, the inflexibility of the system, and Adam's naturally meticulous nature, meant that photographs had to be planned a long time in advance, leaving little room for spontaneity or improvisation. But it also produced highly distinctive images that had a high depth of field due to the camera's small aperture. He developed all his prints himself, not even letting assistants at the gardens learn his methods. Later life and legacy In 1949, Adam retired and left Edinburgh for Kingussie, taking 14,000 of his negatives with him through a blizzard. In 1956, he suffered a heart attack while at Glenfinnan and subsequently moved back to Edinburgh. In 1958 he sold his personal collection of plates and prints to D. C. Thomson, publishers of The Scots Magazine, from where they entered the collection of the University of St Andrews library in 1987. He died in an Edinburgh hospital on 13 November 1967.

It is the second oldest high school in Germiston. History The school was established in 10 September 1917 by Mr R.C Harding. The schools first name was Secondary School Germiston which served as a unisex school till the boys and girls were separated. The school was housed temporarily in the building today occupied by Germiston South School. In April of the following year the school became known as the High School Germiston A start was eventually made in 1922, and the building was officially opened by the Administrator of Transvaal on 1 August 1923. There was opposition to the site by many residents of Germiston who complained that it was too far out of town! Colours were selected in 1917 but there was difficulty in obtaining them because of the Great War, and for the same reason, when they were obtainable, they were not of a very good quality. Mr R.J. Johnson became headmaster in 1919, a position he occupied until 1924, when he was succeeded by Mr F.N. Gammidge. At the beginning of the 1925 season the school game was changed from soccer to “rugger” and during the same year the cadet detachment had the honour of providing a guard of honour to H.R.H the Prince of Wales, (to later become King Edward VIII) on the occasion of his visit to Germiston. Mr W. Main succeeded Mr Gammidge in 1934 and was headmaster throughout the war years. Mr H.C. Robinson was the incumbent after Mr Main, serving as headmaster from 1946 until 1960. At the beginning of the fifties the Transvaal Education Department (TED) decided to separate the boys and girls. In 1951 the girls moved to Lambton, to the building is today occupied by Delville Laerskool. Miss E.B Bergen was then appointed headmistress, a position she occupied for the rest of the school's thirteen years existence The Germiston Boys High School, under Mr Robinson, occupied the Lake Grounds building. Mr J. Lane, an old boy of Germiston High, took over the reins of office when Mr Robinson retired in 1960, and held this position until the end of 1963, when he left to take up the position of Headmaster of Greenside High. Sport Germiston High School provides rugby, soccer, tennis, netball, basketball, chess, athletics and swimming matches which they participate with other schools in Ekurhuleni =Rugby= Under the administration of Golden Rugby Union, Germiston High have been known as the best team in the league. Their winning record is indomitable and they have been invited to many rugby tournaments in South Africa. School Subjects The school offers the following subjects: *English *Mathematics and Mathematical Literacy *Zulu language *Afrikaans *Economic Management Science *Creative Arts *Life Orientation *PAT *Technology *Natural Sciences Notable alumni *Sydney Brenner, winner of a Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine Academics In November 2018 several Germiston High School students were invited to the Gauteng Province Mathematical Olympiad.

After spending several years in Shoreditch, London, where she gained fame as a street artist, in 2018 she returned to Norway to teach at the art school in Karasjok. Biography Born in Porsgrunn in the south of Norway, Linda Charlotte Aslaksen is the daughter of parents from Karasjok in the far north. She is a graduate in illustration and graphic design from University College Falmouth. From 2010, Aslaksen spent several years in London where, thanks to friends who demonstrated the technique, she became a street artist based in Shoreditch. Recognition was triggered by a painting of a muscle man for a training centre in February 2014. It was to be the first of many more, allowing her to make a living as a full-time artist. Her predominately blue works often depict women and children. She became even more successful after receiving a contract from Beefeater Gin. Huffington Post referred to her as one of the world's 25 most notable female street artists. In August 2016, after nine years in London, she moved back to Norway, settling in Alta, Finnmark. There she caused something of a commotion after painting the walls of the young people's school. Later she attracted attention from far and wide in nearby Sørvær by creating a portrait of a traditional fisherman wearing earphones headed \\"Sørøy Rocken\\" on the wall of a fish factory. \\"There's no doubt who should be this year's artist at the Sørøyrocken Festival,\\" commented its cultural expert Ken Arne Brox. In 2018, Aslaksen was given an appointment as a teacher at the art school in Karasjok, not far from Alta where she lives. She also collaborates with Alta's Sisa Cultural Centre, participating in workshops in the local schools.

During the Second Taiwan Strait Crisis in 1958, the islands were designated by the State Council of the People's Republic of China as the \\"Hero's Triangle\\" (). The islands were part of Kinmen County (Quemoy) in Republican China and are claimed by the Republic of China (Taiwan) as part of Kinmen County. History Dadeng and Xiaodeng (labelled as and ) From the Song Dynasty to the early Republican China period, the area was part of Xiangfeng Li (). In 1914, the present-day Dadeng Subdistrict area became part of Xiamen's Siming County. In 1915, the present- day Dadeng Subdistrict area became part of Kinmen County (Quemoy). (Note: Two maps at the front of this book (namely, (Tong'an Xian Zheng Qu Tu, 'Map of the Administrative Divisions of Tong'an County') and (Tong'an Xian Dishi Tu, 'Topographical Map of Tong'an County')) show the county boundaries of what was then Tong'an County to include a sliver of maritime areas east of PRC- administered Jiaoyu () including areas that are north and northeast of ROC- administered Cao Islet in Kinmen County and south of Nan'an and Jinjiang.) Japan occupied Kinmen County (Quemoy) during the Second Sino-Japanese War from 1937 to 1945. During this period, the county government was moved to Dadeng. The islands have been under PRC control since October 9 or October 15, 1949 initially as part of Nan'an County. On the day of Qingming Festival in 2005, a monument to the more than 300 PLA soldiers who died during the struggle was erected on Dadeng Island. In the lead-up to the Battle of Kuningtou in late October 1949, the PLA gathered forces in Aotou () (in Xindian, Xiamen), Dadeng (Tateng) and Lianhe (Lienho) () (then part of Nan'an County, now also in Xindian). Dadeng District () was established in 1949. On September 3, 1954, fourteen 120mm and 155mm Chinese Communist artillery in Xiamen (Amoy) and Dadeng (Tateng) fired six thousand rounds at the Kinmen (Quemoy) Islands in a five-hour period. Two Americans of the US Military Assistance Advisory Group, Lieutenant Colonel Alfred Medendorp and Lieutenant Colonel Frank Lynn, were killed in the shelling. On the morning of September 5, three carriers, a cruiser and three destroyers from the United States Seventh Fleet were standing by, patrolling the Taiwan Strait (Formosa Strait) a few miles from Kinmen (Quemoy). On September 7, the Chinese Nationalists responded to the attack with a seventy-six plane air raid on coastal mainland targets, claiming to destroy five of fourteen Chinese Communist artillery pieces, with (ROC) damaged sustained to only three Nationalist planes or (PRC) six Nationalist planes downed and twenty-five damaged. Beijing (Peiping) reported at least sixty deaths as a result of Nationalist bombing. Taipei reported, \\"great fires at storage points, hundred of junks sunk, and blows at Communist troop concentrations\\". In November 1955, a 6,300-foot causeway between Dadeng Island (Tateng Island) and the mainland was under construction by the PRC. On November 28, 1955, Chinese Nationalist 155mm howitzers fired 240 rounds at the causeway. Communist artillery responded with 680 rounds. No major damage was reported. In the Second Taiwan Strait Crisis in 1958, Dadeng was one of the areas from which PLA forces shelled Kinmen County (Quemoy), Republic of China (Taiwan). In 1958, Dadeng District became Dadeng Combat Zone Commune (). In January 1971, Dadeng Combat Zone Commune (along with Xiaodeng and Liuhe) became a part of Tong'an County (later Tong'an District). In 1984, Dadeng Combat Zone Commune became Dadeng Township. In 1991, Dadeng Township became Dadeng Town. In October 2002, the government of Dadeng Town was moved from Tianqian Village to Xitian (). At the end of 2002, Dadeng was designated a Taiwan Tourism Trade Zone (). In 2003, Dadeng Town became a part of Xiang'an District. In September 2005, Dadeng Town became Dadeng Subdistrict. In 2019, plans for a building an airport on Dadeng Island by 2020 involved doubling the size of the island. Geography Dadeng (labelled as Ta-teng Tao, ), Xiaodeng (labelled as Hsiao-teng, Town I) and Jiaoyu (labelled as Chiao Hsü, Reef I) (1954) Dadeng Subdistrict is made up of offshore islands and islets including: *Dadeng (Tateng, Twalin) () *Xiaodeng (Hsiaoteng, Town I., Siao Deng) () *Jiaoyu/Jiao Yu, United States National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (Chiao I., Reef I. ) *Baihajiao () Dadeng (大嶝/大嶝島), Xiaodeng (小嶝/小嶝島) and Jiaoyu (角嶼) were part of Kinmen County in Republican China and are claimed by modern Kinmen County, Republic of China (Taiwan). The islands have been under PRC control since October 9 or October 15, 1949. At low tide, the coast near Mashan () in northern Jinsha Township, Kinmen County (Quemoy), ROC (Taiwan) is from Jiaoyu. Rock-filled waters make passage between the two areas difficult. Administrative divisions Dadeng Subdistrict administers nine residential communities: *Tianqian (T'ien-ch'ien; ), Shantou (), Xunku (; traditional characters: ), Dengqi (), Shuanghu (Shuang-hu; ), Yangtang (Yang-t'ang; ), Beimen (), Dongcheng (), Xiaodeng (Hsiao-teng; )  See also  * List of islands of Fujian * List of township-level divisions of Fujian References Category:Subdistricts of the People's Republic of China Category:Township- level divisions of Fujian Category:Geography of Xiamen ","title":"Dadeng Subdistrict"},{"id":"61483656","text":"Pyschevyk (; ) is a village in Volnovakha Raion (district) in Donetsk Oblast of eastern Ukraine, at about 117 km SSE from the centre of Donetsk city, on the left bank of the Kalmius river.

February 1805 under Lieutenant Thomas Innes and wrecked 13 November 1805. Woodlark sailed from Lowestoft on 13 November 1805 bound for Plymouth and grounded that evening. The pilot believed that she was on the Goodwin Sands, so Innes fired guns to call for assistance. Around 11pm lights were seen astern and she started to take shots. Despite heavy seas she launched a boat and discovered that she was aground near Calais, France. With France and the United Kingdom at war during the War of the Third Coalition at the time, the boat then ferried Woodlark′s crew ashore to surrender to the French. By the time she was abandoned Woodlark was in a poor state. The subsequent court- martial, held after the crew′s release in 1814, found that Innes had carried too much sail and it admonished him to be more careful in the future. The pilot was found to have sailed too far south, having misjudged the distance Woodlark had traveled. As he had been a prisoner of war for nine years, the court-martial board dealt leniently with him, simply admonishing him to be more careful in the future.

Salom (1901) The Ješua D. Salom Mansion is located in the Municipality Centar in Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina. Since November 2008 it is listed as a National Monument of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Ješua D. Salom's mansion is located on the north side of the river Miljacka, on the Obala Kulina bana number 20 in a row between the buildings built during the Austro-Hungarian period, and on the opposite bank of the Miljacka is located the Ashkenazi synagogue.  History  The Ješua D. Salom Mansion was built in 1901 across from the Aškenazi Synagogue for the prominent Bosnian Jewish merchant Ješua D. Salom, on a design by the famous architect Josip Vancaš. Based on the 1893 Construction Regulation for the Capital City – Sarajevo, only two-story buildings could be constructed along the right bank of the Miljacka, from the Vijećnica to the Drvenija Bridge.Sarajevo Travel The mansion is one of the earliest examples of constructions that saw the use of floral motifs in the Vienna Secession style for residential buildings. When it was built, it was an avant-garde facility, with running water, indoor plumbing, electricity and a heating system. An inner courtyard with a stone fountain was located behind the building. The Bosnische Post for 11 December 1901 reported on a housewarming party which had been held the previous Sunday at the splendid new 'palais' of Ješua Salom, a leading member of a Sephardic Jewish family in Sarajevo: > On Sunday morning Herr Ješua D.

In 1962, the building was nationalised as social property, housing the headquarters of the Society of Engineers and Technicians of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Since 1991, it houses the Sarajevo Cantonal Board of the Party of Democratic Action (SDA). In 2008, the Cantonal Institute for the Protection of the Cultural, Historical and Natural Heritage of Sarajevo rebuilt the mansion, which was then listed as a National Monument.  Description  Dimensions are 27.70 x 16.55 m. The floor is Basement + P + 1 + Attic, with a total height of 18.20 m. The southern façade facing the Miljacka River is an example of a representative city façade solved in the spirit of secession. The decoration of the facade develops from the bottom up, with the main emphasis being placed on a centrally placed wide outlet in the form of a loggia above which is a balcony and a dome. The entrance to the building is a two-winged wooden portal measuring 2.15 m x 3.30 m, made of quality oak wood with brown protective paint. The upper part of the portal is glazed and is protected by original forged locksmith with elements in the Art Nouveau style. On the lateral parts of the attic is a decorated belt with a width of 110 cm, with the motif of alternating lowering a larger circle with a diameter of 50 cm and a smaller circle with a diameter of 25 cm. At the corners of the attics are columns, on which are the figures of the flora. These pillars are finished with a stylized globe motif.

It was one of the largest disasters of its kind in Tanzania.Death toll from Tanzania's fuel tanker explosion rises to 75: official The incident happened in the town of Morogoro, which is located west of Dar es Salaam. A fuel tanker crashed and people gathered at the accident site to loot the fuel. The tanker exploded during the looting, initially burning 60 people to death. Video footage of the incident began circulating on social media, in which many people can be seen collecting fuel in yellow containers and jerrycans. Another 55 people were injured in the incident and many suffered serious burns.  Explosion  The explosion occurred at 8:30 am EAT, 20 minutes after a fuel tanker overturned while trying to avoid colliding with a motorcyclist. The crash happened near Msamvu Bus Terminal. The road on which the crash occurred connects Morogoro to the financial capital Dar es Salaam and is heavily used. Witnesses say that a crowd of at least 150 people gathered at the scene. The crowd began stealing the fuel using yellow jerrycans and continued even when the tanker burst into flames. A video was posted by local news channel Kwanza TV on Twitter, showing groups of people attempting to gather fuel around the tanker. One of the witnesses, who was identified as Daniel Ngogo, described the scene as chaotic with a huge fire which made it \\"challenging to rescue victims. The situation is really bad. Many people died here – even those who were not stealing fuel – because this is a busy place\\". At 3:00 pm EAT, rescue operations finished and all the bodies were removed from the scene. The regional police commissioner, Wilbard Mutafungwa, stated that many people suffered burns as a result of the explosion. Official police figures reported 75 deaths and at least 55 people injured. Most of the victims were identified as local motorcycle taxi drivers who were present at the scene and people who attempted to gather fuel. Morogoro regional commissioner Stephen Kebwe said it was the worst disaster in the region, and warned of more possible deaths. Aftermath Afterwards, government spokesperson Hassan Abbas said, \\"the rescue operations finished by 3 p.m. local time. The scene was cordoned off and all bodies were removed from the scene into a local hospital for identification.\\" President of Tanzania John Magufuli expressed condolences as well as dismay with how the crowd acted.

He worked on the series from 1982 up to and including 1993. Each painting depicts, as its central topic, literally and figuratively, an everyday tin can of the non- existent brand, Canto. The Canto Collection has been on permanent display, since 2008, in Museum Møhlmann, Appingedam, the Netherlands. Preparation A number of strict rules were adhered to during the set up stages:’The Canto Collectieon’, 2011, Publication in Dutch, English and German, Museum Møhlmann, Appingedam # Each painting is painted in the upright portrait-position and always has the same measurements (40x30cm) # The tin can (which is painted actual size) is always the same size on each painting. # In each work the tin can is located at exactly the same place in the image plane. # The can is always perceived from the same angle. First Canto (1982). The first in a series of 124 paintings Motivation Canto means i.a.: ‘each and every part of an epic poem’. Møhlmann therefore intends each painting to be like a Canto in which he follows his hero (the tin can) through time and depicts its fate in oil paint. He calls it an epic visual poem. The series was inspired by the painter's annoyance at the scorn and arrogance with which realistic art, for many years, had been labeled old-fashioned and dusty. He remarked: “that even the most trivial object from so-called known reality could hold enough artistic potential to occupy an entire painter’s life”, and Møhlmann put his money where his mouth is.’’Elf jaar worstelen met een soepblik,’’ Tubantia, 6 januari 1995 He opted for a tin can of which the naked, smooth, curved metal gave its own unique reflection of reality. In this way each painting not only shows the painter's view, but also the reflection in or of the tin can. The top of the can shows another piece of wrapper with the brand name Canto on it. In a broader sense, the entire project can be regarded as an artistic investigation of reality, hence the often appearing subtitle ‘Reflections on reality’. Development The series have undergone several developments. Møhlmann only painted for 5 years when he started with the Canto Project. His painting technique develops and matures throughout the years. Growth is also noticeable in the manner with which he gives shape to his own ‘look at reality’. The painting technique is initially characterized by a slightly impressionistic touch on linen. After experimenting with finer linen for 3 years, the painter began to use wooden panels. He also refined the brushstroke, so that the texture or skin of various materials could be rendered more convincingly. The act of observation matures from fairly unambiguous to an increasingly more complex approach. This is evident, for example, by mini-series emerging within the larger series.Lies de Visser in Het Nieuwe Land, 13 April 1995, ‘’Íntrigerend, diep of amusant, soms alles tegelijk, is het zeker.’’ The concept of time The limitations that the painter has imposed on himself result not only in a series of 124 paintings, but also in a sequence with cinematic aspects. The can is always the same size and in the same place within the image plane. Therefore, one would observe a stationary can if all the Canto's would be subjected, in succession, to a filmic ´overfading´. The environment around the can would continually change while the can itself remains static. With that the Canto series, in a way, could be described as a painted movie, a primitive visual documentary. In this sense, the series deviates considerably from what is usual and possible within a single, independent painting. The series has a timespan of 11 years within which the can was followed by the painter. In a way, time was the co-creator. This makes the Canto Collection more than just the sum of 124 paintings. This time-frame of 11 years is also represented within the series in smaller parts. Canto 6 (1982) already bears witness to this in a subtle manner because a small piece of the label has unnoticeably disappeared. Diederik Kraaijpoel writes: “Within the main series there are many sub-series which usually contain an optical peculiarity so that the viewer constantly wonders: “What do I actually see?”’’Zoektocht naar de werkelijkheid,’’ Van Soeren & Co- Amsterdam, 2003, Diederik Kraaijpoel pag. 8 An example of such a sub-series is shown by the Canto's 9 to 12 (‘An Investigation 1-5’, 1982). In a series of successive works, a glass jar is filled with more and more water so that the image changes all the time; in another sub-series we see the can falling one meter; or flowers that wither, or, simply the can during different parts of the day. The further the Canto project progresses, the more complex the concept of time becomes.

The viewer jumps from one scene to the next; the scene following that (with the can that is to be depicted) is always seen in the background of the painting. The tour ends exactly where it began. It is as if time does not exist here, for we are sent back into the studio over and over again. Here time is as a cyclical phenomenon.

There are comments on Beuys, Mondriaan or Vermeer, or he makes his version of art historical subjects such as ‘the anatomical lesson’ or ‘the breakfast’ and ‘anamorphosis’. Rob Møhlmann, Canto 65, Het melkmeisje, 1987, olieverf op doek, 40x30cm.jpgCanto 65, The Milkmaid Rob Møhlmann, Canto 66, Wie mann dem totenHut die Bilder erklärt, 1987, olieverf op doek, 40x30cm.jpgCanto 66, Wie mann dem toten Hut die Bilder erklärt He also literally plays with surfaces so that it is not clear whether, for example, a woodlouse is part of the painting or actually runs over the surface of the painting. He also ‘destroys’ painting cloths, but this then appears to have been painted. In this manner the seriousness of the subject-matter is often downplayed by humour. Titles The titles of all the Canto's are listed in a separate chapter because they often give slightly ironic indications as to how one could look at the painting. (Incidentally, this applies to most of the titles in Møhlmann's work). For example: the title of his Canto about Joseph Beuys (Canto 66, 1987): ‘Wie mann dem toten Hut die Bilder erklärt’, indirectly refers to Beuys’ 1965 performance How to Explain Pictures to a Dead Hare. Summary The Canto Collection is one painting presented in 124 Cantos. It was created within a time span of 11 years. The painter follows the can throughout time in his studio, which makes it partly autobiographical. The project investigates, in its own way, what reality is or can be. The sharpness, humour, but also the craftsmanship and originality, make this work quite unique in contemporary art history.E.K. in Haagsche Courant, 3rd March 1995, Maakte Møhlmann nu een installatie, een stuk theater of een schilderijenexpositie? Het geheel is denk in niet te etiketteren (…). The series also gave rise to one important ‘spin-off’. In 1989, Møhlmann found his can on the floor (Canto 86, Ground pattern) and did not pick it up, but painted it from above. In 1990, this led to the first ‘top-down’, still life. The still life is seen perpendicularly from above and is a composition form hardly seen, if at all, in art history. According to this principle the painter would make many more works.Møhlmann opent galerie met Blik van Boven, Noordhollands Dagblad, 23 September 1995Kunst & Antiekrevue, March 1996, about top-bottom paintings: Elk schilderij is een gesloten systeem en houdt letterlijk bij de randen van het schilderstuk op (…).

The two artists did not know each other or each other's work, but spoke to one-another by telephone much later, around 2003.See: https://www.museummohlmann.nl/twee-canto-projecten-hoe-zit/ In 2014 and 2016, Møhlmann organized performances of De Canto Ostinato in his own museum, while the public could view the Canto Collection at the same time.Canto ontmoet Canto Ostinato, Dagblad van het Noorden, 4th April 2014 #The can #:The can itself exists, dates from 1982 and was bought in a supermarket in Amsterdam- Zuid. Almost all Western cans at that time were already fitted with a ribbed profile (which gives more strength), but a few imported cans from Asia, for example, kept the smooth hull a little longer. One of them became the model for the Canto series.

It was written on January 6, 1923. First published in the \\"Way of Truth\\" newspaper, in issues 115 and 116, on May 26 and 27, 1923. When working on the article, Vladimir Lenin used a number of books on cooperation. Main ideas In this article, Lenin emphasizes the great importance of cooperation in a multistructure economy in the country with a predominance of peasant population. He points out that cooperation allows to achieve: Lenin believed that cooperation would allow the peasantry to transition to socialism in a simpler and easier way. It is emphasized that in a mixed economy under the dictatorship of the proletariat, cooperative enterprises mean an important step from private capitalist enterprises to socialist ones. To develop cooperation, it is proposed to provide cooperative enterprises with various benefits, as well as to raise the cultural level of the peasantry in every way. The Leninist concept of a mixed economy is formulated: Lenin's ideas about the cooperation of the peasantry formed the basis of the resolution of the 13th Congress of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks) \\"On Cooperation\\" and \\"On Work in the Village\\".The Communist Party of the Soviet Union in Resolutions and Decisions of Congresses, Conferences and Plenums of the Central Committee. Volume 3 – Moscow, 1970 – Pages 76–77 Estimates Alexander Yakovlev notes that in this article, a different point of view was expressed from the views of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels on the way of combining personal interest with the public, since Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels were opposed to the ideas of the old cooperators (Fourier, Considerant, Saint-Simon). Roy Medvedev notes that the Leninist principles of voluntariness and gradualism in the co-operation of the peasantry were grossly violated by Joseph Stalin during collectivization, which caused enormous economic and moral damage.

Na. Sundararao, (26 March 1918 8 October 1986), who wrote poetry under the pen name Vanavihari, was known by his Kannada initials as Ba.Na.Sum.. Banasum was active in Kannada literary circles from the 1950s until his demise in 1986, and is well known as an author, historian, and journalist. A prolific writer, he authored 25 Kannada books including \\"Bengalurina Itihasa\\", one of the few authentic sources on the history of Bengaluru from founding till Indian independence. He also wrote and published biographies of notable people of Karnataka, several travelogues, short stories, poems and many articles in various periodicals. He was a great orator and gave lectures on history, literature, education and the Indian freedom movement. As a Kannada historian, Banasum published \\"Banglodaya\\", a book about the creation of Bangladesh; and \\"Bharata-Pakistana Samarada Itihasa\\" History of Indo-Pak War; the books demanded considerable labour and his meetings with the military personnel at various levels culminated in another monumental work on the biographical sketches of one hundred warriors from Karnataka who fought in the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971, some of whom lost their lives in the war. The book \\"Karnatakada Veera Yodharu\\" (Kannada: ಕರ್ನಾಟಕದ ವೀರಯೋಧರು) (Brave Warriors of Karnataka), was released in 1972 by General K. M. Cariappa. He also wrote biographies of Sir M. Visveswaraiah, Cha. Vasudevayya (teacher of Sir M.V.), and of notable dramatist Bellave Naraharishastri. As a novelist, Banasum documented the struggles of the people of Bengaluru who could not enjoy the freedom on 15 August 1947. The Mysore Wodeyars had to be coaxed in to joining the Indian Democratic Government, and that resulted in a movement entitled \\"Chalo Mysore\\" (Kannada: ಚಲೋ ಮೈಸೂರು) (March to Mysore). Centered on this movement, he penned a historical novel with this title, and published it in 1984. Sundararao gave a lecture series on the history of Bengaluru at the Secretariat Club in Cubbon Park during the 1980s. The lecture notes were compiled into the nucleus of a book, and turned into his magnum opus, Bengalurina Itihasa, which was released in 1986 by Chief Editor of the Karnataka State Gazetteer Dr. Suryanath U. Kamath. The book was published after many years of laborious research in government archives and after researching relevant archeological artefacts located all over the city and surrounding rural areas. This book is considered as an authentic source on the history of Bengaluru. Bangalore Central University MA (History) Course lists Ba. Na. Sundararao's book in the course syllabus. Ba. Na. Sundararao was felicitated for lifetime contribution to Kannada literature by literary persons, students and well-wishers at the Kannada Sahitya Parishat, in June 1986. A fest-shrift entitled \\"Vanavihari\\" (Kannada: ವನವಿಹಾರಿ) also was published, documenting his achievements. Soon after this he suffered a fatal cardiac arrest, which abruptly ended an eventful life. Ba. Na. Sum's birth centenary was celebrated in 2018, when public interest was revived, and his contribution to Kannada literature was hailed.

Ontani and Corte belonged to different generations but shared a common sensitivity and culture; they developed a friendship that inspired Ontani to write a presentation in the form of a poemMarziani, p. 46. of Corte’s first solo exhibition in Rome, at the Planita gallery in 1989. In 1988 Corte obtained his degree (Laurea, in Italian) from the University in the History of Contemporary Art with a thesis on the Austrian body artist Günter Brus, whom he met and interviewed in Graz in 1987.Marziani, p. 20. He then moved to Rome where he established a studio with Andrea Nurcis. To finance his early projects, Corte worked as a 3D commercial artist, scenographer and actor, collaborating with, among others, the experimental film-director Franco Brocani;Franco Brocani on it.wikipedia.org his work with Brocani would later find a place in his art.Marziani, p. 50.

The name they gave to their specific project was \\"Orestecinema: networking as a privileged method.\\" The main topics dealt with the themes of international counterculture, creative hacking and political and cultural dissent. In addition to Room A of the Italian pavilion, Orestecinema expanded to other public spaces, including the Aula Magna of the Università Iuav di Venezia and the Chiostro of Tolentini, Venice.Oreste at the Venice Biennale, p. 128. With the sponsorship of J. Walter Thompson,Oreste at the Venice Biennale, p. 128. the two artists organized a series of film and video screenings and panel discussions between a number of international intellectuals, journalists, musicians, radio/television/theater directors, and the public of contemporay art. It put into practice Corte's desire to escape the \\"self-indulgent individualism of the artist,\\"Marziani, p. 56. a stance Corte relates to the Gramscian school of thought.\\"Just as the Gramscian 'intellectual' must be ready to 'do' as well as think, so the intellectual figure of the artist must also 'organize' as well as create\\". Marziani, p.56. To secure the participation of three radio and television directors from the clandestine and main counter-information news station B92 in Belgrade – a city that at the time was at war – Corte had to seek diplomatic assistance from the Italian ambassador to Belgrade and financial support from George Soros' Open Society Foundation.Oreste at the Venice Biennale, p. 128. The result was an exhibition that included a countercultural critique of Slobodan Milošević, his regime and the civil war underway the former Yugoslavia – just 200 kilometers from the Biennale. The press conference that followed, along with a number of interviews with guests of Orestecinema, were transcribed and published in the book \\"Oreste at the Venice Biennale.\\" In 2003 Corte began a working relationship with the Buia Gallery in New York, taking part in the Young Italian Genome group show.Young Italian Genome on undo.net Corte left Rome in 2008 and moved to Bologna for a brief period, after which he chose to concentrate his work in a studio/house in the countryside near Ravenna. In 2017 the critic Gianluca Marziani organized a double retrospective exhibition of Corte and Nurcis in the Palazzo Collicola Arti Visive museumPalazzo Collicola Arti Visive on it.wikipedia.org in Spoleto, Umbria. The exhibition, entitled ExcerptⒶ, celebrated 40 years of the artists’ work occupying three floors of the museum.Perra, Artribune. ExcerptⒶ caught the attention of the director of the Galleria Nazionale d'Arte Moderna in Rome, Cristiana Collu,Cristiana Collu on it.wikipedia.org who in February 2018 organized a lecture with the two artists in the Galleria Nazionale where the entire exhibition was illustrated and discussed with the audience. On the occasion of the ExcerptⒶ exhibition and the artist’s lecture in the Galleria Nazionale, the aspect of Corte’s work in the field of musical compositionMarziani, p. 52. emerged – an activity on which he has been concentrating in recent years.  Works  = The Botanical Rarities series (1981–present) = Throughout his career, Corte has collaborated with other artists in order to break out of what he refers as «the self-indulgent individualism of the artist».Marziani, p. 56. The multimedia installation Botanical Rarities,Marziani, p. 30.Giusti, Lorenzo, et al. (2017). Arte contemporanea in Sardegna (1957-2017). Arezzo: Magonza editore. . p. 82. created with the artist Andrea Nurcis in 1981, is an example of the type of ongoing collaborative work that has evolved alongside his solo works. Since the first installation of vegetomorphic sculptures, drawings and musical soundtrack in the Orto Botanico dell'Università di Cagliari, from time to time the artists re-elaborate the original themes in order to present the same ideas in different forms using various techniques. So far vinyl LPs, audio CDs, videos, jewelry and various gadgets inspired by the 1981 exhibition have been produced.Botanical Rarities XXXV Anniversary on vimeo.com The “celebratory” pretext was intended ironically, not adulatory, but when viewed in its totality does celebrate the lasting friendship the two artists continue to enjoy.Marziani, p. 31. = Photographic works of the 1980s and 1990s = The young Corte’s approach to photography is characterized by its low-cost production and open-minded approach to the real, which one reviewer called that of \\"a tourist of existence\\".Marziani, p. 44. His photography has also been defined a sort of \\"negative narcissism,\\" experienced through re-defining the conventional concepts of \\"identity\\" and \\"dignity\\".Marziani, p. 29. Typical of the latter are works that could be wrongly intended to \\"search for scandal\\".Marziani, p. 28. For example, in some of them he is photographed standing precariously on the ledge of public buildings (Youthanasia, 1981; Cheese, 1981). Another self-portrait represents the artist’s face spattered with seminal liquid (Drawing [Sketch], 1982), and in another one someone urinates on his face (Idolatrine, 1981). Throughout the 1990s Corte would occasionally include photography in his sculptures or other plastic works to re-contextualize them in a wider multimedia context. = Double Faces and Cross Fades works (1986–1989) = In the second half of the 1980s Corte produced two series of works: the Double Face series, consisting in thirty-five pieces, followed by the Cross Fades series, consisting of forty pieces.Marziani, pp. 40-43. In the former, the artist altered the traditional way a picture is displayed, hanging panels attached to steel cables in the center of the exhibiting area. The panels were painted on both sides, often with images and subjects that are quite different from the point of view of color or figurative representation. The viewer is invited to walk around the picture as it hangs in a void to discover the conceptual tie between the two sides of the work. Often the images depicted emerge from the surface, standing out like altorilievi or jutting sculptures. The Cross Fades series began in 1987 and represent an extension of the works in Double Face: the pictures in this series look as if they are hanging on the wall in a traditional fashion but they are divided into two panels joined by hinges so that they can be opened and closed like a book (or rather, like a Japanese book: from right to left). One of the two panels is fixed to the wall while the other is moveable and can be opened or closed by the viewer on the hinges. When the works in the Cross Fades series are closed, that is to say, when one panel is folded over the other, all that the viewer can see is a black square hanging on the wall; it is necessary to use one’s hands to open the panels in order to be able to see the images painted within. Cross Fade - The Abstraction of the Petroleum, 1987. Nitrocellulose lacquer, silver enamel, black tissue paper cutouts and concave mirror on two openable panels in reflecting black formica, joined by hidden hinges. Open: 100x200x2,5 cm; closed: 100x100x5 cm. Private collection, Osaka. = The Abstraction of the Void series and the Devotees and Wannabes series (1993–1998) = The Abstraction of the Void is a series of small sculptures made of metal, resin and other materials. It is inspired by erotic accessories, reinterpreted through a wide range of aesthetic solutions. For example, the artist modifies the form of a butt plug with precious, unexpected details that have nothing to do with the erotic object’s original purpose, yet still maintain its possible anal use. The concept of “emptiness”, which Corte takes from classical art,Marziani, p.47. takes on an ironic connotation in this series of works, projecting the aesthetic dimension of sculpture into new areas including the concepts of pleasure and pain, formal refinements and scatological eroticism. The Devotees and Wannabes series involves a group of small and medium-small metal sculptures designed by the artist as artificial body parts – fingers, limbs, etc. – missing as a result of voluntary amputation. Corte references the practice by groups of people who in the early 1980s were labeled in the jargon of analytic psychology, as well as U.S. urban subculture, as devotees (people attracted by amputations), or wannabes (people who practice self-amputation).Dixon, Dwight (1983). An erotic attraction to amputees. Sexuality and Disability, 6, 3-19.fleshbot.com (March 22, 2005). Devotees, Pretenders and Wannabes. Archived February 23, 2007, at the Wayback Machine. These fetishists performed voluntary self-mutilation for erotic or merely decorative reasons as they searched for a new aesthetic of the body.Kaplan, Louise (1997). Female perversions. Northvale: Jason Aronson. . Corte’s sculptures are not simply “prostheses” imitating the original form of the missing body part; rather, they take on free aesthetic connotations with the addition of elements which widen the possibilities for the use of the artificial part itself. For both the Abstraction of the Void and the Devotees and Wannabes series, Corte made a set of “promo pictures” of the sculptures, placing the objects in singular poses and settings and photographing them as if they were advertisements for a product. These promo pictures were considered an art form in and of themselves and not simply a commercial o promotion strategy. LWD - RWD (Left Wrist - Right Wrist Disarticulation). Promo picture from the Devotees and Wannabes series, 1993-98. Two prototypes of substitutive sculptures for voluntary hand amputations. Stainless steel, photoceramics with reproduction of charcoal and ink drawings. Each sculpture: 7,5x7x7 cm. Private collection, Milan. = The Art Brothel series (1995) = The series Art Brothel consists of 25 photographs of various sizes with plastic laminate backings. The artist’s intention was to create an ironic, desecrating celebration of the system of contemporary art with an \\"overtone of parody\\"Marziani, p. 50. and using references to cinema. Corte created the Art Brothel series in 1995, the year of the Venice Biennale centenary, so it is not surprising that this celebration is his first ironic reference. On the backstage of an actual film set, where Corte worked as a scenographer and actor, a group of professional male, female and transgender high-class prostitutes plays in sequences that allude to well-known paintings, techniques or artistic trends chronicling the history of art. The artist himself also appears in these sequences. To create the photographic series, Corte projected the sequences on a cinema screen, and then re-photographed them. The resulting photos were later printed and cropped by the artist, sometimes leaving at their edges a small portion of the screen on which the sequences were projected. Also, French subtitles, apparently disconnected from the various scenes, have been superimposed on the photographs. The titles of the single photos are indicative of the artist’s intent, but the series contains more subtle references to cinematographic art. For example, the film set is located in a showroom on Via Veneto – the famous street in Rome that was featured in the 1960 film by Federico Fellini La Dolce Vita, and the show room itself belongs to an Italian architect and interior designer of villas owned by Sylvester Stallone.Marziani, p. 50. Dripping, from the Art Brothel series, 1995. Gelatin silver print on aluminum. 95x180 cm. Private collection, Chicago. = No Light (1995–present) = No Light is the title of a video art work which Corte began working on with Nurcis in 1995.Marziani, pp. 51-54. Corte and Nurcis play the two main characters in the video, which has a narrative structure and includes digital animation, pictorial scenography, costumes, text, and music all created by the two artists. The video, completed in 1997, is 30 minutes long. In the intervening decades, the two artists have periodically re-elaborated themes and images from No Light to celebrate their ongoing artistic collaboration. Similar to their previous collaboration – the Botanical Rarities installation of 1981 – new works offer new interpretations and perspectives on a project that has evolved from a medium-length video to include video still prints, sculptures, drawings, vinyl records, audio CDs, limited edition of artistic gadgets, and multimedia installations. The meaning behind the No Light project, with all its subsequent re-elaborations, can be synthesized as a satirical representation of how the Tragic is impossible within the system of contemporary art.Marziani, p. 51. It's a parody of the “pain” and torment of creating, or as a schizophrenic “split” of the artist’s personality into two different characters who hold a conflictual dialogue about the possibility of abandoning the artistic career.Marziani, p. 51. No Light was presented to an international audience in 1999 at the Italian pavilion of the 48th Venice Biennale, directed by Harald Szeemann. = Maskon, Anthrocon and Intericon series (1996–present) = Maskon, Anthrocon and Intericon are three series of works on paper and cardboard thematically linked by common elements, including the theme of humans dressing up for erotic reasons.Marziani, pp. 60-62. Maskon was the name given in Japan in the early ‘90s to the phenomenon of “rubber dolls”, or the erotic practice of playing the role of dolls while wearing latex clothes and masks. The practice had elements of sadomasochism, but filtered by references to the world of manga (not to be confused with the Cosplay phenomenon). Anthrocon, a blend of the words “anthropomorph” and “convention”, is a series of conventions that have taken place, from the Nineties onwards, primarily in the United States and, to a lesser extent, other parts of the world. These conventions bring together enthusiasts who dress up as anthropomorphic furry animals, using flashy costumes, handmade or bought from specialized fabricators. The latent eroticism in this inclination is often highlighted in Corte’s works. Intericon is a phenomenon which, while inspired by Maskon and Anthrocon, is the creation of Corte. The works of the Intericon series – portmanteau of the words “interiors” and “convention” – show groups of people with a shared passion for dressing up as objects and interior furnishings, satisfying their erotic penchants in complete immobility and semidarkness within apartments designated for the purpose. Anthrocon Chimera, 2007. Dirt and soot partially erased by the artist on a fragment of panel used by a homeless person to build a temporary lodging. 230x172x11,5 cm. Collection: Bank of Sardinia. = Luciferin music (1995–present) = Luciferin music is the title Corte gives to his musical production from 1995 to date, «to say goodnight to the art world» – as is written on his personal Bandcamp page.La Partouze on bandcamp.com The term \\"luciferin\\" refers here to heterocyclic compounds present in some living organisms which produce bioluminescence, like fireflies. Corte plays on the reference to Lucifer, the name given to Satan in the Judeo-Christian tradition (in the No Light video, for which Corte composed the music, he plays a little demon). For his musical projects, Corte presents himself as various “entities” or alter egos – musical groups or soloists – preferring to appear with his own name only as a “producer”. While Corte is responsible for the entirely of his musical compositions, during the creative phase he often relies on sound engineers and other musicians: like much of his work, the artist's approach to music is collaborative. La Partouze and Un Autre are some of the aliases Corte adopts in his musical projects.Marziani, p. 52.

It borders Benrose to the west, Jeppestown and Malvern to the north, Cleveland to the east, and the François Oberholzer Freeway to the south. Just a small portion of the suburb in the northwest has residential zoning; otherwise, Denver consists of industrial land and squatter camps both in the west and up north, the latter largely on Hoofrif Road. Denver was laid out on 25 ha of Doornfontein farm, like all the eastern suburbs of Johannesburg. Owner F.J. Bezuidenhout, for whom Bezuidenhout Valley is named, leased the area in 1903 to a J.H. Strutton to grow crops and garden. Denver was later purchased by a business, and in October 1898, it was zoned as a residential township. Before and after the Second Boer War, several American mining machinery firms built offices there, and it was named after Denver, capital of Colorado, as a result. On May 31, 1900, Dr. Fritz Krause, the South African Republic's appointed mayor of Johannesburg, rode out to meet Frederick Roberts, 1st Earl Roberts to arrange the surrender of the main city into which they subsequently rode. In the early years, the white population of the area was so large that from 1910 to 1933, there was a constituency in the Parliament of South Africa located in the neighborhood (see Denver.

Early years Domingo Valentín Guerra Arteaga y Leiva was born on 14 February 1660 in Ariano Irpino, Italy, near Benevento. At the time the territory belonged to Spain, and his parents were Spanish. His father was Diego de Guerra y Varela, Maestre de Campo in the Spanish army, governor of the fortress of Gaeta in Naples, a native of Espera in the Archdiocese of Seville. His mother was Magdalena Modesta Arteaga y Leiva, a native of Naples. He was the third of three sons. The second, Miguel Francisco de Guerra y Arteaga, was a member of the Council of Castile and a Councilor of State during the reign of Philip V of Spain. Domingo Valentín grew up in Italy, where he was educated and became fluent in several languages. He remained in Italy for the first part of his life. He was aged 46 when he took orders. Church career Baroque facade of the chapel of San Leandro in Seville Cathedral, made in 1733 at the expense of Domingo Valentín Guerra Arteaga y Leiva Domingo Valentín was ordained a priest on 4 August 1706. In 1708 he obtained a doctorate in law in Rome. On 26 January 1711, while in Rome, he was granted the benefits of dean and canon in Segovia Cathedral. In 1714 he was unexpectedly appointed confessor to Queen Elisabeth Farnese, second wife of King Philip V of Spain. He joined the Spanish court, where he stayed for the remainder of his life. His duties as the queen's confessor meant he was unable to perform his duties in the cathedral of Segovia. In 1715 Pope Clement XI agreed to exempt him from the requirement to live in Segovia. In 1724 Pope Benedict XIII gave Philip V permission to build a collegiate church dedicated to the Holy Trinity in the Royal Palace of La Granja de San Ildefonso. Philip V made Domingo the first abbot of the college in 1725. To take the position he had to renounce his benefits of dean and canon in Segovia Cathedral. Philip V also obtained Domingo's appointment as Archbishop of Amida in partibus, which gave him greater status at court. Domingo Valentín was appointed Titular Archbishop of Amida on 31 December 1725, and was ordained bishop on 31 March 1726. His principal consecrator was Cardinal Carlos de Borja y Centellas, Patriarch of the West Indies. His principal co-consecrators were bishops Benito Madueño y Ramos and Dionisio Francisco Mellado Eguíluz. Baltasar de Mendoza y Sandoval, Bishop of Segovia, died on 4 November 1727. Philip V presented Domingo Valentín as his candidate for the new bishop. He was appointed Bishop of Segovia on 8 March 1728. On 16 April 1728 an attorney took possession of the seat of the diocese in his name. He could not come in person due to his court duties as the queen's confessor. Instead he appointed José Francisco Magdaleno as governor of the diocese, responsible for day-to- day administration, who was elevated to Bishop of Teos in partibus. Domingo Valentín was the principal consecrator of Cardinal Álvaro Eugenio de Mendoza Caamaño y Sotomayor (1734). He died on 29 May 1742. He was succeeded as Bishop of Segova by Diego García de Medrano, who was appointed on 24 September 1742.

Early life and education  Krupinski studied experimental psychology at Cornell University, and graduated in 1984. She moved to Montclair State University for her graduate studies, where she was named most outstanding student in arts and sciences. Krupinski earned a doctorate in experimental psychology at Temple University in 1990, where she was a Dean's Fellow.  Career and research  She served as Professor in the Department of Radiology, Psychology and Public Health at Arizona State University from 1992. In 2013, she was elected President of the Medical Image Perception Society, a group of academics who study the process of information perception and recognition in medical images. Since 2015, Krupinski has served as Professor at Emory University, where she is based in the Department of Radiology. She serves a Vice Chair for Research and leads the Imaging Implantation Division. Her research considers medical decision-making and telemedicine, and the future of medical imaging. Medical images are used by physicians to make decisions about diagnosis and treatment, a process which involves visual inspection and interpretation. These two aspects make use of perception and cognition. As medical imaging has become more significant in the training of physicians, Krupinski has called for better understanding of how clinicians interact with images. Image interpretation is an art; and Krupinski looks to optimise the presentation of medical images to both educate trainees and ensure better patient outcomes. It is estimated the mistakes in assessing medical images accounts for almost 30 % of the errors in radiology. With the rise of artificial intelligence in assessing medical images, Krupinski has called for the need for a balance of human intelligence. She serves as Co-Director of the Southwest Telehealth Resource Center. She was inducted into the College of Fellows of both the American Institute for Medical and Biological Engineering and SPIE in 2017.

It is situated on the coast of the Adriatic Sea, from the town center of Rimini. Miramare is equidistant between the town center and the nearby town of Riccione.  History  In Roman times, the site of Miramare was located at the third mile post south of the Arch of Augustus, along the Via Flaminia (connecting Rimini and Rome). This site is known as Il Terzo (the third), or colloquially, the stronz d'Urland. The ancient stone demarcating this location remains visible in the ground. Other stones near Il Terzo comprising the original pavement of the Via Flaminia have also been discovered in excavations during the past decade. Settlement outside the centers of Rimini and Riccione began in the mid-19th century, with the increase in popularity of bathing in the Adriatic. In the late 1880s, politician and visionary Sebastiano Amati conceived the development of the coastal region between Rimini and Riccione. In addition to the expansion of roads and the railroad in both town centers, he envisioned that Rimini and Riccione would be connected by a new road along the coast and new hotels would be built. Construction of this road began in the early 1900s, and by 1907, interest in expansion independently from Rimini grew. Around this time, c. 1905, the development and settlement of Miramare began; the modern hospital was constructed north of Miramare, and numerous hotels were built along the coast between Rimini and Riccione.  Tourism  The Bologna–Ancona railway divides Miramare into two parts: while the area west of the railway is primarily residential, Miramare is located along the beach and is a popular tourist destination, both for Italians and international travelers from across Europe. Along the coast, there are numerous accommodations and recreational facilities for tourists. These include hotels, stores, restaurants, bars, discos, and arcades. Among these is the disco Altro Mondo Studios, which became well known across Europe by the 1980s. There are also many inexpensive two and three star hotels (pensioni), which are popular among young travelers.  Transportation  = Air = Federico Fellini International Airport, serving Rimini, San Marino, and nearby regions, is located west of Miramare. It is one of the main gateways to tourism in Rimini and Riccione. = Rail = Miramare is served by the Miramare railway station, a minor station on the Bologna–Ancona railway. It is served by around 15 regional trains per day; these services are operated by Trenitalia. = Public transportation = Miramare is served by several bus routes. The Rimini–Riccione trolleybus, also known as line 11, runs regularly along the coast between Rimini's town center and Riccione, passing through Miramare.

Life  Albert Steck was son of Ludwig Franz Julius Steck, a member of the Bürgergemeinde of Bern and was a grandson of Johann Rudolf Steck (1772-1805), who served as the General Secretary of the Helvetic Republic in 1798/1799. From 1864 to 1870 he studied law in Bern, Heidelberg, and Leipzig. From 1876 to 1877, he was a civil servant in Bern. In 1878, after the end of the national crisis which triggered the Swiss Kulturkampf, Steck was elected to the Grand Council of Canton Bern, which had been established by moderate conservatives. In spring 1882, he secured his re-election as part of the liberal left wing, Free- thinking party. Disappointed by the internal squabbling in the parliamentary party and suffering from health problems, Steck resigned in August of 1883. Subsequently, he met Alexander Reichel (1853-1921), the founder of the General Workers' Association of Bern and Surrounds, who introduced Steck to socialist ideas. In the context of late 19th century social democracy, Steck adopted a democratic reformist perspective. In 1886 he was one of the founders of the Swiss Strikers' Fund. After Steck failed to win the Grütli Union over to his policies, he and Reichel founded a new social democratic party and began publish in the weekly periodical, The Swiss Social Democrat, which Steck edited, in 1888. Steck had supported the efforts of Hermann Greulich (1842-1925) in Zurich as early as 1870, but it was only on 21 October 1888 in Bern that Steck and Reichel attempted to form a national social democratic party, the Social Democratic Party of Switzerland (SP), out of the numerous Swiss regional workers' associations. In January 1889, Reichel was elected as the first party president, Steck as the vice-president and first party secretary. In 1891 he succeeded Reichel as party president, but was soon succeeded by Eugen Wullschleger. Steck lost influence in the SP after the Käfigturm riots in Bern in 1893, as the party became much more radical. He served in the Grand Council once more, as a representative of the party from 1892-1894. Steck was married first to Anna Margaretha Manni, and then to Leonie Brodbeck (1859-1946), who was active in the Swiss women's labour movement.

Salt has also been a member of the New Zealand national team in various FIBA competitions. Early life and career Born in London, England, Salt grew up in Auckland, New Zealand, where he had a distinguished career at Westlake Boys High School. In 2013, Salt debuted in the New Zealand NBL for the Super City Rangers, averaging 8.6 points and 5.4 rebounds in 14 games.

He played sparingly in his redshirt freshman season, but then became a steady rotation player for the Cavaliers for the rest of his career. In Salt's senior season, the Cavaliers began the season still stinging from becoming the first top seed to lose to a 16 seed in the NCAA Tournament. The Cavaliers won a share of the Atlantic Coast Conference regular season title and were again a number one seed. While playing modest minutes through much of the tournament, Salt played a key role against Purdue in the Elite Eight. Matching up against the Boilermakers' big and physical front line, Salt played 34 minutes and scored 5 points, grabbed eight rebounds and collected a pair of steals to help the Cavaliers to an overtime win and a spot in the Final Four.

Set in late December 2020, it features a military conflict between NATO and Russian military forces across two continents, as the latter plots to retake a rare-earth metal mine in East Africa. Red Metal is Greaney’s first stand-alone novel and is Rawlings' debut novel. The book debuted on The New York Times, USA Today and Amazon bestseller's lists.  Plot summary  Three years ago, the Russian Ground Forces are forced to relinquish control of a rare-earth mine in Mrima Hill near Mombasa, Kenya. Bitter about the retreat, Spetsnaz officer Yuri Borbikov formulates Operation Red Metal, an extensive military strike across Europe as a large diversion to retake the mine. In the present day, Chinese Sea Dragon naval commandos infiltrate Taiwan and assassinate the presidential candidate of the pro- Beijing Taiwan Democratic Communist Party. The Communist Party of China publicly frames the ruling Kuomintang party for the assassination and threatens military intervention over the elections.

The two are tasked to investigate an intelligence leak of an extra-marital affair between two high-ranking officers of the Indo-Pacific Command that causes both of them to be relieved and disrupts the chain of command. Connolly and Griggs consult NSA analyst Nik Melanopolis who deduces that the leak was engineered by Russian GRU hackers. The Joint Chiefs, however, are predisposed to a war in the Pacific and deploy Carrier Strike Group 5 to Taiwan. In Moscow, Russia, President Anatoly Rivkin authorizes Operation Red Metal without the approval of the Ministry of Defence in response to crippling economic sanctions. He assigns Colonel General Eduard Sabaneyev to lead a lightning raid via militarized trains into Europe to destroy the US African and European Commands in Stuttgart, Germany, under the guise of military exercises with Belarus. Meanwhile, Colonel General Boris Lazar is tasked to lead an invasion force to seize Mrima Hill by travelling overland through Iran, also under the guise of military exercise, and covertly sail to Djibouti where they will be free to advance into Kenya before the US can mount a response. General Sabaneyev and Colonel Borbikov are confident that the operation will succeed, but General Lazar is disturbed by Borbikov's contingency plan to destroy the rare-earth mine with nuclear-tipped artillery shells if they fail to capture it. Tensions spike in the Pacific when the destroyer USS Stethem sinks an attacking Chinese submarine in the international waters near Taiwan. The United States National Security Council consequently decides to fully commit to deterrence against China and deploy the Global Response Force to US Pacific bases, effectively isolating NATO forces in Europe. Colonel Connolly and Major Griggs attempt to advise the Joint Chiefs on the Russian machinations but are ignored and rebuffed. Poland, however, is disturbed by the Russian military buildup and begins activating the civilian Territorial Defence Force to prepare for a possible invasion. In Djibouti City, French DGSE intelligence officer Pascal Arch-Blanchette notices Russian Spetsnaz activity in the country. His investigation is ignored by the French government, but he tips off his son, Captain Apollo Arch-Blanchette of the 13th Parachute Dragoon special reconnaissance regiment, who discovers Russian satellite phone signals at mountain peaks in Germany, Austria, and the Czech Republic. Apollo's platoon recons the sights and repels Spetsnaz teams under Colonel Borbikov, but do not realize that Borbikov's men are broadcasting false all-clear radar signals to NATO's airborne early warning and control stations. Operation Red Metal officially begins on Christmas Eve when a Russian Air Force Su-57 stealth fighter squadron simultaneously shuts down communications across Europe by launching anti-satellite missiles, as GRU \\"Fancy Bear\\" hackers penetrate NATO’s communications relays, causing an internet and cellular blackout across Europe. General Sabaneyev then launches the raiding force from Belarus through Poland and into Germany, using the covert assault train Red Blizzard 1 as his mobile headquarters. The Polish Land Forces and TDF are quickly overrun. A young TDF volunteer named Paulina Tobiasz becomes a local hero and is promoted to sergeant after her entire company is wiped out by a Russian armored column. Maintenance detachments of the US 37th Armor Regiment in Grafenwöhr are also alerted to the invasion, having been sent ahead of their combat counterparts to prepare for training exercises. Despite being primarily composed of maintenance units, Lieutenant Colonel Tom Grant scrapes together a composite M1A2 Abrams tank regiment supported by a German Army Leopard 2 tank battalion, Apache sections from the 3rd Aviation Regiment, and US Air Force A-10 Warthogs from the US Air Force 57th Wing. Despite their attempted defense, the US-German forces take heavy casualties as the Russian armor units lay waste to AFRICOM, EUCOM, Katterbach Kaserne, and Ramstein Air Base, severely crippling NATO's military and logistical strength. Having completed their objectives in Europe, the Kremlin contacts the White House and demands a ceasefire and safe return of all Russian forces through Germany and Poland into neutral Belarus, which the US and NATO accept. Colonel Grant wants to commit the 37th Armor to a full counterattack, but US forces in Europe are ordered to escort the Russians back to Belarus. Meanwhile, General Lazar marches his forces southeast through Iran for Oman, where they embark on a heavily guarded flotilla escorted by Iranian container ships west for Djibouti City. Back in the Pentagon, Colonel Connelly is finally able to convince the Joint Chiefs of Russia's true objective. The Pentagon then deploys the Marine Regimental Combat Team 5 under the command of Colonel Ken Caster to sail to East Africa aboard the USS Boxer (LHD-4) and prevent the Russians from taking Mrima Hill. Connolly is assigned to RCT-5 as a Pentagon liaison and acts as an assistant operations officer thanks to his friendship with Caster and his subordinates. A flight of USAF B-1 Lancer bombers attempt to intercept the Russian-Iranian flotilla over the Gulf of Aden but are shot down by anti-air missiles. In Europe, the Polish government plans to violate the ceasefire by funneling the withdrawing Russians through Wrocław to be ambushed by the TDF and GROM special forces. Polish Air Force F-16s destroy several bridges along the Oder River, forcing the Russians into a pitched battle with the TDF militia in the streets of Wrocław where they suffer heavy casualties as they push through the city and across the Oder. Mistaking them as being allied with the Poles, Russian BTR-80s fire on the US 37th Armor units escorting them. President Henry then authorizes lethal action against the Russians in Europe and the US-German forces in Poland begin attacking Sabaneyev's force with combined land and air assets as they retreat through Wrocław. NATO forces continuously pursue the Russians through south- central Poland while TDF pockets harry them through the countryside. President Henry later convinces the president of Taiwan to postpone the country’s upcoming elections in order to forestall an imminent Chinese invasion and therefore provide more reinforcements to Africa. Upon arriving at the port of Djibouti City, Lazar’s flotilla is attacked by the submarine USS John Warner, destroying oil tankers and rendering his T-90 battle tanks useless. Nevertheless, Lazar, accompanied by Borbikov, presses on and marches his forces south for the mine. Pascal manages to transmit intelligence of the Russian forces to the DGSE but is captured and executed by Borbikov's Spetsnaz. Apollo's Dragoon platoon also arrives in Djibouti and harasses the Russian columns as they march through Ethiopia. Meanwhile, the USS Boxer lands RCT-5 in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. Upon receiving intelligence from Apollo's Dragoons, the 1st Light Armored Reconnaissance Battalion conducts delaying ambushes against the Russians at Moyale, Ethiopia, and Mount Kenya. RCT-5 is then able to establish a hasty defense base at Mrima Hill with support from a French Foreign Legion battalion. Back in Europe, USAF Warthog pilot Major Ray \\"Shank\\" Vance destroys the Russian attack train in Poland and Sabaneyev is forced to move out the rest of his forces overland. A Russian supply train is sent from Belarus to reinforce Sabaneyev but TDF militia led by Sergeant Tobiasz switch the tracks to divert the train's course, causing it to be ambushed and destroyed by PLF PT-91 Twardy tanks. After being shot down by an Su-57, Shank joins Tobiasz's militiamen and assists them in destroying a Russian armor column by coordinating airstrikes from other Warthogs of his squadron. He and Tobiasz develop romantic feelings for each other afterwards. Shank even has a promissory ring forged for her, but he is killed as a PLF platoon attempts to return him to US forces. The Russians eventually reach Belarus and cross the Bug River, where General Sabaneyev leaves a T-14 Armata platoon as a rearguard to fire on the pursuing NATO forces, confident that they will not retaliate. Colonel Grant, however, is enraged after receiving fire from the T-14s and orders the 37th Armor to press the attack into Belarus, violating their neutrality and shocking Sabaneyev. Running desperately low on fuel, Sabaneyev attempts to coerce a supply base in Slonim to surrender their reserves but the Belarusians refuse to comply. The 37th Armor then attacks the base, destroys the remaining Russian armor, and captures Sabaneyev, defeating Operation Red Metal in Europe. In Kenya, General Lazar's force attacks Mrima Hill and start gradually obliterating the Marine defenses using accurate artillery strikes and frontal assaults with their BTRs while ZSU-23-4 Shilka tanks defend against Marine airstrikes. As the Marines are pressed to their breaking point, however, the USS John Warner slips through a Russian-Iranian blockade off the Kenyan coast and fires Tomahawk cruise missiles that destroy most of the Russian artillery batteries. Lazar goes missing in action as his BTR is destroyed and is presumed dead by Colonel Borbikov, who assumes command and orders a VDV regiment of the 76th Guards Air Assault Division to launch a final attack. Sensing the dire situation, Apollo leads his Dragoon platoon and a Marine squad on a recon sortie to mark the Russian paratrooper's staging areas for artillery strikes. They then stage a diversionary ambush against a VDV convoy at a large stating area. With the staging areas marked, Connolly gives the Marine artillery batteries Pentagon authorization for a massive \\"Shake 'n Bake\\" fire mission that decimates the VDV regiment and destroys many BTRs. With his final attack thwarted, Borbikov orders a reserve Russian artillery battery to shell the mine with the nuclear- tipped artillery shells as a last resort. A wounded Lazar storms in and has Borbikov arrested, who then tries to kill Lazar but is gunned down himself. Lazar negotiates a ceasefire with RCT-5 the next day. The remnant of his force retreats back to Djibouti with orders from Moscow and Operation Red Metal is decisively defeated. The political fallout causes Rivkin to be ousted from office by the Duma, as Sabaneyev is tried for war crimes by the International Criminal Court. In Warsaw, Poland, Tobiasz is commissioned as a PLF officer and receives the Virtuti Militari medal but is heartbroken by Shank's death. Colonel Grant returns to Germany expecting a court-martial for violating Belarusian neutrality but is instead re-assigned to Fort Bliss, he and his subordinates share a celebratory round of beer with their German counterparts. Apollo receives the Legion of Merit and buries Pascal's body in the Saint- Vincent Cemetery in Paris. He and his platoon sergeant then sets about the difficult task of apologizing to the families of their dead Dragoons. In Arlington, Connolly and Griggs are promoted and the former receives the Navy Cross. Taiwan resumes their presidential election and the Kuomintang win again despite the objections of the Chinese government. The People's Liberation Army then muster for naval invasion of Taiwan. The novel ends as Sea Dragons prepare to infiltrate the country once again.

They met up with Brigadier General Klaus Feldmann, the last German armored brigade commander before reforms reduced the size of the German tank corps. They met with a French special forces commander in Paris from the 13th Parachute Dragoon Regiment, and spent a day aboard the USS John Warner (SSN-785), a nuclear powered Virginia-class attack submarine of the United States Navy. Both flew to Nellis Air Force Base where they spent two days at the USAF tactical fighter center for the US A-10 Thunderbolt II learning flight tactics, each night meeting the officers off duty in the \\"Hog- Trough\\", the squadron's famed bar. In addition, Greaney and Rawlings acknowledge over a dozen other personal, military service-members they contacted to gain information to write the novel.  Reception  = Commercial = The novel debuted at number fifteen and Hardcover Fiction categories of the New York Times bestseller list for the week of August 4, 2019, making it Greaney's second NYT bestseller for the year of 2019. In addition, it debuted on the USA Today Best Selling Books list for the week of 4 August 2019. Red Metal achieved the Amazon Chart rating for the week of 21 July 2019. Apple Books listed Red Metal in sixth place for Mysteries & Thriller Bestsellers on July 21, 2019. = Critical = Publishers Weekly gave the book a Starred Review, praising the book as \\"The various battles—fought on land, sea, and in the air—are exciting, realistic, and technically detailed, complete with the high emotions experienced by the combatants. As in the best of this genre, there are no cartoon villains, just dedicated warriors who are given a mission and are determined to carry it out. This is powerful material, required reading for anyone interested in modern warfare.\\" In November 2019, they selected Red Metal as one of the \\"Best Books of 2019\\" in the Thriller/Mystery category. Kirkus Reviews wrote, \\"Readers will be humming \\"The Marines’ Hymn” after finishing this paean to the U.S. Marines. Hoorah! As with all of Greaney’s work, this is a fun read. If only all our wars were fiction.\\" Thriller novel reviewer The Real Book Spy stated that \\"While it’s already drawn comparisons to Tom Clancy’s Red Storm Rising (1986), Red Metal boasts even more action and tension, reading like a modern-day Game of Thrones (without the dragons and White Walkers), as individuals go all-in fighting for their cause—often with little regard for the rest of the world. Much like George R.R. Martin’s epic fantasy saga, Greaney and Rawlings rely more on their characters to drive the story than the explosions, gunfights, and eye- candy, of which there is still plenty. The wargaming is impressive to be sure, but it all works as well as it does because the characters are so well fleshed out, and the conflict so perfectly captured.\\"  References  Category:2019 American novels Category:American thriller novels ","title":"Red Metal"},{"id":"61484855","title":"1999 Russian Indoor Athletics Championships"},{"id":"61484856","text":"Bijay Subba is a Nepali politician and a member of the House of Representatives of the federal parliament of Nepal.

Early life and work as innkeeper Owen was born on 21 December 1768 in Portsea, Portsmouth, England. He worked as an inn keeper in Hampshire near Portsmouth during his years as a professional boxer. Innkeeping was a common profession for boxers of the era, perhaps because their notoriety drew more tenants, or because boxers had a better chance of maintaining order and collecting fares from unruly travelers. Background to English boxing in 1796 Owen fought under English Broughton rules. Under Broughton, if a man went down and could not continue after 30 seconds, the fight ended. Hitting a downed fighter and grasping or hitting below the waist were prohibited. Broughton invented and encouraged the use of \\"mufflers\\", a form of padded gloves, which were used in training and exhibitions. The advent of the Broughton rules around 1743 did allow fighters an advantage not enjoyed by modern boxers; a boxer could drop to one knee to start a 30-second count at any point in the match, but overuse of this privilege was frowned upon and sometimes disallowed by the judges. Taking the heavyweight championship of England John Jackson In 1796, the better known and larger English boxer, Londoner John Jackson vacated his English heavyweight championship, allowing Owen to fight for the title. Owen took the heavyweight championship of England on 14 Nov 1796 against William Hooper in forty rounds in Harrow, England. The bout lasted one hour and four minutes. Owen was known as a tough, strong opponent and used a studied and careful defense against Hooper in their well- known contest. In a rematch against Hooper, he successfully defended the title in February of 1797 in a win at Jeffries Close, England. Owen lost the English championship on 22 Aug 1797 to well known boxer Jack Bartholomew in a thirty minute bout at Moulsey Hurst, England in twenty-six rounds. Owen met the great London boxer Daniel Mendoza in a grudge match on 20 July, 1820, at Banstead Downs. Mendoza, the far better boxer in his prime, had been absent from the ring for fourteen years and was six years older. Owen defeated his best known opponent by knockout in twelve rounds, in a bout that lasted fifteen minutes. Like Mendoza, who would work at the Admiral Nelson Inn, Owen would work as an Inn Keeper as his second profession after ring retirement. Death Owen died at the age of 74, on 13 December 1843 at Plumstead, England.

Background At the Second Battle of El Alamein and the immediate retreat following, Italian losses were severe. The main mechanized arm of the Italian Army (Ariete Armored Division, Littorio Armored Division, and Trento Motorised Division, together composing XX Motorised Corps) was destroyed, as were the divisions of the other Italian corps engaged (X Corps, comprising Folgore Paratrooper Division, 27th Infantry Division Brescia, and 17th Infantry Division Pavia). Many of the Italian units fought bravely and effectively, and their sacrifice allowed the rest of the Axis army in Africa to escape. Italian forces had also been heavily engaged, and taken severe losses, at the First Battle of El Alamein. The Italian memorial memorializes both battles. Memorial Bust of Paolo Caccia Dominioni, at the memorial The Italian war memorial is built on Tel el-Eisa (Hill of Jesus) near the coast, a site of heavy fighting during the battle. (Tel el-Eisa is also referred to as \\"Hill 33\\" in descriptions of the battle.) It is the largest of the various national memorials at El Alamein. The main structure is a white marble tower. Paolo Caccia Dominioni, who had been at the battle, was the driving force behind the construction of the memorial. Caccia Dominioni devoted his postwar life to collecting the remains of Italian dead from the battlefield and advocating for the construction of a memorial. He designed the memorial, which was constructed between 1954 and 1958 by the Italian government under Caccia Dominioni's direction (an Italian cemetery had existed at the site since 1943). The cemetery contains several thousand graves, many marked \\"Ignoto\\" (\\"Unknown\\"). Some 38,000 Italian soldiers whose remains were never recovered are also honoured. Due to Paolo Caccia Dominioni's twenty years of effort, the remains of thousands of German and British soldiers (as well as Italian) were also eventually identified and received a proper burial. On 30 October 2012, an historical park was opened on the battle site to show visitors key points in the battle.

They were one of the most economically active families who helped to create an industrial revolution in Slovenian towns and cities and made a significant contribution to the historical records which include the fact that the land of Carniola was ranked as one of the most developed European provinces and which also influenced the development of the cities of Trieste, Sarajevo and Zagreb.  Biography  Tönnies manhole in Ljubljana Ljubljana Central Pharmacy in 1917 Župančičeva 8 building in Ljubljana Gustav Tönnies was born in Sweden, where he studied carpentry and worked as an apprentice in several European cities. In 1845, he was sent from Graz to Ljubljana to work on the construction of the roof of Kolizej, at the time one of the largest buildings in this part of Europe. Because the completed work was to an exceptionally high standard, Ljubljana Major Johann Nepomuk Hradeczky offered Gustav Tönnies the position of city carpenter. Because of this, he established his own company, which soon expanded to include other aspects of the building and construction industry: the production of various materials, machinery, and a foundry which were required for the advancement of his building business. Gustav Tönnies participated in the construction of the railway stations on the Celje – Ljubljana – Trieste route and later from Ljubljana to Treviso. He also took over the renovations and re-construction of various industrial buildings in Ljubljana which included: Madil textile factory; Cukrarna sugar refinery on Poljan in 1858, Kozler brewery in Sisak (now named Union) in 1866; Tschinkel & son confectionary and coffee substitute factory in 1871 (today Titus); Tobacco factory (later named Tobačna). In Trieste, he also constructed warehouses at the port and the main railway station where the first train arrived from Ljubljana on July 17, 1857. Gustav Tönnies acquired quarries in Nabrežina, Repentabar and Momjan. He also founded the factory Strojne Tovarne in Livarne Šiška and a brickworks in Koseze (which had the first circular furnace). In 1871 he joined company with F. Dobner, formerly directors of the ironworks at Dvor at Žužemberk, and in addition to building locksmithing, he also established an iron foundry and machine workshop; In 1880 Dobner exited the company, and Tönnies remained the sole owner of the \\"Gustav Tönnies machine shop and iron foundry\\". In particular, he made machinery for the wood industry and crafts, vacuum cleaners, turbines and steam engines. In 1895, an earthquake struck Ljubljana and the Tönnies Company was a great asset to the rebuilding of the city supplying the much needed construction materials for the building projects in progress. This dedicated engineer received an award from Emperor Franz Joseph on the 600th anniversary of the accession of Carniola to the Habsburg Monarchy. At the time of his death in 1886, the Tönnies establishments employed 650 people. The Tönnies sons continued their father's legacy and built the court palace; a town hall; a gymnasium; the Mladika complex; the Catholic printing house (today the Faculty of Law); the Jakopič Pavilion in Tivoli Park; the Yugoslav Credit Bank (now the Bank of Slovenia); the main railway station in Ljubljana and many other buildings in Ljubljana. In addition to the construction work of Tönnies, they also had important achievements in mechanical engineering. The machinery developed included that what was used in forestry industry; wood processing; pumps and turbines; belt presses and the instruments for measuring earthquakes.  Sons  * Gustav Tönnies Jr. (September 3, 1851 – October 22, 1922) studied construction at the Danube. craft school, and in 1887 acquired the right to craft buildings. He worked as builder, stonecutter and carpenter in Trieste until 1900; In 1901 he received a concession for the same crafts in Ljubljana and compensate u. the Adolf brothers as the holder of the trade right for the building.Slovenski biografski leksikon * Adolf Tönnies (September 21, 1855 – June 13, 1900) trained as a builder and worked for his father's building company. In 1883 he passed the technical exam in Trieste and obtained a concession for Trieste. He managed the Gustav Tönnies Company until his death. * William Tönnies (April 24, 1857 – May 31, 1925) trained in mechanical engineering and had technical management of the iron foundry and machine shop. *Emil Tönnies (September 7, 1863 – August 30, 1941) practiced as commercialist until 1914, managing his father's quarries in Aurisina and Monrupino. He continued the construction works, greatly expanding the family business. The iron foundry and machine shop were sold in 1919 by a new establishment. * Rudolf Tönnies (April 20, 1869 – December 6, 1929 in Munich), studied construction and civil engineering and worked for the Croatian government in Zagreb, then as lead architect for the Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina in Sarajevo. In 1918 he returned to Ljubljana, obtained a trade concession (building master) and joined his brothers. In Ljubljana he built around 1923 the Credit Bank (today the seat of the National Bank) and at the same time the Ljubljana yard (headquarters of Railway Transport Company).

It contains and protects the Montalban Gorge formed by the Marikina River that separates Mount Pamitinan and Mount Binacayan in the municipality of Rodriguez in Rizal. Established in 1996 through Proclamation No. 901 issued by President Fidel Ramos, the park is originally a component of the Mariquina Reserve founded in 1904 to protect the watershed of the Marikina River that supplied water to the city of Manila from the Wawa Dam located just above the Montalban Gorge in the early 1900s. The park is visited for its scenic views, as well as for recreational activities as hiking, mountain climbing, spelunking and historical sightseeing. It includes the Pamitinan Cave which played a role during the Philippine Revolution and World War II, and is the setting of a popular local legend called Bernardo Carpio. The picturesque Montalban Gorge was declared a national monument and reserved area in 1983 by the National Committee on Geological Sciences of the Ministry of Natural Resources. Geography View of the protected landscape from the peak of Mount Pamitinan The Marikina River immediately downstream from the Wawa Dam The Pamitinan Protected Landscape is situated in the sitio of Wawa within the jurisdiction of the barangay of San Rafael in the mountainous eastern section of Rodriguez, formerly the municipality of Montalban. It is centered on the high water gap carved by the Marikina River in the southern Sierra Madre of northern Rizal province. The Montalban Gorge, also known as Wawa Gorge, has been a popular tourist destination since the Colonial Era and was widely regarded as one of the most remarkable natural features of Oriental scenery in the early 1900s. It is ringed by a series of marble boulders, limestone crags and up to tall white rock walls. The gorge separates the high Mount Pamitinan on the north from the high Mount Binacayan on the south with the Wawa Dam and Marikina River running between them. Mount Pamitinan as seen from the Marikina River Mounts Pamitinan and Binacayan are two limestone mountains formed around 20-25 million years ago during the Miocene epoch. They create a dramatic backdrop to the \\"Wawa\\" Dam, so named for its resemblance to a portal or \\"entrance\\" in the local Dumagat language. The karst topography of the mountains is due to the continuous passage of water along their cracks and fractures over millions of years. Mount Pamitinan, the 22nd tallest mountain in Rizal, is a popular hiking destination for beginners from Metro Manila. It has designated hiking trails consisting of a muddy and slippery assault part and a rock climbing bouldering trail. It requires only two hours to reach its summit from the sitio of Wawa. Its twin mountain to the south, Mount Binacayan, has a more agricultural terrain consisting of less explored rock and bamboo trails. The Pamitinan Cave in Mount Pamitinan is a declared National Geological Monument. It is notable for its rich stalactites and stalagmites with rimstone pools and cave coral. The multichamber cave was used as a secret headquarters of the Katipunan where Andrés Bonifacio and his fellow revolutionaries first declared Philippine independence from Spain on April 12, 1895. It also figured during World War II when it was turned into an armory by the Japanese invading forces. Many Japanese were killed here during a three-month-long battle with American forces in 1945. A cavern which measures in height and radius called Bulwagan (\\"Hall\\") is located about from its mouth through a narrow passageway. It has the inscription Viva la Independencia written on its wall which dates back to the Philippine Revolution era. The cave is accessible via a hanging bridge from the Montalban gorge. An American-era watchtower adjacent to Wawa Dam The focal point of the protected area is the Wawa Dam, a decommissioned arch-gravity dam that is tall and long situated in this gorge portion of the Upper Marikina River. It was built in 1904 by the American colonial government and was the only source of water supply for Manila at the time until it was replaced by the Angat Dam in the 1960s. It is now a recreational and picnic spot where tourists ride bamboo rafts and swim in its reservoir that has an average depth of . The artificial waterfall over the dam was turned into a tourist spot where cottages and shops selling locals' fruit and vegetable produce have also been developed. It is accessible via a trek from the sitio of Wawa. The park also includes the high Mount Hapunang Banoi located just north of Mount Pamitinan. The mountain is the location of Mascap Spring. Another limestone cave known as Bat Cave which is only accessible during summer when the water level drops at Wawa Dam is also found within the protected area. Biodiversity The protected landscape park has rich flora and fauna owing to its location in the Sierra Madre range. It is a known birdwatching site that offers sightings of the endemic scale-feathered malkoha, grey-backed tailorbird, elegant tit, grey-rumped swiftlet, white- browed shama, crested honey buzzard, Philippine bulbul, feral pigeon, peregrine falcon and mangrove blue flycatcher. The park's vegetation resembles that of the adjacent Upper Marikina River Basin Protected Landscape and comprises dipterocarp species characteristic of lowland forests such as tanguile, mayapis, bagtikan, white lauan and red lauan.

The genus is known from fossil fruits found in the early Eocene deposits of northern Washington state, United States. P. sternhartae are possibly the fruits belonging to the extinct trochodendraceous leaves Tetracentron hopkinsii. Distribution and paleoenvironment Pentacentron sternhartae is known from specimens which are recovered from outcrops of the early Eocene, Ypresian Klondike Mountain Formation in Republic. The Klondike Mountain Formation preserves an upland temperate flora which was first interpreted as being microthermal, however further study has shown the flora to be more mesothermal in nature. The plant community preserved in the Klondike Mountain formation is a mixed conifer–broadleaf forest with large pollen elements of birch and golden larch, but also having notable traces of fir, spruce, cypress, and palm. Taxonomy The species was described from a type specimen, the holotype Infructescence, number SR 93-08-02, plus a group of eight paratype specimens. At the time of description, type series specimens were preserved in the Stonerose Interpretive Center paleobotanical collections in Republic, Washington. Manchester et al published their 2018 type description of the species in the International Journal of Plant Sciences along with the type description of Paraconcavistylon wehrii. The genus name Pentacentron was coined as a reference to the fruits five-fold symmetry, which is distinct from the fourfold symmetry displayed by extant Tetracentron species. They chose the specific epithet sternhartae as a combined patronym honoring Michael E. Sternberg and matronym honoring Janet L. Hartford of Republic, Washington. Sternberg and Hartford have helped to facilitate the collecting of fossils at Republic, and promoted the research and education of fossils done through the Stonerose Interpretive center. Pe. sternhartae is one of between three and four trochodendraceae species that have been described from the Klondike Mountain Formation. Broadly circumscribed, three other species have been identified at Republic, Paraconcavistylon wehrii, Tetracentron hopkinsii, and Trochodendron nastae. Additionally the species Trochodendron drachukii is known from related Kamloops group shales at the McAbee Fossil Beds near Cache Creek, British Columbia. Manchester et al 2018 noted that Tr. drachukii is likely the fruits of Tr. nastae, while Pe. sternhartae are likely the fruits of Te. hopkinsii. If fossils of the fruits and foliage in attachment are found, that would bring the species count down to three whole plant taxa. Description Pentacentron sternhartae fruiting spikes range between in length with the fruits arranged long the axis in a helical pattern. Each capsule is sessile on the thin raceme. The caspsular heads consist of five fruiting chambers, arranged pentagonally around the midline of the wide head. Growing from the middle area of each chamber is an apically and inwardly curving persistent style, each with an elliptical nectary bulge at its base. Rimming the base of each fruit are Perianth scars creating a raised flange. The fruits opened apically, through separation lines running from just above the styles up to the fruit tip where they met to form a pentagonal star like opening.

This unit work and was formed like Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC) to execute special operations missions worldwide.  History  The Koopsus was established in 2015. At that time, this force consisted of 90 people who would serve in operational status. Revisions to Indonesia's anti-terror laws, which were passed in 2018, allowed the military to be formally involved in counter- terrorism operations. Until then, the Indonesian National Police’s elite wing, the Detachment 88 (Densus 88), had been the country's lead security unit in pursuing terrorists. The Special Operations Command was established on 30 July 2019.  Organization  According to Commander of the Indonesian National Armed Forces Air Marshal Hadi Tjahjanto, the Koopsus consists of 500 personnel drawn from the army, navy and air force. About 400 Koopsus personnel carry out preventive measures, including surveillance and intelligence, while the remaining 100 members are tasked with confronting terrorist acts. = Commander = The Koopsus is to be commanded by a two-star general officer, while the minimum position is a one-star general officer. Currently, Brigadier General Rochadi has been appointed on 30 July 2019 as the unit's commander.  Mission  President of Indonesia Joko Widodo signed, on 3 July 2019, a presidential decree clarifying the military's expanded role in counter- terrorism. Koopsus is to be coordinated with the Indonesian National Police in carrying out its mission of responding to high-intensity terror acts. According to the Decree, the Koopsus is in charge of conducting special operations and activities to safeguard the Indonesian national interests both at home and abroad.  Reactions  The speaker of the House of Representatives, Bambang Soesatyo, said he hoped that the formation of Koopsus would also strengthen the monitoring of cyberspace. According to Air Marshal Hadi Tjahjanto, the establishment of the unit is an implementation of the 11 Priority Programs, a military program to deal with a spectrum of threats.

The species is known from fossil leaves found in the early Eocene deposits of northern Washington state, United States and south Central British Columbia. The species was first described from fossil leaves found in the Allenby Formation. T. hopkinsii are possibly the leaves belonging to the extinct trochodendraceous fruits Pentacentron sternhartae. Distribution and paleoenvironment Tetracentron hopkinsii was initially described from two leaves, both recovered from the Early Eocene, Ypresian Allenby Formations One Mile Creek outcrop north of Princeton, British Columbia. The one mile creek site is notable for being dominated by fossils of Betula leopoldae though Acer species, Rosaceae species, Pistillipollianthus wilsoni, Tsukada davidiifolia, and Ulmus okanaganensis are also present. The Allenby Formation preserves an upland temperate flora which was first interpreted as being distinctly microthermal, however further study has shown the flora to be more upper microthermal to lower mesothermal in nature, with few to no days below freezing in a year. Analysis of pollen samples shows plant community preserved at the site was mesic mixed conifer–broadleaf forest, with large pollen elements of birch and golden larch, but also having notable traces of fir, spruce, cypress, and palm. The plants and animals are preserved in a finely layered light greenish-gray lacustrine shale as compression-impression fossils. Pigg et al noted in 2007 that one leaf assignable to Tetracentron had been found in the Klondike Mountain Formation of Republic, Washington, but was not complete enough to confidently attribute it to T. hopkinsii. The recovery of additional leaves deposited in the Stonerose Interpretive Center allowed Manchester et al to assign the Republic flora specimens to T. hopkinsii in 2018, expanding the confirmed distribution of the species. Taxonomy Examination of the species was performed by Kathleen Pigg, Richard Dillhoff, Melanie DeVore and Wesley Wehr based on the study of the holotype \\"UWBM 54185\\" and paratype \\"UWBM 56700ab\\" leaves. Both specimens were part of the in the Burke Museum of Natural History and Culture paleobotanical collections at the time of description. Pigg et al published their 2007 type description of the species in the International Journal of Plant Sciences along with the type description of Trochodendron drachukii. They chose the specific epithet hopkinsii as a patronym honoring Donald Q. Hopkins in recognition for his collecting efforts at both the One Mile Creek site and other sites in the Okanagan highlands floras. Along with the 2008 description of Tetracentron atlanticum from the Mid to Late Miocene of Iceland, Grímsson et al documented and figured Tetracentron pollen recovered from the Princeton Chert locality of the Allenby Formation. T. hopkinsii is one of between three and four trochodendraceous species that have been described from the Klondike Mountain Formation. Broadly circumscribed, three other species have been identified in the Republic flora, Paraconcavistylon wehrii, Pentacentron sternhartae, and Trochodendron nastae. Additionally the species Trochodendron drachukii is known from related Kamloops group shales at the McAbee Fossil Beds near Cache Creek, British Columbia. Manchester et al 2018 noted that Tr. drachukii is likely the fruits of Tr. nastae, while Pe. sternhartae are likely the fruits of Te. hopkinsii. If fossils of the fruits and foliage in attachment are found, that would bring the species count down to three whole plant taxa. Description The elliptical Tetracentron hopkinsii type specimen leaves have a length to width ratio of 1.3:1, being up to in length and up to . The venation is palmate with one thin midvein and two to three sets of lateral primaries which curve upwards towards the apex. The outermost set of lateral primaries are thin, branching off from the midvein at a 90° angle. Conversely the inter one to two sets of lateral primaries are thicker and arch towards the leaf apex. The secondary veins which branch off the midvein are thin, and fork out from the midvein at 32°–40° angles before meeting secondaries from the lateral primaries and forming chevrons. The tertiary veins and quaternary veins are percurrent forking at 60° to 70° angles. The margin has regular teeth formed by a convex basal side and a convex apical side which may divide into a subtooth. A persistent gland is present in the tooth tip and which is supplied by a central vein and two converging lateral veins. The robust long petiole starts wide at its base, and gradually thins along its length before meeting the leaf in the center of the cordate leaf base.

Early life Born in London in April 1968, Braine was educated at Eton College, and graduated with a BSc in Physics and Philosophy from King's College London. Since 1994, Braine has worked as a software developer and a designer, and has run a photography business based in London. He founded Cyberphotographer, a web- based event photography service, in 1999. Customers have included Cable & Wireless, Carlton Television, Channel 5, Ernst & Young, Eurosport, Hugo Boss, Jardine Lloyd Thompson, JPMorgan Chase, Lastminute.com, Microsoft Corporation, MTV, PlayStation, Puma, The Times and Time magazine. Early political career Braine was a campaigner for the Referendum Party in the 1990s, and since the party's demise in 1997 has supported UKIP. During the 2016 EU referendum, Braine served as a borough manager for pro-Brexit organisations Vote Leave and Grassroots Out (GO) in Kensington and Chelsea, leading a group of ninety volunteers. Braine has stood as a UKIP candidate in local, general and European Parliament elections. In the 2017 general election, he was the UKIP candidate for the constituency of Ruislip, Northwood and Pinner, where he came last of five, with 2.2 per cent of the vote. He was the second UKIP candidate on the London constituency list in the 2019 European Parliament election, behind party leader Gerard Batten, but they both failed to be elected. Leader of the UK Independence Party =Election as leader= On 10 August 2019, Braine was elected as the leader of UKIP, receiving 53% of the vote. He was endorsed by former UKIP leader Gerard Batten after the National Executive Committee prohibited Batten from standing. He became the first Old Etonian to lead UKIP since Lord Pearson of Rannoch. =2019 party conference= Braine refused to attend UKIP's annual party conference in September 2019, in protest at the UKIP National Executive Committee's decision to no longer regard Gerard Batten as a member of the party \\"in good standing\\". He wrote: “I have made clear to the chairman and NEC that I would not attend unless something drastic was done to increase ticket sales, namely returning Gerard Batten to good standing to heal the rift with the many members who are boycotting conference for that reason”. UKIP's party chairman, Kirstan Herriot, commented: \\"Both I and the NEC believe it is a complete insult to the membership to attempt to cancel conference because of a potentially low turn- out...it is also a particular affront to hard-working regional, county and branch officers who have worked hard in encouraging members to attend conference to hear Richard lay out his vision for the future of UKIP.\\" Neil Hamilton commented on Braine's refusal to attend the conference held in Newport, Wales, saying: \\"This would have been a great opportunity for him to make himself known in Wales and he has turned it down for a totally spurious reason\\", and that Braine \\"is a novice and he has only been involved in politics a couple of years, he is almost completely unknown\\". =Suspension from UKIP and resignation = In October 2019, Braine was suspended from UKIP after being accused of stealing data from the party, along with three other members: Jeff Armstrong, Mark Dent and Tony Sharp. All four members were reported to the National Fraud Intelligence Bureau. UKIP's application in the High Court for an injunction against Braine et alia was denied by Mr Justice Warby of the High Court Queen's Bench Division, who said that > \\"the prospects of UKIP establishing at a trial that any of the defendants to > this claim obtained, and then threatened to disclose, confidential > information... ...are slender in the extreme, or worse\\".

He attended public schools in LaSalle and Winn Parish, graduating in 1945 from Winnfield High School. He served in the United States Navy from April 1946 to February 1948. Long attended college at Northeast Junior College in Monroe, Louisiana, graduating in 1950, and then at Northwestern State College in Natchitoches, Louisiana, from which he graduated in 1951. He was recalled to active duty in the Navy from September 1951 to December 1952, then graduated from Louisiana State University Law School in Baton Rouge in February 1959. Long was admitted to the Louisiana bar in 1959 and began the practice of law in Jena, Louisiana. Long was elected to the Louisiana State Senate and served from May 1956 to May 1964, after which he ran in the primary to be the Democratic nominee for election to United States House of Representatives representing Louisiana's 8th congressional district. His opponent in the primary was the incumbent, his cousin Gillis Long. Both of the Longs were segregationists but Gillis Long was less outspoken in his views than Speedy Long was, and Gillis had also, according to Speedy, aided the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 by voting to increase the size of the House Rules Committee from 12 to 15 members, thus diluting the South's influence on the committee. Speedy used the slogan \\"Vote Against the Man Who Voted Against the South\\" in the campaign against Gillis. A state senator from New Orleans described the difference between the two Longs: Speedy was \\"a redneck\\" with a regional focus, while Gillis was \\"a cosmopolitan\\". In the primary, Speedy Long easily beat Gillis Long. Speedy's campaign in the general election was limited to a single 150-second television appearance. Although the Republican Presidential candidate, Barry Goldwater, carried the district, Democrat Speedy Long won election handily, becoming the sixth member of the Long family to serve in the United States Congress. Long served in the 89th (1965–1967), 90th (1967–1969), 91st (1969–1971), and 92nd (1971–1973) Congresses, but did not stand for re-election in 1972.

Some sources give 1865 as her year of birth.  Early life  Agnes Maria Caroline Zaremba was born in Breslau, Silesia (now Wrocław, Poland).  Career  In 1884, having performed in regional theatres, Sorma was invited to join the Deutsches Theater in Berlin, as a character actress. Sorma was perhaps best known for playing Nora in Henrik Ibsen's A Doll's House, beginning in 1894. She played Nora in Paris in 1899, where a critic marveled at her interpretation of the character: \\"Sorma has no need to resort to the tricks and devices of the art of acting; she had but to live and to reproduce that nature which she had assimilated to her own personality,\\" concluding that \\"a great performance like hers dissolves all criticism into praise, and the highest tribute of all is speechless admiration.\\" She also played Nora in the United States (1897), Italy, Austria, Belgium, Greece, and the Netherlands, and was the first actress known to play the character in Istanbul. Other stage appearances by Sorma were roles in The Sunken Bell, Der Strom, Liebelei, The Taming of the Shrew, Diplomacy, Chic, Hero and Leander, Die Konigskinder, Mädchentraum, Cyprienne, and Morituri. Many of her performances in New York and Chicago were given in German, for German-speaking American audiences.Agnes Sorma's grave in Berlin.  Personal life  Agnes Sorma married an Italian count and diplomat, Demetrius Minotto, in 1890. They had a son, James Minotto (1891–1980). In 1903, she was hospitalized with a \\"a severe nervous malady\\", attributed to marital difficulties, after rumors of his gambling debts and her affair with actor Harry Walden. During World War I, she volunteered as a nurse and gave benefit appearances for war relief causes, but was barred from the stage in Hanau because she was an Italian citizen by marriage. Meanwhile, her son in the United States was considered a security threat because of his German birth, and held in an internment camp in Georgia, until his wealthy American in-laws argued for his release. She was widowed in 1920, and she moved to the United States to be near her son, who had a ranch in Arizona. She sold her collection of art and antiques in 1925, to fund her travels. She was injured in a fall from a horse in 1926, and she died in Crown King, Arizona, in 1927, aged 63 years, from heart failure. Her grave is in Berlin.

Early life and education Cohn was born in Minneapolis, Minnesota, in 1950, and spent part of her childhood in Israel and the Netherlands. She studied in Israel for a semester of high school on the Eisendrath International Exchange (EIE) program, followed by a year at Hebrew University of Jerusalem at Mount Scopus. Cohn returned to the United States and continued her undergraduate studies at the University of Minnesota in history and Judaic studies. She then studied art history at Williams College, Massachusetts. Career Cohn quickly rose to become a director at the B'nai B'rith Museum and the Jewish Museum in Washington D.C., at the time one of the world's largest museums of Judaica. In 1982, Mark E. Talisman of Project Judaica recruited Cohn to join the curatorial team preparing The Precious Legacy. Cohn travelled to the State Jewish Museum in Prague, Czechoslovakia, and helped select items for loan to the Smithsonian Institution for the travelling exhibition. Cohn was chosen as the international tour's project director, and was involved in every aspect of the undertaking. During the same period, Cohn was director of planning for the future US Holocaust Memorial Museum, which she believed \\"should strive for authenticity\\". She resigned from the position in January 1985, citing working problems with the oversight council. A turnover of development personnel followed as the council sought a new direction for the museum and its exhibitions. Cohn returned to the Smithsonian Institution Traveling Exhibition Service (SITES), becoming a program director. Among her projects were the exhibits Crossroads of Continents: Cultures of Siberia and Alaska, September 11: Bearing Witness to History, and 381 Days: The Montgomery Bus Boycott Story.

It is based on David MacGregor's play of the same name. Cast *Carrie Preston as Claire *Bernard White as Ridley *Brian Hutchison as Phil *Heather Raffo as Lauren  Plot  On Halloween night, two couples meet at one of their houses for drinks and hors d'oeuvres before planning on heading out to a massive party. Dressed in their finest costumes (witch, cowboy, doctor, and Queen Elizabeth I), the hostess brings out a bottle of blue wine she picked up in Peru. Based on an old Inca recipe, the wine supposedly has truth-telling properties and is brewed from the skins of blue dart tree frogs. Three of the four drink the wine and the conversation begins to take odd turns. Some of the \\"truths\\" are harmless enough, but progressively get darker and more disturbing. It gradually becomes clear that the marriage of one of the couples is disintegrating due to a lack of truthfulness, and the other marriage is only held together by lies. Production According to Preston, the film was shot in Lincoln, Nebraska the hometown of director Knight. Reception The film opened to positive reviews. Mark Adams of Screen Daily wrote, “A smartly and slickly made indie drama, cleverly adapted by playwright David MacGregor from his own production and blessed with four fine performances. Director Sarah Knight keeps ‘Vino Veritas’ moving nicely, and makes good use of her interiors that help belie the film’s stagey origins.” L. Kent Wolgamott of the Lincoln Journal Star penned, “‘Vino Veritas’ never feels ‘stagey.’ That’s a measure of the quality of MacGregor’s adaptation, Knight’s direction, John Beymer’s cinematography and the acting.” Tom Long of Detroit News wrote, “It's highly entertaining if occasionally (and appropriately) cringe-inducing and offers some fine actors the opportunity to strut their stuff.

History The settlement was originally located on Mill Creek, west of its present location. J. J. Vest and his family were early settlers, arriving in the area in 1873. Vest operated a grist mill and general store, and in 1877, he organized Saint's Rest Baptist Church. In 1888, Vest moved the church to Wideman (later named Boswell) in Izard County. When a post office was established in 1891, the settlement was officially named \\"Jumbo\\" due to a misreading by the US Postal Service of \\"Jimbo Smith\\", one of the settlement's founders. Jumbo had several houses, in addition to the grist mill, general store, and post office. Thirty years after its founding, river flooding forced residents to move Jumbo to its present location, closer to the county seat Melbourne. By 1927, Jumbo was \\"thriving\\" at its new location, with a general store, saw mill, cotton gin, blacksmith shop, grist mill, and several residences. Jumbo Church of Christ was completed in 1928 and was used for religious purposes, as well as a school, meeting hall, and voting place. The church is listed on National Register of Historic Places. Jumbo began to decline in 1949 when the area's small rural schools and voting places were consolidated to Melbourne. Residents began moving to Melbourne and other areas, and by the 1960s few people still resided in Jumbo, and its businesses had closed.

Biography Georges Pontier was born 1 May 1943 in Lavaur in the Tarn. After studying at the major seminary of Albi he completed his training at the Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome where he obtained a degree in theology, then a master's degree in Modern Literature at the University of Toulouse. He was ordained a priest of the Diocese of Albi on 3 July 1966. He taught at the minor seminary of Saint-Sulpice-la-Pointe and became its rector. He was curate and then archpriest of the Albi cathedral from 1985 to 1988. Pope John Paul II appointed him Bishop of Digne on 2 February 1988 and he was consecrated on 20 March. John Paul made him Bishop of La Rochelle and Saintes on 5 August 1996. Pope Benedict XVI named him Archbishop of Marseille on 12 May 2006. Though orthodox in matters of theology, with respect to same-sex marriage and the ordination of women, for example, his rapprochement with Islam made him the \\"bête noire\\" of the political right. He was particularly engaged by the social situation of the Roma and the undocumented. In 2010 he arranged for retired priests to vacate six apartments in a Church-owned apartment building in the Saint-Pierre district of Marseille to allow for six Roma families to be housed there, provoking resistance from locals and their political representatives. And in 2017 he called on the French government to devise better solutions for the Roma who are being \\"shuffled from one place to another\\". In the Bishops Conference of France (CEF) he was vice president from 2001 to 2007, headed its Studies and Projects Committee from 2008 to 2013, and president from 2013 to 2019. In October 2015, as president of the CEF, he attended the Synod of Bishops on the Family. He declined to endorse the \\"proclamation of freedom of expression\\" that Reporters Without Borders invited all religious leaders to sign following the Charlie Hebdo shooting in January 2015. In a letter to the bishops of France, he said the statement itself seemed to doubt the commitment of religious leaders to freedom of expression and singled them out when all leaders of civic society should share this commitment. Pope Francis accepted his resignation, submitted as required when Pontier turned 75, on 8 August 2019. Auxiliary Bishop Jean-Marc Aveline was appointed to succeed him.

He was responsible for many civil, religious and industrial buildings in the baroque style. Life Juan Antonio Camacho de Saavedra was born in 1669, the fourth of five children of the master builder Jeronimo Camacho of Córdoba and of Maria Ana de Saavedra of Écija. Before the age of twenty he married his first cousin Antonia Ortiz, a native of La Rambla. His first wife gave him five children. His second wife was Antonia Vázquez, sister of the writer and sculptor Fr. Juan Vázquez. Camacho became a master builder, and as an architect and engineer repaired various industrial buildings. Both the nobility and the church noticed his ability, and he earned positions such as Master of Works of Córdoba, Master of Works of the Cathedral and Diocese of Córdoba and Master of Works of Priego. The main body of Camacho's work was done for Nicolás Fernández de Córdoba y de la Cerda, 8th Marquis of Priego and Duke of Medinaceli. In 1727, when he was 47 years old, Camacho had leased some houses of importance to the Angulo family in the square of San Andrés, Cordoba for one thousand fleeces annually. He was senior master of works of the city and the bishopric, charged with repairing the diocese's mills. Towards the end of his life he was ruined, and he died in anonymity. On the day before he died he signed a codicil to his will in which he declared that he was impoverished and the city of Cordoba owed him twenty thousand reais for his work on the Visos road and the Bridge of Alcolea. He died the next day, 4 October 1740. Works Hospital del Cardenal Salazar Camacho undertook an overhaul of the Medinaceli ducal palace in Montilla. The blueprints from 1709 have been preserved, although the work is now hard to distinguish due to later changes. He was responsible for the stairs of the Córdoba town hall. Minor works include the repair of the Capilla del Nacimiento in the Montilla parish church, structural reinforcement of the Tercia of Monturque and repair of the Tercia's oil mill in 1711. The Franciscan Convent of San Lorenzo, which was outside the city of Montilla, was moved to the city center in the 17th century. At the end of that century the Friars Recollects of the convent were housed in the central building of the College of the Incarnation, which had belonged to the Society of Jesus. Nicolás Fernández de Córdoba, 10th Duke de Medinaceli, paid for construction of a luxurious infirmary designed by Camacho in the place the Franciscans had left the majestic stone building is surrounded by secondary stone structures such as the convent church, three hermitages, a gateway, courtyards and a small garden. The infirmary has 7 individual rooms on each of its two floors. On the ground floor there was a large room for the nurses, a kitchen, pantry and storage rooms. The medieval castle of Montilla was built in the thirteenth century and partially demolished in 1508 by order of King Ferdinand II of Aragon to punish the 1st Marquis of Priego, Pedro Fernández de Córdoba y Pacheco for having led a riot in Córdoba against the inquisitor Diego Rodríguez de Lucero. Much of the material was used for other buildings in the city. In 1722 Camacho was given a commission to build a granary on the site, the Alhorí de Montilla. He reused what was left of the old fortress to create a large and beautiful granary. His construction of the Alhorí de Montilla (1723) respected the architectural elements of the remains of the medieval castle. The Hospital del Cardenal Salazar (1724) has great architectural beauty, with a facade of columns with Doric capitals flanking the arched entrance. The rooms surrounded patios that brought them light and air. In 1728 Camacho won the commission as master builder for the Baeza Gate Fountain. Camacho designed the Miragenil bridge arch over the Genil river in Puente Genil (1728). He designed the Ronda bridge over the Tagus waterfall with a round arch in diameter and a platform wide in collaboration with José García. For the Tagus bridge in Ronda he had to borrow the large amount of 20,000 ducats. The foundations were poorly built to save on cost, and the bridge collapsed in 1741. It was rebuilt between 1759 and 1793. Camacho made a major repair of the Martos mill (1731). In 1731 he was also working on the Franciscan convent of San Pedro el Real, with a facade very similar in style to that of the Hospital of Cardinal Salazar, which now houses the faculty of Philosophy and Letters. In 1733 he was working on the palace house of the nobleman Luis Fernández de Córdoba.

In 1963 an off-road competition motorcycle were prepared, the 125 Regolarità, derived from the Centomila model, with a five speed gearbox, reinforced frame and specialised suspension from Ceriani. The four-stroke OHV single-cylinder engine was developed to produce 12.5 bhp (9 kW) @ 8,500 rpm. The factory machines we entrusted to Dante Mattioli of the Fiamme Oro team to race. Good results were obtained, 2 team victories and 30 individual victories. Following the victories consequent interest from riders, a limited production run was made in 1965 for private riders. Production Placed on pre-order at 310,000 lira in the summer of 1965, the motorcycle was officially presented at the November at the Milan EICMA Motorcycle Show. Initially production was 46 units. Using the frame from the competition machines and Ceriani forks, the engine was detuned to produced 10 bhp. Also derived from the factory machines was the quickly detachable rear wheel, which left the hub and brake in place when removed. The model featured a high-level exhaust, rubber mounted petrol tank, headlight guard and swivelling footrests. A second batch of 17 machines was built in 1969. These machines had a different tank, front brake, forks, and carburettor. Power output was increased to 13 bhp (10 kW) @ 8,000 rpm.

History  The Electrical Association of Women developed in 1924 from a proposal by electrical engineer Mrs Mabel Lucy Matthews and taken up by Caroline Haslett at the Women's Engineering Society, having been initially rejected by the Institution of Electrical Engineers and the Electrical Development Association. The organisation focused on ‘emancipation from drudgery’ by extending the benefits of electrification to middle class and working class homes and to engage women’s experience in the design of electric appliances and model homes. The first meeting to develop the organisation, at this time called the Women's Electrical Association, was held on 12 November 1924 at 1 Upper Brook Street, home of Lady Katharine Parsons. Attendees were leading figures in the world of engineering and women’s organisations, including Sir Charles Parsons, Lord Headley, Sir Alfred Yarrow, Mr. F. S. Button, Mr J Beauchamp (Director of EDA), Mr B. Llewelyn Atkinson (Cable Makers Association), Margaret Partridge (WES member, electrical engineer and company director), Miss T J Dillon and Miss Hilda Shaw from the world of domestic science, Miss B J Lanfear of the Incorporated Municipal Electrical Association, with representatives from the Girl Guides, the Women’s Co-operative Guild, the Gardens Cities and Town Planning Association, the Headmistresses’ Association; the National Union of Women Teachers, the National Council of Women and the National Women Citizens’ Association. Mabel Matthews read a paper outlining her concept of using electricity ot lessen the burden on women to the meeting. > “When I was haymaking during the war, an old farm hand came to me and said, > “Now ma’am, this is a job where you can work hard or you can work light, > what you want is to work light”. I’ve never forgotten that, and I look round > and see lots of women working hard when they might work “light” with equally > effective results. This is where electricity can help: and not only in > regard to work but in health, hygiene and greater comfort in the home. The > average middle-class housewife and prosperous working women are very shrewd > and thrifty persons but they are very much apt to overlook the fact that > thrift of one’s energies is often more vital than thrift of money. It is by > this form of thrift that electricity in going to help women.” What was termed \\"a lively discussion\\" followed Matthew's speech and the meeting ended with a resolution, proposed by Margaret Partridge and agreed unanimously “…to form a Women’s Electrical Association” and wishing “to put on record its thanks to Mrs Matthews”. The name was soon changed to the Electrical Association for Women to avoid confusion with the acronym of the Workers’ Educational Association.  Membership  Its first director was Caroline Haslett, and its first patron was Lady Astor. Members included Laura Annie Willson, Margaret Moir, Lady Katharine Parsons, Lady Eleanor Shelley- Rolls, Annette Ashberry and Margaret Partridge. Many were women who had worked in industry in World War I and continued their interest in peacetime. Branches were established in Glasgow, Birmingham and Manchester.

In 1933, the EAW moved to share their new headquarters at 20 Regent Street in London with the Women's Engineering Society and proudly described the then high tech electrical facilities available to members. \\"The kitchen cabinet fitment designed by [architect] Edna Mosely [sic] A.R.I.B.A. has a control panel with one 15 amp and three 5 amp plug points above the working table; the wall behind the panel is hollow and the wiring of the panel may be seen through a glass window”.  Notable members  The campaigning Labour MP Ellen Wilkinson (1891-1947) was involved with the EAW from its inception. The Electrical Age for Women recorded her 1934 speech at their annual lunch in which that she felt \\"that the twin keys to women’s earthly paradise were the Vote and Electricity… which will enable the poorer working families to have the benefits of electric help in their homes and for education which will enable all women to make best use of the help electricity offers.\\"  Projects  The EAW campaigned for more electrical outlets in homes, and better electrical safety as well as education on the range and benefits of electrical applications in the home. The EAW published a magazine The Electrical Age (known as The Electrical Age for Women from June 1926 -1932), commissioning the then architect and designer Carmen Dillon, (later Oscar winning film art director and production designer) to design the front cover of the magazine. In 1934, the EAW published the Electrical Handbook for Women. It sold 33,000 copies in that year, and remained in print (in updated form) until the 1980s. The handbook was aimed at its female lecturers and demonstrators whose jobs were to guide Britain’s housewives on the best and most efficient ways to electrically equipping their homes. It is considered to be the first book published in Britain aimed at technically-minded women. The first five editions featured a cover designed by art-deco illustrator Ethel “Bip” Pares. The EAW held annual conferences, and had a network of member branches across Britain, and abroad. The Netherlands branch was set up in 1932, the Australian organisation in 1934 by electrical engineer Florence Violet McKenzie and the New Zealand branch in 1960. The Trinidad and Tobago branch was set up in 1961 by Public Relations Officer of Trinidad and Tobago Electricity Commission, Mrs. Louise Buxo and which is still in operation. The EAW commissioned an electric flat for the Bachelor Girl in 1930, which was designed by Edna Mosley, ARIBA, an architect and member of the EAW. In 1932, the Association made a small scale-model of an electrical working-class kitchen at an exhibition at Central Hall, Westminster, sponsored by the voluntary Housing Societies of London. Among its other projects were the 1934 report Electricity in the Working-Class Home, the 1935 all-electric house in Bristol, the 1936 film Motion Study in the Home and the Electrical Housecraft School, run by Dorothy Vaughan, which opened in 1933. The EAW published recipe books, ran courses on Electricity for Everyday Living and developed an Electrical Housecraft Certificate and diploma course. In the 1950s and 60s, they produced series of tea towels, pinnies and dusters to inform women about electrical safety. The British EAW organisation was wound up in 1986.  Archives  The archives of the Electrical Association for Women, including the full run of The Electrical Age, are held at the Institution of Engineering and Technology.

It was named an All-America Rose Selections winner in 2000. History 'Knock Out' was developed by amateur rose breeder, William Radler in his Milwaukee, Wisconsin basement in 1989. The cultivar was developed from a cross between the floribunda, Rosa 'Razzle Dazzle' and shrub rose, Rosa 'Carefree Beauty'. Compared to the other new hybrid rose plants in his backyard test garden that year, Radler recalled that new cultivar was exceptional. \\"The rose was special, a dense bush full of pinkish-red blooms. No need to prune. Dead flowers just fell off. No need to spray. The rose appeared immune to diseases such as black spot mildew\\". Radler was able to work with the wholesale nursery, Star Roses and plants, to help develop and test the new rose cultivar. After eight years of testing, Star Roses introduced the new rose into the United States in 2000 under the marketing name of 'Knock Out'. The extremely hardy rose cultivar, was successful that first year, and has become one of America's top selling roses, 'Knock Out' is also the original rose variety of a large family of 'Knock Out rose varieties. Description 'Knock Out' is a medium, bushy shrub, 2 to 4 ft (60—121 cm) in height with a 3 to 4 ft (90—120 cm) spread. Blooms are 2—3 in (5—7 cm) in diameter, saucer-shaped, with single to semi-double (5—13) petals. Flowers open from attractive buds, and are a bright cherry red with a white center and green-yellow-stamens. Flowers have a strong, fruity fragrance, and bloom in flushes from spring through fall. 'Knock Out' is disease resistant and blackspot resistant, but is susceptible to mildew. The shrub has glossy, dark green foliage. New stems and growth are purple.

The church was originally reserved for the garrison of the castle, but in 1902 also incorporated a civil parish. The Citadel Church celebrated its 300th anniversary in 2004. History =Ruse's plan= Ruse's plan from about 1661 On Henrik Ruse's plan of the Citadel from about 1661, a building (marked in red) is inscribed in the drawing, east of the site, with a floor plan that can almost only belong to a church. However, no church was mentioned in Ruse's contracts, nor are there any drawings for anyone from Ruse's hand. There is a drawing at the National Museum of Denmark of a church erected with Frederick III of Denmark's monogram, which places it in the correct time period and which fits on Ruse's floor plan, but since the church was never built, it is more of academic interest. However, it has been used in a visualization of Ruse's plan. =The first Citadel Church= The information about the first church of the castle is sparse. North of the Artillery Stick, Ruse had erected a command house (marked in blue on the drawing) of recycled materials from the old customs warehouse. It can be seen on the plan as an extension that goes further into the alarm area than the other sticks. However, the house was a short distance from the log. The house was described as having a basement walled basement, two-storey half-timbered building and full roof. After the completion of the plant around the turn of the year 1666-67, the building remained unused until the church moved in somewhere between 1672 and 1676. The church was on the first floor (\\"other logging\\"), with an outside staircase. In 1696, the chief of fortification, Hans Erasmus von der Pfordten, drew up a proposal to redevelop the house into something very similar to the present church, just less. It was previously believed that von der Pfordten himself had worked as an architect on the proposal, but information obtained in connection with [Garrison's Church] indicates that it was the same man, the engineering officer Georg Philip Müller, who designed both churches. The rebuilding was not carried out, it was sufficient to repair the need, in anticipation of a new and larger church being built. In 1699, a bell stack was erected at the north end of the church. =The history of the present Citadel Church= In 1697, von der Pfordten proposes that a new church be built west of the Alarm Square along the Royal Bastion, where it is today (marked with green on Ruse's drawing). The project is so similar to the proposal for the redevelopment of the first church that we must assume that G.P. Müller was the architect of it again. Construction began in 1703 under the direction of \\"contractor\\", Domenico Pelli, and was completed in 1704, when the church was inaugurated on November 26. The drawings for the church have been lost, and the oldest drawings we have come from Chr. Goede's survey in 1754, where the prison was built. However, there is a detailed description of the church from 1709 which gives an impression of what the church looked like at the beginning (translated from Danish): The date when the copper roof was replaced with brick is not known, perhaps in 1722 when there were windows – two on each long side and one on each short side – perhaps in 1725, when the prison was built. The attic windows had disappeared again by the great redevelopment in 1857. The prison, which in 1725 was being built up to the west side of the church, blocks the four west-facing windows, but nothing more than that still some light falls on the western pulpit. A system of sound channels was constructed from the church into the prison so that the prisoners could follow the services of their cells. In 1750, more was added around the monogram in the frontispiece. In 1961, it was all renewed. From the time between 1750 and 1850, there is almost no information available on the church, partly because the archdiocese's archives were lost during the English occupation of the Citadel in 1807. Remodeling in 1857 In 1857, a city architect, N.S. Nebelong, started a major redevelopment. He was also supposed to have devised the plans. In this rebuild, the pulpits were removed along the long sides, replaced the chairs with new (oak-coloured) and laid a plank floor. The chairs along the east wall were led through so the door was locked. The windows on the west side and the sound channels were completely rebuilt and a new pulpit was erected. Probably the most significant of Nebelong's changes was the new alternative. The southern end wall was drawn out so that a rounded niche could be formed around the altarpiece (see drawing). Thereby two small rooms were formed, one on each side of the altar, which served as a priest and writing chair. The drawing also shows a new altarpiece that was apparently made (it still exists) but never used. After this conversion, the church receives only daylight from the east wall windows. In the next hundred years, the major changes in the appearance of the building will not occur. In 1880, the north portal was changed to resemble the east portal. In 1895, a fire in the boiler room spread to the roof, which must then have been at least partially replaced. In 1905 the text \\"I am the way of truth and life\\" is placed on architrave one over the east portal. The same year, the glam holes in the spiral, which have previously been partially closed, are opened. Inside, the ceiling vault is covered with blue painted boards in 1950. In 1969, the church got a new organ, which does not cover the entire back wall, so the north windows again shed light on the organ pulpit. In 1985, an extensive restoration of the building began. The roof structure was found to have been attacked by fungus, and large parts of the woodwork had to be replaced, as was the upper part of the wall crown. The church room was brought back, if not to its original appearance, then to its original style. Most of Nebelong's changes were removed and only his pulpit was preserved. The two rooms at the south end were removed. Instead, clergy and parish rooms were set up in the former prison, and doors were made between the two buildings. The rooms on each side of the porch were closed, and the porch – which is closer to a porch – was lined with wooden panels that matched the gables of the new chairs. The chairs were opened again so that the east door could be used. See also the description and pictures of the church building below. The church was inaugurated in March 1987. In 1988, the church received Europa Nostra's bronze plaque for the restoration. Church building The Citadel Church today appears as a simple Baroque building without the great decoration. The masonry is whitewashed yellow and the roof is covered with black glazed bricks. The \\"tower\\" – it's more like a [roof rider] – is lined with copper, and the wing bar details are gilded. The wing bar ends in a cross, which is really the only thing that reveals that the building is a church. Above the east door is the building year 1704, the inscription from 1905 is gone again. Although the east door is no longer locked, the north entrance is normally used. The north entrance portal from 1880 is preserved. The church room appears very simple, adjacent to the Spartan. The walls and ceiling are white, the woodwork is pearl grey with gilded details, and the floor is covered with greyish tiles. Under the chairs, there is a slightly raised plank floor. Except for the altarpiece, only colours other than grey, white, and gold, are found on the organ facade, the cushions of the chairs and the kneeling. The church room has no decoration drilled from what is on the normal church furniture parts (see below). (On the day that one photograph was taken, however, roses were adorned on the headboards.) nowadays, 10 of the original 14 windows provide light to the main church room. The four facing the prison are still walled, but the sound holes have been reopened to the prison. The rows of chairs go all the way to the choir, which is raised two steps, so there is no actual choir counter.

The cutter is unknown. It stems from the church's construction, but the paintings are older. The large painting in the middle – The Shepherd's Worship – is very likely identical to the altarpiece of the first Citadel Church. It was made in the latter half of the 17th century. The lower image – The Last Supper – is stylistically similar to other church images dating from about 1700. The upper image – Christ on the Cross – dates from the late 1600s. The altar is adorned with the Citadel's own 'logo': a Greek cross in a stylized outline of the five bastions of the Citadel. The church also has an altarpiece from about 1860, probably part of Nebelong's redevelopment, but it has never been erected in the church. It is a painting of Lucie Ingemann depicting Christ as the King of Heaven, receiving the souls of the deceased. The painting is inserted in a newly Gothic oak frame of 3.2 meters by 1.47 meters. Pulpit =Pulpits= The church's first pulpit from 1704 is described as a single carpenter's work without any particular decoration. It had a sound sky \\"made of boards\\". It was painted pearl grey and red like the rest of the church's woodwork. It was located at about the same location as the present one, west of the altar. The present pulpit dates from the great redevelopment in 1857 and was designed by Nebelong. It was originally in \\"oak colour\\", but whether it involves aging is not entirely clear. In 1958 it was painted pearl grey like the other woodwork, with gilded figures. It used to have a back wall with window-shaped squares around a center field with a cross, but it has been removed, presumably by the renovation in 1985-87. The sound sky now sits for itself on the wall above the pulpit. Baptismal font =Baptismal font= Until 1839 the church had no actual baptismal font, but a baptismal table was used. Originally, baptism was held in the northwest corner of the church in a font closure. Now it happens in the choir east of the altar. The baptismal font dates from around 1820 and was not until Our Lady Church as a temporary font until 1839, when it was redundant and donated to the Citadel Church. It is made of wood and in a classicist style. Originally it was marbled in grey and white, now it stands in solid grey with gilt details. Organ facade =Organ= The church's first organ was provided by Johan Beverlin and was ready in the summer of 1705. It cost 60 dollars, so it has probably not been a great instrument. At the same time, the carpenter Jochum Jacobsen delivered a carving work in lime wood, which is believed to be the ornament that still sits on the organ pulpit. In 1756, a new organ was acquired, of which little is known, besides being a rococo organ, and the price was 400 dollars. However, you know what the facade looked like, since it is the facade that is still seen on the organ. The instrument was used for over a hundred years, despite being almost unplayable in the end. In 1859, Marcussen & Son delivered a new organ which was approved by the organists J.P.E. Hartmann and Niels W. Gade, but in 1922 it was replaced by one with 35 votes and three manuals, conducted by W. Sauer, Frankfurt an der Oder. The organ filled the entire room above the entrance and separated from the organ pulpit by a grating wall so that only the old organ facade could be seen. In 1969, the church got its current organ from Poul- Gerhard Andersen's Organ Building. (The Marcus organ was sold to [Philip's Church].) It has 25 votes on two manuals and a pedal. The organ may be behind the old organ facade, so the back wall is no longer hidden. Ship Flag =Church ship= The church ship, the Danish frigate Jylland, was a gift from the church's past pastor A.V. Storm (or possibly funded with a gift Storm received on behalf of the church. It is created by Gorm Clausen from Marstal in 1930. =Flag= Like Garrison's Church and Holmen's Church, Kastelskirken has a church flag. It was donated by the 1st Regiment, the Danish Life Regiment's Soldiers' Association in connection with the 325th anniversary of the Citadel on October 28, 1989. The tab is only promoted during the ecclesiastical acts. The cloth was renewed in 2004, paid for by the Chief of Defense and the commander of the Army Operational Command, as well as the 1st Regiment, the Danish Life Regiment's Soldiers' Association. Graveyard There is no cemetery attached to the Citadel Church.

She was a fervent Catholic, skeptical and communist thinker.  Life  Two years after being born in Morelia, Michoacán, her father Luis Urquiza died, so along with her mother also named Concepción and her two siblings María Luisa and Luis, she moved to Mexico City. As a child, she attended the official primary school that was located on the Plaza de Dinamarca. Later she completed her secondary education at the school located in the Ribera de San Cosme, in a building formerly occupied by the Colegio del Sagrado Corazón. In the city, under the auspices of the poet Muñoz y Domínguez, she wrote her first poem titled \\"Para tu amada\\" (\\"For your beloved\\"). When she was 12, she published the poems \\"Tus ojeras\\" (\\"The rings under your eyes\\") and at 13 \\"Canto del Oro\\" and \\"Conventual\\" in the magazines Revista de Yucatán and Revista de Revistas. Critics admired the creations of Urquiza, who sporadically published several poems in more than 10 literary magazines. Although she was in direct contact with the best stridentist and avant-garde Mexican poets of the time, such as Arqueles Vela, she was not influenced by Vela's work and kept in her poetry \\"the most classical standards of meter and rhyme\\". At 16, Urquiza collaborated for the Revista de Revistas asking the following question: \\"What do you think of the new generation?\\" in interviews with Rafael López, Mariano Azuela, Xavier Villaurrutia, Victoriano Salado Álvarez and Federico Gamboa. The question was accompanied by a small introduction in connection with each of these authors, for example, in the case of Mariano Azuela, Uquiza said \\"The author of Evil Hour ...\\". She lived in New York City from 1928 to 1933. She militated in the Communist party until in 1937 she had a spiritual crisis that turned her into Catholicism, breaking with her political affiliation. She entered the aspirancy of the Daughters of the Holy Spirit, but could not stand the life at the convent, and abandoned the order to teach logic and history of philosophical doctrines at the Autonomous University of San Luis Potosí. That period is considered the most fruitful of the poet who, halfway between the bohemian and religious life, rejected all imposture or flaunting typical in intellectual circles. Together with her great friend Rosario Oyarzun, who was a lawyer, Urquiza was part of a group of outstanding young professionals and Potosinian university students who would later have an outstanding career: Raúl Cardiel Reyes, Ignacio Retes, Pedro Rodríguez Zertuche, Humberto Arocha, Manuel Calvillo, Antonio Rosillo. Jesús Medina Romero and Joaquín Antonio Peñalosa also attended the meetings held, almost always, at Oyarzun's house and, if not, in the popular cafe Zaragoza. She wrote in 1944 in Viñetas de la literatura michoacana, a monthly literary magazine from Morelia, where she shared credits with Porfirio Martínez, Alejandro Ruiz Villaloz, Alfonso Rubio y Rubio, Miguel Castro Ruiz, Luis Calderón Vega, P. Francisco Alday, Miguel Bernal Jiménez, Alejandro Avilés, Roberto Ibáñez, Jacques Leguebe, Eduardo de Ontañon, Manuel Ponce, Artemio de Valle Arizpe and Joaquín Antonio Peñalosa. Urquiza was one of the Mexican writers who, like Josefina Vicens, also ventured into cinema. She was only 16 years old when she competed under the pseudonym \\"Santiago Damián\\", in the contest created by Revista de Revistas with \\"Moby Dick. Novela cinematográfica\\" (\\"Moby Dick. Cinematographic novel\\"). According to Luis Mario Schneider, this award-winning text \\"is a very personal version of Melville\\". Another project in which the author was involved is the film adaptation of the novel Heart by Edmondo De Amicis. In January 1939, she delivered the document on which the brothers Alejandro and Marco Aurelio Galindo relied to make the screenplay, allowing filming to start two months later. The result was Corazon de Niño (1939), with Domingo Soler in the leading role. Urquiza drowned in the sea at Ensenada, Baja California, at age 35, on June 20, 1945, along with a fellow traveler.  Work  As Margarita León's research indicates, thanks to philologist Gabriel Méndez Plancarte the corpus of his friend Concha Urquiza's poetic work was not released until 1946, after her death, by the Mexican publishing house Bajo el Signo de Ábside, with the title Obras (\\"Works\\"). Various reissues of the book approved by Méndez Plancarte were prepared, among the most important, that of Antonio Castro Leal by the publishing house Jus in 1975 and Ricardo Garibay in 1985 under the title Nostalgia de Dios (\\"Nostalgia of God\\").  In popular culture \\"Cesárea Tinajero\\", the lost poetess character from the novel The Savage Detectives by Roberto Bolaño was based on Concha Urquiza.

Emma was the eldest of eight children. She has also married a total of five times. Her first husband, Charles Barrett, divorced her. Her second husband, William Stanley Williams, died from suspicious circumstances, and she benefitted from a large life insurance policy she had on his life. Emma LeDoux and the \\"Trunk Murder of 1906\\" On March 24, 1906, law requirement authorities were called to a grain warehouse in Stockton, CA, after station workforce saw a trunk was emitting an aggravating scent. At the point when officials opened the holder, they found the carcass of Albert N. McVicar, the third spouse of Emma LeDoux. Subsequent to playing out a post-mortem examination on McVicar's inert body, the restorative analyst decided he had kicked the bucket because of a morphine overdose. The specialist really put the dead man's remaining parts on open show at the funeral home. At the point when law enforcement found LeDoux, they discovered that her subsequent spouse had died of heart disease when he was just 30 years of age, leaving her with $10,000 in life insurance. They soon discovered she married Jean LeDoux in 1905, despite being married to McVicar, furnishing her with a motive to murder the man who was discovered dead in a trunk. Not exactly a month after McVicar's body was found, LeDoux was indicted for homicide in the main degree on April 18, 1906. LeDoux was condemned to death, making her the main lady to get capital punishment in California. Her sentence was later diminished to life in jail after charges of jury altering emerged, and she was paroled in 1920 in the wake of serving only 10 years. Be that as it may, LeDoux was in and out of prison for different wrongdoings; she inevitably passed on of malignancy in jail in 1941 at 65 years old. Emma's trial was the biggest news besides the Great Earthquake of 1906, which actually postponed her trial. In the end, she was convicted of murdering her husband and sentenced to be hanged. Her attorney filed an appeal on the basis that the jury was biased, as well as the judge not allowing her to testify. In 1910, the appeal was granted, but Emma had become so ill she felt that she could not handle another trial so she notified her attorney that she wanted to plead guilty and get it over with. She was sent to San Quentin where she served 10 years and eventually was paroled in 1920. She did marry her fifth and final husband Fred Crackbon, but she outlived him as well. She didn't inherit anything from the last husband's death and became poor. Doing what she could to make a quick buck, Emma found herself once again on the wrong end of the law, thus the beginning begins the revolving door of being in and out of the system again.

At Yarrabah he married Maggie Frew and they had a son, however both she and the child died shortly afterwards. Noble later married Angelina (c.1879-1964), with whom he had six surviving children. In 1914 James and Angelina Noble arrived at the newly reopened Forrest River Mission in Western Australia, where they worked for the next eighteen years. In September 1925 Noble became the first Aboriginal Anglican clergyman in Australia, when he was made deacon in a ceremony at St George's Cathedral, Perth. In 1926 Noble, who was skilled in tracking, went to investigate rumours that the police had massacred Aboriginal people close to the Forrest River. He discovered apparent evidence that people had been tied to trees and shot, before their remains were dismembered and burnt. In 1927 Noble gave evidence before a Royal Commission of Inquiry which concluded that police had probably murdered eleven people, but could not ascertain which individuals had been responsible.
