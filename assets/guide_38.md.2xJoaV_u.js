It was raised in both 1870 and from 1874 to 1876. Both times it faced significant opposition from both the native population and the British merchants based in the Gambia. It was raised again in the 1890s as a possible exchange for French fishing rights off the Newfoundland coast  1870 proposal  = Initial suggestion and acceptance = In 1868, Arthur Kennedy, Governor of Sierra Leone, acknowledged an inquiry from the French regarding the possibility of the cession of the Gambia to France in return for other French territories in West Africa. In April 1869, Kennedy said that such an arrangement would have obvious commercial, administrative and military benefits. However, he warned that the native population had a \\"chivalrous attachment to the Queen and Her Government.\\" He also observed that \\"the natives of the country would regard any negotiations [as a] sale of their country.\\" In February 1870, the British government accepted the proposal in principle. However, it did not want any of the French settlements on offer and proposed to cede the colony in exchange for the French renouncing any claim to the disputed Mellacourie region north of Freetown. This proposal was accepted by the French in March. = Opposition in the Gambia =  Opposition of natives  After news of the negotiations reached the Gambia, members of the Liberated African community in Bathurst - specifically J. D. Richards, S. J. Forster, Sr., and W. C. Walcott organised opposition to the proposals. Three petitions against cession were organised between April and October 1870. In London, Joseph Reffles condemned the idea in letters to The African Times.  Opinion of merchants  The opinions of the British merchants in the Gambia on the proposed cession was split. However, a large group of were merchants were opposed to the idea of a cession, led by Thomas Chown, whose firms was one of the oldest in Bathurst having been founded in the 1840s. Thomas Brown (1811-1881), one of the foremost merchants in the Gambia at the time, was strongly opposed to the possibility of the cession. He was the only unofficial member of the Legislative Council in 1870 when the news broke, and made his opposition clear inside and outside the council. He also persuaded the Manchester Chamber of Commerce to oppose the cession. In May 1871, he founded the Gambia's first newspaper, The Bathurst Times, to oppose the cession, although it was short- lived. = Parliamentary debates = On 15 July 1870, in the House of Lords, the Duke of Manchester put a question to the Secretary of State for the Colonies on the proposed cession. He said that the matter appeared to involve the \\"undue exercise of the Prerogative of the Crown.\\" He said that it would be a breach of neutrality to hand over a \\"seaport of great capacity\\" that was \\"advantageously situated\\" to a nation that was at war with one of the UK's allies. He argued that \\"if the French thought it desirable to obtain it, it must be equally desirable for us to keep it.\\" He also said that the residents of the Gambia should not be moved to the control of another power without their consent. The Duke said he understood that 600 native inhabitants of the Gambia had, \\"without instigation on the part of any Englishman\\", signed a petition that had been sent to the Colonial Office. He said that their main motivation was to avoid the country losing out on trade as a result of being under French control. Earl Granville, who had just become Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, responded on behalf of the Colonies Secretary. He said that the matter was never going to be completed without the consent of Parliament. However, he said that \\"you will find it excessively difficult to show what advantage is gained by this country by retaining possession of this settlement.\\" He said that as there was no slave trade and no suppression of the slave trade anymore, there was little value in maintaining the Gambia. He also said there was no military value to the Gambia, \\"unless our seamen were seized with an unusual whim to run away and hide themselves from the rest of the world.\\" The Earl continued that in fact, trade had \\"steadily fallen off\\" and \\"the revenue with it\\". He said that Colonial Office officials tended to have difficulty adapting to conditions in the Gambia, and also that the handwriting on the petition the Duke referenced was seemingly by the same person. He concluded that \\"While the Colony would be of great advantage to the French in connection with their flourishing Colony of Senegal, I think it is no exaggeration to say that Gambia is to our country an absolute burden without any redeeming characteristics.\\"  Second proposal, 1874‚Äì76  In April 1874, the French government again proposed that the Gambia should be exchanged. This time, they proposed that it would be done in return for the Ivory Coast and the Mellacourie region. Once the news broke in mid-1875, there was further opposition in Bathurst. Liberated African political leaders formed the Gambia Native Association to coordinate their proposals. Likewise, the British merchants formed the Gambia Committee, which also condemned cession. Negotiations were again delayed again, and in March 1876, when it appeared that he may have misled Parliament, the Earl of Carnarvon broke off negotiations. In 1876, the South Australian Register concluded with the following in an article on the possible Gambian cession: \\"At this moment, every portion of England's vast Colonial Empire is thoroughly loyal, but it is not too much to say that very different sentiments will arise if the British Government once give their assent to the principle that to suit the fancy of statesmen any portion of the colonies may be given away to or exchange with a foreign power, not only without the consent, but contrary to the wish of the people whose allegiance is made a matter of barter.\\"  Collapse of the 1870s proposals  The idea of exchange remained a political possibility in the 1880s, but no firm proposals were put forward by either government. Concurrent with many of these events, Otto von Bismarck set about unifying the German states. During this process, he provoked the French into the Franco-Prussian War. Following the war, the French did not revisit the subject of Gambian cession, and the British authorities \\"apparently thought better of pursuing the matter.\\"  Proposal raised again, 1890s  There was the possibility of cession again in the 1890s as the government proposed that a West African colony, likely the Gambia, would be ceded to the French in return for them giving up their fishing rights on the Newfoundland coast. According to The New York Times, the dispute over Newfoundland fishing rights had been going on since the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713. In 1891, The Spectator noted that \\"British Gambia is of little use to England except as a means of inflicting injury on France, it would be not unreasonable on our part to exchange it as suggested.\\"  References  History of the Gambia 19th century in the Gambia ","title":"Proposed cession of the Gambia to France"},{"id":"53600730","text":"The HMBS Arthur Dion Hanna (P 421) is the first of four Damen Stan 4207 patrol vessels commissioned by the Royal Bahamas Defence Force.

He scored 20 goals from 121 appearances in the Scottish Football League playing for East Fife, Heart of Midlothian and Airdrieonians, and was a member of the East Fife team that reached the 1927 Scottish Cup Final. After moving to England, he scored 20 goals from 92 appearances in the Football League playing for Aldershot and Darlington in the 1930s. Life and career =Early life and career= Edgar was born in Edinburgh and had lived in the Merchiston district. He played football for the Boys' Brigade team based at Dalry church, from where he and Peter Barrett followed Bobby Russell to Penicuik Juniors. In early 1922, Edgar performed well in junior international trial matches. He had a trial with Division One club Celtic before moving into the senior ranks in mid-February with East Fife of Division Two. He was joined soon afterwards by his former colleagues, manager David McLean believing that \\"the best value could not be got from the winger until they had the generalship of Barrett and the resourceful feeding of Russell\\" to complete the left side of his team. =Senior football= The trio soon established themselves in the team; in a 1927 retrospective, the Courier recalled how \\"in the course of the [1922‚Äì23] season the tremendous benefit of signing the other two was demonstrated over and over again\\". Early in that season, a Courier match report highlighted the danger stemming from Edgar's crosses despite his being marked by the best of the opponents' defenders. According to the Evening Telegraph, Edgar's return from six weeks out with a knee injury (sustained in East Fife's Scottish Cup draw at Kilmarnock) \\"made all the difference\\" to his team in a 1‚Äì0 win against Dunfermline Athletic: \\"he was in dazzling form, and attracted all eyes by his brilliant play.\\" After carrying an injury at the start of the 1923‚Äì24 season, he soon returned to form. Against Johnstone in early November, the Courier praised his trickery and the quality of crossing and shooting, though three weeks later against King's Park, \\"his finishing left a good deal to be desired\\", and against Arbroath in December he twice missed an open goal. His importance to the team was illustrated when he was selected for a January 1924 match against Cowdenbeath despite still recovering from illness. In September, the Evening Telegraph reporter was reminding him to curb his tendency to \\"shoot from impossible angles\\" when a cross might be more productive. In his last appearance for East Fife, in mid-October, Edgar crossed for his team's first goal and scored the second in a 2‚Äì1 win at home to Alloa Athletic. He had scored 11 goals from 83 appearances in Scottish League and Cup. =Heart of Midlothian= Later that week, amid reported interest from Raith Rovers and from English clubs Burnley, Bury and Chelsea, Division One club Heart of Midlothian paid ¬£1,000 for Edgar's services. He was one of a number of expensive signings made by Hearts, and the fee received was an East Fife club record. Edgar made his debut on 18 October, in a 2‚Äì0 win in the Edinburgh derby at home to Hibernian. He scored in the next match, a 3‚Äì3 draw with Partick Thistle, and scored twice more in the following three fixtures. He appeared in 15 consecutive matches, and scored once more, but was then dropped after a loss of form. He played no more first-team football before joining Airdrieonians on loan on 10 March. He marked his debut, in a 7‚Äì1 defeat of Third Lanark, with two \\"beautifully taken\\" goals, and went to make seven appearances, without scoring again, as Airdrie finished runners-up in Division One. He returned to Hearts at the end of the season, and played in the semifinal and final of the Rosebery Charity Cup. He was retained for 1925‚Äì26, but played little for Hearts thereafter, Willie Murraywho went on to make more than 300 appearances for the clubbeing preferred at outside left. and =East Fife in the Scottish Cup= In March 1927, Edgar returned to East Fife on loan to play a part in their Scottish Cup run. They had already eliminated two Division One teams when Edgar arrived, just ahead of the quarter-final tie away to another second-tier side, Arthurlie; the winner would become the first lower-division team for 24 years to reach the semi-final. The local press predicted a likely win, as well as a \\"grand reception\\" for Edgar and the resumption of his \\"old association\\" with Barrett and Russell. East Fife won 3‚Äì0, albeit against opponents reduced to ten fit men for the second half. The opening goal was fortuitous: with the Arthurlie goalkeeper well placed to take Edgar's cross, a defender touched the ball into his own net. The Athletic News reporter rated him the best forward on the pitch. East Fife then beat a third Division One team, Partick Thistle, to reach the final, in which they faced Celtic. After just seven minutes, Edgar crossed for Jock Wood to head the opening goal; a couple of minutes later, an East Fife defender put the ball into his own net when trying to make a clearance, and Celtic went on to win their twelfth Scottish Cup by three goals to one. =Aldershot and the Edgar case= Edgar returned to Hearts, and played occasionally for a further two seasons, finishing his career with 9 goals from 35 league appearances. He was also reported to have spent time playing in the United States. In 1928, Edgar was listed as open to transfer by Hearts at a fee of ¬£300, which would not become payable unless the player joined another Football League club, whether in Scotland or England. He moved to English Southern League club Aldershot Town for the 1929‚Äì30 season, and played for their reserve team in the London Combination as well as for the first team, who finished as champions. At the end of that season, in the expectation of being elected to the Football League, Aldershot paid Hearts the required fee. However, they lost out by one vote to Thames, so requested a refund of their payment. A commission of the Scottish League reported on \\"what [had] become generally known as the Edgar case\\", and the management committee ruled that Hearts retain the ¬£300 and Edgar's League registration be cancelled. He thus became an Aldershot player. He remained with the club for two more Southern League seasons and, after their eventual election in 1932 and change of name to plain Aldershot, played four times for them in the Third Division South of the Football League. =Darlington= In July 1933, Edgar signed for Third Division North club Darlington. He opened the scoring in their first win of the season, 2‚Äì1 at home to Wrexham, which did not come until the last match of September, and helped them achieve an unexpected win in the final of the Durham Professional Cup against First Division club Sunderland. He became a regular member of the first eleven, making 36 of a possible 42 league appearances in his first season. He also played in all five of Darlington's matches in the 1933‚Äì34 Third Division North Cup as they progressed to the final at Old Trafford and beat Stockport County 4‚Äì3 with a last-minute goal from Dan Cassidy. He was ever-present in all competitions in 1934‚Äì35, and scored 13 league goals as Darlington finished fifth in the table. The first of the 13 secured a draw against Doncaster Rovers and the second a week later was the only goal of the local derby away to Hartlepools United, which the Yorkshire Post thought \\"fluky\\": the goalkeeper placed himself to cover Jerry Best's shot, \\"but the ball cannoned off a defender to Edgar, who had only to touch the ball through an untenanted goal.\\" He had a run of eight goals in nine matches in December and January, and his 86th-minute winner against Carlisle United in the last match of the season ensured Darlington finished in fifth place, ahead of Tranmere Rovers on goal average. Edgar continued in the side for the first eight matches of the 1935‚Äì36 season, but when the arrival of Gordon Reed displaced Best from the centre-forward position, new manager George Brown moved Best to outside left and Edgar appeared only twice more for the first team. He finished his Darlington career with 22 goals from 97 matches in senior competition, and was given a free transfer. =Later life= After retiring from League football, Edgar saw off competition from former players including Alf Common and Dickie Downs for the post of coach to County Durham secondary schools under the auspices of a scheme promoted by the Football Association. The Sunderland Echo reported that some of the other candidates dropped out of consideration because of their interpretations of the laws of the game, a topic in which Edgar had excelled. He combined his new role with playing North-Eastern League football for Workington; he helped that club win the North-Eastern League Cup in 1937. Although the Courier reported in the 1937 close season that Edgar \\"would not be averse to a return\\" to Scottish football, he and former Darlington teammate Jerry Best were at Hexham, also of the North-Eastern League, in 1938. Edgar turned out for Darlington in 1940 in the wartime leagues, and remained living in the town. His son John had a brief spell of League football with the club in the 1950s. In 2001, John Edgar told the Northern Echo that as a young man he had had the opportunity to sign for Sunderland, but his father strongly advised him to continue his education rather than taking the risk of a career in professional football. \\"In those days you did as your father told you\\", so he trained as a schoolteacher and played mainly non-league football. Dave Edgar died in Darlington in 1976 at the age of 74.

During the raid, the militants targeted the Bangladesh Armed Forces who were surrounding the militant occupied compound in Sylhet. There were two suicide bombings which killed four civilians and two police officers and wounded more than 40, some critically. An army lieutenant colonel later died from his injuries. Bombs exploded and gunfire was reported when the military launched Operation Twilight to clear the militant hideout. ISIL claimed responsibility however, Home Minister Asaduzzaman Khan Kamal denied the claims of ISIL and blamed the local Jama‚Äôatul Mujahideen Bangladesh for the attacks. Finally the Bangladesh Army neutralised four militants at the suspected hideout.  Background  On Thursday, 23 March 2017, the Bangladesh Police surrounded a suspected militant hideout in South Surma Upazila, Sylhet, Bangladesh. The hideout was located in a housing complex which consisted of two apartment buildings. The police unit was reinforced with personnel from Rapid Action Battalion on the Friday. On Saturday, the 1st Para Commando Battalion took charge of operations. Operation Twilight Operation Twilight was launched by the 1st Para Commando Battalion of the Bangladesh Army under the command of Major General Anwarul Momen, GOC 17th Infantry Division in Jalalabad Cantonment. First the security forces established a three kilometre perimeter around the militant hideout. Then the operation was launched on Saturday morning at 8am. Two militants were killed in the initial attack, one of whom detonated a suicide vest. The commandos rescued 78 civilians who had been trapped in the building since Thursday. The militants had planted improvised explosive devices (IEDs) all over the building which slowed down the operation. The main gate of the building was blocked by a refrigerator with an IED booby trap attached to it. Army spokesman, Brigadier General Fakhrul Ahsan, initially reported that the operation would take more time because of the presence of scattered IEDs in strategic points inside the building. ‚ÄúWe used a rocket launcher to punch a hole through the wall. We used explosives but those didn‚Äôt work out. Then we used a Thai shell and successfully neutralised two militants,‚Äù Brigadier General Fakhrul said. The commandos arrived in armoured personnel carriers from their military base for the operation. The building had 30 apartments and 150 rooms, and the militants constantly changed their location. The operation was launched on Saturday morning at 8am. The Commando unit was assisted by SWAT forces and Bangladesh police. Finally four militants were found dead at the hideout.  Bombing  On 26 March, while Operation Twilight was in progress, militants bombed a crowd of about 500‚Äì600 onlookers gathered near the cordon perimeter, which was about 400 metres from the militant hideout. Two bombs were used in the attack. The first was thrown by two individuals from a motorcycle at 6.45pm. The second was left in a bag containing vegetables and exploded at 7.55, after police and RAB personnel moved into the area following the first explosion. Six people, including two police officers, were killed in the explosions and 44 injured. Lieutenant Colonel Abul Kalam Azad, director of intelligence of RAB, was seriously injured in the second explosion. He was taken to Sylhet MAG Osmani Medical College for primary care. Then he was flown to the Combined Military Hospital in Dhaka. He was later flown to Singapore for better treatment, but died from his injuries. Police Inspector Monirul Islam of the bomb disposal squad and Inspector Abu Kawser were killed outright by the second explosion.

One person was killed and 16 others were injured. Two suspects were arrested on March 30, though police continued to search for more people involved. One of the suspects, who was among those injured, later died of his injuries on April 4.  Club  The club itself is a large single-story structure, located directly to the west of the Cincinnati Municipal Lunken Airport, from downtown Cincinnati near the southeast corner of the city. It was previously called Club Cameo, and before that, a gay club known as Adonis. The club maintains a high security profile, usually posting two off-duty police officers at the front door and two in their parking lot. Events The shootout occurred around 1:30 a.m. EDT at Cameo nightclub. Hundreds of people were in the nightclub when the shooting began, with officers describing the crime scene as \\"chaotic\\". = Victims = Several of the injured drove themselves to area hospitals, and some had sustained life-threatening injuries, according to police officials. Eight victims were taken to University of Cincinnati Medical Center, one of whom was in critical condition. Of the remaining, three were seriously injured, and four were stable. Two additional victims were taken to The Christ Hospital with minor injuries. Others were treated at Bethesda North Hospital, Mercy West Hospital and Anderson Mercy Hospital. Officers at the scene attempted to administer CPR to the person who died. One of the wounded was arrested as a suspect. The suspect died from his wounds on April 4.  Investigation  The event was initially believed to be a mass shooting. On March 27, however, Chief Isaac stated that the shooting occurred after several local men who were patrons at the club got into an argument, which later escalated into a shootout between them. Aftermath The operator of the Cameo club Julian Rodgers announced on March 27 that the club will officially shut down on Friday after its landlord issued a notice to vacate the premises. He also surrendered the club's liquor license during the day. The club had been cited numerous times for violations in the past. Two suspects were arrested on March 30 and were charged with murder. One of the suspects had been wounded in the shooting and was in critical condition. Isaac stated that they had evidence that other people were involved as well. Authorities stated that they had found three guns and were seeking an unidentified suspect. In December 2018, the surviving suspect, Cornell Beckley, was sentenced to 19 years in prison. The two people killed in the shooting were O'Bryan Spikes and Deondre Davis. Davis was charged with Spikes's murder, but later died at University of Cincinnati Medical Center.

It is part of the volcanic centres of the Andean Volcanic Belt, which has formed a number of calderas in large ignimbrite producing eruptions. These calderas include Aguas Calientes, Cerro Panizos, Galan, Negra Muerta and La Pacana. Some of these volcanic centres appear to be associated with large fault zones that cross the Puna. Negra Muerta is a caldera with dimensions of that was formed over two volcanic periods, one about 9 million years ago and another over 7 million years ago. Each volcanic period included the formation of ignimbrites, the Acay ignimbrite in the first and the Toba 1 ignimbrite in the second. After the Toba 1 ignimbrite, effusive activity forming lava flows occurred. After the cessation of volcanic activity, glacial and fluvial erosion has exposed subvolcanic structures.  Geomorphology  = General geography and geology = Negra Muerta lies on the eastern margin of the Puna and is associated with the major Calama- Olacapato-El Toro fault, which was active starting from the Paleozoic. Dilatation along this fault influenced the volcanic processes at Negra Muerta and other volcanoes, by opening up paths for magma ascent. This fault and several others are associated with belts of volcanoes that extend across the Puna. Crustal shortening and folding also contributed to the morphogenesis of the region. Nevado de Acay lies northeast just outside the caldera margin, and the town of San Antonio de los Cobres only about northwest. The cities of Salta and Jujuy lie about east of Negra Muerta. The region has an arid climate, thus geological features are often buried beneath uneroded rocks and difficult to access. The south Central Andes in the past were the site of large scale dacitic ignimbrite-forming eruptions and the formation of calderas, linked to the interaction between a subducting slab and the overlying crust. These include Aguas Calientes, Cerro Panizos, Galan and La Pacana. The area was also affected by stratovolcanoes and other styles of eruptive activity. These were often more diverse in chemical composition than the ignimbrite forming eruptions, a property attributed to various magma processes and the interaction between the mantle and the crust. = Local geography and geology = The Negra Muerta caldera is the easternmost caldera in the Puna where it meets the Eastern Cordillera, and has dimensions of . The caldera does not feature a ring fault; rather several individual faults were involved in its formation. The caldera floor fragmented before the collapse and sagged around a hinge in the southern sector of the caldera. The floor of the caldera lies at elevations of , descending from north to south. The northern and western margin reach elevations of ; the southern and eastern margins were lowered by glacial erosion during the Pleistocene and fluvial erosion by the , which along with some tributaries originates in the caldera and has eroded about of rock. Presently, acid mine drainage occurs in the caldera through natural processes and renders the water of the Calchaqu√≠ River unsuitable for drinking. The Calama-Olacapato-El Toro fault passes north of the caldera, the Saladillo fault southwest of the caldera, and Abra de Acay lies on the northwestern caldera margin. The caldera contains three lava domes aligned north to south with lengths ranging from to , dykes and other subvolcanic structures. These structures have been exposed by erosion in the caldera. A wide structure close to the caldera centre appears to be a pipe- like structure, which appears to be the main vent. Some faults are also observed within the caldera, which have offset the ground over distances of about . Some of these dykes appear to be the source of lava flows and their remnants which lie on top of the Toba 1 ignimbrite. There are at least three such lava flows which cover a surface of outside of the caldera. Their composition ranges from andesite to rhyodacite, with the andesite being erupted later. The volcanic rocks of Negra Muerta are rich in potassium and belong to the calc-alkaline series. The basement of the volcano is formed by the sedimentary Salta Group of Cretaceous-Tertiary age and the below lying Cambrian Puncoviscana Formation. These sediments formed within rifting basins and contain both volcanic and carbonate rocks. The Negra Muerta caldera may host a porphyry copper deposit, which is however not mined.  Eruptive history  Two distinct volcanic phases are recorded at Negra Muerta, the first 9 million years ago and the second 7.6-7.3 million years ago. Each phase was associated with a pulse in caldera formation. Non-volcanic processes later in the caldera history include the deposition of alluvium and glacial till. The Acay ignimbrite was erupted 9 million years ago and covers a surface area of outside of the caldera, but some material is also found within the caldera. It is formed by a rhyolite glass matrix containing phenocrysts made of amphibole, biotite, magnetite, plagioclase and quartz. The ignimbrite is rich in crystals and fiammes. This ignimbrite originated in a magma chamber deep, where the ignimbrite formed in a closed system by fractional crystallization. The Toba 1 ignimbrite is dated to 7.6 - 7.3 ¬± 0.4 million years ago and was deposited on top of the Acay ignimbrite. It covers a surface area of . It is formed by feldspar-biotite-rhyolite containing over 55% of biotite, plagioclase and quartz phenocrysts. The magma chamber for this eruption laid at a depth of . Compositionally, the lava flows and the ignimbrite originated from slightly different magmas. It is likely that the injection of new mafic magma into the previous magma chamber triggered this eruption. The lava flows were erupted about 7.3 ¬± 0.1 million years ago, after the Toba 1 eruption. A further small ignimbrite named Morro II has been linked to Negra Muerta.

The Headquarters are in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Each member country has a Control Reserve Base (CRB) and a Base Manager (MG) that represents the Organization at Country level. The DLCO-EA was established by an International Convention signed in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia in 1962, and is registered with the United Nations. This followed the desert locust plagues of the 1940s that left massive hunger and deaths across the region, and the recommendation, in October 1961 by the 3rd session of the Food and Agriculture Organization Eastern Africa Desert Locust Control Sub- committee, for its establishment. The desert locusts breed in the Sahel region of Africa and migrate to the rest of the world when food resources are exhausted within the breeding areas. Following the successful management of the locusts, resulting into Uganda, Kenya, and Tanzania being free from attacks for many years, the DLCO-EA mandate was extended to include other migratory pests such as the African Armyworm moth (Spodoptera exempta), the grain-eating and destroying birds (Quelea quelea) and Tsetse flies (Glossina spp), vectors of nagana and sleeping sickness.

It is one of the oldest preserved sculptures in the city, realized by Ferdinand Lepcke. The figure of The Archer is one of the most expressive symbols of Bydgoszcz. Four copies of the statue still exist in German cities.  Description  The statue has been designed by Berlin artist Ferdinand Lepcke. It is made of bronze and portrays a young naked woman, stretching a bow. The silhouette has classic proportions and athletic body. The character only wears Roman-like sandals, and stands on a pedestal made of pink granite. Dimensions of the sculpture are: 210 cm (height), 128 cm (width), 35 cm (depth). The archer figure itself is 175 cm tall, 77 cm at waist and 105 cm at hip.  History  The sculpture was probably created in 1908, and was one of Ferdinand Lepcke's last works, as he died of pneumonia at the age of 43 on March 13, 1909, in Berlin. The Archer was exhibited in Munich and Berlin, attracting great interest from professionals and visitors, and receiving praises in the press. Pictures of the work were also published in several professional art magazines. The miniature version, tall, made from gypsum, was exhibited in Bromberg in May 1910, at the exhibition organized by the German Society of Arts and Sciences in Bromberg (). While visiting the exhibition a local magnate had the idea of purchasing a copy of the sculpture. This patron was a Bromberg Jewish banker and philanthropist, Lewin Louis Aronsohn. He personally decided to fund the acquisition of the original piece of art. The statue in its original location ca 1920 The cost for Louis Aronsohn was 7,500 German gold mark. The Mayor of the city, Hugo Wolff, went to Berlin, to approach Lepcke's late brother and buy the original masterpiece, not one of several copies the artist had made. Hugo Wolff had entertained good relationship with Ferdinand Lepcke since the sculptor designed the colossal fountain The Deluge () installed on Freedom Square in 1904. The statue arrived in Bromberg on August 26, 1910, the official unveiling ceremony took place on October 18, 1910, for the 60th birthday of Louis Aronsohn. At the time, the figure was set on a pedestal standing in the middle of a flowery square, on Theater Square, next to the City Theater. The Archer was aiming at the side wall of the theater, parallel to Mostowa Street. The naked silhouette standing in the middle of the city aroused much emotion and discussion in the Polish society of the newly reborn Poland during interwar period. The same arguments appeared in Berlin where a copy was exposed in 1908. During religious holidays, the statue was screened or dressed so as not to distract participants in the processions. On the opposite, 20-year old movie star Pola Negri was among the strongest supporters of the neoclassical statue, while living in Bydgoszcz. In the 1928, city councilors tried to pass a resolution requesting the withdrawal of the monument, claiming that it was a symbol of the Prussian power. A proposal was made to erect a statue of Jesus Christ in its place, since it stood on the ancient plot of the monastery and church of the Carmelites. But people sobered up when Cyryl Ratajski, president of Poznan, proposed to purchase The Archer back for its city if the bill was passed Hence the monument survived, but it was moved anyhow further away from the street around 1925, deeper into Theater Square and closer to the river, avoiding direct eye contact with city inhabitants. In autumn 1939, German forces moved the statue back to its previous place near the street, where it stayed until 1945. During fighting in January 1945, the figure was slightly damaged by gunshot in the back, on the hands and feet. However, it survived the fire and the destruction of the Municipal Theater. In May 1948, The Archer was restored under the expertise of local sculptor Piotr Triebler. In 1955, the sculpture was moved to a square next to the district museum on Gda≈Ñska street, and in 1960, to the Jan Kochanowski Park, in front of the Polish Theater. This move was linked to the planned re-construction on Theatre Square of the Freedom Monument of Plac Wolno≈õci, however the project never took shape, and The Archer stayed where one can admire it. Further preservation works happened in 1987 and 1990, to clean from corrosion the figure and the arrow. The Archer, over time, gained more and more sympathy from the inhabitants of Bydgoszcz, visitors and tourists. On April 19, 2013, to celebrate the 667th anniversary of the city charter, a new statue, the \\"Archer Nova\\" was unveiled, referring to Archer's original figure: it stands on a sphere, with its head slightly inclined, eyes closed, athletic body bent backward. It is visible on the yard facing the main entry of the Opera Nova. The sculpture was created by Maciej Jagodzi≈Ñski-Jagenmeer, from Torun. It is made of bronze and covered with chromium, weighs 200 kg and is 1.8m tall - five centimeters more than the original Archer. ≈Åuczniczka Nova in 2015  Other copies  While the original statue by Ferdinand Lepcke has been purchased to be displayed in Bydgoszcz, few copies have been realized and sent to the following cities: * Coburg, hometown of Ferdinand Lepcke, in the north of Bavaria. The Archer copy still stands today in the park of the city; * Berlin, where a copy has been bought in 1908-1909. It stood opposite the train station near the town hall, but was damaged during World War II and scrapped in 1947. In 1994, a social initiative in favor of the reconstruction of the sculpture succeeded to have it recast. This archer () has been standing since 1997 on Museum Island in Kolonnaden.; * Heringsdorf, on Usedom island. The copy is a decoration of the park, and is still standing today in front of the Diana hotel. This Archer belonged to Ferdinand Lepcke's family, as was the sea resort Diana; * Wilhelmshaven, the sculpture has been unveiled on June 18, 1982. This copy, made from Coburg's statue, has been fundraised by an association () of Germans from Bydgoszcz.  A Bydgoszcz icon  The archer is widely considered to be a work of great artistic beauty, as critics in the interwar period have already noticed. Wojciech Rze≈∫niacki, a journalist, wrote in the 1930s: \\"[...] The Archer is an unmatched work of art. The way to focus the viewer's attention on the illusory aim of the arrow - absolve the artist who did not hesitate to present his modern Artemis in all her naked beauty. The tension of the muscles does not, however, reduce the charm of its shape. On the contrary, the attitude in which The Archer tightens the bow allowed the artist to develop all the noble harmony and symmetry of the statue.\\" The statue of Archer is connected with many literary works of local writers, as well as artists and photographers. Today it is not known who was the model for The Archer figure. According to anecdotes disseminated in the press and in literature of the time, it could be: * A girlfriend of Heinrich Seeling, founder of Bromberg Former Municipal Theatre; * Julia, Lewin Louis Aronsohn's daughter; * One of Ferdinand Lepcke's models from Berlin. Nowadays, the figure is one of the most important symbols of Bydgoszcz. Its image is used on stamps, badges and publications devoted to the city. Statuettes of The Archer are handed out to participants of city competitions, events and festivals. In 2002, the name ≈Åuczniczka has been given to the newly built sports and show arena. Bydgoszcz american football team bears the name of Bydgoszcz Archers, in reference to the sculpture.

Racing career =1981: two-year-old season= Prince's Polly began her racing career with a win in a maiden race over seven furlongs at Leopardstown Racecourse in June. Over the same course and distance in August she finished second twice, beaten three quarters of a length by Fly Street in the Ardenode Stud Stakes, and a neck by Woodstream in a minor event. She was then moved up in class and distance for the Group Three Silken Glider Stakes over one mile at Leopardstown in September. Ridden by the veteran Wally Swinburn she took the lead early in the straight and won by two and a half lengths from Realms Reason, to whom she was conceding six pounds. On her final appearance of the season she finished third in the Park Stakes over seven furlongs at the Curragh in October, conceding twelve pounds to the winner More Heather. At the end of the year, a half-share in the filly was sold to the American owner Kerry Fitzpatrick and she was transferred to the stable of Dermot Weld. =1982: three-year-old season= On her three-year-old debut Prince's Polly looked unlucky to be beaten when finishing third in the Azalea Stakes over seven furlongs at Leopardstown. She was then stepped up to the highest class when she was one of twenty-four fillies to contest the Irish 1000 Guineas over one mile at the Curragh on 22 May. The English 1000 Guineas winner On The House started the 3/1 favourite ahead of Woodstream, Mary Mitsu and Miss Lillian with Prince's Polly, ridden by Swinburn, going off the 12/1 fifth choice in the betting. Fly Start and More Heather were also in the field. The last quarter mile saw a prolonged struggle between Prince's Polly and On The House before the Irish filly pulled ahead in the closing stages to win by a length, with Woodstream finishing strongly to deprive On The House of second by a short head. Prince's Polly bypassed The Oaks and ran instead in the Pretty Polly Stakes over ten furlongs at the Curragh in late June. With Swinburn again in the saddle she took the lead three furlongs out and won by three quarters of a length from Kazanina, to whom she was conceding four pounds. At the same track on 17 July she started favourite for the Irish Oaks over one and a half miles at the Curragh but was unable to catch the front- running Swiftfoot and was beaten three lengths into second place. In August she was made odds on favourite for the Brownstown Stakes at the Curragh but after briefly taking the lead she faded and finished sixth behind the Vincent O'Brien-trained Miraflora. Prince's Polly was retired from racing to become a broodmare. She was sent to be covered in the United States but died there in early 1983. Assessment In the Irish Free Handicap for 1981, Prince's Polly was given a weight of 120 pounds, making her the second-best juvenile filly trained in Ireland, 8 pounds inferior to the top-rated Woodstream. The independent Timeform organisation gave her a rating of 103, 10 pounds behind Woodstream and 19 behind their top two-year-old filly Circus Ring. In their annual Racehorses of 1981 they described her as \\"game and consistent\\" and likely to be suited by longer distances. In 1982 she was given a rating of 113 by Timeform, 18 pounds behind their top-rated three-year-old fillies Akiyda and Time Charter. In the Irish Free Handicap she was rated the second best filly of her generation behind the British-trained Swiftfoot.

He established the Department of Chemistry of Jilin University, and served as President of the university from 1978 to 1986. He was a founding member of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and a member of the International Academy of Quantum Molecular Science (IAQMS). He established the National Natural Science Foundation of China in 1986 and served as its first president.  Life and career  Tang was born on 18 November 1915 in Yixing, Jiangsu, Republic of China. He entered the Department of Chemistry of Peking University in the summer of 1936. When the Second Sino-Japanese War broke out in 1937, Beijing came under Japanese attack and Peking University, together with Tsinghua and Nankai universities, evacuated to Kunming in Southwest China. In Kunming, the universities combined their diminished resources to form the temporary National Southwestern Associated University, where Tang continued his studies. After graduating in 1940, he was hired by the university as a faculty member. After the end of World War II, Tang was sent to the United States in 1946 to study nuclear physics, together with Tsung-Dao Lee, who would win the Nobel Prize in 1957, and other distinguished scientists. However, Sino-American relations deteriorated after the Chinese Civil War broke out, and Tang studied chemistry at Columbia University instead of nuclear physics. After earning his Ph.D. from Columbia in 1949, Tang returned to the newly established People's Republic of China in early 1950 and became a professor of Peking University. In 1952, he moved to Changchun to help establish Jilin University (initially called the Northeast People's University). He founded the university's Department of Chemistry, and served as Vice President of the university from 1956. After the Cultural Revolution, he served as President of Jilin University from 1978 to 1986, and as President Emeritus afterwards until his death. He was elected a founding member of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in 1955 and a member of the International Academy of Quantum Molecular Science (IAQMS) in 1981.  Scientific contributions  Tang's research was mainly focused on quantum chemistry, polymer chemistry, and polymer physics. In the 1950s, he pioneered a method to calculate the \\"potential function of molecular internal rotation\\". He later made contributions to the ligand field theory and developed three graph theorems of molecular orbital. He co-authored eight monographs and was conferred four consecutive State Natural Science Awards (including two first-class awards), an unprecedented achievement. Tang is widely considered the \\"Father of Quantum Chemistry\\" in China. Five of his students were elected academicians of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in 1991 and 1993, and many of his students became leaders of theoretical chemistry in major Chinese universities, including Peking, Nanjing, Xiamen, and Beijing Normal University. In 1986, Tang established the National Natural Science Foundation of China and served as its first president.  Death and legacy  Tang died on 15 July 2008 in Beijing, at the age of 92. In 2011, the Chinese Chemical Society established the Tang Au-Chin Youth Award on Theoretical Chemistry in his memory. Asteroid 218914 Tangauchin, discovered by astronomers with the PMO NEO Survey Program at Purple Mountain Observatory in 2007, was named in his memory.

The top brand is the light lager Taedonggang by the state-owned Taedonggang Brewing Company. The country's problems with goods distribution and power output have forced North Korean brewers to innovate. To minimize distribution, many restaurants and hotels maintain their own microbreweries. Because unreliable power supply makes it difficult to refrigerate beer, North Koreans have developed their own steam beer, an originally American beer style brewed in higher than normal temperatures, that is widely available. Although the Korean liquor soju is preferred, beer comes second when it comes to consumption. Since the 1980s, beer has been within reach of ordinary North Koreans, though it is still rationed. Tourists, on the other hand, enjoy inexpensive beer without such limitations. History The Japanese brought beer to Colonial Korea in the 1930s in the form of German lager beers. After WWII and independence, until at least 1960, all beer in North Korea was produced domestically. By the 1980s, beer was in such good availability that the common North Korean could drink it. Until the mid-1990s when the state rationing system started to crumble, North Koreans would receive one bottle of Korean liquor soju and three bottles of beer for every major public holiday in North Korea. All North Korean beers are bottled in domestic made glass bottles that are of poor quality. During the North Korean famine, beer bottles were used for intravenous therapy (IV) due to the shortage of proper hospital equipment. Although there had been breweries before, brewing in North Korea began in earnest in 2000, when the country's leader Kim Jong-il wanted to build a showcase brewery in the country. The state-owned Taedonggang Brewing Company was allowed to buy the old brewery of Ushers of Trowbridge in the United Kingdom and import it to North Korea. April 2002 saw the opening of the Taedonggang Beer Factory opened in the capital Pyongyang. The Rakwon Paradise Microbrewery and the Yanggakdo Hotel Microbrewery soon followed. In August 2016, the Taedonggang brewery opened the first ever beer festival in the country. The festival was canceled for 2017, possibly due to drought. Until recent economic difficulties, there were government-run beer halls in Pyongyang and other major cities. Nowadays beer is generally available in private restaurants that have become more common since government control on the economy has loosened. Beer culture North Korea has a lively beer brewing culture in spite of the country's isolation. Beer is not the most popular alcoholic beverage among North Koreans, who generally prefer the Korean liquor soju. As consequence, North Korean beer is still little known. Nevertheless, beer and soju are the two most common alcoholic drinks in the country, with 94.9 percent of all alcohol consumed (in pure alcohol) being liquor and the remaining 5.1 percent beer. An average North Korean consumes just under a liter of pure alcohol in the form of beer annually. Nevertheless, North Koreans are said to \\"love a beer as much as Europeans or North Americans\\". According to Josh Thomas, an amateur brewer who has toured North Korean breweries: In the future, beer drinking is expected to trend among young people in particular. Indeed, North Korean youths have begun to emulate their South Korean counterparts for whom beer and folk music was a youth trend in the 1970s. Availability tourists at the Taedonggang Microbrewery No. 3 in Pyongyang. Beer is available to tourists without limitation. Mass-produced beer can be found everywhere in the country, and microbreweries are common, too. North Koreans need to expend food coupons when buying beer, which will diminish their grain rations. North Korean men residing in Pyongyang can receive beer vouchers that entitle them to one or two monthly liters of beer at low-end bars. These limitations make beer a beverage primarily for the elite. It is not uncommon for donju, the nouveau riche of Pyongyang, to frequent beer houses. According to the KCNA, there are some 300 newly installed beer taps in Pyongyang, consistent with plans to open 300 pubs announced earlier. Whether the taps are actually in operation or not is impossible to verify. At any rate, there is a \\"huge number\\" of bars in Pyongyang where beer is available. In the summer and during festivals, beer tents pop up around Pyongyang. Tourists may buy beer with foreign currency without the limitations that apply to North Koreans. Beer in international hotels cost about two euros. Indeed, for tourists, according to Josh Thomas, the actual \\"price of drinking North Korean beer is bowing to a lot of statues of Kim Il-Sung and Kim Jong-Il, listening to their version of the Korean war, and eating anything and everything they give you to eat\\". In farmers' markets, a bottle of beer costs about 53 North Korean won. Foreign beers such as Heineken, Tiger, Erdinger, and Bavarian and are increasingly available. A can of Chinese beer, such as Tsingtao or Harbin, can cost up to 4,000 won at the Jangmadang (grey market). Poor rural people brew their own beer with whatever ingredients they can find; \\"We found corn flower and hops and made something that came out a weird milky color. At least it was fizzy like beer\\", one North Korean defector remembers. Brands Taedonggang is the top beer brand of North Korea. There at least ten breweries in North Korea. The country has more major breweries than South Korea. Breweries include the Paradise Microbrewery, the Yanggakdo Hotel Microbrewery (of the Yanggakdo International Hotel), and the Taedonggang National Brewery. Several different beers are brewed in the country, \\"ranging from steam beers, to oatmeal stouts, to chocolate porters and pale ales\\". According to Josh Thomas, \\"[f]or a country that commonly experiences famines, North Korea has a surprisingly large range of beers.\\" Taedonggang (\\"Taedong River\\"), a golden orange lager, is the top brand. It is considered one of the best quality beers in all of Korea, or even \\"significantly better\\" than all other mass-market beers in the rest of Asia. Taedonggang has been exported, even to South Korea, from 2005 until 2007 when Pyongyang increased its price. Other brands include Ryongsong, Pyongyang, Pohak, Ponghak, Rakwon (\\"Paradise\\"), and Samgak (\\"Delta\\"). =Microbreweries= Rakwon Paradise Microbrewery in Pyongyang is one of the many microbreweries of North Korea. There are many microbreweries in the country. The \\"surprising microbrewery culture\\" can be explained with regards to sanctions against North Korea that limit the availability of petrol, thus making distribution of beer a particularly difficult part of the product lifecycle: Many bars and hotels brew their own beer. The Koryo Hotel, for instance, houses a microbrewery that serves what is considered \\"the best dark beer in town\\". There is also a microbrewery at the Chongjin Tourist Hotel in Chongjin. A microbrewery with Czech-made equipment exists in the Rason Special Economic Zone. Indeed, only the Taedonggang Brewing Company could be classified as a \\"macro\\" brewery and the rest are, in effect, microbreweries. =Steam beer= There is a North Korean variety of steam beer, an originally American style of beer brewed in higher than normal temperatures. The North Korean equivalent came about through necessity. Frequent power outages made it impossible to maintain a constant low temperature for brewing. North Korean steam beers are brewed with lager yeast, but for the same reason of unreliable refrigeration, ales are also well-liked. North Korean steam beers are so ubiquitous that it can be said that \\"the average beer is a steam beer\\". Since rice ‚Äî a staple in Asian beers ‚Äî is reserved for food, and barley is not generally used in Korean cooking, there is ample barley to be used in brewing, up to the point of all-barley beers. As a result, beers are darker, fuller, and maltier, which is considered a perk over other Asian beers. Necessities have forced North Koreans to make, according to one writer, \\"more interesting beers than most other countries of the world\\". Quality North Korean beers have low hop content due to taste preferences. North Korean breweries have an abundance of fresh water. Due to the underdevelopment of North Korea's industries, there are no pollution problems with the water. Other ingredients are imported. North Korean beer, in general, is \\"relatively good\\", and tends not to be as light as its South Korean counterparts, whose reputation is of blandness and low quality. The British business weekly The Economist caused an uproar in South Korea when it declared in 2012 that \\"brewing remains just about the only useful activity at which North Korea beats the South.\\" The article and the success of North Korean microbreweries prompted the South Korean beer industry to reform, including changing the alcohol law to allow microbrewing.

Developed in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, it was one of the largest industrial employers in the community for many years, and is relatively unaltered from its period of development. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985. It is now subdivided for multiple industrial and commercial tenants. Description and history The former Winsted Hosiery Mill complex is located north of Winsted's commercial downtown, on the east side of the Still River and the south side of Holabird Avenue. The complex has six buildings, and is roughly divided in half by Whiting Street, which parallels the river. Five of them are of brick construction, and one is of stone. The stone building, which housed the mill offices, is located at the corner of Holabird and Whiting, with a long and narrow brick building extending to the south. Across Whiting Street is another large building, with smaller structures attached and standing detached nearby. The Winsted Hosiery Company was founded in 1882 by William L. Gilbert, producing hosiery and underwear for men made from cotton-wool blends. Its original mill building burned down in 1900, after which the company embarked on a ten-year construction program that resulted in the present complex. The company experienced significant growth until about 1935, and saw declining employment during World War II. In the 1950s it shifted to the production of woolen garments. In 1965 the company, then known as the Winchester Spinning Company, moved its operations to more modern facilities in North Carolina.

It had 98 bridges, very tight radii and a steep incline. It was used from 1883 to 1937, after it had gone several times through financial difficulties.  History  Bath station of the Barbados Railway The governor of Barbados turned the first sod for building the narrow gauge track on Saturday, 23 June 1877. The line's first section from Bridgetown to Carrington was inaugurated on 20 October 1881. The first train needed approximately 40 minutes for the one-way trip. After derailments, the passenger trains were temporarily cancelled after one week, as additional construction work had to be done. The public was informed that up to then only trials had been carried out, to test the track and to establish, how well the track could be used. Additional work was required at the terminus, and some sections of the track had to be levelled. Artist impression of the Barbados Railway, published in The Graphic of 25 February 1882 The complete line up to Belleplaine was officially inaugurated in 1883 with a festive banquet. The dignitaries of the maiden voyage \\"wondered, why the railway should have ended so abruptly among barren sand hills,\\" but they were apparently impressed by the meal, which had been prepared for the occasion. According to a contemporary report \\"nothing was heard for sometime but the rattle of knives and forks and the popping of soda- water and Ginger Ale corks, which with some good sound Claret and a little Bass, cooled by abundance of ice, formed the staple beverages.\\" Initially, the railway was operated with great success, due to large traffic of sugar, freight and passengers. The owners did not re-invest their earnings into the maintenance of their assets, so that the track deteriorated in the 1890s by corrosion, wear, rain and floodings and was in the need of a complete overhaul. Bridge over Long Pond, St. Andrew, before re-gauging in 1898 Due to large storms in December 1896, long sections of the track became unusable because of erosion and flooding and had to be rebuilt completely. In the subsequent two years until 1898, the rail track was re-gauged to the new gauge of 762 mm (2 feet 6 inch) by the internationally recognised railway specialist Everard Calthrop. New Baldwin locomotives and passenger cars were imported from the United States. The success was only short-lived, as the operators went into financial difficulties again when the governmental subsidies faded out. The railway was temporarily closed in 1904, while the liquidators tried to find another investor. Bathsheba station, St. Joseph A new railway company was founded in 1905 with the name The Barbados Light Railway Company Limited and took-over the operation. It expanded the services by installing a branch to Crane. Crane's Hotel placed advertisements for the passenger trains from Bushy Park, which stopped near to the hotel. But the company went into dire straits again in 1906, as there was only very limited passenger traffic and the goods transport was not profitable enough, to keep the company running. The government subsidies phased-out again in 1914, and the company went bankrupt. The Government of Barbados took over the railway in 1916. After conducting some urgently needed repairs, it started initially with goods transport and with effect from 1917 it started again to transport passengers. Over the years, the railway deteriorated again. Even after buying a new train and overhauling the existing ones, the track itself became unreliable and caused some derailments. The buildings in Bridgetown required also some immediate refurbishment. The railway line had a total of 98 bridges. Ernest Biffin, the General Manager of the Railway, explained in the 1920s that the railway was unique for two reasons: It had the most severe curve of any line he knew and one of the steepest gradients of any railway in the world. Just beyond Three Houses at Consetts Cutting the railway descended a 1 in 33 grade from the escarpment to sea level. Local people believe that curves were placed in the track because the railway company from England did not build lines less than 21 miles long. More likely this could be the reason, why it was extended into the sandy hills of Bellplaine. The insufficient maintenance raised again some concerns in the early 1930s. The locomotive sheds and depots for the wagons had become unstable beyond repair, and the locomotives should have been stripped down and overhauled completely. An engine driver reported about the poorly maintained track and points: \\"About 150 feet (45 m) from the Carrington siding I noticed the points open half way for main and half for siding; at this discovery the steam was shut off, engine reversed and danger whistle blown. I can only say, Sir, that if those points had been run over undiscovered it would have been a moast (sic) terrible disaster.\\" The passenger cars were in poor condition with worn-out wheels and unreliable brakes. They needed to be re-painted, as did most of the railway's structures. The passenger traffic decreased from year to year. Passenger traffic was discontinued in 1934 due to safety concerns, and only limited goods transport was conducted, until the railway was closed completely on 12 October 1937. The steel tracks were lifted in 1938 and either scrapped or re-used as telephone posts.  Rolling stock  = Locomotives = 0-4-0 steam locomotive St. Michael of Black Hawthorn during construction of the railway Initially, five steam locomotives were used: * One 0-4-0 locomotive, St. Michael of Black Hawthorn, which had been owned by the construction company * Two 2-6-2 tender locomotives of Vulcan Foundry with a wheelbase of 5.68 m (18 feet 8 inch) and a running weight of 27,3 t (27 tons 6 cwts) * Two smaller 2-6-2 tender locomotives of Avonside Engine Company In 1891 two new 0-6-0 heavy tank engines were acquired from W.

As a researcher, he made important contributions in the area of discrete mathematics; and as an educator and administrator, was also instrumental in founding the Faculty of Mathematics at the University of Waterloo, and for establishing its unofficial mascot of the pink tie.  Life and education  Stanton was born in Lambeth, Ontario, Canada on 21 October 1923. He was the eldest of four children. Stanton received his BA in Mathematics and Physics in 1944 from the University of Western Ontario. He went on to receive his MA in 1945 and PhD in 1948, both from the University of Toronto. His PhD dissertation was on the topic \\"On The Mathiew Group M(Sub 24)\\", under advisor Richard Dagobert Brauer. He received honorary Doctor of Science degrees from the University of Queensland in 1989, and from the University of Natal in 1997. He also received an honorary D. Math from the University of Waterloo in 1997.  Career  = Faculty positions= From 1946 to 1957 Stanton taught at the University of Toronto. In 1957, he moved to Kitchener-Waterloo to work at what was then Waterloo College, which was undergoing expansion, and became what is currently the University of Waterloo. At the time of his arrival he constituted the entirety of the Mathematics Department. Stanton became the university's first Dean of Graduate Studies in 1960. He turned the Department of Mathematics into the Faculty of Mathematics, which when it opened on January 1, 1967 was the first of its kind in North America. In 1967 he moved to York University to found their Graduate program in Mathematics. In 1970 he moved to the University of Manitoba's Department of Computer Science, serving successively as Head, Professor, and Distinguished Professor. =Research = Stanton's main areas of research were in statistics and applied statistics; algebra; mathematical biology; combinatorial design theory, including pair-wise balanced designs, difference sets, covering and packing designs, and room squares; graph theory, including graph models of networks; and algorithms.  Teaching and other influences  Stanton's influence on the young University of Waterloo extended to many areas. He hired Wes Graham, who Stanton had taught as an undergraduate. Graham became one of the first professors of computer science at the university, and the first Director of its Computing Centre in 1962. Stanton was one of five members of the Academic Advisory Committee that, in 1958, urged the board of governors to buy the Schweitzer farm on the outskirts of Waterloo that today houses the main campus. He introduced computers to classroom teaching in 1960, and introduced co-op programs in applied mathematics and computer science. His interest in teaching extended to the secondary school level. He encouraged teaching of computing science and mathematics in high schools, serving as editor of two high school mathematical journals, member of Ontario provincial curriculum committees, and was actively involved in developing the Canadian Junior Mathematics Contest and the Descartes Senior Mathematics Competition, now administered by the University of Waterloo's Centre for Education in Mathematics and Computing. Stanton's gaudy neckties were the inspiration for the University of Waterloo's Faculty of Mathematics mascot, a giant pink tie that was hung by students over the Math and Computer Building when it opened in 1968. The pink tie remains the unofficial symbol of the Mathematics Faculty, with the Mathematics Society distributing more than 1000 pink ties to new students in the first week of the school year. Stanton founded and administered three not-for-profit corporations dedicated to mathematical research and communication. \\"Utilitas Mathematica Publishing\\" started in the 1970s and published conference proceedings in mathematics and scientific computing. He founded the Charles Babbage Research Centre (CBRC), a registered charitable organization, to promote conferences and encourage the publication of research. The CBRC currently has published the Canadian journal of combinatorics, Ars Combinatoria, since its inception in 1976, and continues to publish six volumes per year. In 1990 he began his final project, the Institute of Combinatorics and its Applications (ICA). Although the institute was minimally active after Stanton's death in 2010, in March 2016 it resumed its full activities. Stanton also helped organize the first Southeastern Conference on Combinatorics, Graph Theory, and Computing. He continued as one of the organizers until at least 1991, at which point it was the largest combinatorial meeting in the world.  Awards  In 1985 he was awarded the Killam Prize in Mathematics for Natural Sciences from the Canada Council for the Arts. (As of 2017, five prizes of $100,000 Cdn are awarded annually.)  Literature collection  Stanton's collection of French and Portuguese literature was described as one of the world's largest private collections of classical Portuguese literature. He donated his collection to the Fisher Rare Book Library at the University of Toronto. His donations spanned from 1987 to his death in 2010, with the bulk being donated in the 1990s. Thanks to his generosity, the Fisher Rare Book Library now \\"boasts comprehensive collections of most of the significant French playwrights of the Classical period\\". An example of his donations is a two-volume set of the 1587 edition of Holinshed's Chronicles.

A combined French and Dutch fleet under Job Forant encountered a larger English fleet commanded by Admiral Sir Thomas Allin, 1st Baronet. The English attacked and in poor visibility a series of encounters left several French and Dutch ships badly damaged. The battle ended with the English having captured the French ship Le Rubis. Background The Second Anglo-Dutch War had been raging for a year between the Kingdom of England and the Dutch Republic over the colonial possessions of the two countries. Most fighting involved naval encounters, which took place in European waters and the West Indies. France was allied to the Dutch Republic and Denmark. In 1666, the English fleet controlled the North Sea after its victory in the St James's Day Fight, and the Dutch had also been dealt a severe blow after the English raid known as Holmes's Bonfire. Louis XIV of France and his general superintendent of navigation, Fran√ßois de Vend√¥me, Duc de Beaufort, had decided that it was the time to act, as the English would be distracted by the Great Fire of London, which had ended only on 5 September. Louis had ordered for the French and Dutch fleets to be united against England.Jones p. 173 A French squadron of eight ships, commanded by capitaine de vaisseau Job Forant aboard La Sophie (60 guns) had departed from Toulon and was joined by a small Dutch squadron bringing the total to fourteen ships. The Franco-Dutch fleet entered the English Channel, seeking to join the main Dutch fleet in the Netherlands. It encountered heavy weather, and off Dungeness, the fleet came across a larger English force of 25 ships under the command of Admiral Thomas Allin.Clowes p. 286 Battle Allin pursued the combined fleet, and a battle commenced. Visibility was poor and so the action was very confused. The English had the weather gage and inflicted heavy damage on the French ships Le Bourbon (66 guns) and Le Mazarin (48 guns) under Captains Rabesni√®res-Treillebois and Villepars respectively. Battling six English ships, they succeeded in dropping out with heavy damage and casualties and escaped to Le Havre. The French ships Le Merc≈ìur (32 guns) and L'Oms and the Dutch Prins te Paard and Oosterwijk were forced to abandon the fight. Le Dragon (42 guns) under captain Pr√©aux- Mercey after having been nearly surrounded by three English ships battered its way out inflicting damage and managed to make port at Dieppe. Le Rubis, a new ship in the French Royal Navy with sixty guns, had become detached in the poor weather and sighted Allin's fleet, which thought that it was the Franco-Dutch fleet. The French captain Gilles de La Roche Saint-Andr√© realised his mistake too late. He attempted to fight, but outnumbered, he stuck his colours and surrendered. The rest of the French and the Dutch retreated to safety. Aftermath Gilles de La Roche Saint-Andr√© was treated honourably by his English captors and was immediately released by order of Charles II. The Duke of York offered him a sword before his repatriation to France. His reputation at the French Court was such that he was appointed as chef d'escadre in the French Royal Navy in 1667. Louis, however, was disenchanted with the Duc de Beaufort for his failure to unite with the Dutch fleet. The Rubis was taken into service as HMS French Ruby and served in the English Navy until 1686.

Bruce Cameron and published by Forge Books. It is the sequel to Cameron's 2010 book A Dog's Purpose. Plot Buddy feels as if he has served his purpose by taking care of his deceased master, Ethan when he was alive, and Hannah and Ethan‚Äôs other family members who live on the Farm. However, when Hannah‚Äôs granddaughter, a toddler named Clarity Jones (CJ) comes to visit the Farm with her mother, Gloria, Buddy cannot help but feel that Ethan would want him to help her because her curiosity leads her to dangerous situations and Gloria does not pay attention to her. As a result, Buddy saves CJ from drowning and being trampled by a horse. Instead of admitting that she has been negligent and praising Buddy for his actions, Gloria blames him for each of CJ‚Äôs predicaments and gets mad when CJ shows him affection. She later leaves the Farm with CJ after becoming angry when Hannah suggests that she take care of CJ so that Gloria can continue her singing career. Gloria wants the child support payments she receives from Hannah‚Äôs son, Henry. After some time, Buddy dies, thinking that he will not be reborn and that he hopes there will be a dog for CJ because she needs one. Buddy is reborn, however. His realizes that he is now a female dog and his name is Molly. He tries to understand why he is back and then, one day, he sees Clarity who people now call CJ. She comes with her high school friend, Trent. Trent adopts Molly‚Äôs brother, Rocky. Molly shows her love for CJ, but CJ says that Gloria will not allow her to have a dog. Not long afterwards, however, she returns and takes Molly home with her, planning to hide her from Gloria. The plan does not work, however, as Molly also tries to show Gloria love and reveals herself. Gloria tires to force CJ to get rid of Molly. Molly fights back by threatening to reveal Gloria‚Äôs constant neglect of her. Gloria then tries to eliminate Molly herself by trying to kill the dog and then taking it to an Animal Control shelter. CJ rescues Molly both times. She tries to get her away from Gloria by living with other people and then running away to California. As she is still a minor, she has to return home both times. During the fight for Molly, CJ gets in trouble for skipping school and giving Shane, a boy she dates, the key to the art department. He says he wants to get a copy of an upcoming test, but instead commits a more serious crime. CJ tries to get away from Shane, who continues to try to control her, with Gloria‚Äôs blessings. CJ runs away from Gloria again when she discovers that she has spent the money in CJ‚Äôs trust fund. CJ was depending on the money to pay for her college education. When she leaves, Shane follows her and she has a car accident. Molly does not survive. As she dies, Molly realizes that she is the dog that was sent to take care of CJ. Buddy comes back to life again as a small dog named Max. This time he is intent on saving CJ. His devotion to her almost causes his death as he is not nice to other people, so no one wants to adopt him. Finally, he sees CJ who is now a young woman living in New York. She agrees to take him even though she is dog sitting and living in an apartment that is not hers. As it turns out, Trent also now lives in New York and he and CJ reunite. CJ is dating a married man. Trent has a girlfriend. Max recognizes Trent and is nice to him. During this period of her life, things do not go well for CJ and she realizes that she has become her mother. The realization causes her to attempt suicide. Afterwards, Gloria tries to take her back to her house, but Trent intervenes. Upon leaving the hospital, CJ moves in with Trent. He has broken up with his girlfriend and he helps CJ by finding Hannah and arranging a trip to visit the Farm and nursing CJ back to health. CJ finally admits that she loves him in a romantic sense and the two get married. Thanks to Max, Trent is saved from dying of cancer. However, the suicide attempt ruined CJ‚Äôs kidneys and she has to go on dialysis. She also goes to school and studies psychology. After a long life with them, Max dies, happy to think that they will be okay. Buddy is born one more time. This time he has the same name he had at the very beginning of his life, Toby, and he not so anxious to find CJ as he thinks that she will find him when she needs him. His job is to work at a hospice where he comforts dying patients. CJ finally does come. Gloria is suffering from Alzheimer‚Äôs and is in the hospice. Both CJ and Gloria are much older. Trent has died, but he and CJ lived a happy life. Gloria dies in the hospice with CJ and Toby by her side. CJ comes to work part time in the hospice. Then, one day, she checks herself in after deciding to end her dialysis treatment. She takes comfort in Toby‚Äôs presence, telling him that he reminds her of her dogs Molly and Max.

He gained notoriety by appearing in the first German ISIL propaganda video in 2015, and went on to fight for the militant organization until 2017, when he was killed in action against the Syrian Democratic Forces.  Biography  Born in 1986 in Stuttgart into a partially German Muslim family, Yamin Abou-Zand grew up in Baden-W√ºrttemberg until moving with his parents to K√∂nigswinter in 2000. There, he married a German Muslim and rented his own apartment. The couple had no children and lived secluded, though neighbors said that they were generally nice people. Yamin also began working at the Deutsche Telekom in the department for Recruiting and Talent-Acquisition, where he was initially considered to be a \\"promising, committed and very courteous employee\\". In late-2013, his co- workers noticed that he became increasingly extremist in his religious views. Eventually, he began to openly express sympathy for ISIL, whereupon the Telekom reported him to the German security agencies. Yamin eventually quit his job in late-2014. In early-2015, he and his wife disappeared without informing their families, who reported them missing to local authorities. The two appear to have travelled to Turkey, and from there to Syria in order to join ISIL. Soon after, Yamin adopted his nom de guerre \\"Abu Umar al-Almani\\" and joined Millatu Ibrahim, a German Salafist organization led by the Austrian Mohamed Mahmoud that had become a unit of ISIL's military. He gained prominence in August 2015 by appearing in the first ISIL propaganda video in German together with Mohamed Mahmoud. In the video, shot in Palmyra, the two tried to encourage German Muslims to travel to Syria and join ISIL. Abu Umar claimed that \\"the jihad is like vacation for us. We are here at one of the most beautiful places in Syria.\\" In the case German jihadists could not travel to Syria, he ordered them instead to commit terrorist attacks in Germany and Austria, saying that they should \\"attack the kuffar, in their own homes! Kill them where you find them!\\" The two ISIL fighters justified this as revenge for the German support of the anti-ISIL coalition, and the Bundeswehr mission in Afghanistan. Abu Umar then proceeded to execute a captured Syrian Army soldier. Since his appearance in the propaganda video, Abu Umar was wanted by the German security services for murder and war crimes. German Salafists, including those with sympathies for ISIL and al-Qaeda, widely condemned the execution and the video, with prominent Islamist Bernhard Falk (de) calling Abu Umar a psychopath. In course of the following year, Abu Umar became an emir and one of the leading ISIL commanders in the Al-Thawrah District, where he helped to organize the defenses against the SDF-led Raqqa offensive. On 25 March 2017, he was killed with three of his bodyguards by YPJ fighters during clashes near Tabqa Dam.

It is based on a 2008 French television film, Papillon Noir, directed by Christian Faure. Plot Paul Lopez is an alcoholic screenwriter suffering from writer's block. His realtor, Laura, arrives with a couple, the Owens, to show them Paul's house, for sale because of Paul's financial difficulties. Before leaving to go hunting, Paul asks Laura to meet later at a diner. On his way, he receives a phone call advising his script cannot be submitted in its current form. Frustrated, Paul gets into an altercation with a truck driver who won't let him pass in traffic. He meets Laura. News of the \\"Roadside Killer\\" is being broadcast. The Owens are not interested in the house but Laura is interested in his work. He confides he has not written in a long time. Before leaving they make a dinner date. Meanwhile, the truck driver enters the restaurant. Upset, he attacks Paul, but is thrown out of the diner by Jack, another patron. Driving, Paul spots Jack hitchhiking and picks him up, inviting him to stay the night in his guestroom. Later Paul explains his phone connection is out and there is no internet. He tells Jack his history as a writer. Jack asks to read one of Paul's scripts and is given an unsold script called Under the Clock. Paul notices Jack's tattoo while he is swimming in an artificial pond near the house and Jack explains that it is a prison tattoo of a black butterfly; very rare and very hard to catch. Jack convinces Paul to quit drinking and to write a script based on Paul's life. Jack reads the first draft without Paul's consent and, unsatisfied, throws it into the fire, proposing that the character of \\"Jack\\" be a person working in collusion with the truck driver. That night Jack sneaks into Paul's room and puts a knife to his throat to show him that, unlike the girl pleading with her attacker in his script, in reality the victim does not speak a word. While Jack is chopping wood the next morning, Paul looks through old newspaper clippings and evidence he has collected about young women's disappearances but quickly hides it when Jack walks in. Later, while working on the script, Paul hears a gunshot and a woman scream. He goes outside to investigate but Jack indicates that it was a bird screeching due to the gunshot. A delivery man arrives with some goods. Jack points a shotgun at Paul and tells him not to walk too far. Once Paul gets rid of the delivery man, he argues with Jack about his twisted conduct. Attempting to leave, Paul ends up punching Jack but is wrestled to the ground and taken prisoner. Jack explains that he is paranoid about going back to prison. That night Paul sneaks out for drink but is stopped by Jack who then forces him to smash all the bottles, insisting that he is helping him. Later in the night, Paul has difficulties writing due to Jack terrorizing him. Laura arrives on a foggy morning asking why Paul hasn't answered her calls for days. At that moment, Paul rushes to her and tells her to give him her car keys so that they can escape Jack. Halfway down the road, Jack walks out in front of them and shoots at the car. He then forces them to push the car into the water and to come back to the house. Soon a sheriff arrives looking for a missing girl who was supposed to have been delivering a package. Paul says that he hasn't seen the girl but attempts to scream out a message, causing Jack to run out, force the sheriff into the trunk of his police vehicle and shoot him. Paul locks Jack out and barricades the windows to protect himself and Laura. When Jack pretends to drive the sheriff's car away, they attempt to run through the woods to catch the half- hourly train but Laura trips over a log and Jack catches them. That night Jack insists that Paul has broken their agreement. Laura, surprisingly, stabs Jack in the back with a pair of sewing scissors. Paul grabs the shotgun but Jack says he is not brave enough to shoot and wrestles it from him. He takes Laura into the study and ties Paul to a chair. Paul breaks a picture and uses the broken glass to cut himself free, goes downstairs where he picks up a shotgun and enters the study. Laura is unconscious on the floor. Paul explains to Jack that he understands what it is like to \\"kill\\" and believes Jack has been sent by God so that Paul can kill Jack and frame him as the Roadside Killer. He shoots at Jack but the bullets are blanks. Jack grabs the shotgun and knocks him unconscious. Paul wakes next morning and finds a group of FBI agents searching his house. He sees the sheriff uninjured and the truck driver, Laura, and Jack, all wearing FBI badges. Jack explains that they have been \\"tracking\\" him for three years and plays the recording of Paul's explanation of what it is like to kill. Paul complains that any evidence collected from his house is tainted because Jack and Laura had access to the house and could have planted it and that the tape recording is just his notes for a screenplay. Jack fears that they do not have enough evidence for a conviction. He notices an excavator with dirt on it. Looking through Paul's possessions, he finds a picture of Paul's wife in a yard that shows no artificial pond. Paul is impressed and attempts to make a deal to avoid the death penalty but Jack prefers \\"his own ending\\". The film ends with Paul waking up from what appeared to be a dream that happened to be the events of the film, and quickly attempts to type out the dream as a new script entitled Black Butterfly.

It has a hot climate with high rainforest throughout the year, and holds one of the most diverse collections of fauna and flora in the world. The ecoregion is relatively intact. Location The Solim√µes-Japur√° moist forests has an area of divided between Colombia, Brazil and Peru. The northern boundary of the western portion in Colombia is defined by the Caqueta River. The Caqueta separates the ecoregion from the Caqueta moist forests to the north. The Caqueta becomes the Japur√° River when it crosses the border with Brazil, and the Japur√° (or the Purus v√°rzea along the Japur√°) defines the northern boundary in Brazil to the point where the Japur√° meets the Solim√µes River. The Japur√°-Solim√µes-Negro moist forests lies to the north of the Japur√°. The Purus v√°rzea and then the Iquitos v√°rzea along the Solim√µes define the southern boundary in Brazil and Peru. The Purus v√°rzea forms the south east border, and elements of the Purus v√°rzea are found along rivers throughout the Solim√µes-Japur√° ecoregion. The Iquitos v√°rzea forms the southwest border, separating the Solim√µes-Japur√° ecoregion from the Southwest Amazon moist forests further south.. The Solim√µes-Japur√° moist forests adjoins the Napo moist forests to the west. The Napo River separates the Solim√µes-Japur√° moist forest from the Napo moist forests. Physical The ecoregion covers upland alluvial plains formed in the Tertiary period. The terrain includes floodplains, rolling hills, steep banks and plateaus. Elevations are typically from , but in Colombia the sandstone plateaus rise to . The Putumayo River, which defines the border between Peru and Colombia, runs through the region, which is also drained by the Caquet√°, Napo and Solim√µes. There is a variety of soil types, but most are oxisols and ultisols poor in nutrients and high in aluminum and iron. Ecology The Solim√µes-Japur√° moist forests ecoregion is in the Neotropical realm and the tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests biome. The climate and complex physical environment make the ecoregion one of the most biologically diverse in the world. =Climate= The climate is hot and humid, with high rainfall. The K√∂ppen climate classification is \\"Af\\": equatorial, fully humid. Temperatures vary little throughout the year, with mean temperatures from , minimum temperatures from and maximum temperatures from . There is heavy precipitation throughout the year, ranging from an average of in August to in April. Rain falls almost every day of the year. Total annual precipitation is around . =Flora= 15 types of vegetation have been defined in just one part of the ecoregion in Colombia. Most of the vegetation is tall, dense evergreen tropical rainforest, rich in plant species. It includes well- drained terra firme upland forest, well-drained floodplain forest, poorly drained floodplain forest and swamp forest. The whitewater rivers carry organic and mineral sediments washed down from the Andes, which they deposit during the annual floods, so the soils in the floodplains are richer in nutrients than in the terra firme areas. The floodplain forests belong to the Purus v√°rzea ecoregion. The Peruvian part of the ecoregion contains areas of nutrient-poor white sand similar to the Brazilian campinarana ecoregion. The vegetation is sclerophyllous low scrub or open-canopy low forest with distinctive flora and fauna and high levels of endemism. The sandstone plateaus in Colombia have shrub and savanna vegetation related to the Guiana region. The dense forests on the uplands have a canopy of up to with emergent trees up to . The forests often have a dense understory of lianas, palms, epiphytes, mosses and ferns. Flora are typical of the Amazon biome. The most common families of trees are Annonaceae, Lecythidaceae, Myristicaceae, Fabaceae and Sapotaceae. Emergent trees include Ceiba pentandra, Terminalia amazonia, Cedrelinga cateniformis, Carapa guianensis and Hevea guianensis. Commercially valuable timber trees include Virola surinamensis, Cedrela odorata and Carapa guianensis. =Fauna= Fauna are typical of the Amazon region. Many of the species are at the furthest west of their range. 181 species of mammals have been recorded including equatorial saki (Pithecia aequatorialis), golden-mantled tamarin (Saguinus tripartitus), Goeldi's marmoset (Callimico goeldii), jaguar (Panthera onca), margay (Leopardus wiedii), Sechuran fox (Lycalopex sechurae), southern little yellow-eared bat (Vampyressa pusilla), Schmidts's big-eared bat (Micronycteris schmidtorum), South American tapir (Tapirus terrestris), giant anteater (Myrmecophaga tridactyla), silky anteater (Cyclopes didactylus), southern tamandua (Tamandua tetradactyla), long-nosed armadillo (Dasypus), gray brocket (Mazama gouazoubira), red brocket (Mazama americana) and West Indian manatee (Trichechus manatus). Endangered mammals include white-bellied spider monkey (Ateles belzebuth) and giant otter (Pteronura brasiliensis). About 542 species of birds have been recorded, of which 500 are found in the Amacayacu National Park. Birds endemic to the ecoregion or rarely found elsewhere in the Amazon region include ashy-tailed swift (Chaetura andrei), blue-tufted starthroat (Heliomaster furcifer), pavonine quetzal (Pharomachrus pavoninus), white-eared jacamar (Galbalcyrhynchus leucotis), ochre-striped antpitta (Grallaria dignissima), Salvin's curassow (Mitu salvini), and golden-winged tody- flycatcher (Poecilotriccus calopterus). Endangered birds include wattled curassow (Crax globulosa). Reptiles include Arrau turtle (Podocnemis expansa), spectacled caiman (Caiman crocodilus), green iguana (Iguana iguana) and tegus lizards (Tupinambis genus). Snakes include green anaconda (Eunectes murinus), lanceheads (Bothrops atrox), palm pit-vipers (Bothriechis genus), coral snakes (Micrurus genus), boa constrictor (Boa constrictor), emerald tree boa (Corallus caninus), and bushmaster (Lachesis muta). Fish include silver arowana (Osteoglossum bicirrhosum), tetras (Hyphessobrycon and Bryconops genera), piranhas (Serrasalmus genus) and ocellate river stingray (Potamotrygon motoro). Endangered amphibians include Johnson's horned treefrog (Hemiphractus johnsoni). Status The World Wildlife Fund class the ecoregion as \\"Relatively Stable/Intact\\". There are only two short roads in the whole region. The original habitat is mostly intact, but large areas along the Caquet√° and Putumayo rivers have been deforested for production of coca (Erythroxylum coca), logging, mining and cattle ranching. These activities threaten the remaining forest. Colombia has strong laws regulating logging but they are poorly enforced. Almost all the mahogany (Swietenia macrophylla) has been logged, and most of the tropical cedar (Cedrela odorata) has been logged along the main rivers. About one third of the ecoregion, between the Putumayo and Caquet√° rivers in Colombia, is the territory of indigenous people. They practice extraction and small-scale farming in shifting locations. The Cahuinari and Amacayacu national parks in Colombia protect of rainforest. The Mamirau√° Sustainable Development Reserve in Brazil protects part of the ecoregion.

His early work was mostly figurative; much of his later work is inspired by the Bible, particularly the Book of Psalms.  Biography  Benn was born in 1905 in Bia≈Çystok, Russian Empire, where his father was an architect and his grandfather was a rabbi. He demonstrated an early talent for painting. In 1917, he began giving private lessons in drawing. In 1926, he started making theatre sets. In 1927, Benn had his first private exhibition in Wilno (Second Polish Republic).

It comes under the Diocese of St Albans and is one of the largest village churches in the county. The church dates almost entirely from the 14th century and is renowned for its ornate tower which stands at and which is crowned by an octagonal lantern with a leaded fleche or spire. The church also contains some medieval graffiti carved on its walls which highlights the plight of survivors of the bubonic plague pandemic known as the Black Death. The church has been Grade I listed since 1968. History and design The chancel The Victorian baptismal font The pulpit was installed in 1627 The Sanctuary and sedilia It is not known if an earlier church occupied the site but if one did its materials would presumably have been incorporated into the present church, which was completed in 1381 using clunch, flint rubble and a small quantity of red bricks. St Mary's church is an impressive building with a large West tower built in four stages, the top half of the tower having been added some time after 1415 while the lead-covered wooden fl√®che was added between 1415 and 1562. At including the fl√®che, the tower is the tallest in Hertfordshire. The North porch and the aisle windows were added in the 15th century; the North porch is single storey and retains its original door arch and windows while the two-storey 14th century South porch has many of its original features with a gabled front which was restored in the 19th century. The North aisle is dedicated to St James. The nave is of 5 bays and the chancel retains its mid-14th century sedilia. The original rood screen dividing the chancel from the nave was probably destroyed during the English Reformation. Today in its place is a modern cross above the altar of The Risen Christ by John Mills, President of the Royal Society of British Sculptors and who lives nearby in Hinxworth Place. The mediaeval stained glass in the East window which showed depictions from the life of Thomas Becket was removed in 1538 by order of Henry VIII. Three small fragments of the mediaeval glass can still be found in the windows of the North Aisle while other small pieces of it were discovered in the churchyard and have been set in the modern clear glass. The hexagonal wooden pulpit is dated 1627 while the church has a 15th-century traceried wooden screen to the Lady Chapel in the East bay of the South aisle. The baptismal font is a 19th-century replica but stands on an early octagonal base. There are 15th century benches near the chancel. On a visit to Ashwell in 1956 the Poet Laureate Sir John Betjeman wrote of St Mary's: > \\"So I went to Ashwell which is near nowhere, unless it be Baldock, and on > the road to nothing, thank God. We first saw its gigantic dark grey > fourteenth-century church tower, crowned with a tapering lead fl√®che, rising > from huge elms on chalky foothills looking over open corn land to the levels > of Hunts and Cambs. ... And the church inside, white and spacious and East > Anglian, with arcades like a Cathedral, clear glass everywhere, uneven > floors and splendid chancel, was worthy of the best of English > villages.\\"John Betjeman, 'City and Suburban', The Spectator, 12 July 1956, > Page 12 Today St Mary's is a popular venue for music concerts and festivals. Ashwell Graffiti Graffiti of 1360 and 1361 in St Mary's church Graffito of Old St Paul's Cathedral in St Mary's On the North wall of the West tower can be found some remarkable 14th century graffiti which includes an inscription recording survival of citizens of Ashwell during the Great Plague known as the Black Death and an early inscribed drawing of the Old St Paul's Cathedral in London. There is no clue as to who wrote the graffiti or to its exact date. On the wall of the church tower graffiti was inscribed which reads: > \\"MCT Expente miseranda ferox, violenta Superest plebs pessima testis, MCCCL\\" > A translation of the above is: > > \\"1350 Miserable, wild, distracted 1350 > The dregs of the mob alone survive to witness\\" This refers to the bubonic > plague epidemic during the reign of Edward III when it is known Ashwell > suffered greatly at this time.David Short (Historical Adviser), Guide to St > Mary's, Ashwell. No publisher (ND) pg 11 > A later graffito dated 1361 reads: > \\"In finque ventus validus oc anne maurus orbe tonat MCCCLXI\\" > Which translates as: > \\"And in the end a tempest full and mighty > This year 1361 thunders mightily in the world\\" This last line probably refers to the famous storm of St Maur‚Äôs Day on 15 January 1361 which may have cleared the air of any remaining traces of the Black Death. Below and on the same wall is inscribed a sketch thought to be of Old St Paul's Cathedral which burnt down in the Great Fire of London in 1666. This is the most important of the graffiti in St Mary's, not only because the depiction is of national importance but also because the mediaeval depiction of buildings in such detail is rare, even in manuscripts. The date the depiction was made was sometime in the 14th or 15th century. Architecturally, it shows a building in the Perpendicular style of about 1350 to 1500. It cannot be earlier than the masonry of St Mary's church which dates from about 1340, and if it actually does depict St Paul's it cannot be later that 1561, when the spire of St Paul's fell down.Guide, pg 12 Most of the rest of the graffiti in the church is scratched on the pillars in the nave. On the pillar nearest the Lady Chapel is one yet to be interpreted which is believed to refer to the consecration of the church. On the pillar near the south door there is a comment from a frustrated mediaeval architect: \\"Cornua non sunt arto compugente-sputo\\" ‚Äì meaning \\"The corners are not pointed correctly ‚Äì I spit\\". On another pillar is a brief inscription showing the bitterness of some unhappy suitor in love: \\"Barbara filia barbara est\\" ‚Äì \\"Barbara is the daughter of a barbarian\\". Bells and embroideries Reredos embroidered by Percy Sheldrick in the Lady Chapel The church has six bells hanging in a 15th- century frame in the tower. The second bell, cast in 1694 by Charles Newman, is the oldest. The fifth was cast by Robert Taylor of St Neots in 1808. The remaining bells were cast by John Brian of Hartford between 1787 and 1817. The embroideries displayed around the church including the exquisite reredos behind the altar in the Lady Chapel showing The Virgin and Child flanked by St James and St John the Baptist are by Percy Sheldrick (1890‚Äì1979) of Ashwell who worked as a master weaver and embroiderer at William Morris' Morris & Co. workshops at Merton Abbey Mills during the 1920s. By far his greatest work was 'The Passing of Venus' from a design by Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood artist Edward Burne-Jones and which includes 18 life size figures; it is now in Lansing Community College in Michigan. He left Merton Abbey Mills in 1939 and returned to Ashwell to work for an antique dealer and where he acted as Verger at St Mary's. Sheldrick continued to embroider in his spare time and his work can be found in collections and institutions all round the world.

Peter Epting took over as the club's chairman that season from Charles R√∂thlisberger at the Annual General Meeting in March 1993. FC Basel played their home games in the St. Jakob Stadium. Following their relegation in the 1987‚Äì88 season this was their fifth season in the second tier of Swiss football.  Overview  Friedel Rausch was appointed as trainer, following Karl Odermatt and Bruno Rahmen who had taken over ad interim after Ernst August K√ºnnecke had been sacked toward the end of the previous season. After missing promotion during the last four seasons, the club's repeated priority aim was to return to the top flight of Swiss football. Basel were assigned to the Nationalliga B West group and also assigned to this group were local rivals Old Boys. Basel ended the Qualifying Phase in second position in the league table. In the 22 matches Basel totaled 36 points with 16 victories, four draws and two defeats. The team scored 54 goals and conceded only 10. Basel thus qualified for the promotion stage and were assigned to group A. Further teams assigned to this group from the Nationalliga B were Del√©mont, Ch√™nois, Luzern, Locarno and Wil. Assigned to this group and fighting against relegation from the Nationalliga A were Bulle and Grasshopper Club. Basel ended the promotion stage in a very disappointing fourth position in the league table. The 14 matches resulted in seven victories, four draws and three defeats with 18 points, scoring 25, conceding 17 goals. Therefore, Basel missed promotion again. In the Swiss Cup Basel started in the second round. They were drawn away from home against lower-tier local team FC Baudepartement Basel. In the round of 64 they were drawn at home to local rivals Old Boys. Basel were drawn away against lower-tier SC Young Fellows Juventus in the round of 32 and in the next round they were drawn at home against lower-tier FC Savi√®se. All four games were won without the team conceding a single goal. However, in the quarterfinals Basel played at home against higher-tier Xamax. Because this match ended with a 2‚Äì3 defeat they were eliminated from the competition.

She works with glass and fabrice to produce what the David Owsley Museum of Art describes as \\"beautiful crafted surfaces and disturbing text about aggressors and victims\\". She lives and works in Israel. Her work has appeared in solo and group exhibitions, and she has won, or been nominated for, a number of international prizes and awards. Biography Dafna Kaffeman graduated in 1999 from the Gerrit Rietveld Academy in Amsterdam, and in 2001 received a Master of Fine Arts from the Sandberg Institute, also in Amsterdam. She had one-person shows, among others, at the San Francisco Museum of Craft and Design (2015‚Äì16); the David Owsley Museum of Art at Ball State University in Muncie, Indiana, (2014‚Äì15); Keramikmuseum Westerwald in Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany (2013); the American University Museum in Washington, D.C. (2011); and the lorch + seidel contemporary in Berlin, Germany (2006, 2010, 2013, 2017). She has participated in many group shows in Europe and the United States. She won the Design Prize from the Israel culture ministry in 2016 and was awarded the Prize for the Advancement of the Arts (Israel) in 2011. Kaffeman's works are exhibited in the collections of various museums such as the Montreal Museum of Contemporary Art in Montreal, Canada, the Victoria and Albert Museum, in London, England, and the Corning Museum of Glass, in Corning, N.Y. She is senior lecturer, and was head of the glass course, at the Bezalel Academy of Arts and Design in Jerusalem between 2005 and 2011. Working methods Described as \\"a poetess in glass,\\" Kaffeman's work deals with social and political processes in Israel using several layers‚Äîtexts that refer to events in the country and images of local flora and fauna‚Äîthrough which she addresses themes such as identity and immigration. Using lamp working techniques, she has been building a botanical collection made of glass. Each work, whether of plants or insects, is informed by personal observation of the local environment through a cultural and an iconographic interpretation. In recent years, research processes, including drawing on paper, have become an integral part of her exhibitions. Embroidery plays a significant role in the work, serving as a platform for the text on which the work is based, and enabling collaboration with a varied range of populations. The catalogue of the winners of the 2011 Israeli Minister of Culture prizes describes Kaffeman's work as: \\"Using a botanic lexicon that reaches into cultural practices of commemoration, sacrifice and mourning, the artist blends local values in meticulously crafted glass and embroidery work.\\" Davira Taraqin writes of her work: > Since 2002, Kaffeman's increasingly transparent statements, first on > politics and now on social issues, have taken two distinct directions. The > plant and animal forms that comprise such series as 'Tactual Stimulation' > and 'Wolves' are fabricated primarily from flame-worked glass.

It is located about fifty kilometers south of Paris in the village of Milly-la-For√™t in the Essonne Department of France. The 16th century house was originally part of the domain of a 13th-century chateau whose moat and a ruined tower are next to the house. The house also has gardens and a small wooded park. The house now displays furnished rooms and a museum of his work. The tomb of Cocteau, decorated with his work, is found in a small chapel, Saint Blaise des Simples, at the edge of town not from the house. The house facade and roof were listed in the supplemental inventory of historic monuments in 1969.Sanson, Maison Jean Cocteau, Somogy √©ditions d'art, (2010), page 7 History The house was originally constructed during the reign of Henry IV of France and a clerical residence, with twelve rooms, adjacent to the Chateau of Milly-la-For√™t. The house adjoins the walls and moat of the 13th century chateau. In 1947, at a time when his fame and fortune had been greatly increased by the enormous success of his film Beauty and The Beast, Cocteau and his frequent companion of the time, the film actor Jean Marais, purchased part of the domain of the chateau, including the house, garden and part of the woods, and used it as a retreat from his residence on Rue Montpensier in Paris. Cocteau stayed there on occasion during his early years of ownership, but when he entered a relationship with Edouard Dermit he stayed there for longer periods of time, and created many of his later works there. Cocteau died on October 11, 1963 at the age of 73 years, and was buried in the Chapel of Saint-Blaise-des Simples nearby, which he had decorated. Dermit inherited the house and the works of art it contained and kept them until his own death in 1995, after which his son St√©phane became owner of the house. In 2002 the businessman and philanthropist Pierre Berg√© purchased the house, with the assistance of the Regional Council of the Essone and the French Ministry of Culture, and began an extensive campaign of restoration between 2005 and 2010.

The Red Rose by Violet Oakley The Red Rose Girls were a group of female artists from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, active in the early 1900s. The work of the three working artists in the group, Violet Oakley, Jessie Willcox Smith, and Elizabeth Shippen Green, was supported by Henrietta Cozens, who took on the responsibility of managing their communal household. They rented the Red Rose Inn in Villanova, Pennsylvania, in Mainline Philadelphia from 1901-1906, before moving to Cogslea in Mount Airy, Philadelphia from 1906-1911. The Red Rose Girls were given their nickname by Howard Pyle, who taught the three artists in his first illustration class at Drexel Institute. Prolific and highly successful as artists, the Red Rose Girls were exemplars of the artistic style of Romantic realism. They helped to establish Philadelphia as a national center for book and magazine illustration. Their unconventional life style as a group of young female artists living together received criticism at the time but also demonstrated that women could become successful professional artists, serving as a model for later women.  Young Female Artist Group  The three girls' choice to live together on an inn and studio in the suburb of Philadelphia was a bold act in the 1910s, consistent with the feminist ideal of the ‚ÄúNew Woman‚Äù. The Red Rose girls received several criticisms for their \\"untraditional\\" living arrangements. Their formation of a close familial group for mutual support was influenced in part by Howard Pyle's outspoken opinion that once a woman married \\"that was the end of her\\" professionally. Pyle was not the only person to emphasize the difficulty, for a woman, of managing both family and professional commitments. Anna Lea Merritt, a member of The Plastic Club, wrote in Lippincott's Magazine, that \\"The chief obstacle to a woman's success is that she can never have a wife... It is exceedingly difficult to be an artist without this time-saving help.\\" Alice Carter, author of The Red Rose Girls: An Uncommon Story of Art and Love describes their work and relationships in detail. The activities of Henrietta Cozens, who took on the role of \\"wife\\" in the day-to-day management of the household, were both important and recognized by the other members of the group. Throughout their years together the four women formed intimate bonds of friendship and love and enriched each other's professional lives by sharing ideas and inspiration. The group disbanded in 1911 after Elizabeth Shippen Green married following a seven year engagement.  Romantic Realism and Pre-War Era  According to Dr. Mark Sullivan, PhD in the Art History Department at Bryn Mawr College and professor of Art History at Villanova University, the artistic style of the ‚ÄúRed Rose Girls‚Äù could be categorized as ‚Äúromantic realism,‚Äù a combination of Romanticism and Realism, two popular art styles in the end of 19th century and at the beginning of 20th century. The Red Rose Girls could be said to represent one of the peaks of the artistic style of Romantic realism, although the popularity of the style declined in American High Art circles after the group was active, due to the dominance of Abstract Expressionism in the Post War era.

The Culture of Tirana concerns the arts, music, museums, festivals and other entertainment in the capital city of Albania. Tirana is one of the country's leading business and cultural centers including entertainment, music, media, fashion, and the arts all contribute to its status as Albania's largest city.  Architecture  Two architects of the Benito Mussolini period in Italy, designed the city plan in Neo-Renaissance style with articulate angular solutions and giant order fascias. Tirana is home to different architectural styles that represent influential periods in its history dating back to the antiquity. The architecture of Tirana as the capital of Albania, was marked by two totalitarian regimes, by the fascist regime of Benito Mussolini during World War II and the communist regime. Both have left their mark on the city with their typical architecture. In addition to the objects of the architecture of the totalitarian regimes of 20th century, Tirana offers a couple of other such objects of both periods. The Palace of Brigades (former Palace of the Albania's King Zog I), the ministries buildings, the government building and the municipality hall are designed by Florestano Di Fausto and Armando Brasini, both well-known architects of the Mussolini period in Italy. The D√´shmor√´t e Kombit Boulevard was built in 1930 and given the name King Zog I Boulevard. In the communist period, the part from Skanderbeg Square up to the train station was named Stalin Boulevard. The Royal Palace or Palace of Brigades previously served as the official residence of King Zog I. It has been used by different Albanian governments for various purposes. Because of the outbreak of World War II, and the 1939 Italian invasion of Albania, King Zog I fled Albania and never had a chance to see the Palace fully constructed. The Italians finished it and used it as the Army Headquarters. The Palace took its nickname Palace of Brigades because it was taken from the Italians by a people army brigade.  Museums  National Art Gallery. Tirana's museums and monuments are among its most highly esteemed attractions. The National Historical Museum is the largest Museum in the country and details the history of the country. It was opened on 28 October 1981 and is in size, while are available for exhibitions.

The National Archaeological Museum is the national archaeological museum is the first museum created after World War II in Albania. The National Art Gallery opened to the public on 11 January 1954. The museum preserves over 5000 artworks. The Natural Sciences Museum was founded in 1948 is affiliated with the University of Tirana and has branches in zoology, botany and geology. The former Enver Hoxha Museum is a pyramid- shaped structure dedicated to the communist dictator Enver Hoxha. It served as a museum about his legacy, but after the Fall of communism in Albania, it became a conference center and exhibition venue.

Biography  He was born in Damascus in 1934, the son of Theodoros Katinis and Despina Peridakis. His father's work as a Greek engineer who built roads in the Middle East, meant that his family moved a lot. = The Middle East = He attended the French private school ‚ÄúFr√®res Lazaristes‚Äù in Damascus, and spent long periods in Jerusalem, Cairo and Amman. In Damascus, Kattinis took an active part in the cultural and intellectual life of the time. He was strongly attracted by the Archeological Museum of Damascus and Palmira, full of Mesopotamian, Greek and Roman Art, from which he absorbed much of his inspiration and imagination for his work. The town of Deir-el-zor near the Euphrates and Maalula were a source of stimulation for his artistic life. The sky of the desert and the white and terracotta colors of Maalula strongly attracted him and affected his way of painting. In 1957 he was invited by the Egyptian Cultural Center of Damascus [1] for his first exhibition. In 1961 the Modern Art Gallery in Damascus invited him to exhibit his work at the Salon National de Printemps and Salon d‚ÄôAutomne, where he could display the variety of forms and techniques he had long experimented. = Europe = In 1961 Kattinis decided to leave the Middle East to go to Europe, willing to join in the exciting cultural events which were happening in Europe during the 60s. He settled in Rome, the town that mostly suited his idea of beauty, and here he attended the Academy of Fine Arts, where he met and made friends with his teachers, the very famous painters Mario Mafai, Nino Maccari and Giuseppe Canali, and in 1964 got his Diploma in Fine Arts. In the same year he took part in the XXXII International Venice Biennal of Art with his abstract painting [2], extremely in vogue during that time in Italy. During the long periods spent in several European towns such as Paris, Athens, Vienna, Gen√®ve, Munich, Innsbruck, he visited their museums and came into contact with the cultural life of other countries. All this strongly affected him, causing a more independent turn of his painting into a personal sort of expressionism. He went back to the Middle East in 1965, invited by the French Cultural Center in Amman (Jordan) for a solo exhibition [3] and, in Beirut (Lebanon), for a solo exhibition at the Amateur d‚ÄôArt gallery. In addition, the Sursock Museum of Beirut invited him for a group exhibition [4] where he had an opportunity to meet and confront artists of different countries. A year spent in Innsbruck (Austria) (1967‚Äì68), surrounded by the beauty of the white mountains that strongly inspired him, gave way to a new phase of his art, where symbolism and expressionism merge into strongly colored images of landscapes and human beings. During this year Kattinis was invited for a solo show at the Zentrun 107 gallery in Innsbruck and at the Schuhmacher gallery in Munich(Germany). [ 5] The two exhibitions were extremely successful. Captured by Kattinis‚Äô way of painting, Hans Lang Beton Firm in Innsbruck commissioned him a large, oil painting on plywood [6] On this occasion Professor Heinz von Mackovitz wrote of him ‚Äú ‚Ä¶Kattinis‚Äô colors light up and shine with a brightness full of tension, without becoming violent, so that Kattinis‚Äô painting arouses in the spectators a feeling of perpetual forces...‚Äù [7] =Italy and Rome= When he went back to Italy, Kattinis set up his studio in Trastevere Rome, where, in 1969, the Poliedro gallery invited him for a solo exhibition which was introduced by writings of the famous poets, writers and journalists Leonardo Sinisgalli, Ugo Mannoni , Renato Civello and Giancarlo Fusco. It was an extremely lively time in Rome, one of the European cinema‚Äôs most fertile periods, when many artists from all over the world lived and worked in Trastevere and Via Margutta. The American psychologist Giorgina Nathan Burdett got interested in his work and organized an exhibition in her studio. John Hart of the Daily American wrote: ‚Äú... Kattinis has limitless imagination and prolific technical command, which lets him treat solemn themes with seemingly irreverent levity...‚Äù [8] In 1972 Kattinis was invited at the famous Museum Palazzo Braschi of Rome, for a solo exhibition of his paintings, where the figure of man, fixed out of his temporal significance, becomes a dominant theme of his work. The art critic Rolando Meconi curated the catalog and the issuing of Kattinis‚Äô first album of handmade linoleum etchings in relief ‚ÄúVasi Antichi‚Äú [9] In the following year appeared his beautiful album of 6 handmade linoleum etchings ‚ÄúGLI ASTRONAUTI‚Äù edited by IL Poliedro and accompanied by an introduction of Leonardo Sinisgalli [10] and writings of Sandra Giannattasio, Pietro Bianchi, Heinz Von Mackowitz. In 1977 the Greek government organized a retrospective of his work at the Municipal Theatre (Dimotik√≤ Th√®atro) of Piraeus- Athens (Greece), and later on at Kyklos Gallery in Thessaloniki (Greece). Curator: the Greek art critic Eleni Gyzi, with articles on the Greek art magazine Kaleidoscope and Greek newspapers.[11] In Italy he was commissioned an oil painting on iron for one of the twelve doors of the old stadium by the Municipality of Bari and the Greek Embassy of Rome(1997) [12] In 2002 Kattinis was invited by The Municipality of Pisa ‚Äì for an exhibition entitled ‚ÄùCantami o Diva‚Äù held in Santacroce in Fossabanda in Pisa and in Montecatini (Italy).

The building on the left is 17 State Street; between the two tall buildings can be seen at street level the red- brick James Watson House and the Church of Our Lady of the Rosary (the Shrine of St. Elizabeth Ann Bayley Seton) State Street is a short street in the Financial District of Manhattan, New York City. It runs from west Whitehall Street as a continuation of Water Street, then turns north at Battery Park to become its eastern border. Passing Pearl and Bridge Streets, it terminates at the northeast corner of the park, at Bowling Green, where the roadway continues north as Broadway and west as Battery Place. State Street approximates the original waterline of the island before landfill expanded it.  History  According to the Castello Plan of 1660, the original fort built by Dutch settlers for New Amsterdam, Fort Amsterdam, was located where State Street is now. In 1790, the State House or Government House was built on the site of the fort. The street was originally called \\"Copsey Street\\" after the Native American village of Kopsee, which had been located nearby. It was renamed by the Common Council after the State House in 1793 or 1795, at which time it was one of the city's most desirable residential areas, a status it held until after the Civil War. Around 1808, Robert Fulton bought a mansion on State Street at the corner of Marketfield Street, which was near the current location of Bowling Green. Later, in 1819, Herman Melville was born in a house on or near 15 State Street. One of the row of stately town houses lining the Battery on State Street was the James Watson House, built in 1793 at 7 State Street, which was 6 State Street at the time. The mansions had unobstructed views of New York Harbor. The Watson House is the last remaining house on the street from that era.New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission (November 23, 1965) \\"James Watson House Designation Report\\" The former James Watson House (right) and the Shrine of St. Elizabeth Ann Bayley Seton (left) on State Street In 1883, the James Watson House became the Mission of Our Lady of the Rosary, which saw after the care of Irish immigrant girls, along with 8 State Street next door. By the early sixties, both buildings were in disrepair. 8 State Street was torn down, and replaced in 1964 by the Church of Our Lady of Rosary, designed by Shanley & Sturgis; while the former Watson house was gutted to become the rectory for the church. Today both are part of the Shrine of St. Elizabeth Ann Bayley Seton, the first American-born saint. Seton had lived at 8 State Street from 1801-03, after her family's bankruptcy forced them to move from their home on Stone Street.\\"Our Lady of the Rosary\\" St. Peter-Our Lady of the Rosary Roman Catholic Parish website From 1901 to 1907, Cass Gilbert's extravagantly-designed Alexander Hamilton U.S. Custom House was constructed at the northern end of the street, adjacent to Bowling Green.New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission (October 14, 1965) \\"United States Custom House Designation Report\\" At around the same time as the Custom House was being built, the Seaman's Church Institute was constructing a 13-story headquarters building, including a chapel, at 7 State Street, designed by Warren & Wetmore. The building, which began construction in 1906, had in addition a lecture hall, a reading room, a bank, a school for merchant marines, and an employment bureau, all for the use of sailors. A hotel in the building could, after the building of an annex in 1929, sleep 1,614 men. The corner turret of the building featured a lighthouse with a range of 12 miles, which was a memorial to the dead of the Titanic disaster. The institute moved to 15 State Street in 1968, to a 23-story red-brick building designed by Eggers & Higgins which featured a rounded prow with a cross that spanned the building's entire height. The Institute moved out of this building in 1991. The lighthouse from the earlier building was salvaged and stands in the South Street Seaport. On the site of the second Seaman's Church Institute building is 17 State Street, built in 1987-89 and designed by Emery Roth and Sons, a 41-floor, office building with a curved curtain wall facade that, according to the AIA Guide to New York City, forms a \\"sleek columnar mirror\\". The building is one of a number of tall office buildings which now populate the street. The New Amsterdam Plein and Pavilion, in Peter Minuit Plaza on State Street at the intersection of Whitehall Street, was a gift from the Netherlands to New York City to commemorate the 400th Anniversary in 2009 of Henry Hudson's arrival in New York Harbor. The pavilion, in the shape of a flower, was designed by the Dutch architects Ben van Berkel and Caroline Bos, and features radiating bars of LEDs; it is both a caf√© and a visitors center. The stone plaza is a landscaped platform (\\"plein\\" in Dutch) with benches of modern design, walkways with engraved passages from Russell Shorto's The Island at the Center of the World, about the founding of Manhattan, and a map of the Castello Plan of New Amsterdam from 1660, carved in stone.Hill, John (2011) Guide to Contemporary New York City Architecture.

Founded by Austin-based promotions company Margin Walker Presents and produced by Funhouse Services and Sound on Sound Event Services, SOS Fest was home to three music stages showcasing emerging and established talent from the worlds of indie, punk, hip hop, metal, and dance music, as well as comedy. Created by Graham Williams and much of the same team behind the long-running Fun Fun Fun Fest, SOS Fest aimed to bring the same Austin-centric culture to the forest by including many local businesses, food trucks, restaurants and nonprofits as official vendors of the fest. With a fan focus, SOS took the festival beyond the music with a comedy and live-panel discussion stage, a skateboard and BMX halfpipe, a wrestling ring, a disco dungeon, and 15 acres of camping. The festival also incorporated the renaissance theme of Sherwood Forest Faire into the daily fest activities with period actors roaming the grounds, jousting, turkey legs, and SOS Fest's own fire-breathing dragon that lives at the top of the main stage.

Erle's service to King Edward VI, Queen Mary and Queen Elizabeth is mentioned by Pole, whose sister married Erle's son, and who therefore appears to have particular authority (1547-1553) and two daughters, Queen Mary I (1553-1558) and Queen Elizabeth I (1558-1603) during their successive reigns. According to Sandon (1983) his popularity as a royal courtier was in part due to his ability as a musician, particularly as a player of the virginal. He is known to have composed at least one work of church music, namely Ave Vulnus Lateris (\\"Hail, O Wound of the Side\\"), a short votive antiphon in honour of one of the Five Holy Wounds of Jesus,\\"shows fluency and an understanding of the vocal medium; it may have been sung by a small group of chamber singers rather than by a larger ecclesiastical choir\\" (Sandon, Nick, (Ed.), \\"Hedley, Edward: Terrenum Sitiens Regnum; Erle, Walter: Ave Vulnus Lateris\\", Royal School of Church Music, RCM 112 his authorship of which is recorded in Peterhouse College manuscripts 471‚Äì474, held in the Cambridge University Library, comprising four partbooks from a set of five copied late in the reign of King Henry VIII, which contain seventy-two pieces of Latin church music.Sandon, Chapter III, Volume I, pp.86-96 As a courtier- musician he well represents the ideal royal courtier described in The Courtier by Baldassare Castiglione (d.1529) and also in The Boke Named The Governour by Sir Thomas Elyot (d.1546).Sandon, p.95 Although he was born into a minor gentry family of Devonshire, he founded a dynasty of substantial landed gentry that survives to the present day, his heir (albeit via several female lines) being the Conservative Member of Parliament Richard Grosvenor Plunkett-Ernle- Erle-Drax (born 1958), of Charborough House. Origins No record of Erle's birth survives, but circumstantial evidence suggests a birthdate between 1515 and 1520.Sandon, Chapter III, Volume I, p.87 He was the son of John III Erle of Cullompton in Devon, by his wife Thomasyn. Walter's grandfather was John II Erle of Cullompton, the second son of John I Erle of Ashburton, Devon. Career as courtier =King Henry VIII= The earliest surviving document which mention Walter Erle is a list which appears to date from 1537‚Äì47,Sandon, p.87: \\"The last decade of the reign of King Henry VIII\\"; and: \\"Assuming that the list was drawn up in full knowledge of current events, we can probably date it to the six weeks between 11 November 1541, when the privy council communicated to Cranmer the king‚Äôs decision about Catherine‚Äôs immediate future, and 22 December, when a royal proclamation depriving her of the title of queen was made at Hampton Court\\" entitled The booke of Certayne of the Quenys Ordynary as yet to no place Appoynted, a list of 127 above-stairs members of a queen's existing household whose appointment to new positions is envisaged but not completed, in which Erle is named last among three Pagis of the Chamber Ordynary. Sandon deduced the queen in question to be Catherine Howard (beheaded 1542),Sandon, p.87: \\"The membership of the higher ranks of the household named in the list shows such a strong Howard affinity that it is difficult to believe that the household is not that of Catherine\\" the 5th wife of Henry VIII. Erle was thus a page in her service at the time of her downfall in November 1541 due to adultery. Erle however retained a position at court after Catherine's execution, having been transferred to the household of Edward Seymour, Earl of Hertford (later 1st Duke of Somerset), the eldest brother of Queen Jane Seymour (d.1537), the third wife of Henry VIII, and the future Lord Protector of England from 1547 until 1549 during the minority of his nephew, King Edward VI (1547-1553). Erle is mentioned in Hertford's household accounts drawn up by his steward John Thynne,Sandon, p.87 including on 30 June 1542 a payment of 40 shillings to Water Erley by my lady's comandement for a payre of virginalls, the lady in question being Anne Stanhope, Hertford's second wife. According to Sandon this reference to Erle is highly significant for several reasons, namely:Sandon, p.88 it is the earliest dated reference to Erle in the orbit of the royal household; it is the earliest to link him with the Seymour family; it is‚Äîby several decades‚Äîthe earliest to place him explicitly in a musical context and to associate him with a keyboard instrument; and it is the only known reference that spells his name in a manner identical with one of the spellings in the Peterhouse College manuscripts, in which his musical work Ave Vulnus Lateris is recorded. Erle's continuing presence at court is suggested by a payment of 40 shillings received by him in April 1543 from Princess Mary (eldest daughter of Henry VIII, later Queen Mary), after which the records concerning him are silent for several months. Erle returned to the inner circle of the royal court following the 6th and last marriage of Henry VIII to Catherine Parr (d.1548) on 12 July 1543, and became a Gentleman Waiter to that queen, as is evident from the final entry in a mid-1540s list of additions to the royal household's expenditure: :Item, yt ye 2nd day of November in ye 35th yeare (i.e. of his reign, 1543), ye Kings pleasure was declared by ye mouth of Mr Herbert,Sandon, p.88, note 64: \\"probably William Herbert\\" (in 1551 created 1st Earl of Pembroke) \\"husband of Catherine‚Äôs sister Anne Parr and himself a gentleman of the king‚Äôs privy chamber\\" yt Walter Earle shoud yearly have ye Wages of ¬£ x in lieu of a Gent Wayter to ye Queens Grace. =King Edward VI= Following the death of King Henry VIII in 1547, Erle's career at court depended on Queen Catherine Parr (d.1548), the king's widow. He became a member of her household, apparently due to his connection with the Seymour family, when three months after the king's death she remarried to Thomas Seymour, 1st Baron Seymour of Sudeley (d.1549), Lord Admiral of England, the younger brother of Queen Jane Seymour, an uncle of King Edward VI and brother of Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset (d.1552), Lord Protector of England. As former fellow courtiers to Henry VIII, Thomas Seymour was well-acquainted with Erle, whom he referred to in a letter to his wife as \\"my old friend\\".Sandon, p.90 Furthermore, in 1544 Thomas Seymour had purchased from Erle various of the latter's speculative acquisitions of former monastic lands. Erle also had business dealings with the Lord Protector, from whom in 1548 he purchased a twenty-one-year lease on property in Ottery St Mary, Devon, including \\"the Warden's House\\" of the dissolved college there. Following the death of his wife in 1548, and released from her restraining influence, Thomas Parr's \\"imprudence and recklessness now became increasingly manifest\\", and Erle became caught up in his master's ambitious scheme of personal aggrandisement, which involved seizing control of his nephew the king. In 1548 Thomas Seymour offered to Princess Mary, King Edward VI's eldest sister, the services of Erle to provide lessons on the virginal, and shortly afterwards Erle passed her a compromising letter from Thomas Seymour, which eventually was discovered and assisted in providing evidence of the latter's plot in 1549 against the young king, for which he was executed soon after. Erle's role in the conspiracy was wholly innocent and he suffered no penalty; however, he had lost his patron and was absent from court circles for another two years. During this period he appears to have resided at Colcombe House in Colyton, Devon, in which parish on 22 October 1549 he married Mary Wyke.Sandon, p.91 On 9 April 1551, with effect from the previous Christmas, he was appointed a Groom of the Privy Chamber to King Edward VI, at a yearly salary of ¬£20. This was thus his first position as a direct servant of a monarch. Shortly afterwards he received various royal grants of land, including in 1552 the manor and advowson of Axmouth (in which parish was situated his wife's inheritance of Bindon), for an annual rent of ¬£53 13s. 6d, formerly part of the dower lands of Catherine Parr. In 1553 he was granted the reversion of the leaseholds of various ex-monastic property in Devon, including part of Dunkeswell Abbey. =Queen Mary I= On the accession of Queen Mary I in 1553, Erle retained a position as a servant of the Privy Chamber, although his exact role is unclear. This is evidenced by his inclusion on several livery lists allocating clothing to courtiers of the queen. The earliest such list including his name is dated 4 November 1553, and is \\"signed by the Queen's hand\\", as follows: :\\"We woll and Commaunde youe that Imediatly upon the syghte hereof ye deliver or cause to be delivered yerely unto our welbelovede Servvante Walter Earle oon of our prevye Chambre theise percelles Folowinge That is to saye: fourtene yardes of good blacke velvett; fourtene yardes of good blacke Damaske or Satten to make him a gowne, Coate and doblett; oon Furre of very good booge (i.e. budge, lamb's skin) for the sayde Gowne price eyghte powndes; twoo yardes d‚Äô (i.e.and a half) of fyne Marble Clothe to make him a winter Cooate; two yardes d‚Äô of Russett velvett to garde the sayde Cooate; two yardes d‚Äô of fyne grene clothe to make him a Sommer Cooate; two yardes d‚Äô of good grene velvett to garde the sayde Cooate, withe makinge lyninge, sylke buttons and all other necessarie thinges to the sayde gowne, Cooate, doblett, furre and all other the premises in enywyse belonginge or apperteining. And theise our lettres shalbe youre sufficiente warraunte and dischardge in that behalff. Yeven undre our Signett at our palaice of Westminster the fowerthe daye of Novembre in the furste yere of our Reigne\\". In about 1554 Erle was promoted to the position of a Gentleman of the Privy Chamber.Sandon, p.93 on New Year's Day 1556 Erle made a gift to Queen Mary of \\"a booke covered with blacke vellat of the Comentary of Warre, in Englishe\\". On 3 July 1558 he was granted a licence to export English wheat to Spain. =Queen Elizabeth I and retirement= Following the death of Queen Mary in 1558, Erle now aged in his late-thirties, appears to have retired from court to concentrate on expanding and consolidating his landholdings in Devon and Dorset. His name does not appear in the lists of active servants of the next monarch Queen Elizabeth I (1558-1603), although he is still referred to as late as 1578 as \\"of the Queen‚Äôs privy chamber\\", perhaps in title only. Career as musician Little is known concerning Erle's career as a musician, an unusual career for a member of the landed gentry at that period. Indeed, Sandon states: \\"One might doubt that the connection between him and the composer of Ave Vulnus Lateris was anything more than a coincidence of names\\". It is clear that Erle was primarily a courtier and secondly a musician, unlike for example Philip van Wilder (1500-1554), a Flemish lutenist and composer who worked as a court musician circa 1520s-1550s, and then became a Gentleman of the Privy Chamber, and who is referred to in royal household accounts primarily as a musician. As Sandon (1983) states: \\"Where(as) van Wilder deserved his position by virtue of his musical ability, Erle deserved his by his status and upbringing, his musical skill being a useful adjunct\\". However four pieces of evidence are given by Sandon which serve to confirm the courtier Walter Erle as a musician:Sandon, p.94 *A payment to him made in June 1542 by Edward Seymour for a pair of virginals. However, this was not unusual as a similar payment is recorded as having been made to the courtier Hugh Denys (c.1440-1511), who is not supposed to have been a musician. Money is recorded having been paid in August 1502 by Elizabeth of York, Queen of Henry VII, to Hugh Denys, reimbursing him for paying a deliveryman, or possibly their maker come in person, for a pair of clavichords, a form of virginal, thought to be amongst the earliest imported into England.Musical Times 1/6/1893, p.331. The transaction is recorded in the Privy Purse expenses of Elizabeth of York, August 1502: \\"Item, the same day, Hugh Denys, for money by him delivered to a stranger (i.e. foreigner) that gave the Queen a payre of clavycordes. In crowns for his reward, iiii libres\\" (¬£4). The reward was four times greater than the estimated value of the gift, perhaps signifying the royal mark of approval and appreciation of the maker's generosity.Brinsmead, Edgar. The History of the Pianoforte. 1876 As Alison Weir wrote of King Henry VIII \\"It was common for subjects to bring gifts to royalty in the expectation of a reward and such largesse or tipping was expected of a monarch\\".Weir, Alison. Henry VIII King and Court. London, 2001. p.23. *A note in \\"a collection of vocal music copied in 1742 by John Immyns, founder of the Madrigal Society, where folio 1 recto is annotated The following Seven from a Manuscript written in ye year 1551 and wch belonged to Walterus Erle one of the Gentlemen of ye Bedchamber to K. Henry ye 8th\\".(Sandon) *\\"A pavan ascribed to Erle in several later sources of keyboard music\\" (Sandon), namely: entitled \\"Walter Earles Pavan\\" in the FitzWilliam Virginal Book (341/2‚Äì343/1); \\"Maister Earles Pavane\\" in Anthony Holborne's The Cittharn Schoole (London, 1597), H1v‚ÄìH2r; and \\"Walter Erles Paven\\" in Cul, ms Dd.4.23, ff. 2‚Äì3.Sandon, p.94, note 103 *\\"The record of a later court appointment: Virginalls Orlando Gibbons to attend in His Highnesses Privy Chamber which was heretofore supplied by Walter Earle deceased at ¬£46 per annum from Michaelmas 1619\\". (Sandon). Sandon concludes, concerning the career of Erle: :\\"It appears, then, that whatever may have been the other qualities - gentle birth, influential connections, a pleasing countenance, an engaging manner, a quick wit - that helped to gain for Erle his admission to the Privy Chamber, the attribute that kept him there and assured his success was his musical ability. He was lucky that Henry VIII and his daughters were so fond of music and so generous in their patronage of it. A significant part of Erle‚Äôs contribution to the life of the royal household must have been musical, as a solo keyboard player, a participant in instrumental and vocal consorts, and a composer\\". Marriage and children In November 1546 \\"an official letter was written to one of Walter‚Äôs relations in support of his intention to marry\\". Sandon, p.89 This proposed wife appears to have been his cousin Nicola Erle.Identity of Nicola Erle uncertain. Sandon notes \\"Nicholoa, daughter and heir of Robert (rather than John) Erle of Ashburton three generations earlier\\", recorded in F. T. Colby, The Visitation of the County of Devon in the Year 1620 (London, 1872), p. 201 The letter is listed in the Letters and Papers of Henry VIII as: A let[ter] to Nicolas (sic) Erle doughter (sic) and heire to John Erle deceased in the favour of Walter Erle the quenes servant for mariage preferred by Mr Dennye.Sandon, Page 89, note 72, quoting \\"NA, SP4/1, no. 114\\" and \\"LPH8, vol. 21, part 2, item 475/114\\" 22 October 1549 at Colyton,Sandon, p.91, note 80: \\"Colyton parish register of marriages 1538‚Äì1753: 'Walter Erle of Colcome gentleman was weddid unto Marye Weekes one of the daughters and heyre of Byndon the xxij daye of Octobre'. W. Wykes-Finch, The Ancient Family of Wyke of North Wyke, Co. Devon, Transactions of the Devonshire Association, vol. 35 (1903), pp. 389‚Äì90, gives the date of the marriage as 22 October 1547, but the register places it definitely and unambiguously among the marriages solemnized during 1549\\" he married Mary Wyke, the third of four daughters and co-heiresses of Richard Wyke of Bindon in the parish of Axmouth, Devon, three miles south-east of Colcombe. Richard Wyke was a great-grandson of Roger Wyke (died c. 1467) (alias Wykes, Wycke, Wick, Wicks, Weeke, etc.), a Member of Parliament for Plympton Erle,The \\"Erle\\" in Plympton Erle refers to the Earl of Devon, lord of that manor, not to the Erle family Devon, in 1413, a younger son of William Wyke of North Wyke in the parish of South Tawton in Devon. Richard Wyke died without sons, leaving four daughters and co-heiresses. Mary's share of her paternal inheritance included Bindon and a moiety of her father's larger estate at Charborough in Dorset. Erle re-purchased the other moiety from Alice Wykes, Mary's elder sister, and made it his principal residence. By his wife he had children as follows: Effigy of Thomas Erle (d.1597) of Charborough. St Mary's Church, Morden, Dorset *Thomas Erle (d.1597), eldest son, whose large effigy dressed in full-armour and kneeling on one knee in prayer, survives (re-positioned) in St Mary's Church, Morden, Dorset, the parish church of Charborough House. In 1581 at Shute in Devon, he married Dorothy Pole, a daughter of his father's near neighbour William Pole (1515‚Äì1587), Esquire, MP, of Shute House in the parish of Shute, near Colyton, Devon. Dorothy's brother was the Devon antiquary and historian Sir William Pole (1561‚Äì1635) whose principal seat was Colcombe House in the parish of Colyton, the former residence of Walter Erle of which mansion house and deerpark a lease had been granted to him by the Queen Catherine Parr.

Landholdings *Colcombe, Colyton. On 2 November 1543, the day on which he was appointed a Gentleman Waiter to Queen Catherine Parr, he was appointed by letters patent keeper of the park and mansion of Colcombe, in the parish of Colyton in Devon, and bailiff and hayward of the manor and hundred of Colyton. Colcombe had been a seat of Henry Courtenay, 1st Marquess of Exeter, 2nd Earl of Devon (executed 1539), which he forfeited following his attainder in 1538. Courtenay had commenced building a grand mansion at Colcombe, which was never completed by him. This confiscated estate and offices were given by King Henry VIII to his new wife Catherine Parr as part of her marriage settlement, and she was thus free to dispose of it as she wished. The grant to Erle was backdated to the previous Michaelmas, with fees of 52 shillings per annum as bailiff and hayward and 2 pence per day as keeper. On 1 July 1546 the queen transformed the grant to Erle into a 40-year lease, free of rent, which however required Erle to surrender the keepership and to provide 26\\"vixx\\", 26 (?) deer from the park for the queen. The grant was as follows: :Walter Erle to have the commoditie of the grounde and lodge within the parc of Colcombe for xlti yeres rent free in recompence of his office and fee wch he hadd thereof, reserving alwais at his own chardge certain haie and vixx dere for your mai'ties use.

Like many of his contemporary courtiers, Erle used his privileged position to acquire at advantageous prices former monastic lands following the Dissolution of the Monasteries. In September 1544 with two associates, Thomas Strowde and James Paget, he invested the enormous sum of ¬£2,875 12 shillings 3 pence in purchasing (via the Court of Augmentations) various westcountry estates, which, as was commonly done, he almost immediately re-sold at a profit, having obtained from the king the requisite licences to alienate.Sandon, p.89.

In his will was dated 4 January 1581 he bequeathed to his wife Mary ¬£20 in cash, the income from the manor and parsonage of Axmouth, the income from four hundred sheep, six cows, six bullocks and six calves, and the use of the house at Bindon and its contents during her life. The reversion of these properties and all his other assets and lands, including Charborough and the contents of his house, he left to his eldest son Thomas Erle, whom he required to pay the sum of ¬£400 each to his two unmarried sisters Bridget and Mary, towards their marriage or maintenance. To the parishes of Morden and Axmouth he left 40 shillings each, for the upkeep of the poor. The executor of his will was his son Thomas.

History Originally just 'St Teilo's', the church was one of several (of numerous denominations) built in Cathays in the opening decades of the 20th century with the intent of servicing the large numbers of working people in the growing district. The Cathays Methodist Church, Woodville Baptist Church and Cardiff International Church are all nearby. The church began life as a tin tabernacle in 1879. This structure, built to serve the large numbers of railroad workers who lived in the district, was enlarged in 1885.Rose, J. 2013. Cardiff Churches through Time Amberley. 2013. p. 30. . St Teilo's was formed as a separate parish, together with St Andrew's Church, St Andrew's Crescent, in 1884.Rose, J. 2013. Cardiff Churches through Time Amberley. 2013. p. 83. . Work began on the permanent church in 1895, with ¬£3000 being contributed to the project by the Mackintosh of Mackintosh. The aisles and nave were dedicated in 1897. The chancel was added in 1901. The architect's original plans had included a grand tower of similar dimensions to that of St John's in Cardiff city centre. The tower was begun in 1913 (a lady chapel being installed at the same time), but the plans proved overambitious, and only the lowermost portion of the tower was ever built ‚Äî which does not even stretch above the roof of the nave. The reredos was installed by John Coates Carter in 1924. The church became Grade II listed in 1975. The west window of the nave, which dates from 1919, is the largest in the Diocese of Llandaff. In 1954 St Andrew's Church closed (later reconsecrated as Dewi Sant) and the congregation joined with St Teilo's. St Michael & All Angels, Cathays The church is now in the Parish of Cathays, formed in 2007. Also placed in the new parish was the nearby church of St Michael & All Angels. This was erected on Whitchurch Road in 1922 as the successor to the combined school and chapel dedicated to St Monica which had opened in 1893. The 1922 structure was a tin tabernacle, which lasted in use until the 1990s. In 1995, a development partner was found and the church moved to a new building located on the corner of Whitchurch Road and Gelligaer Street, directly beside its former location, which is now occupied by a block of retirement flats.

After the ceremony a wedding lunch was served and a short reception held, after which Mr. and Mrs. Knowlton took the 5.37 train for Montreal. On their return they will reside at 58 Myrtle St., and will receive friends.\\" Career An accomplished artist and craftswoman, Knowlton was appointed to the Currier Gallery of Art Board of Trusttes and tasked with researching art museum buildings in order to guide the design of the Currier's new building, designed by Edward L. Tilton in 1927.

In total, 104 people died in the accident, including 87 on the ground.  Aircraft involved  = Vickers Viscount = Middle East Airlines Flight 265 was a passenger flight en route to Ankara from Cyprus, carrying eleven passengers and three crew. The aircraft involved was a Vickers 754D Viscount, registered OD-ADE and owned by Middle East Airlines. The aircraft involved was initially registered G-APCE, ordered by the British Overseas Airways Corporation. The plane was initially planned to be transferred to one of the subsidiary airlines of BOAC - Lebanese Middle East Airlines (MEA), but in April 1957 it was decided to be sent to another ‚Äî Cyprus Airways, where it was to serve the London-Cyprus route. The final assembly of the airliner did not start until 11 June, and in September it was finally finished, painted in the livery of Cyprus Airways and given the name \\"Buffavento\\". However, by that time the flight from Cyprus to London was already served by British European Airways, so Cyprus Airways found it unnecessary; hence on October 31, 1957 the plane was re-registered, giving it the new registration OD-ADE and on November 24, it finally made his first flight. On December 12, OD-ADE was transferred to the initial customer ‚Äî MEA. At the time of the accident, the aircraft had 13,187 flight hours and 5,515 pressurization cycles. The crew on board the fatal flight consisted of two pilots and one flight attendant: * The captain, 29, had a pilot's license that was valid until 30 May 1963. In August 1962, he was certified to serve as a captain on the Vickers Viscount; having a total of 2,925 flight hours on the Viscount. * The first officer, 38, had a pilot's license that was valid until 17 May 1963. In June 1960, he was certified to serve as a captain on the Vickers Viscount; having a total of 4,200 flight hours on the Viscount. = Turkish Air Force C-47 = The other aircraft involved in the accident was a Douglas C-47A Skytrain registered as CBK-28, belonging to the Turkish Air Force. The aircraft was built in 1944 and at the time of the accident it had 2340 flight hours. The crew consisted of two pilots, an instructor and a trainee, as well as a radio operator. The pilot-in command and instructor was 33 years old, had been a pilot since May 1955 and had a total of 1,452 hours flying time on the C-47. The pilot in training was 22 years old and had a pilot's license since July 1962; he had 36 hours flying time on the C-47. On the day of the accident, CBK-28 was carrying out a training flight, which departed from Etimesgut Air Base. The trainee was sitting in the left seat and wearing blue glasses. An orange plexiglass panel was placed in front of him on the left side of the windshield to prevent seeing outside as part of instrument training. The supervising instructor was on the right.  Accident  According to meteorological data, at 15:00 the sky over Ankara, clouds were present with a lower boundary of 3000 feet (910 m), visibility was 10-20 kilometers. The flights collided over Ankara at 7,000 feet in good weather. The C-47 departed Etimesgut at 11:22 GMT; the instrument training flight flew a route southeast of the Golbashi radio beacon for lasted an hour and a half, after which the pilots headed back to Etymesgut, following visual flight rules. The flight was intended to last 1 hour and 30 minutes. Flight 265 radioed Esenboƒüa at 13:04 GMT to inform air traffic control it would descend from flight level 185 to 105 and would pass Golbasi at 13:07. Flight 265 was given permission to descend to 6500 feet at 13:05. Air traffic control ordered Flight 265 to report when they began descent for landing on runway 03. The altimeter setting was 1015.5 mb. Flight 265 reported descending to 6,500 ft and would radio when reaching the Ankara beacon; it was descending from flight level 125 intended to radio when reaching flight level 105. At 13:07 GMT the aircraft reported altitude at flight level 100, and asked it they needed to enter a holding pattern; they had not checked in with Ankara air traffic control but would soon. The flight was 8,000 ft over the Ankara at 13:09 and continued descent to flight level 65. Air traffic control expected to hear from the plane again but never did; the controller made multiple attempts to contact the plane starting at 13:13 but never heard from the plane again. The Viscount, flying at a heading of 283¬∞, collided into the C-47 flying on a heading of 243¬∞, both at 7,000 feet. It was noted that the Viscount attempted to avoid crashing by pulling up but failed.  Causes  Investigation showed the aircraft collided at a 40¬∞ angle. Eyewitnesses to the collision reported that there were clouds where the planes collided. The ICAO laid blame on the Viscount pilot for: incorrectly estimating the distance between Golbasi and Ankara; failing to comply with international standards for radio communications; and failing to follow the flight plan by flying under VFR instead of planned IFR conditions.

His father died two years later and the family moved to Nottingham, where they lived with Bromley's maternal uncle, the architect and surveyor Frederick Bakewell. Bromley was educated in Nottingham, and then at Mr George Shipley's academy, a boarding school in Lincoln. In 1867 he was articled to his uncle but by 1871 he was back in Lincoln and working as an architect's clerk in Henry Goddard's architectural practice. Then from 1872 he spent the next 14 months travelling in Greece, Turkey and the United States. He returned to London and 1874 was working in the office of Charles Barry, junior. He then returned to Nottingham and 1875 he was taken into partnership with his uncle. Within two years Bakewell went into retirement. In 1886 he was elected FRIBA. He became principal architect to the Nottingham School Board and undertook several projects for the Nottingham and District Tramways Company. He was also architect to the National Telephone Company. In 1897 he was in partnership with Thomas Herbert Waumsley, and from 1912 with Harry Garnham Watkins as Bromley and Watkins. In 1904 Thomas Cecil Howitt, the future architect of the Council House and Council housing, joined Bromley's office as an apprentice, and from 1907 was his assistant.

A sketch of a relief from the Kumurdo Cathedral, c. 964. Gurandukht or Guarandukht (, fl. 960‚Äì999) was a queen of Kartli by marriage to Gurgen of Kartli, and regent during the minority of her son from 975. She was a daughter of King George II of Abkhazia and wife of the Bagratid royal Gurgen of Kartli. She was the last known member of the royal house of Abkhazia, a fact that provided an opportunity to her son, Bagrat, to claim the crown of Abkhazia. By virtue of being also heir to the Georgian Bagratid principalities, Bagrat went on to become the first king of unified Kingdom of Georgia. Gurandukht stood by her son in his political and cultural enterprises. Gurandukht is known from The Georgian Chronicles and several inscriptions.  Biography  Gurandukht was a daughter of George II of Abkhazia (r. 916‚Äì960) and, thus, sister to the three succeeding monarchs‚ÄîLeon III, Demetrius III, and Theodosius III. Gurandukht is depicted in relief on the northern squinch over eastern arch of the Kumurdo Cathedral in Javakheti, with an accompanying inscription in the medieval Georgian asomtavruli script ·Ç¢·Ç∞·Ç£·Ç≤, \\"G[u]R[an]D[ukh]T\\". The southern relief shows her brother Leon III, who is unnamed, but mentioned in a dedicatory inscription on the south door of the church, dated to 964. Gurandukht was married to Gurgen, a member of the Georgian Bagratid family and a son of Bagrat II \\"the Simple\\", the titular king of Kartli, which was de facto under the Kingdom of Abkhazia. As none of Gurandukht's brothers produced a male heir, her son with Gurgen, Bagrat, was the potential heir to the crowns of both Abkhazia and Kartli. In addition, Bagrat was adopted by his powerful cousin, David III of Tao, through the advice of Iovane Marushisdze, eristavi of Kartli. =Regency= David installed the boy-prince Bagrat as a ruler in Kartli in 975, with Gurgen and Gurandukht as regents. The family had to deal with strong aristocratic opposition, but enjoyed the support and protection of David of Tao. In 978, again through Marushidze's efforts, Gurandukht's weak reigning brother Theodosius III was deposed and Bagrat, now of age, proclaimed King of Abkhazia. On this occasion, Bagrat and Gurandukht sponsored the construction of the Bedia Cathedral, completed in 999, and donated a gilded chalice to it. For a time, during Bagrat's absence in Abkhazia, Gurandukht administered the key fortified, rock-hewn town of Uplistsikhe and part of Kartli. Gurandukht's husband Gurgen succeeded on his father's death as king of Kartli in 994. When he died in 1008, Bagrat, for the first time in history, united the western kingdom of Abkhazia with the eastern realm of Kartli to give rise to the unified Georgian monarchy. The date of Gurandukht's death is not known, but she is mentioned as dead in two inscriptions of Bagrat III, an undated one from Akhalsopeli in Kvemo Kartli and the other, dated to 1002, from the Tsvimoeti church in Shida Kartli.

It occurred at and around the Ming's northern city of Guangning (now Beizhen, Liaoning), which fell to the Later Jin in 1622. Background In Sichuan and Guizhou a major rebellion by indigenous peoples had broken out the previous year, and the Ming dynasty was thrown into a major rebel crisis. Meanwhile in Liaoning, Wang Huazhen, Vice Censor-Chief of the Right and Touring Pacification Commissioner of Guangning, proposed hiring 400,000 Mongols to attack the Jurchens. The officials at the Ming court thought this was a dumb idea and refused the proposal. As of 1622 the Ming dynasty had spent 21,188,366 taels on the war in Liaodong over a three year period. With the allotted funds for weapons manufacturing, 25,134 cannons, 6,425 muskets, 8,252 small guns, and 4,090 culverins had been produced for a total of 43,901 firearms. In terms of cold weapons, 98,547 polearms and swords, 26,214 great \\"horse decapitator\\" swords, 42,800 bows, 1,000 great axes, 2,284,000 arrows, 180,000 fire arrows, 64,000 bow strings, and hundreds of transport carts were produced. Course of battle Jin forces attacked Fort Xiping, situated west of the Liu River, one of the minor tributaries of the Liao River. Their initial advance was checked by Ming forces who repelled the invaders with cannon fire. Wang Huazhen, charged with the defense of Guangning, sent Bao Chengxian to intercept the enemy. Ming forces engaged in battle with the Jin army and lost. Bao managed to evade capture and escaped. Upon receiving news of their defeat, Wang abandoned Guangning, leaving Sun Degong in charge of the city, and fled to Dalinghe. Luo Yiguan, the commander of Fort Xiping, had an unruly subordinate who wanted to attack the Jurchens, so he did. He was defeated and retreated back to the fortress. The Ming defector Li Yongfang besieged Fort Xiping. Fort garrisons put up a stout defense and Luo personally cursed Li as a traitor. So many attackers died that piles of their bodies were reported to have reached the top of the walls. Eventually the defenders ran out of gunpowder and ammunition, at which point Luo bowed towards Beijing and said, \\"Your minister has exhausted himself,\\" before committing suicide by slitting his throat. What remained of Fort Xiping's 3,000 garrisons were slaughtered, but the Jin army had suffered 6,000 casualties in the process. The Jin khan Nurhaci then intercepted a Ming relief force of 30,000 and routed them, killing a third of their men. Meanwhile, the Ming's Mongol allies were busy looting the area around Guanging, which had already been emptied of people, who fled further south seeking refuge. Sun Degong surrendered Guangning to the Jin, after which Bao Chengxian also came forward and surrendered. Nurhaci's sons Hong Taiji and Dai≈°an took Yizhou and slaughtered its 3,000 strong garrison. Aftermath Northeast Asian 1620-1630. Nurhaci returned to Liaoyang to recuperate. Sun Degong became a mobile corps commander accompanying the White Banner, and led other Ming defectors to garrison Yizhou. Wang Huazhen rendezvoused with Xiong Tingbi at Dalinghe. From there Wang retreated with the aid of Xiong's soldiers past the Shanhai Pass into Ming territory. Both Wang and Xiong were impeached and eventually arrested. Xiong Tingbi was executed in 1625 and Wang Huazhen was executed in 1632. Ming commander Zu Dashou retreated to Juehua Island. Mao Wenlong was appointed commander-in-charge of Pacifying Liao. Sun Chengzong was appointed military commissioner. He immediately requested 200,000 taels in cash, which the court eunuch Wei Zhongxian opposed, but was ultimately provided for on command of the emperor. The emperor also allocated 30,000 taels for the construction of war carts. Sun took on a defensive approach and promoted his stance to the court as the only realistic response to Jin aggression. Sun chastised the court officials for having no knowledge of military matters yet constantly meddling in matters of strategic importance. However he also acknowledged the problem of military officials impinging on the authority of civil officials, and neither were ideal or desirable. Sun recommended the appointment of men such as Sun Yuanhua and Yuan Chonghuan, who would play a pivotal role in the Battle of Ningyuan. Yuan Chonghuan was made Inspector of the Army at Shanhai Pass. Ningyuan, located southwest of Guangning, was made the frontier base in the northeast. Wang Zaijin continued to propose a Ming-Mongol alliance, and even requested 1.2 million taels to hire Mongols to attack the Jin. He was eventually reassigned to Nanjing as Military Commissioner of auxiliary administration.

This identification has been recently questioned by Jim Wafer of Newcastle University, who also reconstructs the original name as Kayawaykal. Language The Geawegal language would have been, according to Tindale, closely related to Gamilaraay. Surveying the literature, Jim Wafer says it is as yet unclear whether the linguistic affiliation, based on guesses from a mere 6 morphemes, links the language to a \\"Darling Tributaries\\" language' like Gamilaraay, or to a \\"Lower North Coast\\" language like Warrimay, or even a \\"Hunter River-Lake Macquarie language\\" (HRLM) like Awabakal. The ethnonym appears to means \\"no-sayers\\" (geawe, held by Tindale to probably represent keawai = no, while -gal appears to be a \\"belonging\\" suffix), ‚Äì the tribe being described by the negative word it employed- and if so, Tindale suggested that the more precise transcription of their name, given the prevalence of unvoiced consonants, might be Keawekal/Keawaikal. Wafer however argues that this is very close to kayaway is one of several alternative negative forms in HRLM, suggesting different language affinities than those suggested by Tindale. Horatio Hale, a philologist who took part in the United States Exploring Expedition led by Charles Wilkes, made the first description of their language. Country The Geawegal were described by Rusden as occupying \\"part of the valley of the Hunter River extending to each lateral watershed, and from twenty-five to thirty miles along the valley on each side of Glendon.\\" Disputing this, Tindale claimed they lived further to the north-west over an estimated extending from the territory around the northern tributaries of the Hunter River to Murrurundi, and taking in Muswellbrook, Aberdeen, Scone and Mount Royal Range. Tindale's evidence for this, based upon an 1899 police survey questionnaire, has been challenged by Jim Wafer with regard to the Upper hunter River. Her concludes that 'the region attributed by Tindale to the \\"Geawegal\\" was in fact occupied by speakers of a dialect ‚Äì which I call the \\"Upper Hunter dialect\\" ‚Äì of the Darling Tributaries language.' People Tindale affirms that the Geawegal had close affiliations with the neighbouring Warrimay, and were not to be confused with the Gweagal, an Eora horde that dwelt between Botany Bay and Port Jackson. Helen Brayshaw to the contrary considered them to form part of the Gamilaraay nation. Wafer contests this, while also challenging Tindale's two speculative identifications and suggests rather that they belong to the Hunter River-Lake Macquarie language group. They married out with the aborigines of Maitland, to some extent with those of the Paterson River, and on exceptional occasions with the people around Muswellbrook. They greatly feared the Gamilaraay, who, according to some early reports, were wont to push down from the upper Hunter River and raid their territory as far as Jerrys Plains. Their society was divided into at least two sections, Yipai and Kampu., as opposed to the four recorded for the surrounding tribes, but this may simply reflect a failure of the informant's memory. Despite formally strict marriage rules, Fison and Howitt's informant told them that festive occasions involving wife-swapping took place among them. They were one of the tribes employing heralds to communicate with other, and sometimes distant tribes. These people were considered as sacred, and to be allowed free passage, even among hostile tribes. The victor who slew an enemy in a tribal fight would excise his hand and carry it for some time among the tribe as a trophy. When a warrior died, all of his fighting and hunting equipment was solemnly buried with his body. History Tindale regards passages in the travelogue of the French explorer Fran√ßois P√©ron, writing in 1807, as constituting the first description of the Geawegal. Hale's observations in 1846 were written in good part from notes he gathered from interviews with Lancelot Threlkeld, but Wafer contends that Tindale errs in ascribing this data to the Geawegal. In 1880, by which time the tribe was thought to be extinct, Lorimer Fison and Alfred William Howitt wrote a short excursus on them, relying on information from G. W. Rusden, who had learnt the language in his youth. Dispute over their identification Determining what tribes occupied the upper Hunter Valley region has long proved difficult, with maps of Australian tribal territories often leaving this particular area vacant. Despite Tindale's identification of an indigenous Geawegal people in this locality, many historical documents attest to the presence of the Gamilaraay in the same area, especially around the Hunter River headwaters and Murrurundi. It was Fison and Howitt who first provided this name for the tribe.

The 2017 version was the 21st year in a row that AAA has held a Rey de Reyes show and tournament. Previous Rey de Reyes tournaments consisted of several rounds, but for 2017 AAA held a nine-man Royal Rumble-style elimination match, which was won by Argenis. The show saw several changes compared to the originally announced matches, including Johnny Mundo, the AAA Latin American Champion defeating AAA Mega Champion El Texano Jr. and AAA World Cruiserweight Champion El Hijo del Fantasma to win both championships, making him the first man to hold all three championships.

Production =Background= Starting in 1997 and every year since then the Mexican Lucha Libre, or professional wrestling, company AAA has held a Rey de Reyes (Spanish for \\"King of Kings') show in the spring. The 1997 version was held in February, while all subsequent Rey de Reyes shows were held in March. As part of their annual Rey de Reyes event AAA holds the eponymious Rey de Reyes tournament to determine that specific year's Rey. Most years the show hosts both the qualifying round and the final match, but on occasion the qualifying matches have been held prior to the event as part of AAA's weekly television shows. The traditional format consists of four preliminary rounds, each a Four-man elimination match with each of the four winners face off in the tournament finals, again under elimination rules. There have been years where AAA has employed a different format to determine a winner. The winner of the Rey de Reyes tournament is given a large ornamental sword to symbolize their victory, but is normally not guaranteed any other rewards for winning the tournament, although some years becoming the Rey de Reyes has earned the winner a match for the AAA Mega Championship. From 1999 through 2009 AAA also held an annual Reina de Reinas (\\"Queen of Queens\\") tournament, but later turned that into an actual championship that could be defended at any point during the year, abandoning the annual tournament concept. The 2017 Rey de Reyes took place at Arena Jos√© Sulaim√°n in Monterrey, Nuevo Le√≥n, the fourth time Rey de Reyes was held in Monterrey and the first time it was held at Arena Jos√© Sulaim√°n. The show was the 19th Rey de Reyes show in the series. AAA had originally announced that the 2017 Rey de Reyes tournament would consist of one match, a three-way match between the three reigning AAA singles champions as El Texano Jr. (AAA Mega Championship) would face El Hijo del Fantasma (AAA World Cruiserweight Championship) and Johnny Mundo (AAA Latin American Championship). =Event= Johnny Mundo, who became a triple champion at the Rey de Reyes show. The Rey de Reyes show featured seven professional wrestling matches with different wrestlers involved in pre-existing, scripted feuds, plots, and storylines. Wrestlers were portrayed as either heels (referred to as rudos in Mexico, those that portray the \\"bad guys\\") or faces (t√©cnicos in Mexico, the \\"good guy\\" characters) as they followed a series of tension-building events, which culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches. The opening match, a steel cage match between the team of Pagano / El Mesias and Dark Cuervo / Dark Scoria was originally announced as the fourth match of the night, but was moved to the first instead. Under AAA rules the match could be won by escaping the cage to the floor, usually by climbing over to side to the floor. During the match Curvo climbed over the top to the floor, waiting for his partner to also exit. In the closing moments of the match El Mesias tackled Dark Scoria through the cage, driving both of them to the ground outside the ring, which was ruled as an escape for Dark Scoria. As a result of their victory Dark Cuervo and Dark Scoria earned a match for the AAA World Tag Team Championship at a future date. Mari Apache was originally scheduled to be part of the #1 contender for the AAA Reina de Reinas Championship but was unable to compete due to a skull injury. AAA had announced a luchadora sorpresa (a \\"surprise wrestler\\") that turned out to be Mexican-Japanese Ayako Hamada who had last worked for AAA in 2008. Faby Apache was the first wrestler eliminated, followed by Goya Kong, La Hiedra and Big Mami. The match came down to Ayako and Lady Shani, with Hamada gaining the final pinfall and thus the right to challenge for the AAA Reina de Reinas Championship later on in the show. Prior to the third match of the show, Impact Wrestling representative Jeff Jarrett came to ringside with AAA official Dorian Roldan to announced that the two promotions had reached a working agreement. The next match, originally scheduled to be the main event of the show, was not only moved down the card, but was no longer for the 2017 Rey de Reyes title. Instead AAA official Vampiro announced that all three championships would be on the line in the match as AAA Mega Champion El Texano Jr. faced off against AAA World Cruiserweight Champion El Hijo del Fantasma and AAA Latin American Champion Johnny Mundo. During the match El Hijo del Fantasma was able to perform \\"The Thrill of the Hunt\\" (one of his signature moves, a Samoan driver onto a steel chair) on Texano Jr. After taking the move El Texano Jr. was attended to by paramedics, to give the impression that the move hurt Texano Jr. so badly that he had to be taken from the ring on a stretcher. Moments later Johnny Mundo was aided by an unidentified man who attacked El Hijo del Fantasma. The attack led to Mundo pinning El Hijo del Fantasma to win the match and become a triple champion. The next match originally announced as a Falls count anywhere match, but was instead contested under normal tag team rules. For the match long-time rivals Psycho Clown and Dr. Wagner Jr. fought Murder Clown and Monster Clown, who had turned on both Psycho Clown and Wagner in the months leading up to the match. Psycho Clown and Dr. Wagner Jr. managed to get along well enough to defeat the two traitorous clowns. Moments after the match was over all four wrestlers were attacked by a group consisting of Carta Brava Jr., Mocho Cota Jr. and Soul Rocker who beat up all four competitors and then stole Dr. Wagner Jr.'s mask. The semi-main even match was Taya's third Reina de Reinas championship defense since winning the title in 2014 as she fought Ayako Hamada. Hamada pinned Taya cleaning, becoming the 20th Reina de Reinas in AAA history. The semi-final match was the previously unannounced Rey de Reyes tournament, a nine-man elimination match, fought under delayed entry battle royal rules where a new competitor joined the match at a timed interval and wrestlers were eliminated by being thrown out of the ring. The order of elimination was Pimpinela Escarlata, Ni√±o Hamburguesa, El Elegido, Joe L√≠der, La Parka, Chessman and Bengala leaving Argenis and Averno as the last two men. The final elimination happened by pinfall as Argenis pinned Averno to win the Rey de Reyes tournament and the Rey de Reyes sword that symbolizes the victory. In the last match of the night Aero Star put his mask on the line against long time rival S√∫per Fly who would risk his hair in a Lucha de Apuestas, or \\"bet match\\". During the match both wrestlers bled profusely and Aero Star's mask was torn up by S√∫per Fly. At one point the two wrestlers fought outside the ring, with Aero Star climbing to the second level of the arena, only to leap off the edge onto S√∫per Fly who was positioned below. At one point S√∫per Fly used a pair of brass knuckles to hit Aero Star to get the pinfall and looked like he had won the match. Vampiro made his way to ringside and informed the referee of what had happened and restarted the match. The restart allowed Aero Star to pin his opponent, forcing S√∫per Fly to kneel in the middle of the ring and have all his hair shaved off as per the Lucha de Apuestas stipulation.

She was named as a Purpose Prize winner in 2009 and a top 10 CNN Hero in 2012. Life Siskowski grew up in Nutley, New Jersey. When her parents divorced, she went to live with her grandparents. When she was 11, she cared for her ailing grandfather for 2 years until his death. Her grandfather suffered from chronic heart disease. After her grandfather's death, she became a candy striper and volunteered with a local junior first aid squad. After graduating high school, she went on to attend nursing school Johns Hopkins University on a full scholarship. She earned a master's degree in public administration with a major in Health Administration from New York University. After becoming a registered nurse, she gained advanced degrees in cardiac nursing and then as a Licensed Nursing Home Administrator. She also went on to get a PhD in Educational Leadership from Lynn University. She moved to Boca Raton, Florida from New Jersey in 1990. Career Siskowski became a registered nurse in Maryland in 1968, then in New Jersey and Florida. She worked in the health care system for over 30 years. She worked in settings such as hospitals, home care, and hospice nursing. She also founded a healthcare company, MD To You, which sent doctors into the home. Activism Siskowski founded her first nonprofit centered around family caregiving in the late 1990s. The group provided volunteer support services to help people who were homebound and caregiving families, ultimately changing its name to Volunteers for the Homebound and Family Caregivers (VHFC), Inc. The program was founded in 1998 with seed money from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation's Faith in Action program. Siskowski worked with researchers at Palm Beach Atlantic University and the Palm Beach County school district to help her understand the scope of the youth caregiving problem, and that is when she discovered that thousands of middle and high school children are caregivers. This impetus also led to the first national study on children caregivers in 2005. Afterward, Siskowski decided to focus solely on youth caregiving. By the end of 2009 VHFC changed its corporate name to the American Association for Caregiving Youth (AACY) in Palm Beach County, Florida. In 2006 the first Caregiving Youth Project began at Boca Raton Community Middle School. The organization is perhaps the first of its kind to be founded in the United States. As of 2012, the program has helped over 550 children. This organization was also helped by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. It also supports hundreds of students at a time. Her organization, located in Boca Raton, Florida, started the Caregiving Youth Project. The Caregiving Youth Project acts as a system of early intervention to aid youth that are caregivers. It is also said to be the first organization of its kind in the United States. The organization provides support services to the youth in school, out of school and at home. Since 2006, the program has expanded to 25 area middle and high schools. The program also follows children throughout their grade school education. The program also provides children with a home study and also provides education about factors the children will need to know in order to be better caregivers. The program relies on local funding and from donations. Children also are connected to other children in the same situation, even in different countries. They also are offered a getaway called Camp Treasure, where they get a chance to go away to camp. Awards Siskowski received the Purpose Prize in 2009. In 2009, she was also named an Ashoka Fellow, which is a lifetime fellowship to expand her organization. She was also named a Top 10 CNN Hero in 2012. She was also nominated for a Blue Dove award in 2012 and more recently the Johns Hopkins Distinguished Alumna Award and has a Star in the Boca Raton Walk of Recognition. She has also hosted local awards ceremonies.

The software is named after World Chess Champion Magnus Carlsen and features adjustable difficulty levels for chess players of various skills. It has been available since 2014 and is developed by the Norwegian company Play Magnus AS which was founded by Carlsen. Description The program is a chess engine tuned to play at nineteen different skill levels based on Magnus Carlsen's ability at given ages. Through the app, users can win the chance to play against Carlsen in person. Users earn points by playing chess, or can purchase points for money. Points can be spent on querying the engine for move suggestions, and on the undo function (the cost of this is higher at the higher levels). A large points balance is required to stand a chance of playing Carlsen in person. After each game, the app gives the user a chance to \\"share\\" their result on Facebook or Twitter, or to save the game as PGN. It also includes various quotes from Magnus that are presented between games. The first skill level (\\"age 5\\") plays moves predominantly at random. History The development of Play Magnus began after Carlsen founded Play Magnus AS and invested his own money and funds from investors into the company. It was developed by a team including Tord Romstad, one of the creators of Stockfish, who said he based the engine on his Stockfish predecessor \\"Glaurung\\" to avoid copyright issues with Stockfish itself.Developer Tord Romstad's comments Romstad also said they \\"intentionally made the progression up to about age 14 a bit more linear than it was in reality (in an attempt to make the progression not be too steep, but user feedback indicates that it might be too steep nevertheless)\\".Comment by developer Tord Romstad on Reddit Play Magnus was released in January 2014 for iOS and late 2014 for Android. It received close to one million downloads by November 2016. It has risen to 2.8 million downloads as of December 2017. Play Magnus AS acquired the chess website chess24.com in 2019.

Early life and education Born in Cleveland, Alice Carmen Gouvy was the daughter of Charles P. And Helen L. Gouvy. She graduated from the Cleveland School of Art in 1894. After moving to New York, she shared an apartment with Tiffany Studios designer Clara Driscoll. She studied at the Art Students League from 1896 to 1898. In 1898, she began working at Tiffany studios. She became Driscoll's most trusted assistant, and remained a close friend. The two shared a summer cottage at Point Pleasant, New Jersey. Career Gouvy began working at Tiffany Studios in the fall of 1898. That year, Louis C. Tiffany undertook his first experiments with enameling on metals at the Stourbridge Glass Co. facility. Tiffany hired additional staff to create chemicals for the new department. Gouvy was hired to work on formulas and new designs. The department was originally set up in a small laboratory in Tiffany's mansion at 72nd Street and Madison Avenue, and moved to the glass shop at Corona in 1903. By 1900, Gouvy also worked in the Tiffany Studios pottery department and designed bronze objects.

She is known for non-figurative, abstract, expressionistic painting. Sanchez currently lives in Miami, Florida where she paints and works for the Miami international airport.  Early life and education  Yolanda Sanchez was born in Havana, Cuba to a concert pianist mother. She emigrated with her mother at seven years old to Miami, where she was raised . Sanchez initially received her PhD in clinical psychology from Florida State University in 1979 and then proceeded to be involved in 24 years of practicing and teaching psychology. She later received a degree in fine arts from Florida International University in 1991 and then a Masters in Fine Arts from Yale University in painting in 1994. Sanchez is also a Fulbright scholar from her fellowship in Spain studying El Greco, Goya, Mir√≥, and Tapies .  Career and style  Sanchez creates her works where she lives in Miami Beach. A figure within the arts community there, she created and manages the Arts and Cultural Affairs division of the Miami-Dade Aviation Department, while also holding an administrative position in the art program of the Miami International Airport, including oversight of the airport galleries, children‚Äôs art program, and curating the temporary exhibitions. Sanchez also acts as a liaison to the Professional Advisory Committee for the Miami Dade Art in Public Places program. As an artist, Sanchez has had enough success and acclaim to warrant representation in museums such as the Museo Siyasa in Spain and the Museum of Craft and Folk Art in San Francisco, as well works in the permanent collections of the Graham University center and The Art Museum at FIU, the Museum of Art in Fort Lauderdale, as well as the Museum of Contemporary Art in Jacksonville. Sanchez describes her work as being influenced by color, light, texture, and the natural landscape, depicting the experience or memory of something rather than an exact representation. Her work also takes influence from poetry, dance, calligraphy, and Asian art, while also not straying from the syncretic culture of the Caribbean. Sanchez has prior study, training, and a personal background in both calligraphy and dance, explaining her use of the movement and energy of both in her works. When it comes to Asian art, it is the Chinese and Japanese ink painting that is integrated into her paintings. Sanchez aligns herself with American artists such as Franz Kline and Cy Twombly, and cited her historical influences as Matisse, Bonnard, Pollock, and Monet. In addition to her Cuban heritage, Sanchez also draws from the South Florida landscape, in the colors of the sea and flora.  Process  Sanchez was originally a figurative painter and transitioned over into abstract painting. Sanchez made this transition because she began to feel that figurative painting was limiting. She gradually began to use less and less recognizable imagery. Some of Sanchez‚Äôs most important tools include light, color, mark and gesture. Sanchez believes these tools along with her abstract style ‚Äúallows the viewer a greater opportunity to enter into interaction with the work and to project their own interpretation of what is going on‚Äù, overall creating greater dialogue between the viewer and the work. Sanchez goes into further detail regarding her creative process when speaking about what art and making art means to her in which she states ‚Äúmaking art for me is a way of paying attention, of being more present‚Äù. Much of her work is process oriented and almost always begins with the color palette. Sanchez is a firm believer in working through her paintings rather than planning them and letting the paint guide her. Besides raw materials Sanchez‚Äôs spirituality and state of mind are very important to her works and their creation. Sanchez utilizes meditation and poetry often when creating works.

Glenny was a fixture of the thriving artistic scene in Buffalo in the early twentieth century. From 1893-1894 and 1903‚Äì1904, she served as president of the Buffalo Society of Artists. She studied under top teachers, such as William Merritt Chase and Gustav Boulanger, in both the United States and France, and was considered in her time to be one of the city's top artists. Today, Glenny is best remembered for her Art Nouveau posters and magazine illustrations. Her posters were featured prominently in Buffalo's Pan-American Exposition of 1901, famous for being the location of the shooting of President William McKinley. She also regularly contributed illustrations to the Buffalo-Courier Express, one of the major newspapers in Buffalo at the time.  Early life and artistic training  In 1858, Alice Russell was born in Detroit, Michigan. As a young woman, she moved to New York to study art, where she met and married John Clark Glenny of Buffalo (1859‚Äì1909). The couple had two daughters. Living in New York, Glenny trained under American painter and art teacher William Merritt Chase. Traveling to Paris, Glenny also studied with French figure painter Gustav Boulanger.  Involvement in the graphic arts  Cover: Women's Edition Buffalo Courier (1895)While also being a muralist and sculptor, Glenny's work as a graphic artist consisted of American Art Nouveau posters. With the development of color lithography, the production of posters was elevated worldwide from what H.C. Bunner had called a \\"primitive system\\" in which woodblocks were harshly carved allowing for an imprecision of color and shape. Color lithography provided American advertisers with the means of creating eye-catching and beautifully rendered pictures, often of fashionable women. Poster design in America was influenced by a number of emerging styles from countries such as France and Britain. French poster design, largely influenced by woodblock printing in Japan, was well received in the United States when Harper's Magazine commissioned Franco-Swiss artist Eug√®ne Grasset to create covers in 1889, 1891, 1892, and in April 1893. Exposure to these international styles ignited a \\"poster craze\\" in which American graphic designers developed a style commonly \\"depicting bourgeois scenes\\" and utilizing more stylized lines filled with blocks of color, similar to the designs of artists such as Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec and Alphonse Mucha. Through the proliferation of print culture as well as industrial expansion, American millionaires such as Andrew Carnegie and Henry Clay Frick began to support education and culture, enabling the U.S. to be a fertile ground for the creation of a new style of art. It was not only the upper-class who strove for cultural edification, but the also middle-class who were exposed to emerging art styles through magazines. These magazines provided a push for the opening of new museums and travel abroad. Women's Clubs were integral in establishing cultural spaces as well as publishing these art magazines. Glenny was a part of a women's club named The Twentieth Century Club in Buffalo, New York. She, along with other poster artists such as Ethel Reed, was active in promoting the interests of American female artists. Her best known work is the cover for the Buffalo Courier: Women's Edition in 1895. Similar to other posters and covers being produced at this time, the cover displays organic and natural forms as well as the color blocking technique indicative of Art Nouveau style. Glenny's figure displays a hard face, however, uncommon of the bourgeois women depicted in posters of this time. A classical revival of sorts, the woman stares out in a stark frontality. She is softened by the flowing hair ribbon above her head and the full blooms of the flowers in her coiffured hair. While feminine in features, hairstyle, and clothing, the woman holds a firm stance in the face of women's rights.  The Pan-American Exposition in Buffalo  Glenny's prints were exhibited at the 1901 Pan-American Exposition. A World's Fair, the Pan-American Exposition sought to emphasize good relations between North and South America. After much deliberation and competition, Buffalo, New York was chosen as the site of the exposition due to its large population of 350,000 people and easy access by railroad. Following the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, the exhibition emphasized the economic connections of the United States and Latin America, especially Cuba and Puerto Rico. Upon learning of the theme of the World's Fair, President William McKinley declared, \\"I shall be very glad to do anything I can for Buffalo.\\" The Pan-American Exposition ran from May 1 through November 2, 1901. In 1900, Glenny won a mural competition to decorate the Pan-American Exposition's New York State Building. Her painting, Blessing of the Cross by Father Milet, 1688 depicts a scene from New York history where a priest, Pierre Milet, erected a cross following the rescue of a starving garrison. The scene shows Milet, surrounded by a small group of soldiers and American Indians, blessing the raised cross while a faint figure of Christ hovers behind him. In addition to Blessing of the Cross by Father Milet, 1688, Glenny had four other works displayed in the Exposition's Exhibit of Fine Arts, including The Maid of the Mist, The Coral Harp, and The Figure of Electricity. The Exhibit boasted the largest collection of contemporary American artists such as Mary Cassatt, John Singer Sargent, and James McNeill Whistler. Many of the works exhibited emphasized the achievements of American society and technology. Glenny's cover design for the booklet, \\"Music at the Pan-American Exposition: Organists, Orchestras, Bands\\", also known as The Coral Harp demonstrates her creativity representing the idyllic, idealized female form. The coral color choice was not an accident. As part of the spectacle of the Pan-American Exposition, each building was painted a different, vibrant color, with the Temple of Music painted red and salmon. Highly advertised, the Exposition saw several noteworthy visitors, including Thomas Edison, Vice President Theodore Roosevelt, and President McKinley. On September 6, McKinley was greeting visitors at the Temple of Music when Leon Czolgosz shot him twice. Despite the presence of the newly invented X-ray machine, doctors decided not to use it on the president for fear of possible radiation side effects. As a result of his wound in the abdomen, McKinley developed gangrene and died on September 14. The assassination cast a pall over the Exposition, and postcards depicting the Temple of Music, together with portraits of McKinley, were distributed. After the Exposition closed on November 2, the halls, including the Temple of Music, were disassembled and destroyed. The sole surviving structure from the Pan-American Exposition, the New York State Building still stands and was converted into Buffalo's Historical Society Museum where Glenny's mural remains.  Historical significance and artistic legacy  Alice Russell Glenny is a historically significant figure in the realm of late nineteenth to early twentieth century American women artists as evidenced by her presence in American Art Posters of the 1890s. The exhibition catalogue includes prints and posters that are housed in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Glenny's artwork in American Art Posters of the 1890s visually elucidates the uniqueness of the American posters when compared to French posters of the same time period. The insertion of Glenny's poster in this collection demonstrates that women artists helped shape American graphic design. Glenny's legacy is also solidified by her inclusion in the Library of Congress in Washington D.C. Her artwork can be found in the tome American Women: A Library of Congress Guide for the Study of Women's History and Culture in the United States. Within the text, there are many examples of works by influential women who were authors, film makers, photographers and printmakers. Glenny's entry in the volume regarding \\"The Buffalo Courier's Women's Edition\\" from May 8, 1895 explicates the importance of \\"Women's Editions\\" magazines. Women's editions magazines were usually longer than the regular magazine and were marketed specifically towards women. For example, \\"The Buffalo Courier's Women's Edition\\" was \\"forty pages (versus the usual ten) ... [and was] promoted with colorful posters and flyers to attract readers and advertisers alike.\\" These editions proved that women were worthy of being marketed to as consumers. Besides Glenny's historical legacy on the national stage in the MET and Library of Congress, she was also a prominent local figure in Buffalo, NY during her lifetime. For example, she was an editor of a local magazine called Hobbies, which was put together by the Buffalo Society of Natural Sciences, circa 1920. Hobbies was a magazine that aimed to bring the \\"world to Buffalo.\\" The purpose was to help middle class citizens cultivate their leisure time into worthwhile pursuits that promoted culture and erudition. Articles provided opportunities for citizens to become involved with a multitude of activities such as the study of photography, microscopic experimentation, and even anthropology. Glenny was the Art Director of this magazine. Her name can be found on the mast head. This demonstrates Glenny's continued involvement and authority regarding the arts even up until four years before her death.

Her father, Julius A. Parker, was a successful physician and pharmacist who graduated from Meharry Medical College, the first medical school in the South for African-Americans. Her mother was Della Ella Murrell Parker. Carolyn Parker's maternal first cousin Joan Murrell Owens, was a marine biologist who was one of the first African-American women to receive a PhD in geology. Carolyn Parker was one of six children, all but one of whom received natural science or mathematics degrees. Mary Parker Miller had a Masters of Science in mathematics from New York University in 1975; Juanita Parker Wynter had a Bachelor of Science in mathematics and chemistry, and a Master of Science from New York University; Julie Leslie Parker had a Bachelor of Science in mathematics from Fisk University and a master's degree in medical technology from Meharry Medical College; and Julius Parker Jr had a master's degree in chemistry from the University of Michigan. The sixth sibling, Martha Parker, studied social sciences, gaining a master's degree from Temple University. Carolyn Parker graduated magna cum laude with an A.B. (Bachelor of Arts) degree from Fisk University in 1938, then an A.M. (Master of Arts) in mathematics from the University of Michigan in 1941. She undertook further studies from 1946‚Äì1947 at Ohio State University, towards the end of time of her time on the Dayton Project. She gained a Master's in physics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in 1951. According to members of Parker's family, she had completed the course work for her PhD in physics at MIT around 1952 or 1953, but died of leukemia, apparently due to job- related exposure to radiation, before she was able to defend her dissertation. She is the first African-American woman known to have gained a postgraduate degree in physics. Career Parker taught in public schools in Rochelle, Florida from 1938‚Äì1939, Gainesville, Florida from 1939‚Äì1940, and Newport News, Virginia from 1941‚Äì1942. She was an instructor in physics and mathematics at Bluefield State College from 1942‚Äì1943. From 1943 to 1947, Parker was a research physicist on the Dayton Project, at the Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton, Ohio. The Dayton Project was part of the Manhattan Project to develop atomic weapons in World War II, and continuing into the Cold War. The Monsanto Chemical Company led top-secret research work on using polonium as the initiator for atomic explosions. Parker's sister, Juanita Parker Wynter, reported in an interview that her work there was \\"so secret she couldn't discuss it, even with us, her family\\". In 1947, Parker became an assistant professor of physics at Fisk University in Tennessee. Parker was a member of the Institute of Radio Engineers, the American Physical Society, Sigma Upsilon Pi, and Delta Sigma Theta. Personal life Parker's family report that she died of leukemia, which they believe was radiation-induced. Leukemia is regarded as a risk of occupational polonium exposure. Workers on the Dayton Project had weekly tests for polonium excretion. In 2000, the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program included leukemia as a compensable illness for workers at the Dayton Project who were, or should have been, regularly monitored for polonium levels and were employed there over a certain time. Parker died in Gainesville, Florida on 3 March 1966 at the age of 47. She was Roman Catholic.  Legacy  In 2020, during the George Floyd protests, an elementary school and neighboring park in Gainesville, which had been named after a Confederate General, were renamed to Carolyn Beatrice Parker Elementary School and Park in her honor.

The network had up to 10 miles (16 km) of track. The Barbados Tramway Company operated up to 25 horse-drawn tramcars. Instead of numbers the trams had names, such as ACTIVE, ALERT and JUBILEE. Gasoline-powered buses began to attract more and more passengers with effect of 1907. There were several bus companies by 1908 competing against the slower trams. Thus the tramway was sold in 1910 to U.S. investors and renamed to Bridgetown Tramway Company. The American investors initially wanted to build extensions north to Speightstown and south to Oistins Town, but their plans did not get realized. Instead, the tramway ceased to operate in 1925.

David Dadiani (; 23 January 1813 ‚Äì 30 August 1853), of the House of Dadiani, was Prince of Mingrelia, in western Georgia, from 1846 until his death in 1853. A son of Levan V Dadiani, he became de facto ruler of Mingrelia on his father's retirement in 1840. Like his father, David ruled as an autonomous subject of the Russian Empire and served as a major-general of the Russian army. David presided over the frequently heavy-handed efforts to modernize Mingrelia's government, economy, and education. The Russian authorities, citing the Mingrelians' discontent with Dadiani's harsh measures, attempted, but failed to bribe him into resigning his office. David died of malaria at the age of 40.  Early life and career  David Dadiani was born in the village of Chkaduashi near Zugdidi, Mingrelia's capital into the family of the prince-regnant Levan V Dadiani and his wife, Princess Marta, n√©e Tsereteli. As an adolescent, David was sent to Tiflis to be educated under the guidance of the Russian generals Vasili Bebutov and Georg Andreas von Rosen. He was commissioned as a cornet in the Life Guards Cossack regiment in 1829. From 1834 to 1838, he was in his native Mingrelia at his father's request to help reform the principality's crumbling government and economy. However, the young reformer's efforts were not popular with the local nobility and even his father. The disillusioned prince David returned to Tiflis and resumed his service with the Russian military, being promoted to the rank of colonel. Eventually, on 11 May 1840, Levan V resigned the government of Mingrelia in favor of his son; he remained a titular prince-regnant, while David became a co-prince and de facto ruler of the principality. On Levan's death in 1846, David succeeded to all his titles.  Reforms in Mingrelia  The Dadiani Palace in Zugdidi. Once in government, David embarked on a series of reforms to modernize his principality's administration and economy. He substituted hereditary governors of Mingrelia's districts with appointed officials, removed the court from the high nobility's control and appointed 12 independent lawyers as the final arbiters of justice. He, further, emancipated the lower strata of the clergy from serfdom and, at the same time, placed Mingrelia's chief prelate, the archbishop of Chqondidi, under his authority. Dadiani also abolished the institution of dowry, improved civil infrastructure, and instituted annual scholarships for around 10 Mingrelians for professional education in Tiflis. He helped found several enterprises, such as a silk factory in Zugdidi and alcohol beverage distilleries in Zugdidi and Salkhino. At his palace in Zugdidi, Dadiani founded a museum of Georgian antiquities and a library of old Georgian manuscripts, subsequently bequeathed by his son Niko to the Society for the Spreading of Literacy among Georgians. Dadiani's reforms were frequently executed in a heavy-handed manner, causing discontent among his subjects. Critics accused him of despotism and self-enrichment. Mikhail Vorontsov, viceroy of the Caucasus, reacted to this by offering Dadiani to step down in exchange of monetary compensation. David demanded 30,000 chervonets and that all his estates be left in his possession. Vorontsov threatened with the abolition of Mingrelia's autonomy and Dadiani promised to accommodate Russian interests in his principality.  Relations with Russia  In general, David Dadiani was a loyal subject of the Russian crown throughout his rule. At the head of Mingrelian forces, he fought the anti-Russian rebels in neighboring Guria in 1841 and the Circassian tribes on the northwest Caucasian coastline later that year. In 1845, he was promoted to the rank of major-general. Dadiani was in dispute with his cousins, the Shervashidze family, in Abkhazia over the borderland fiefdom of Samurzakano. In 1847, the Russian government removed Samurzakano from Mingrelia's control and put it under the Kutais Governorate, paying Dadiani off with 25,000 roubles.  Death  David Dadiani died of malaria at the age of 40 at his palace in the village of Gordi. He was buried at the Martvili Monastery. According to the Russian military physician Erast Andreyevsky, there were rumors that Dadiani was poisoned by the people disaffected by his rule. He was succeeded by his six-year-old son, Niko, whose regency was assumed by David's widow Ekaterine Chavchavadze.  Family  Ekaterine Chavchavadze, David Dadiani's wife. David, while still a child, had been betrothed to Darejan, daughter of the Svan prince Tsiok Dadeshkeliani, but, in 1835, David repudiated her and arranged Darejan's marriage to the Kakhetian nobleman David Abkhazi, granting her former fianc√©e a pension of 150 chervonets. In 1839, David married Princess Ekaterine, a daughter of the poet and general Alexander Chavchavadze. The wedding was celebrated at the Kashueti Church in Tiflis on 15 May 1839. David and Ekaterine were the parents of seven children. Of these, Maria (1840‚Äì1842), Nina (1841‚Äì1848), and Levan (1842‚Äì1844) died in David's lifetime. He was survived by four children: * Niko (1847‚Äì1903), Major-General, the last Prince of Mingrelia; * Salome (1848‚Äì1913), a socialite married to the French prince Achille Murat (1847‚Äì1895); * Andria (1850‚Äì1910), Lieutenant-General, an avid chess-player; * Tamar (1853‚Äì1859).

Taking a distinct feminist angle, Sanitary Panels comments upon social justice topics ranging from discrimination to victim blaming. Taneja started her webcomic on Facebook in June 2014 and has since accumulated over 50,000 followers. Content A short 2015 Sanitary Panels strip. Rachita Taneja's Sanitary Panels uses a stick figure artstyle to comment upon topics such as misogyny, sexism, and social injustice. Taneja noted that she \\"doesn't consider herself an artist\\": though her webcomic tells short stories about discrimination and hypocrisy, its primary purpose is to cover issues ranging from victim blaming, harassment and homophobia to menstruation and democracy. Sanitary Panels is an explicit webcomic about feminism, similar to The Royal Existentials, Inedible India comics, Why Loiter?, Blank Noise, and various other Indian webcomics. The webcomic covers other topics as well, such as net neutrality. Development Rachita Taneja uploaded the first strip of Sanitary Panels on Facebook in 2014, in response to people being arrested for denouncing president Narendra Modi on the social media platform. In an interview with The News Minute, Taneja described her thoughts at the time as followed: \\"I thought if they want to arrest people on the basis of what they say on Facebook, I'll give them something to be mad about.\\" At the time, Sanitary Panels were simple doodles Taneja drew on her tablet and shared with her friends, but she quickly found that her work was collecting a lot of positive attention, which prompted her to start an official Facebook page for her webcomic on June 15 that year. Taneja wanted to name her webcomic something taboo, and chose a pun on sanitary pads. Taneja cofounded the Internet Freedom Foundation in 2016, campaigning for net neutrality, free speech, and privacy. She is also a proponent of the Me Too movement. In 2017, Sanitary Panels was covered by the Obama Foundation in a YouTube video, in which Taneja talks about the responsibility she feels to make her content as accurate and fair as possible as it reaches millions of people and influences them. Taneja wishes to contribute to social justice through her comic strips. Taneja finds that humour is highly effective when communicating complex ideas to large groups of people, claiming that \\"the best thing about the [online] medium is its inclusiveness.\\" Impact Sanitary Panels has over 50,000 followers on Facebook since January 2019, and over 33,000 followers on Instagram since December 2019. Taneja was one of the leading people behind the net neutrality movement in 2015, and her art was used en masse during the Citizenship Amendment Act protests.

Known for his research on insulin resistance, Dey's is a J. C. Bose National Fellow of the Department of Science and Technology and an elected fellow of the National Academy of Sciences, India and the Indian National Science Academy. The Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, the apex agency of the Government of India for scientific research, awarded him the Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar Prize for Science and Technology, one of the highest Indian science awards for his contributions to Medical Sciences in 2003. He is also a recipient of the National Bioscience Award for Career Development of the Department of Biotechnology.  Biography  University of Calcutta S. C. Dey was born on 18 March 1961 in Kolkata, the capital of the Indian state of West Bengal. He graduated in zoology from the University of Calcutta in 1982 and continued at the institution to obtain a master's degree in 1984. Afterwards, he joined the Indian Institute of Chemical Biology, in Kolkata, as a research fellow for his doctoral studies and submitted his thesis Biochemical regulation of sperm motility, which earned him a PhD from Jadavpur University in 1990. He did his post-doctoral studies initially at California Institute of Technology from 1988 to 1991 as a post-doc research fellow and later, at the Baylor College of Medicine, as a post-doc research associate from 1991 to 1992. On his return to India in 1992, he started his career by joining the National Institute of Immunology as a pool officer, but his stay there lasted only for two years. In 1994, he moved to National Institute of Pharmaceutical Education and Research, Mohali as an assistant professor at the department of biotechnology where he served for over a decade and a half. During this period, he held positions as an associate professor (1999‚Äì2002) as well as a professor (2002‚Äì10), and he became head of the department in 2004. In 2010, he moved his base to New Delhi to join the Indian Institute of Technology at Kusuma School of Biological Sciences as a professor and is the head of the Central Research Facility. He leads a laboratory at IIT Delhi involved in research on Insulin-resistant diabetes and hosts a number of scholars and students. He also serves as a visiting scientist at Madras Diabetes Research Foundation (MDRF).  Legacy  Dey's research has been focusing on the drug resistance of two diseases, leishmaniasis and diabetes. His work on insulin resistance included the development of an in-vitro model, which has potential applications in screening anti-diabetic drugs. The model, which involved insulin-resistant cultured skeletal muscle cells, earned him a US patent. Using the model in tandem with biochemical and gene silencing methodologies, he demonstrated that focal adhesion kinases and p38 mitogen- activated protein kinases could be used as possible drug targets. His team identified for the first time the apoptosis-like cell death in Type II topoisomerase and suggested the enzyme as a possible treatment protocol for Leishmaniasis. His findings were published in a 2005 article in Molecular and Biochemical Parasitology of Elsevier. He also proposed eIF4A, a member of a set of three related proteins, as a drug target to combat infection with Leishmania donovani, a Miltefosine-resistant type of trypanosome causing leishmaniasis. His work on myogenesis and muscular dystrophy showed insulin‚Äëmediated dephosphorylation of PTK2 (focal adhesion kinase) could be stopped by inhibiting the activity of the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase, which was a new discovery. His research has been documented in numerous articles; ResearchGate, an online repository of scientific articles, lists 90 of them. Besides this he has contributed chapters to two books, and his work has drawn citations from other researchers. James Watson, a recipient of the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1962, cited one of Dey's papers in his 2013 lecture at University of California, Los Angeles to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the discovery of double helical structure DNA, which was later published as an article in Lancet in 2014. He also holds a Patent Cooperation Treaty and his aforementioned US patent, as well as two Indian patents, and has guided students in their master's and doctoral studies. Dey was the Sectional Secretary of the 91st Indian Science Congress held in 2003; he was also associated with the organization of the Indo‚ÄëUS Symposium on Recombinant DNA Technology and Its Application in Drug Discovery held at BITS, Pilani in February 1999 and the workshops on Molecular Basis of Drug Discovery and on Molecular Modeling and Pharmainformatics held at National Institute of Pharmaceutical Education and Research, Mohali in 2005. He was the regional associate editor of the Journal of Biopharmaceutics and Biotechnology in 2006 and is a former member of the editorial boards of the now defunct Open Parasitology Journal of Bentham Science Publishers and Scientific Reports of Nature Publishing Group. He is a reviewer for Molecular Biology International, a journal of the Hindawi Publishing Corporation, the Diabetes journal of the American Diabetes Association, The FASEB Journal, the Molecular Medicine journal, FEBS Letters, the Journal of Molecular Cell Biology, Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy, the British Journal of Pharmacology, Comparative Biochemistry and Physiology, Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy, the Indian Journal of Medical Research, and Experimental Parasitology. He has also served as an adviser or consultant to pharmaceutical companies such as Orchid Chemicals and Pharmaceutical Ltd., TCG Lifesciences (former Chembiotek Research International) and DSM Anti-Infectives.  Awards and honors  The Council of Scientific and Industrial Research awarded him Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar Prize, one of the highest Indian science awards in 2003.

Compagnia della Stella of Albert Sterz The first company with the name was formed in August 1364 by the condottieri (soldiers of fortune) Anichino di Bongardo (Hannekin Baumgarten), Albert Sterz and Ugo della Zuccha and was composed largely of English and German mercenary soldiers. Bongardo contributed the men of his own company and Albert Sterz many men of the White Company who followed him when he left it after its mauling at the Battle of Cascina. The name referred to the emblem of the Knights of Bongard, the family to which Anichino belonged. The following month Anichino left the company and command devolved to Albert Sterz. Under Sterz's leadership the company was hired by the Papal States who were engaged in hostilities with Perugia. The Star Company comprised about 5,000 cavalry and 1,000 infantrymen, while that of Perugia consisted of some 10,000. Fighting took place over five months in Umbria, Tuscany and Lazio, with the main battle taking place in San Mariano, near Corciano, where the Sterz forces were comprehensively defeated by the White Company in 1365. They were then hired by Perugia, but disbanded after Sterz had been accused of treachery by the Perugians and beheaded in the town. Compagnia della Stella of Astorre Manfredi The second company of the name was formed in Soragna in June 1379 by Astorre I Manfredi, who recruited adventurers mainly from Emilia- Romagna, initially having a complement of about 600 lancers and 2,000 infantry. The company tried to attack Bologna and Rimini, but was then was hired by Bernab√≤ Visconti of Milan and the Venetians during the War of Chioggia between Venice and Genoa. In August 1379, on the orders of Visconti, they attacked Genoa and looted several villages of the city, including Sampierdarena. However, their most important battle took place on September 24 of that year when 400 lancers and 3,000 infantry under Manfredi were defeated by the Genoese near the Bisagno valley. Most of Manfredi's mercenaries were captured, with the exception of Manfredi himself, who was saved by a farmer to whom he promised a reward of 10,000 ducats. Many of the captured mercenaries were subsequently executed by the local people. References * Based on a translation of the equivalent article on Italian Wikipedia Bibliography * E.

The episode was written by Thomas Ian Griffith and was directed by Janice Cooke. In the episode, Nick and Hank investigate severe attacks in a nursing home and discover that there's euthanasia being performed in the Wesen community. Meanwhile, the group begins to discover more about the prophecy behind the symbols. The episode received positive reviews from critics, who praised the character development but some criticized it for its pace just like the previous episodes. Plot Opening quote: \\"Nothing, they say is more certain than death, and nothing more uncertain than the time of dying.\\" After a series of random brutal attacks and an apparently unrelated assault on a 91-year-old woman in a local nursing home committed by an orderly, Nick (David Giuntoli) and Hank (Russell Hornsby) learn about euthanasia being practiced in the Wesen community. Eve (Bitsie Tulloch) asks Adalind (Claire Coffee) questions that only a Hexenbiest can answer. Dasha talks about an ancient prophecy which predicts something coming. Renard (Sasha Roiz) decides to ask Nick about the mysterious symbols in the tunnels. Reception =Viewers= The episode was viewed by 3.95 million people, earning a 0.7/3 in the 18-49 rating demographics on the Nielson ratings scale, ranking third on its timeslot and ninth for the night in the 18-49 demographics, behind 20/20, Dr. Ken, a rerun of Shark Tank, Dateline NBC, Last Man Standing, MacGyver, Blue Bloods, and Hawaii Five-0. This was a 7% decrease in viewership from the previous episode, which was watched by 4.23 million viewers with a 0.8/3. This means that 0.7 percent of all households with televisions watched the episode, while 3 percent of all households watching television at that time watched it. With DVR factored in, the episode was watched by 5.80 million viewers and had a 1.3 rating in the 18-49 demographics. =Critical reviews= \\"Blood Magic\\" received positive reviews. Les Chappell from The A.V. Club wrote, \\"'Blood Magic' is another Grimm episode that towards the end gets to one of the things I've always liked about the show. For all the criticism that can be leveled at Grimm for its scattered approach to narratives and political organizations ‚Äî are we ever going to mention Black Claw or the royal families again? ‚Äî it's always been reliable in terms of creating a lived-in wesen community. It's a vibrant ecosystem with a lot of different species trying to exist in a society that doesn't acknowledge them.\\" Kathleen Wiedel from TV Fanatic, gave a 3.8 star rating out of 5, stating: \\"One could once again fault the series for introducing new world building with only a precious few episodes left, but Grimm Season 6 Episode 10 made up for it with a definite poignancy to the A-story.\\" Sara Netzley from EW gave the episode a \\"A-\\" rating and wrote, \\"In your wildest fairy tale fantasies, did you ever expect Grimm to feature a somber rumination on dementia, eldercare, and dying with dignity in its final season? I didn't, but I'm certainly glad it did ‚Äî and in an episode where seemingly divergent plot threads tidily weave together in the end, to boot.\\" Christine Horton of Den of Geek wrote, \\"This week Grimm tackled the weighty subject of dementia and assisted suicide, but of course in a very Grimm-like manner. It was an interesting move, this late into the final season to offer up more insight into the Wesen world and its inhabitants, but it provided a genuinely emotional moment that is rare to experience on a show such as this.\\" See also *Hyaluronidase *assassin bug References External links 2017 American television episodes Grimm (season 6) episodes ","title":"Blood Magic"},{"id":"53603972","text":"Hevea nitida is a species of rubber tree in the genus Hevea, belonging to the family Euphorbiaceae. It is a medium-sized evergreen tree up to tall. It is native to the rainforests of northern Brazil and Colombia. Description H. nitida is a medium-sized, evergreen tree growing to with a slender trunk and branching crown. The exception to this is the variety toxicodendroides, which is a shrubby form only growing to about tall. The leaves have three, drooping, elliptical leaflets, that are folded upwards at the midrib; both upper and lower surfaces are glossy bright green. Male and female flowers are separate and borne in mixed panicles. The calyx lobes have blunt tips and the disks of both male and female flowers are markedly broad, and in the female flowers, lacerated. The fruit capsules are green with reddish tips and usually contain three large, rounded seeds. Distribution and habitat H. nitida is found in northern Brazil and Colombia. It mostly occurs north of the Amazon River, and because of its habitat requirements for drier ground, its range is divided into a number of subpopulations mainly in the western half of the range of the genus. There are also populations south of the Amazon in northern Peru and near the lower reaches of the Madeira River. It grows at altitudes of up to about above sea level, typically growing in sandy soil, in sparse, well- drained forest, but sometimes growing in areas briefly inundated in the wet season. The variety H. nitida var toxicodendroides only grows on the sandstone mesas of the Vaup√©s Department and Amazonas Department in Colombia. Uses The seeds are poisonous when raw but can be eaten when well-boiled. Some native tribes consume them regularly, but others regard them as famine food only to be eaten at times of food scarcity. Tapping the tree gives a thin latex that has the undesirable quality of preventing coagulation when mixed with the latex from other rubber tree species.

It is native to the rainforests of Ecuador, Venezuela, the Guyanas, Brazil, Colombia and Peru. It generally grows on well- drained soils or on those that are only lightly inundated, on river banks, in gallery forests, savannah forests and wooded slopes. Description H. guianensis is a large evergreen tree growing to a height of . Annual growth is in the form of vigorous short shoots on which flowers and foliage develop before the old leaves are shed. The leaves are tri-foliate (with three leaflets), the leaflets being folded back when the leaf emerges but becoming semi-erect as the leaf matures, the only species in the genus where this is the case. The variety lutea differs from the nominate race in having obovate leaflets instead of elliptical ones. The inflorescence is borne on the tip of the short shoots, there being separate male and female flowers. Each flower has five perianth lobes, the male flowers having five anthers, arranged in a single whorl in a central column, but in lutea they may be arranged in an irregular whorl or in two whorls. The female flowers have a central pistil with a disk below. The fruit is a three-chambered capsule which splits apart explosively to expel the seeds; these are kite-shaped and measure .

The New York Times labeled her ‚Äúone of the nation‚Äôs most prominent developmental psychologists.‚Äù Early life Rheingold was born Harriet Lange in New York on February 13, 1908, the daughter of Oscar Lange and Lillian Brown (Braun). Both parents were born in the United States, of parents born in Eastern Europe. They were Jewish. Harriet excelled in high school in Brooklyn and was admitted to Cornell University at age 16 under a special program. Her parents moved with her to Ithaca. She was graduated in 1928 with a bachelor's degree in philosophy, and was admitted to Phi Beta Kappa, the honors society. She taught high school in Ithaca, NY and worked thereafter as an assistant to Arnold Gessel at Yale University. She earned a master's degree in psychology from Columbia University in 1930. In 1932 she married Joseph C. Rheingold, a psychiatrist in training, whom she met when both were working at Worcester State Hospital in Massachusetts. They had two children, Paul David and Arnold Lange Rheingold. (She later divorced Joseph and remarried.) Harriet and Joseph lived in Chicago, where Harriet worked as a supervising psychologist at the Illinois Institute for Juvenile Research. During World War II, Harriet accepted a teaching position as professor of psychology at Rockford College in Rockford, IL. Today, the school offers a scholarship in her name. Career Rheingold left Rockford for the University of Chicago to pursue a Ph.D. in psychology, which she was awarded in 1955. She studied under and was influenced by one of her teachers, David Shakow. Her first job was at the National Institute of Mental Health, as a research psychologist in the Early Development Section. In 1964, Rheingold became a research professor at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill, where she remained until her retirement in 1978. At UNC, she attained a life time Research Career Award from the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, which sponsored her research and furnished her salary. These early studies and publications dealt with early childhood development. Her views helped shape widespread understanding that an infant plays an active role in its environment from birth. In 1984 she edited the book Maternal Behavior in Mammals. Rheingold focused on the positive achievements of infants, from sociability and responsiveness to independence and such valued behaviors as sharing, helping, and caring. Her demonstrations of infant social competence led to a significant change in the ways in which psychologists, pediatricians, and even parents perceive normal infant behavior. A diplomat in clinical psychology in the American Board of Examiners in Professional Psychology, Rheingold was a member of Phi Beta Kappa and former president of the UNC-CH chapter of Sigma Xi, the Scientific Research Honour Society. She was a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the Society for Research in Child Development and fellow of the American Psychological Association, where she served as president of Division 7 in 1972-1973. Although she became a professor emeritus in 1978, Rheingold continued to do research and publish in her field, as well as supervise Ph.D. candidates. She also wrote her most popular book, The Psychologist‚Äôs Guide to an Academic Career, in 1994. She died of lung cancer (she was an ex-smoker) on April 29, 2000, at the age of 92. Her ashes are buried in Greensboro, North Carolina, at the Hebrew Cemetery, along with her parents and brothers. Awards and recognition Rheingold received a number of awards and recognitions in her lifetime. In 1977 she was awarded the G. Stanley Hall Award for Distinguished Contributions to Developmental Psychology. She received the Professional Achievement Award from the University of Chicago Alumni Association. The University of North Carolina honored her with an honorary Doctor of Science Degree in 1986 at commencement. After her death the school created the Harriet L. Rheingold Student Research Endowment Fund in the Department of Psychology.

Hinshaw (born December 1, 1952) is an internationally recognized psychologist, whose contributions lie in the areas of developmental psychopathology and combating the stigma that still surrounds mental illness. He is the author of more than 325 scientific articles and chapters as well as 14 authored and edited books. Currently, he is Professor (and former Department Chair) in the Department of Psychology at the University of California, Berkeley, and Professor In Residence and Vice Chair for Child and Adolescent Psychology in the Department of Psychiatry at the University of California, San Francisco. His work focuses on child and adolescent mental disorders, clinical interventions, mechanisms of change in psychopathology, and stigma prevention efforts, with a specialization in ADHD and other externalizing behavioral disorders.  Accomplishments  The primary focus of his research is externalizing behavior dimensions and disorders, particularly ADHD; family, peer, and neuropsychological risk factors; mechanisms of change via clinical trials; and the stigmatization of mental illness. His work has featured the interplay between psychobiological vulnerability and family and peer-related risk factors and impairments, emphasizing transactional models of influence. His work on randomized clinical trials of pharmacologic and psychosocial interventions for children with attention-related and impulsive behavior problems emphasizes understanding the mechanisms underlying clinically significant change, particularly family processes. He has been awarded numerous federal grants for his investigations. Hinshaw was documented as one the 10 most productive scholars in the field of clinical psychology across the past decade. From 2009-2014 he was editor of Psychological Bulletin, the most cited journal in general psychology. He is a fellow of the Association for Psychological Science, the American Psychological Association, and the American Association for the Advancement of Science. His research efforts have been recognized by California‚Äôs Distinguished Scientific Contribution in Psychology Award (2009), the Distinguished Scientist Award from the Society for a Science of Clinical Psychology (2015), and the James McKeen Cattell Award from the Association for Psychological Science (2016) ‚Äîits highest award, for a lifetime of outstanding contributions to applied psychological research‚Äîand the Distinguished Scientific Contributions to Child Development Award (2017) from the Society for Research in Child Development. Hinshaw‚Äôs research is regularly featured in various mainstream media outlets including ABC World News Tonight, CBS Evening News, CNN, Huffington Post, NBC Today Show, New York Times, Newsweek, Oakland Tribune, Psychology Today, People Magazine, San Francisco Chronicle, The Economist, Time, Wall Street Journal, and Washington Post. He is a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the American Psychological Association, and the Association for Psychological Science. As a trainee and student, he received the R.E. Harris Award: Outstanding Clinical Psychology Fellow, Langley Porter Institute, UC San Francisco; the UCLA Alumni Association Distinguished Scholar Award winner (outstanding graduate student campus-wide); and, at Harvard, the Ames Award, Detur Prize, John Harvard Scholarship, Harvard College Scholarship, and National Merit Scholarship. In 2001, Hinshaw received the Distinguished Teaching Award from UC Berkeley‚Äôs Division of Social Sciences. His Teaching Company (‚ÄòGreat Lecture‚Äô) series, ‚ÄúOrigins of the Human Mind,‚Äù was released in 2010. Regarding his 2007 book, The Mark of Shame, Stigma of Mental Illness and an Agenda for Change, the New England Journal of Medicine review stated the following: ‚ÄúHinshaw's skill as a writer cannot be overstated. He uses a mixture of technical and lay language to paint a picture of stigma across the ages that is thoroughly enjoyable to read despite its often distressing content. In addition to being a professor of psychology, Hinshaw comes across as a passionate historian and humanitarian.‚Äú Regarding his 2014 book with R. Scheffler, The ADHD Explosion, Publisher‚Äôs Weekly called it ‚Äú‚Ä¶complex, thought-provoking, and urgent.‚Äù  Academic career  Hinshaw attended Harvard University from 1970-1974, concentrating in Psychology and Social Relations. After graduating, he directed a residential summer camp for children with serious disabilities (Camp Freedom) and a day school program operating out of Massachusetts Mental Health Center (Therapeutic Center) for children who had been excluded from public school settings. He went on to earn his Ph.D. in Clinical Psychology at UCLA, before serving as a postdoctoral fellow at the University of California, San Francisco. He was a Visiting Lecturer at UC Berkeley, an Assistant Professor at UCLA and an Assistant, Associate, and currently Professor at UC Berkeley and UC San Francisco. Over the years he has served as Principal Investigator for the Berkeley site in the Multimodal Treatment Study of Children with ADHD (MTA Study) and founded the Berkeley Girls with ADHD Longitudinal Study (BGALS), the largest study of girls with this condition in existence. Contributions from the latter investigation include delineating the serious risk for self-harm (suicide attempts and non-suicidal self-injury) in girls with ADHD as they mature into late adolescence and early adulthood. Among other consultantships and affiliations, he serves on the scientific board of Glenn Close‚Äôs mental health nonprofit Bring Change 2 Mind, as an advisor and storyteller for the play The Manic Monologues, and as Co-Chair of the Scientific Research Council of the Child Mind Institute.  Early life  Stephen P. Hinshaw was born on December 1, 1952, in Columbus Ohio. He was the oldest child in the family; his sister, Sally P. Hinshaw, is 15 months younger. It wasn‚Äôt until he was 18 that Hinshaw‚Äôs father, the eminent philosopher Virgil Hinshaw, Jr., let him in on a family secret, which had been explicitly forbidden from discussion by Virgil‚Äôs doctors. Once his father‚Äôs ‚Äòmadness‚Äô ‚Äî a lifelong, cyclic psychotic illness misdiagnosed as schizophrenia, which Hinshaw subsequently corrected as bipolar disorder ‚Äî was out in the open, Hinshaw's career trajectory moved toward clinical psychology. Subsequent discussions revealed a history of involuntary hospitalizations and other brutal treatments, fueling Hinshaw‚Äôs lifelong passion for understanding vulnerable children and eradicating mental illness stigma.

He served as the governor of Erzincan from ca. 1511 to 1515. Nur-Ali Khalifa was a pivotal figure in the early days of the Safavid realm. His large-scale campaign in Anatolia in 1512, with troops levied on the spot from Sufis belonging to the Safaviyya order and which coincided with the ascension of Selim I (r. 1512-1520) to the throne, was one of the casus belli that lead to the Battle of Chaldiran (1514). This Safavid force led by Nur-Ali Khalifa penetrated deep into Anatolia, captured and sacked the town of Tokat, had the khotbeh read there in Ismail I's name, and managed to defeat an Ottoman army led by Sinan Pasha that was sent after them. During the decisive Chaldiran battle, Nur-Ali Khalifa and Mohammad Khan Ustajlu were Ismail I's (r. 1501-1524) commanders who had first-hand experience with the Ottoman ways of warfare. They both advised to attack at once, in order to prevent the Ottoman's from establishing their proper defensive positions, but were rudely rebuffed by Durmish Khan Shamlu. Durmish Khan considered it \\"cowardly to engage an unprepared enemy\\". Ismail I chose to endorse Durmish Khan Shamlu's suggestion for the attack and thus the Ottomans were allowed to prepare their defenses at their leisure; this would prove costly, contributing to the sound Safavid defeat at Chaldiran.

It is closely related to the Siberian rubythroat which however lacks the distinctive white tail-tips and white tail bases. It was also previously considered conspecific with the Himalayan rubythroat, together called the white-tailed rubythroat. It is found along the Himalayan ranges from Pakistan to Myanmar. Taxonomy The first formal description of the Chinese rubythroat was by the Russian geographer Nikolay Przhevalsky in 1876. He introduced the current binomial name Calliope tschebaiewi. The specific epithet tschebaiewi is in honour of the Cossack Pamfili Tschebaeiv who accompanied Przevalsky on his travels. The Chinese rubythroat was subsequently considered as a subspecies of the Himalayan rubythroat (Calliope pectoralis). The species complex was given the English name \\"white-tailed rubythroat\\" and placed in the genus Luscinia. A large molecular phylogenetic study published in 2010 found that the Luscinia was not monophyletic. The genus was therefore split and several species including the white-tailed rubythroat were moved to the reinstated genus Calliope. Another study published in 2016 compared the mitochondrial DNA, vocalization and morphology of several Calliope pectoralis subspecies. Based on their results the authors recommended that C. p. tschebaiewi be promoted to species rank with the English name Chinese rubythroat. At the same time the English name \\"white-tailed rubythroat\\" was changed to Himalayan rubythroat. The species is monotypic. Description The male is slaty brown above with a white forehead and supercilium. The wings are brownish and the tail is blackish with white base and tips. The sides of the throat and breast are black and the centre of the chin and throat is scarlet. Each of the black feathers on the breast is narrowly fringed with grey. The belly and vent are white. The female is dull, brownish grey above with a diffuse supercilium and smoky underparts. The centre of the throat is whitish as is the short moustachial stripe. Distribution and habitat It is found in Central Asia and the Indian subcontinent, ranging across Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Myanmar, Nepal, Pakistan, Russia, and Thailand. The move up north and into higher altitudes in summer and move into lower elevations to the south in winter. It breeds along the edge of the Tibetan plateau winters to its south from Nepal to Assam. Its natural habitat is open woodland and scrub. Behaviour and ecology Adults are shy although sometimes perching in the open. They are usually seen singly or in pairs during the breeding season. They feed mainly on small insects including beetles and ants. During the breeding season the male sings through the day from the top of an exposed perch. The song is a series of squeaky notes with a great deal of variation. Females produce an upward inflected whistle that follows a short and gruff note. The alarm call is a sharp yapping '. In the Tien Shan region, the Chinese rubythroat is found in thickets of juniper elfin at altitudes of 2500 to 2700 m on gently sloping land. The breeding season is in summer and nests are built in shrubs near dense stands of trees. The nest is placed in the middle of a shrub and sometimes on the ground in a dense tussock. The typical nest is a loose and large ball like with an entrance on the side but is sometimes cup like with an open top. The nest is built mainly by the female. A clutch of 4 to 6 eggs is laid. The eggs are greenish blue with rusty dots forming a ring near the broad end. Incubation is mostly by the female but the nestlings are fed by both parents. The eggs hatch after around 14 days and the young leave the nest when they fledge after about 16 days. The parents forage close to the nest and the young are mainly fed with hairy caterpillars. Rubythroats have been observed to abandon their nest when a cuckoo (Cuculus canorus) laid an egg in their nest. Martens and stoats sometimes destroy nests and prey on the young.

Leukon besieged the city himself but, after having been tricked by Tynnichus, retreated back to Panticapaeum. After his defeat, Leukon had to solidify his position on the throne after getting word that some of his friends and subjects were conspiring against him due his failure at Theodosia. He enlisted the aid of merchants and put down the conspiracy.

Early life and academic career Lee was born in Taipei on 4 January 1952. He studied law at Chinese Culture University and Soochow University. He taught law at CCU and was dean of the law school at Shih Hsin University. Legal career When Diane Lee was assaulted by Lo Fu-chu in March 2001, she hired Lee Fu-tien to represent her in court. In January 2004, he and Wellington Koo were two of six Taiwanese lawyers selected by the Straits Exchange Foundation to represent taishang who had been accused of spying in China. By Chinese law, Taiwanese defendants must be represented by Chinese lawyers, and as such, the legal professionals from Taiwan were asked to serve as liaisons between the defendants and their Chinese attorneys. Lee was named a legislative candidate via the People First Party party list in October 2004, but was not elected. He then taught law at Chinese Culture University and represented James Soong in 2006, who charged Chen Shui-bian with slander. Political career Upon the death of Nelson Ku in January 2007, Lee was nominated to finish Ku's term in office. After Taipei County Council member Wu Shan-jeou was shot and killed, Lee argued for amendments to the Statute Regulating Firearms, Ammunition, Knives and Other Deadly Weapons, favoring harsher penalties. During Ma Ying- jeou's 2007 corruption case, Lee petitioned the Ministry of Justice to rule on the status of special allowance funds Ma was alleged to have used as income. Lee was later appointed to the Control Yuan and began a formal examination of corruption charges against Chen Shui-bian. In 2009, the agency found that two Special Investigation Panel investigators had contacted Chen Shui-bian as the corruption probe continued. The first vote to impeach State Public Prosecutor- General Chen Tsung-ming in relation to the Chen Shui-bian case was held in January 2010, and failed. Three weeks later, a second vote on the impeachment of Chen Tsung-ming passed, and Chen subsequently resigned his post. Lee was also involved in investigations of corruption within law enforcement in Taipei County and Chiayi City. He led the 2009 impeachment of former Transportation Minister Lin Ling-san, who was found to have made illegal investments in Taiwan High Speed Rail. Lee was responsible for a 2010 investigation that found Taiwan's immigration system had held foreign nationals longer than legally permitted. Facilities for foreigners detained by Taiwan were also of substandard quality. In October, the Control Yuan impeached judges Hsiao Yang- kuei of the Supreme Court and Kao Ming-che of the High Court, at the suggestion of Huang Wu-tzu and Lee. Hsiao and Kao were found to have lobbied other judges to secure a \\"not guilty\\" ruling for Hsiao's son. A year later, in October 2011, Lee, Shen Mei-chen, and Liu Yu-shan announced a review of the government subsidy available to farmers. The inquiry was opposed by multiple members of the Legislative Yuan, and the parliament eventually passed an amendment raising the value of the subsidy to NT$7,000. After civilians broke into a military compound in December 2011, Lee and Huang began an investigation into the Republic of China Army's security measures. In 2012, Lee and Teresa Yin moved to impeach National Taiwan University Hospital director Ko Wen-je for an oversight in organ donation and transplantation. Control Yuan President Wang Chien-shien remarked in 2013 that the agency should be abolished. Lee criticized Wang for the statement, replying that Wang did not work to improve the Control Yuan, but only attempted to limit its powers. Shortly after the April 2014 execution of Liu Yen-kuo as ordered by Justice Minister Luo Ying-shay, Lee began review of the case, as he suspected a violation of due process.

Barrow does not view being an artist and a designer as mutually exclusive, but rather integrates both aspects into her work. Barrow is currently based in London, using British culture as an inspiration in her art. Barrow is, also, inspired by the idea of consumerism and its effect on art. She, like Burberry, has rejected traditional ideas of the fashion system and announced last year that she would no longer show her designs in accordance with the traditional seasonal model, preferring to focus on creating fashion and art without the motivation of consumerism.  Life  Barrow grew up in Stockton-on-Tees in northeast England. Barrow studied at Conyers School in Middlesbrough and did a BTEC National Diploma in Fashion Design at Cleveland College of Art and Design (now the Northern School of Art)https://northernart.ac.uk/fashion-designer- inspires-young-creative-visit-home/ before she moved to London in 2008 to study Fashion at the University of Westminster. In 2012 she graduated from the University of Westminster with a degree in Fashion Design. Before graduating she got her first big break from the fashion editor at British Vogue, Fransesca Burns. One of her hand painted leather jackets was featured in Vogue, another in i-D and another on Rihanna. Despite the break in her career Barrow still finished her degree. After her graduate collection was featured on the catwalk Fashion East founder Lulu Kennedy quickly picked her up. Just one year after her graduate collection she made her London Fashion Week debut with Fashion East and then began exhibiting with NEWGEN.  Style  Barrow has defined her own style as \\"car boot sale\\". Others have described her style as neo-primitivism. Barrow has grown tired of people inquiring whether she's a fashion designer or artist. She explained in an interview,\\" The question is always, ‚ÄòIs it fashion or art?‚Äô\\" this prompted \\"the Retro-Spective\\" her own fake retrospective which combined the two demonstrating that she's both an artist and a fashion designer.

O'Byrne has also received a number of notable grants and commissions, including: * The NET/TEN Travel Grant * The FreeRange Commission * The Puffin Foundation Grant * The Clover and Cactus Playwrighting Commission * 52nd St. Project TYA Playwrighting Commission  Critical Reception  = Among the Sand and Smog = Among the Sand and Smog (2006) is one of O'Byrne's first plays. It addresses the unsolved murders of numerous women in Ciudad Ju√°rez, Mexico, a city that lies just across the border from El Paso, Texas. The story follows the families of the victims after their disappearance, but in the final scene O'Byrne creates a dramatization of the final moments of the women. Critic Nicolette Good writes of the production, \\"Among the Sand and Smog hits home and is a powerfully written show that cuts through the issue to expose both truth and heart\\". The play was produced by the Cellar Theater at the San Pedro Playhouse in 2008. Since then, it has not been produced on a large scale. = Clover and Cactus = O'Byrne's 2010 play Clover and Cactus was commissioned by the Watts Village Theater Company (WVTC). The play tells the story of the St. Patrick's Battalion, a battalion of Irish-American immigrant soldiers who fought in the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War. Theater critic Karen Jean Martinson stated in her review, \\"As the characters sounded the battle cry in the final moments of the play, I felt the urge to yell out in solidarity with them, with the hope that we can forge such bonds across the lines that currently divide us\\". = The Golden Drum Year = His most recent production, The Golden Drum Year (2015), is an adaptation of 365 poems written every day during O'Byrne's first year living in New York. The play is centered around the character Eugene, a young man who has recently moved to New York City and the people and experiences he encounters during his first year living there. This coming of age story was described by critic Rachel Abrams as \\"an artsy, expressionistic love poem to a diverse and dynamic NYC, and to anyone who‚Äôs searched for their purpose and their people in a new city\\". Critic Michelle DeBella writes that the play \\"assures us that despair is only temporary and if we wait it out, joy is just around the bend\\". The play was developed by Beto O'Byrne and Meropi Peponides, directed by Sim√≥n Adinia Hanukai, and produced by Radical Evolution. Its first staging ran through October 2015 at University Settlement in New York City. = Bibliography = References External links * Hispanic and Latino American dramatists and playwrights Living people American writers of Mexican descent People from Gregg County, Texas Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Beto O'Byrne"},{"id":"53604921","title":"Guy Fort"},{"id":"53604925","text":"Egyptian Knowledge Bank Logo The Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB) ŸÑÿπÿ±ÿ®Ÿäÿ©: ÿ®ŸÜŸÉ ÿßŸÑŸÖÿπÿ±ŸÅÿ© ÿßŸÑŸÖÿµÿ±Ÿä) is an online library archive and resource that provides access to learning resources and tools for educators, researchers, students, and the general public of Egypt.

Tibetan cuisine includes the culinary traditions and practices of Tibet and its peoples, many of whom reside in India and Nepal. It reflects the Tibetan landscape of mountains and plateaus and includes influences from neighbors (including other countries India and Nepal). It is known for its use of noodles, goat, yak, mutton, dumplings, cheese (often from yak or goat milk), butter (also from animals adapted to the Tibetan climate) and soups. The cuisine of Tibet is quite distinct from that of its neighbors. Tibetan crops must be able grow at the high altitudes, although a few areas in Tibet are low enough to grow such crops as rice, oranges, bananas, and lemon. Since only a few crops grow at such high altitudes, many features of Tibetan cuisine are imported, such as tea, rice and others. The most important crop in Tibet is barley. Flour milled from roasted barley, called tsampa, is the staple food of Tibet. It is eaten mostly mixed with the national beverage Butter tea. Meat dishes are likely to be yak, goat, or mutton, often dried, or cooked into a spicy stew with potatoes.

He was involved in the chaos that surrounded the succession to Sultan Bayezid II (1481‚Äì1512). Murad's father, Ahmet, the legal heir to the Ottoman throne, had fought against ≈ûehzade Selim (later Selim I); during this struggle, Ahmet received support from King (Shah) Ismail I (1501‚Äì1524) of the neighboring Safavid Empire. When Ahmet was put to death by the victorious Selim, Prince Murad was subsequently given support by Ismail I as claimant to the throne. Ismail I wanted to use prince Murad to mobilize opposition against Selim I. In 1512, during Nur-Ali Khalifa's large-scale campaign in Anatolia, Murad joined his campaign, and even \\"girded the Qizilbash crown\\". According to information Selim I received from his spies (December 1512/January 1513), Ismail I allegedly wanted to conquer Anatolia, give the Rum beylerbeylik to Murad, while the rest of the territory would be ruled by the Qizilbash. Anyhow, when the Safavid support meant for Murad failed to materialize, the scheme was abandoned, and Murad migrated to the Safavid Empire where he was given asylum. He died at Kashan, or Isfahan. Ismail I's support to these rivals of Selim I formed one of the main casus belli that led to the decisive Battle of Chaldiran (1514).
