Danley (born 1952) is an American audio engineer, electrical engineer and inventor, the holder of multiple patents for audio transducers, especially high-linearity, high-output professional horn loudspeaker systems. Danley first gained notice in the 1980s with his novel servomotor-driven subwoofer systems used to reproduce very low frequencies in concert tours and theme parks. In 2000 he advanced the implementation of multiple-entry horns in 2000 with several designs led by the SPL-td1, a seven-driver loudspeaker. In 2005, he started a new company, Danley Sound Labs, through which he patented further technologies and produced a wide variety of loudspeaker models based on these technologies. Early life and career Danley was raised in the northern area of Illinois, around Highland Park, north of Chicago. His father and brother were mechanically inclined, and taught Danley how to use the workshop tools. Danley studied mechanisms by taking them apart, and he learned to arc weld by age 12. He attended Deerfield High School, obtaining his diploma in five years instead of four. He later said, \\"I took every shop class there was, but I had an attendance problem and math was my weakest thing.\\" One of his friends from mechanical drawing class was T.C. Furlong, who later became an equipment manufacturer and event production company owner. During and after high school, Danley worked as an electronic technician, and he played bass guitar in several bands. He fabricated his own tube amplifiers. After a few years, he joined Steamer Sound, the audio production company founded in 1973 by Furlong. Danley designed loudspeakers for the company, and for individual musicians such as keyboardist Joan Gand. In 1974, he brought a reel-to-reel tape recorder to the Alley, a nightclub in Highwood owned by Furlong, to record the performance of the John Burns Band (the son of Jethro Burns) as he mixed their set. Danley was amazed when he listened to the tape after the show; the tape held a wider frequency range, a higher fidelity experience than was heard at the nightclub. He realized that the loudspeakers must have been a significant limiting factor. Danley left Steamer Sound to work as an electronics technician at Data Specialties in Northbrook, where in 1976 he first used a computer ‚Äì a Commodore VIC-20 ‚Äì to write a program to perform the math calculations he needed at work. He was repairing teleprinters and punch card readers, and had almost given up on concert audio in his career. Intersonics In 1979, a co-worker recommended a job offering nearby at Intersonics, a contractor to NASA, supplying hardware for rocketry research. Danley invented many devices while at Intersonics, obtaining 17 patents. The inventions include a high-powered acoustic levitator, a sonic- boom generator used by BBN Technologies, and a multi-enclosure Flow Modulator loudspeaker system used by Georgia Tech Research Institute and NASA for vibration tests on rocket payloads. Danley designed and built major components of the payload on Space Shuttle flights STS-7 in 1983 and STS-51-A in 1984. =ServoDrive= Danley experimented on his own with a loudspeaker based on the servomotor, and showed the third prototype to his employer. When he asked permission to use this technology to create a subwoofer product line for concerts and touring sound systems, Intersonics president Roy Whymark said yes, but only if the effort did not interfere with Danley's other responsibilities at Intersonics. Danley designed a variety of models including W bins, seeing the most success with the folded horn BassTech 7 subwoofer which performed very well. ServoDrive became the professional audio division of Intersonics. The BassTech 7 was used to great acclaim by Clair Brothers on the North American legs of Michael Jackson's Thriller tour and U2's the Unforgettable Fire tour, both in 1984. Clair typically used a dozen Danley subwoofers as the lowest element of a 5-way system, to fill the bottom octave. Other large purchasers of the BassTech 7 included Disney with about 500 units in Europe and the U.S., and in Las Vegas, the hotels Mirage and Treasure Island which used the BassTech 7 for special effects. The BassTech 7 drive unit was essentially a cube holding two opposing 15-inch woofers, both connected to a central servo motor by way of shafts and flexible belts. The enclosure included Danley's patented cooling fan powered by a DC-rectified portion of the audio signal, kicking in only at high voltage levels. The servo motors in the subwoofer allowed for 3 to 4 times as much peak-to-peak deflection of the woofer cones, compared to what was available at the time with conventional magnetic coil woofers. Additionally, the servo design greatly reduced the common problem of power compression, in which a driver heats up and sound output drops. The servo motor can change direction very quickly, easily allowing an upper frequency response of 125 Hz down to 28 Hz with less than 2% harmonic distortion. Trouble arose with the belt material, which was modified several times by the supplier without notice, resulting in driver failures. Both Intersonics and the ServoDrive division grew in the mid-1980s. A turning point was the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster in 1986, which damped the mood and the business climate in the aerospace industry, and brought delays and cancellations of contracts. Around 1986 a request came in to Intersonics from Cornell University for a low frequency subwoofer loudspeaker intended to reproduce elephant vocalizations in Kenya. Dr. Joyce Poole and Katy Payne of the Amboseli Elephant Research Project asked for a custom loudspeaker that would fit inside a sport utility vehicle, and provide strong output down to 14 Hz. Danley designed the Pachyderm 6, an enclosure with two 15-inch drivers connected to a servo motor, and four 18-inch passive radiators. The output at 14 Hz was measured at about 115 dB with about 200 watts from the amplifier. Based on this, another subwoofer model produced by ServoDrive was the Contrabass in 1987, similar to the Pachyderm 6 but with a smaller enclosure and half the number of passive radiators. The frequency response also reached down to 14 Hz. The Contrabass was popular for home theater installations, including George Lucas' home. An unusual characteristic of the Contrabass was that its distortion components went down as sound pressure level went up, until 105 decibels was reached. Sound Physics Labs Intersonics determined to close the ServoDrive division, as it was considered a distraction from aerospace work. To save the firm, Danley teamed with Bradford Skuran, a guitarist he had played with in his youth, to form a new company: Sound Physics Labs (SPL). SPL bought ServoDrive and continued to produce and service the subwoofers, as well as to design new loudspeakers. =Multiple entry horns= In the late 1990s, Danley designed the SPL-td1, his first trapezoidal \\"top box\\" intended to deliver the mid- and high frequency sounds to complement a subwoofer. The SPL-td1, produced in 2000, was a 3-way speaker which used seven drivers exiting into the same horn to deliver greater coherence. The SPL-td1 was used in many installations and concerts, including the opening and closing ceremonies of the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City. Danley's 3-way design was an improvement on the 2-way CoEntrant patent by Ralph Heinz in 1996. (CoEntrant horn) In 2001, Danley began developing the \\"Unity\\" horn for license to Yorkville Sound, patenting the improvement in 2002. (Unity Horn) In 2003, Yorkville released their Unity line of loudspeakers, using Danley's Unity horn design for the mid-range and high frequency bandpasses.Yorkville Sound. Unity Further modifications to the SPL- td1 concept came with the SPL-td2 providing improved phase/time linearity, the smaller and lighter SPL-runt, and the larger SPL-trik containing nine drivers. LAB subwoofer In the early 2000s, Danley was participating in online discussions at Dave Stevens' Live Audio Board (LAB), a bulletin board system which was later hosted by ProSoundWeb. A number of LAB users wished to collaborate on a do-it-yourself (DIY) subwoofer design. Danley discussed the benefits and tradeoffs of horn versus front-loaded subwoofers, and offered to model a horn enclosure based on the desired size, frequency response and power handling. He \\"spearheaded\\" the effort which in February 2002 resulted in Danley posting the design of a snail-shell folded-horn subwoofer using two 12-inch drivers at the horn throat.Tom Danley's first plan of the Live Audio Board Subwoofer, dated 2/17/2002 and signed T.J.D. (This was the exact same enclosure size as the BassTech 7, with similarities in the internal folding of the horn.) Eminence, an American speaker company who was also participating in the discussions, designed a custom 12-inch driver to meet the requirements: the LAB12. The LAB Sub, also called the LAB horn, was a heavy subwoofer optimized for operation as four enclosures strapped together in a 2√ó2 \\"cube\\" configuration, to increase the effective mouth size and achieve a low frequency of 32 Hz. Danley's conceptual design (he never built one) was given freely to the public domain, and proved to be influential as the first DIY folded horn subwoofer. Danley Sound Labs Danley partnered with entrepreneur Mike Hedden in 2005 to form Danley Sound Labs (DSL), a loudspeaker company based in Gainesville, Georgia, near Atlanta. Previously, Hedden had been the owner of dB Audio & Video, an A/V contractor who was the largest distributor of SPL loudspeakers. For the first ten years of DSL, Danley contributed design ideas while continuing to live in Illinois. In 2015, he moved to Georgia. The first product was the SH100, an 8-inch coaxial loudspeaker intended for 300-seat churches. =Technologies= Danley's Synergy Horn concept was an improvement on the multiple entry design of the SPL-td1. The idea is that multiple drivers in different bandpasses are combined into one horn to make a phase-accurate, constant-directivity single- point-source loudspeaker. Danley's Tapped Horn concept directs sound from the rear of a horn-loaded driver into ports (taps) that are vented into the horn closer to the mouth of the horn, farther from the driver at the throat of the horn. At frequences such that the wavelength is twice the distance to the taps, the waves routed inside the cabinet to exit through ports in the horn combine positively with direct sound from the front of the driver. Following the SH100, the SH50 was introduced: a 3-way, seven-driver loudspeaker, launched in November 2005. It used both the Synergy Horn and the Tapped Horn technologies to deliver coherent sound down to 50 Hz with an output pattern of https://www.svconline.com/products/danley-sound-labs-introduces- groundbreaking-sh-50-397780https://www.prosoundnetwork.com/gear-and- technology/danley-sound-labs-sh-50-loudspeaker Danley's Shaded Amplitude Lens technology, patented in 2009, uses vanes to deflect portions of the high frequency driver output so that the different paths produce an output pattern appropriate for large venues, such that the farther audience hears much the same amplitude and sound fidelity as the near audience. The vanes allow the upper output pattern of the horn to be narrower than the angle of the horn walls, to carry farther without dissipating. The lower parts of the horn allow the sound to spread wider for the near audience.https://patents.google.com/patent/US8422712B2/en In 2011, Danley filed a patent for DSL's Paraline Technology, a method of combining the output of multiple high frequency drivers into a common output chamber or horn. The waves are routed through multiple passageways defined by parallel partitions of gradient sizes.https://patents.google.com/patent/US20120328140A1/en =Matterhorn= In March 2007, DSL produced the Matterhorn, a single subwoofer made from an intermodal shipping container. Danley designed the Matterhorn to meet a military specification, to produce a low frequency sound in the range of 15 to 20 Hz, to be measured at 94 decibels at a distance of 250 meters. To accomplish this, Danley arranged forty 15-inch MTX subwoofer drivers in a tapped horn configuration, each driver powered by its own 1,000 watt amplifier. A diesel generator was included inside the container for operation in the field. The subwoofer has a flat frequency response from 15 to 80 Hz, and is down 3 dB at 12 Hz. The Matterhorn has been called the World's Biggest Subwoofer.http://futuremusic.com/2008/07/22/worlds-biggest-subwoofer- danley-sound-labs-matterhorn/ =Jericho Horn= In 2010, DSL introduced the Jericho Horn, a loudspeaker intended for large audiences. The Jericho Horn is a 4-way design employing six 18-inch drivers for the lows, six 6-inch drivers for the low mids, and two mid-high frequency drivers each of which carries 2-way high frequencies. The Jericho Horn incorporates Danley's patented Shaded Amplitude Lens technology. The Jericho Horn was praised in 2017 when four of the large enclosures were used for DJ sets at the Temple stage at Glastonbury Festival, along with 22 boxes of DSL TH-118 subwoofers. The Jericho Horns and subwoofers were installed and operated by Neuron Pro Audio.https://www.audiomediainternational.com/2017/09/04/danley-hails- successful-first-outing-at-glastonbury/ After hearing the sound system, festival co-founder Michael Eavis chose the Temple stage for his welcome speech rather than the main stage.http://fohonline.com/newsroom/news/danley- sound-labs-jericho-horns-subs-and-amps-rock-at-glastonbury/ Audio consultant Danley has consulted on acoustic issues for various projects. He appeared in the 1993 documentary The Mystery of the Sphinx to demonstrate acoustic levitation. Danley was an early adopter of the Crown Tecron TEF (time-energy-frequency) audio analysis system, introduced in 1983, and he used a TEF-10 portable test rig to measure his audio experiments. At the request of the same documentary producer, in the 1990s Danley used a TEF-12 analyzer to assess the acoustics inside the Great Pyramid of Giza. In 2019 Danley was recognized as an audio industry pioneer by AVIXA, the Audiovisual and Integrated Experience Association. Danley received the Adele De Berri Pioneers of AV Award.https://www.avixa.org/about-avixa/who-we-are/press- room/2019/04/25/avixa-award-winners-revealed-honorees-to-be-recognized-at- infocomm-2019 The award was presented on June 12 at the InfoComm convention held in Orlando, Florida.http://mmrmagazine.com/news/supplier-scene/danley- celebrates-14th-anniversary-and-tom-danley-award-win/ Personal life Danley has played bass guitar since high school. He was in several bands in the 1970s. When his marriage dissolved in the late 1980s, Danley raised his two daughters as a single father.

Kamuratanet provides parameters that are used to determine what is acceptable and normal and what is not acceptable, and therefore abnormal. Though carried out throughout an individual's lifetime, it is formalized during yatitaet (circumcision) and subsequent tumdo (initiation). Objectives Dr. Chemitei's (2018) conceptual model identifies ten virtues that the content of kamuratanet seeks to inculcate, these are; #Kipong'omnon (wisdom) - to inculcate a sense of wisdom #Luget (lit. raid i.e survival skills) - to equip its learners with skills for survival #Nyingan (courage) - to instill courage #Rip pororiet (lit. guard community) - to instill a sense of responsibility #Korip atepto (teach behavior) - to set behavioral standards #Ateptap chii (to specify roles) - to specify the gender roles #Kas chi neoo (respect for elders) - to encourage obedience #Konet ng'otutik (teaching rules) - to state the rules on conduct #Korurewek, koek lakwa chii neoo (to initiate from childhood to adulthood) - To initiate i.e. transition from childhood to adulthood #Chupisio, si kerip atep (curses to regulate behavior) - To regulate the behavior of members Early learning The home, the family and by extension the oret (clan) are the primary units for educating children in Kalenjin standards of individual behavior and gender roles. Within the home parents, relatives (tilionutik) and oret members, serve as tutors for children. Parents are the primary teachers of their children and where young children misbehave subsequently, the mother and the father deal with the matter. The extended family in turn moderates the behavior of its members - both children and adults. Yatitaet (circumcision) Yatitaet is the Kalenjin term for circumcision. It is accompanied by seclusion where rituals are preferred based on kamuratanet standards. Menjo (seclusion) Teaching and instruction is carried out at menjo by age-mates, young warriors, the motirenik and by some elders. =Motirenik= Motirenik serve as ritual leaders at menjo and are only sought from respectable families and clans. More so in the past, appointment as Motiriot was a prestigious and coveted source of pride for one's oret and community. Tumdo (initiation) The word for the initiation process is Tumdo deriving from the Kalenjin word for rituals (Tumdo, pl. Tumwek), in this case those specifically performed during initiation. =Kaandaet= Special songs known as kaandaet are sung during initiation. These songs serve to give instruction, to teach, to make the initiates relax after a hard day and also as an oath of secrecy and allegiance. They are usually taught by age-mates and young warriors and once mastered are sung three times daily between meals. =Karureiwek= Karureiwek are special teachings only carried out in seclusion. The English equivalent word is ‚Äúripeners‚Äù implying ripening the initiates so that they can become adults. =Controversy= In 2017, politicians Jackson Mandago and Alfred Keter led hundreds of youth in performing a tumdo (ritual) known as Cheptilet in public on the streets of Eldoret in protest against the alleged rigging of the Jubilee Party nominations. Video clips of the ritual went viral on social media causing panic among residents of the town. This act was subsequently widely condemned by various members the Kalenjin community - among them fellow politicians such as Bundotich Kiprop alias Buzeki who stated that \\"It was embarrassing and unacceptable within the Kalenjin community to do such a cultural ritual publicly on the streets...‚Äù. It was also condemned by Kalenjin elders, notably Mzee Kibet Maswai, who said that performing the ritual in such a manner is an abomination. ‚ÄúThese young people got it all wrong and as elders we were caught by surprise and we have asked the leaders involved to desist from ever doing it that way again‚Äù he said. =Alternative methods= Various efforts have been made in contemporary times to develop modern approaches to Tumdo in particular and Kamuratanet in general. Three broad directions of development are; modern approaches where Yatiataet is organised on Kamuratanet standards but embracing modern standards of hygiene, Christian oriented learning models known as Tumdo ne leel and FGM eradication programs also based on Christian principles and known as Tumdo ne leel. Tumdo ne leel Generally the term Tumdo ne leel (lit. the ritual that is pure) refers to Christian based learning models that teach the principles of Kamuratanet. The Government of Kenya initiated an FGM eradication program in 1997 that sought to provide an alternative rite of passage that excluded the 'cut'. This approach was adapted and introduced to Keiyo in 2003 under the name Tumdo ne leel primarily under the aegis of Dr Susan Chebet. Behavior regulation Good behavior is referred to as Tagurnatet and inculcating this is the ultimate purpose of Kamuratanet. Behavior that deviated from the acceptable order was referred to as ‚Äì Sogornatet, a distasteful and derogatory term for deviant. The Kalenijn hate to be sogoran or to be referred to in such distasteful terms. In fact ill behavior is perceived as an embarrassment to Kalenjin pride and is severely dealt with. =Home & family= Responsibility for a child's tuition lies with the parents. Failure to tuition a child properly was traditionally punishable by vilification of parents. When a child's misbehavior came to the attention of the neighbors and the parents were found to be culpable or irresponsible in their parenting style, they were punished and could be forced to go through re-initiation in the next yatitaet season. The parents were therefore obligated to check the behavior of their children, not only at the behest of their pride, but also for the continuity of the oret (clan) and the community. =Oret= Connected to the family is the oret which according to kamuratanet defines people better than families. Traditionally, the oret played a supervisory role in the management and regulation of the behavior of its members. Ortinuek ensured that their members portrayed behaviors that were in keeping with kamuratanet. Oret members therefore took keen interest in the shaping the behavior and training of their youth. =Ipinda= In the traditional setting, individuals bore and contributed to the praise names of their ibinwek in addition to their individual praise names. Thus the ibinwek provided self-regulating mechanisms as each member tried to ensure that their age-grade and age-set was viewed and remembered positively. The Nandi chonginek of the last Sawe age-set for example are still remembered by their praise name Mararma for their defeat of the Arab traders in the 1850s. Conversely, the Kipsigis and Nandi, Kipkoiimet and Korongoro age-sets of the prior cycle were wiped out in war, and as a result their entire age-sets were erased from the cycle of ibinwek, such that unlike other Kalenjin these communities currently only have seven age- setsDaniels, R. E, The Extent of Age-set Co-ordination Among the Kalenjin, Nov. 1982 Ibinwek also played a role in early education of kamuratanet. Where a child‚Äüs misbehavior came to the attention of the neighbors, men and women of the parent‚Äüs siritiet (age grade) summoned the father or mother respectively for questioning regarding the child‚Äüs misbehaviour. Warnings were issued for the unbecoming or \\"unkalenjin\\" behavior to be corrected. =Community= The community plays a significant role in ensuring adherence to behavioral standards set by kamuratanet and escpecially so in the raising of children. Traditionally, children were not considered to belong only to their respective parents, but rather belonged to the extended family, the oret and the community as well. Indeed within the orthodox kamuratanet context, parents are only custodians of children on behalf of the community. =Spirituality= Specific to orthdox Tumdo, various forms of curses and blessings were instituted to regulate behavior. Indeed, good behavior was not optional but mandatory in kamuratanet. Further, language was also loaded with distasteful terms to describe people who misbehaved. In addition, it was believed that one who misbehaved would be confronted by bad omen (ng‚Äôoki). Such strategies made anyone contemplating misbehavior to take caution.

The building, which until 1966 was also the headquarters of Buckinghamshire County Council, is a Grade II* listed building. History Construction work on the building commenced in 1722. It was designed by local architect Thomas Harris in the Palladian style following a design competition supervised by John Vanbrugh but, because of funding difficulties, it was only completed in 1740. The design involved a symmetrical main frontage with seven bays facing onto the Market Square; the central section of three bays, which projected slightly forward, featured a doorway on the ground floor with a wrought-iron grill in the tympanum flanked by round- headed windows in a similar style; there was a round-headed window flanked by Doric order pilasters and pedimented widows on the first floor and a large pediment at roof level topped with three urns. Internally, the principal room was the courtroom. The murderer, John Tawell, who was arrested after police sent a telegraph message to Paddington Station, was tried in the courtroom and then executed in the Market Square in 1845. An extension to the rear to accommodate the judge's lodgings was built to the designs of Edward Buckton Lamb and completed in 1850, while an extension to the south west, this time to accommodate the county constabulary headquarters, was built to the designs of David Brandon in a similar style to the main building and completed in 1865. The building continued to be used as a facility for dispensing justice but, following the implementation of the Local Government Act 1888, which established county councils in every county, it also became the meeting place of Buckinghamshire County Council. It was the scene of the trial of the suffragette, Elizabeth Anne Bell, charged with carrying a loaded pistol outside the walls of HM Prison Holloway in 1913. The courtroom hosted the trial of the defendants accused of participating in the Great Train Robbery in spring 1964 and then was used for a court scene in the Miss Marple film Murder Most Foul which was released in September 1964. After the County Council moved to the new County Hall in 1966, the old building continued to be used as a Crown Court. The courtroom was badly damaged in a fire on 9 February 1970 and subsequently restored. The building went on to be was used for exterior court scenes in the television series Judge John Deed in the early 2000s. After the Crown Court moved to the magistrates' courts building further south along Walton Street in March 2018, Buckinghamshire County Council indicated an intention to develop the old building as a hotel. However, the proposal, which would involve stripping the interior of the building, including the courthouse, met strong opposition from local people and a petition against the proposal was launched in October 2018.

She was classed as a snow in Lloyd's Register of 1845. She worked as a whaler prior to her life as an emigrant ship sailing between Londonderry and Quebec. She was wrecked against the south side of the Isle of Islay in 1847 during a storm. 241 people lost their lives. Three crewmen survived. Build and Service The Exmouth was built in North Shields, Northumberland in 1818. She had one deck and three masts. She worked initially between Hull and Greenland as a whaler, under Wright & company. Her master was Thompson, then Hart. Lloyd's Register recorded a large repair carried out in 1829 and some further repairs in 1833. She sailed between English ports and Quebec and Miramichi for the rest of her working life. Her crew worked under Masters Hart, Greig, Eden and her final captain Isaac Booth. A number of incidents were noted in her service. On 16 January 1839, the Exmouth, under Mr. Eden came \\"into contact\\" with Rainbow during a gale at Bridlington. Rainbow foundered, and her crew was rescued by the Exmouth. On 17 December 1843, she \\"got up onto the beach\\" near Yarmouth while sailing between Shields and London. She was assisted off the sand and continued on her way. On 2 March 1844 she was run into by an unidentified ship in Robin Hood's Bay. She lost her bowsprit and jib boom and her bright heads were strained. Loss at sea Fishing out the bodies of the Exmouth by John Francis Campbell According to Lloyd's List, Exmouth left Londonderry on 23 April 1847. Eyewitness reports after the wreck reported that she left port in the early hours of Sunday 25 April 1847. The ship was registered for 165.5 passengers. Children counted as one half and infants were not counted at all. 241 seems to be the accepted number of souls on board for her last voyage. There were three survivors of the wreck. The description of events is based upon their reports to authorities in the subsequent days. The ship left Londonderry in light winds, but met severe gales on the following two days. A life boat was lost and sails were damaged in the heavy winds and waves on Monday 26 April. The Captain tried to keep close to the coast in the hope that they could reach a harbour to make repairs to the ship. On Tuesday evening, conditions had not improved. A light was seen to starboard that the witnesses claimed the Captain thought was Tory Island off the coast of Ireland. This would have given the ship ample sea room to manoeuvre. However it quickly became clear that the light was in fact the lighthouse on the Rhinns of Islay. Despite the crews efforts, the ship became caught in the broken water and was dashed broadside against the rocks at 12.30am on Wednesday 26 April. The Captain was already on the maintop acting as lookout. Eight of the crew initially joined him, but five descended again to attempt to reach safety from the foretop. Of the four men left on the maintop, the three seamen used the rigging to gain a footing among the rock crags. They spoke briefly to the Captain before a wave washed him away and dragged the ship back out to sea. There was no time for the ship's passengers to attempt to abandon ship. Most probably did not even leave their cramped berths. They were all lost. Aftermath The grave of the crew of the Exmouth Castle The three surviving crewmen, all from South Shields, spent the night in a crevice. In the morning they made their way to a nearby farmhouse. Attempts by the islanders to effect a rescue were in vain as the ship had been broken into fragments. The factor of the island arranged transport for the survivors to Glasgow where they made their report. 108 bodies had been recovered by 4 June. They were mostly of women and children. Their bodies were described as both naked and badly mutilated. They were interred by local men in a \\"beautiful spot\\" nearby. A Government emigration agent, Lieutenant Ramsay made a formal report accounting the lives lost as 220. These were described as 74 male emigrants, 62 female emigrants, 29 male children under fourteen years old, 34 female children under 14 years old, 9 infants, 3 cabin passengers and 9 crew members. The ship was in a \\"perfect state of repair... properly fitted out for emigrants... She was well provisioned, and was supplied with three suitable boats, with every requisite for their use, and two life buoys.\\" The cause of the disaster was agreed to be ultimately the adverse weather conditions. However, concerns were raised about the standard of crew on emigrant ships, both their number as well as their quality. The captain's failure to identify the lighthouse on Islay was of particular note. At the time, ship's Captains were encouraged to submit their qualifications and receive a certificate in competency, but there was no legal obligation to do so.

The district is located near the Fallasburg Bridge, where Covered Bridge Road crosses the Flat River in Vergennes Township, Michigan. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1999. History In about 1837, brothers John Wesley (1812-96) and Silas S. Fallass came to West Michigan about 1837 from Tompkins County, New York. The area was being surveyed, and in 1839 was opened for purchase. The Fallass brothers acquired by pre-emption the a section of land where Fallasburg now located. Later that year, they constructed a sawmill on the Flat River, and in 1840 constructed a matching gristmill. J. Wesley Fallass built his own house soon after, and the unplatted hamlet of Fallassburgh (later Fallasburg) prospered as more people moved to the area surrounding the mills. A school was constructed in 1842, and a post office was established in 1849. By 1860 there were two general stores in the small village, as well as a blacksmith and wagonmaker. In 1864, the saw mill was purchased by Charles Hecox, who began a small chair factory. By the same time, the gristmill had five employees, and did nearly $20,000 in business every year for surrounding farmers. A new school was constructed in 1867. In 1875, John Wesley Fallass's sons took over operation of the mill. However, the 1850s and 1860s were the high point for Fallasburg's economy. Soon the railroad network criss-crossed Michigan, making neighboring Lowell a boomtown, but bypassing Fallasburg completely. At the same time, the sawmill closed and was torn down in 1878. The gristmill, now competing with more modern mills, declined and was torn down in 1912. Several businesses and residences were destroyed by fire, and in 1905 the post office was closed. Even though Fallasburg declined in the last 1800s and early 1900s, it did not disappear. Because it was somewhat isolated location and the much of the area was owned by local government, the remnants of the hamlet survived, reasonably intact, into the 21st century. In addition, in later years, the Fallasburg Historical Society was dedicated to preserving the site and its open spaces from development. Thus, Fallasburg is notable as one of the few pioneer-era settlements in Michigan which survived the disruption of the railroads with a substantial portion of its historic character intact. Description The Fallasburg Historic District contains 14 historic structures, as well as a cemetery and the remains of a sawmill and gristmill. The structures include 12 houses, a schoolhouse, and Fallasburg Bridge. These structures primarily date from the early 1840s to the late 1860s, and are vernacular frame buildings with little decoration. Some have simple Greek Revival details, but only two structures have even the even the basic Greek Revival gable returns.

He was made keeper of Dumbarton Castle in 1620, the position was in the gift of the Lennox family. Mongavlin Castle Margaret was a Catholic, and she was converted from her Catholicism by a prisoner in the castle, Alexander Simpson (1570-1639), minister of Dryburgh and Merton, in 1621.John Howie, Biographia Scotica (Edinburgh, 1796), p. 554.

Prisoners at Dumbarton were usually expected to pay for their food. In 1625, Sir John Stewart of Methven undertook to have 16 \\"fensible men in ordinary\\" in the castle, as a garrison to keep watch and ward, and his successor Sir John Stewart of Traquair was charged to do the same. Methven was said to have been lax in his duties at Dumbarton, spending time in Ireland at Mongavlin Castle which he had acquired and built in 1611 and his lands in Raphoe in Portloughe, both in Donegal.

However, other causes have been pointed out, such as demands for democratic reform, the Causeway Bay Books disappearances, or the fear of losing a \\"high degree of autonomy\\" in general. The Hong Kong protests are unique in this respect from democracy protests in general, which are often provoked by economic grievances.Dawn Brancati. 2016. Democracy Protests: Origins, Features, and Significance. New York: Cambridge University Press. Subsequent actions by the police, such as mass arrests and police violence, as well as what was perceived to be an illegitimate legislative process of the bill, sparked additional protests throughout the city. Causes =Democratic reform= One underlying cause of the protests could be what people consider to be slow pace of democratic reforms. At the time of the protests, half of the lawmakers of the Legislative Council (LegCo) were directly elected as geographical constituencies, while the rest were returned by functional constituencies, where only selected parts of the electorate had a vote. This ran counter to a section of the Hong Kong population's ongoing demand for universal suffrage since the handover of Hong Kong to China in 1997. Indeed, the ultimate aim of achieving universal suffrage is stated in the Article 45 of the Basic Law, Hong Kong's de facto constitution: That said, the 2014‚Äì2015 Hong Kong electoral reform was voted down. That froze the number of members of the Election Committee, the organ that selects the Chief Executive, or the leader of the city, to 1,200, out of a population of over 7.5 million. Nevertheless the proposed reform only turned the aforementioned Election Committee to a nominating committee for the \\"universal suffrage\\" election of the Chief Executive. In the 6th Legislative Council, a few opposition lawmakers were disqualified after they were elected, namely Yau Wai-ching, Sixtus Leung, Lau Siu-lai, Yiu Chung-yim, Nathan Law and Leung Kwok-hung. These figures did not include people who were disqualified to be a candidate, such as Agnes Chow and Ventus Lau. The court later overturned the disqualification of Agnes Chow and Ventus Lau, years after the by- elections. The Economist stated Hong Kong people are disillusioned with the promise that \\"the [Chinese Communist Party] eventually fulfil its pledge to give them more democracy\\", as after the 2014 Umbrella Movement and the 2014‚Äì2015 electoral reform, \\"[the] promise would only mean only the chance to vote for someone the party considered royal\\". While the Financial Times, on 12 June 2019 (date of an anti-bill protest), stated, \\"Most people in Hong Kong, however, find it hard to believe that Ms. Lam brought this crisis [editor note: extradition bill] upon herself with no help whatsoever from Beijing\\". =Fear of losing rights and freedoms= An example of Hong Kong losing its freedoms is its steady fall on the Democracy Index. Despite universal suffrage being part of Hong Kong's basic law in the 2019 report Hong Kong scored 6.02/10 classing it as a flawed democracy, being only 0.02 points of a hybrid regime. Hong Kong also only scored 3.59/10 for Electoral process and pluralism, this was the lowest score in the category for a flawed democracy and scoring lower than some authoritarian countries. Hong Kong came 75 out of 167 and China 153 out of 167. With the approach of 2047, when the Basic Law is set to expire, along with the constitutional guarantees enshrined within it, sentiments of an uncertain future drove youth to join the protests against the extradition bill. Causeway Bay Books and Xiao Jianhua disappearances Even before the proposed 2019 Hong Kong extradition bill, Hong Kong citizens suspected that mainland Chinese personnel engaged in extra-judicial renditions in the Special Administrative Region (SAR), despite such actions being a breach of Basic Law. In late 2015, Chinese government agents kidnapped the owner and several staff members of Hong Kong-based Causeway Bay Books, a bookstore that sold politically sensitive publications, to the Mainland as suspects in breaking Mainland law. Lam Wing-kee, who was held in solitary confinement for five months and unable to make any phone calls, claims that he had no choice but to co-operate in reading a scripted forced confession of guilt. He was denied legal representation, forced to implicate others in bookselling crimes, and requested to turn over information about anonymous authors and customers. \\"They wanted to lock you up until you go mad,\\" he said. Upon his release to Hong Kong he went public with the media to tell his story. Because he had no family in mainland China who could be punished, Lam said that it was easier for him to come forward. He said that he had to be courageous: \\"I thought about it for two nights before I decided [to] tell you all what happened, as originally and completely as I could ... I also want to tell the whole world. This isn't about me, this isn't about a bookstore, this is about everyone.\\" In 2017, Xiao Jianhua, a billionaire from Mainland China who had resided in Hong Kong, had also been abducted and disappeared. These incidents are considered as one of the contributing causes of the protests. Critics have stated that the Central Government is \\"chipping away the independence of [Hong Kong]'s courts and news media.\\" There is also fear that \\"the authorities will use [the bill] to send dissidents, activists and others in Hong Kong, including foreign visitors, to face trial in mainland courts, which are controlled by the party.\\" =Legislative process of 2019 Hong Kong extradition bill= The government's attitude on legislating the Hong Kong extradition bill was seen as sparking the protests. The government was viewed as unwilling to budge, despite opposition from various sectors of the community. For instance, businessmen usually in support of the government opposed the bill. One example was Michael Tien, a legislative councillor. He openly urged Chief Executive Carrie Lam to withdraw the bill in May 2019. He also proposed an alternative route to handle the murder case of Poon Hiu- wing,The murder in Taiwan was the government's stated reason to revise the existing extradition bill in order to extradite the suspect from Hong Kong to Taiwan.. He claimed that his proposal received support from the business sector. However, the government proceeded to move the bill forward. Other sectors also reacted. A record-breaking number of lawyers participated in a silent march against the bill on 6 June. On 9 June, reportedly over a million citizens demonstrated when the Legislative Council was about to resume the process of the second reading. The demonstration took place since pro- government (and pro-Beijing) lawmakers held a majority in the Legislative Council and would mean the ultimate passage of the bill.Despite the pro- government has a majority, it was after the disqualifications of lawmakers and re-election of some of the seats. Moreover, they has a majority in functional constituencies, but almost the same number of seats from geographical constituencies. 5 out of 6 disqualified lawmakers (see above section) were from geographical constituencies. Lastly, Michael Tien was a rouge member of the pro-government camp in the legislation of the extradition bill. The proposed resumption of the second reading sparked the 12 June protest that became a civil conflict. On 15 June, Carrie Lam declared the indefinite suspension of the legislative process. However, from 15 June until 4 September, Lam refused to withdraw the bill. Her reluctance stood against the protesters' demands. On 23 October the bill was withdrawn but the protests have widened for universal suffrage for Legislative Council and Chief Executive election and the resignation of Carrie Lam. =Accusation of police violence on 12 June protest and subsequent events that related to the police= A range of sectors find the police response to protests to have sustained the movements. These include participants of subsequent protests (those after 9 June), as well as many pan-democrats lawmakers, academicians and critics, although they differ in attributing the size of the responsibility to the force. Moreover, even Pierre Chan, a legislator that declared his neutrality between the police and protesters in July, participated in an assembly of physicians and nurses that condemned excessive use of police force in August 2019. Protesters and others highlighted instances where the use of police force was considered excessive. For example, on 12 June, even though protesters gathered around CITIC Tower, an area where protests were theoretically legal with the issuance from the police of a permit that known officially as the Letter of No Objection, the police still used tear gas pellets. Councillors of the Independent Police Complaints Council later stated that if the use of tear gas was indeed proved, it was unsatisfactory (). The actions of the police, at least in part, contributed to the large turnout of the subsequent protest. The organiser claimed that 2 million citizens participated in the march on 16 June, although other sources estimated smaller turnouts. Nevertheless, most sources concluded that it was an all-time high record. Meanwhile, the negligence of the police and the accused collusion with the criminals during Yuen Long attack on 21 July, had spread the protest into Yuen Long, a satellite town in the New Territories. Under Public Order Ordinance, protests are required to obtain the Letter of No Objection to stage a rally or protest. However, the police instead issued a Letter of Objection days before, declaring any such protests illegal . Nevertheless, many citizens still gathered there. They expressed their criticisms of the police by visiting Yuen Long with excuses such as shopping. Some of the protesters engaged in violent actions during 27 July protest. However, when the protesters were leaving and retreating upon police request, the police also used force to try to arrest protesters. Once again, pan- democrats lawmakers had signed a petition to condemn the violence of the police and accuse the force used by the police during the clearance of the location of nearly engaging in a revenge (). They also stated that issuing Letters of Objection would create a vicious circle that only would instigate more citizens to protest. Indeed, protests did not cease. More and more tear gas were used by the police, as well as the use of bean bag rounds and Rubber bullets. Not only on the Hong Kong Island, the use of force by the police had spread along with the protests, which police had used tear gas in most of the satellite towns of the city. On 5 August protest along, the police had used around 800 rounds of tear gas. Many organisations have criticised the actions of the police from that single day. The Hong Kong branch of Amnesty International condemned the police behaviour during the events. For example, on 12 August, after more than 2 months of the protests (since 9 June, or more than 2 months if counting April protests) and right after the 11 August protests, the branch had declared \\"Hong Kong police have once again used tear gas and rubber bullets in a way that have fallen short of international standards. Firing at retreating protesters in confined areas where they had little time to leave goes against the purported objective of dispersing a crowd\\". Arrested protesters have alleged sexual violence by police officers. Some assembly of the protests were dedicated to the theme of protesting police sexual violence.  Allegations of foreign influence The Chinese Central Government accused the protests of being affected by foreign influence. Ip Kwok-him, a former pro-establishment lawmaker of the LegCo and a standing Executive Council member, also made a similar accusation. A senior officer from the HKPF told CNN that \\"they have seen no evidence that foreign governments financed or inspired the protest movement.\\" in August, during a background briefing to a group of journalists. Impact After the June demonstrations, protesters had stated their 5 key demands. One version contained \\"Implementation of genuine universal suffrage\\", despite some reported version in June, substituted \\"universal suffrage\\" to \\"Carrie Lam resign\\" or the reported version just had 4 key demands. The other 4 key demands were \\"withdraw the extradition bill\\"; \\"officially retract characterisation of the protests as a riot\\"; \\"drop charges against protesters\\"; as well as \\"launch an independent commission of inquiry into matters relating to the anti-extradition bill protests\\".

It is featured in the middle of the Flag of Sevastopol on a red background. From 21 July 1893, until the October Revolution in 1917, Sevastopol, under the Russian Empire, used a royal coat of arms, which featured the monograms of Tsars Nicholas I and Alexander II. The royal coat of arms was disposed by the Soviet Union, and the city went without an official coat of arms until 1969. On 12 February 1969, city council approved a new design containing the Gold Star medal and a silhouette of the Monument to the Sunken Ships. Following the independence of Ukraine, the Representative of the President of Ukraine in Sevastopol, began a review of the previous coat of arms in 1992. A jury decided to return to the royal coat of arms used in the 19th century. A legal technicality, where the decision by the city council to approve the previous coat of arms went unreverted, resulted in the city having two official coat of arms until 2000. On 21 April 2000, Sevastopol City Council passed resolution number 518 titled \\"\\" (On the coat of arms of the Hero City of Sevastopol), which legitimized the Soviet-era design as the city's only official coat of arms. As a result of the 2014 Russian annexation of Crimea, the city no longer had an official coat of arms. Since then, several attempts were made to reconfirm either of the previous designs, but to no avail. On 1 November 2018, Governor Dmitry Ovsyannikov made a decree allowing the Soviet-era design to be used as the city's coat of arms until the Legislative Assembly of Sevastopol approves a design. The Soviet-era design, although popular with residents, has been struck down by the Legislative Assembly on July 3, 2019, due to the criticisms on its design by the Heraldic Council of the President of the Russian Federation. History =19th century= The royal coat of arms approved for use in 1893 featuring the monograms of Nicholas I (left) and Alexander II (right) In the 1800s, the citizens of Sevastopol created their own coat of arms (pictured) and used it unofficially until a submission of the emblem was presented to city council in 1892. The council approved the design in 1893, and on 21 July 1893, the Russian Empire's department of Heroldia approved the emblem to be used as the city's official coat of arms. Design The escutcheon is a square top with a \\"French\\" base. The canton features the coat of arms for the Taurida Governorate. The rest of the shield depicts an argent griffin on a gules field. The crest contains another sable double-headed eagle with two imperial crowns and one enlarged between the two heads, representative of the Russian Empire‚Äîthe crowns are tied together with the ribbon of the Order of Saint Andrew. The eagle sits on top of an or crown of the city's mayor. The Ribbon of Saint George surrounds the shield, entangling two diagonally crossed anchors, symbolizing the port city, and two flag poles. The flag poles contain gules banners featuring the monograms of Tsars Nicholas I (left) and Alexander II (right) enclosed by the chain of the Order of Saint Andrew. =20th century= As a result of the October Revolution in 1917, Sevastopol lost its royal coat of arms. The city went fifty-two years without an official coat of arms until a design contest was held for a new emblem. Council approved the Soviet-era design on 12 February 1969, submitted by Sergei Shakhunov and Nadezhda Krylova. In October 1992, the Representative of the President of Ukraine in Sevastopol, started a review of the city's coat of arms. The jury reverted to the royal emblem without reverting the previous approval, thus the city had two official coats of arms until 2000. On 21 May 1997, Ukraine passed the law regarding local self-government. Article 22 dictated that villages, towns, and cities may have their own symbols, flags, and coat of arms reflecting their own historical traditions and cultures as determined by local council. On 21 April 2000, Sevastopol City Council passed resolution number 518 titled \\"\\" (On the coat of arms of the Hero City of Sevastopol), which made the Soviet-era design the official and only coat of arms of the city. Design The escutcheon shape features a square top with a \\"French\\" base. The field is divided party per bend, or diagonally from the upper left to the lower right, with an azure dexter base, which represents the sea, and an argent sinister chief, which represents the white stone of Inkerman. The azure corner features a silhouette of the Monument to the Sunken Ships, while the argent corner contains a Gold Star medal, symbolic of the victory during the Second World War. An or laurel branch stretches between the two partitions in the sinister base. Alternatively, some versions of the coat of arms feature the ribbon of the Order of Saint Andrew and a banner with the Russian word for Sevastopol, –°–µ–≤–∞—Å—Ç–æ–ø–æ–ª—å. Usage The coat of arms of Sevastopol is the primary feature of the Flag of Sevastopol appearing in the centre of a red field. It is also shown on the fuselage of Ka-27 and Mi-8 helicopters in Russia's Black Sea Fleet. =21st century= Following the annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation in 2014, the city no longer had an official coat of arms. The Heraldic Council of the President of the Russian Federation approved the option to revert to the previous monarchical coat of arms with the addition of the Gold Star medal as the emblem's order. On 6 February 2015, deputy Alexander Kovshar presented Bill No. 19/102 to the Legislative Assembly of Sevastopol, proposing that the city's official coat of arms be a variant of the monarchical version chosen in 1893, excluding the Tauridan coat of arms, and adding the Gold Star as its order. The bill sparked an uproar among residents because of the lack of consultation. An appeal was made in March 2015, to the government and was signed by numerous citizens and notable residents. The appeal demands that the Legislative Assembly immediately recall the bill, discuss the feasibility of implementing a brand new coat of arms, and have a Russian-wide competition to decide upon said new coat of arms. , the Chairman of Sevastopol City Council when the resolution 518 was passed to approve the Soviet-era design, was among the signatories. The bill was recalled on 19 October 2015. Chairwoman of the Legislative Assembly, , announced that a referendum on the coat of arms was planned for March 18, alongside the 2018 Russian presidential election, however it was later cancelled due to time constraints. On 25 May 2018, the City of Sevastopol unveiled an online poll asking residents which design they preferred to be the city's official coat of arms. 79% preferred the Soviet-era design, 18% favoured the Russian Empire-era design, while 3% wished for a brand new coat of arms. On 8 June 2018, a bill was tabled to the Legislative Assembly, which would have legitimized the design chosen in 2000, as the city's official coat of arms. On 20 June 2018, the heraldic council objected to the proposal due to its violation of heraldic design principals. Infringements include the gold border, which indicates the city is of a lower status, contradictory of Sevastopol's city of federal importance status; the Gold Star, which is in the field instead of the shield's order or support; the image of the Monument to the Sunken Ships; the structure of the shield, which is interpreted as combining two emblems into one shield, contradictory of the city's history; and the imposition of the Gold Star and laurel branch on a silver background, which violates the Rule of tincture where a metal (or) may not be placed on another metal (argent). The Legislative Assembly, on July 20, rejected the bill with ten votes in favour (one away from the eleven minimum required to pass); chairwoman Altabaeva cited the heraldic council's conclusions for the rejection and insisted the decision should be decided via referendum. Sevastopolitans have been divided about the issue; supporters of the royal coat of arms, backed by former governor Aleksei Chaly, criticise the Soviet- era design's socialist imagery, while supporters of the Soviet-era emblem feel as though they are having a royal coat of arms imposed on them. On 1 November 2018, Governor Dmitry Ovsyannikov made a decree allowing the Soviet-era design to be used as the city's coat of arms until the appropriate laws are put in place. On 3 July 2019, he introduced a bill to the Legislative Assembly, which again attempted to confirm the Soviet-era emblem as the official coat of arms. The bill was rejected on the basis of the Heraldic Council's previous analysis of the coat of arms.

History  For parts of the population, the memory of what happened in certain locations in the last years of the war had something traumatic about it. People knew about the concentration camp Hailfingen-Tailfingen and about the events that happened there. However, the population and local politicians refused to create a place of remembrance. A temporary memorial stone was desecrated in 1985. It was not until the mid-1990s that a change in consciousness began. By 2010, all the necessary conditions had been met and ideas had been specified so that a multi-part concentration camp memorial could be erected.  Memorial  At the western end of the former military airfield, the community of Hailfingen erected a memorial to the Jewish victims in May 2010, which was inaugurated on 6 June 2010. The sculptor Rudolf Kurz created a 2.5 m high and 5 m wide uneven triangle at the base line from closely grouted aluminium bars, so that a closed surface is created. This triangle stands in front of a 5 m long and 2 m high wall of untreated fair- faced concrete, at a close distance and offset laterally. The names of all the 601 concentration camp prisoners, survivors and perished, are engraved. The renunciation of an alphabetical order or by country of origin, forces viewers to go slowly when reading.  Exhibition and documentation centre in Tailfinger Town Hall  Exhibition and documentation room in Tailfinger Town Hall Above all, the private initiatives and extensive research by Volker Mall and Harald Roth were the impetus for the establishment of a multimedia exhibition space on the ground floor of the Tailfinger Town Hall. The target groups are primarily school classes with pupils aged 14 and over. In addition to modern touch-screen monitors, a room-long chronological table over two metres high has been created, from which the connections can be understood. An aerial panorama of the airfield and its surroundings was taken from several aerial photographs taken in 1944/1945. The \\"Number Book\\" lists the names of all Jewish prisoners. However, the focus is on the individual fates of the camp inmates and the testimonies of contemporary witnesses from the G√§u region. The entire stock of digital documents can be used for research purposes. The entire exhibition site has been deliberately designed for possible extensions. At the end of 2008 a documentary film was made: \\"Das KZ- Au√üenlager Hailfingen/Tailfingen\\" by Bernhard Koch in cooperation with Gegen Vergessen - F√ºr Demokratie.  Cemetery in Tailfingen  Memorial plaque at Tailfinger cemetery On 2 June 1945, the dead of the mass grave were recovered from the concentration camp and buried in the Tailfinger cemetery. The following was engraved on a wooden cross: \\"72 unknown concentration camp prisoners rest here‚Äú. In the 1960s, the sons of Ignac Klein erected a gravestone. In 1986, commemorative plaques were erected at the Tailfinger cemetery from the community and the Jewish religious community of W√ºrttemberg at a memorial service for the victims of the camp. As part of the memorial, a plaque with the names of the buried was erected in 2010.  Memorial path, Reusten quarry  A memorial path is set up. It also includes the former quarry at Reusten, where many of the prisoners had to go to forced labor every day. One of the tipping wagons in use at the time was set up as a Memento.

The church was built in 1518 and rebuilt twice, in 1747 and 1894. It was completely destroyed during the 1953 Ionian earthquake, like most buildings on Zakynthos. During the sixties, the church was built in its current form. A renovation took place in 1994. Before the earthquake there were valuable relics, statues, a large organ, artistic candlesticks and valuable priestly robes in the church. Near the church was a building with a large library and extensive photo gallery. Among other things, a large part of the statues, the organ, the historical archive and the library were lost during the great fire that broke out after the earthquake. Residents who have seen the church with their own eyes before the earthquake still call it the jewel of the island. Current church Interior of the current church (2014). The current church was built during the 1960s and has retained most of the external characteristics of the old church. Inside the church are the few remaining objects of the destroyed church like the statue of St. Mark, two of the large candlesticks that are to the left and right of the pedestal of the statue, the Holy Cross, the small marble baptismal font and other smaller objects. The small marble font stood at the entrance to the old church and was used for holy water rites. When one enters, there is a statue of Saint Paraskevi on the right. Together with the one of St. Mark, they are the only two statues that have been saved from the fire. The marble slabs of the old have been laid on the floor of the new church. The current church was renovated in the first quarter of 1994. Among other things, the floor, the altar, the pedestal of the statue of St. Mark, the foot of the monstrance containing the Eucharist, the pulpit, the lighting and part of the furniture were renovated.

He was the 25th pontiff of Uttaradi Math and served the pontificate from March 1744 - 9 March 1783. Satyabodha Tirtha was a great yogi and was honoured by both Hindu and Muslim rulers of his time. Satyabodha Tirtha enjoyed a good fame as a miracle-man. Almost all the princes of the South India used to worship him and were his ardent disciples. Murari Rao of Gooty, Raghoji Bhosale and Fateh Singh Rao Gaekwad, were his great disciples. Satyabodha Tirtha Swamiji's mission of peace has played a prominent role during this time. He earned a reputation as the greatest of Madhva saints of his time for his un-rivaled scholarship, miraculous achievements and dynamism as the pontiff of the Uttaradi Math. So many were his achievements and so well was he liked, admired and respected by people of all castes and creeds, rich and poor, that the Uttaradi Math (where Satyabodha's Brindavana is present) in Savanur got the name as Satyabodha Math after him. Biography Satyabodha Tirtha was born in Raichur which is located between Krishna and Tungabhadra rivers in the Indian state of Karnataka. Most of the information about his life is derived from hegiography: Satyabodha Vijaya written by Kanchi Vadiraj Achar. Born in 1710 into a traditional Kannada Deshastha Madhva Brahmin household, he was named Ramacharya. His father name is Hariyacharya and mother name is Aralabai. He was born with Markhandeya rishi amsa. He started studying shastras at the age of 8. The name conferred on him when he became the head of the Uttaradi Math monastery was Satyabodha Tirtha. On assuming the pontificate of the Uttaradi Mutt, he built an excellent Brindavana to his guru at Mana Madurai and performed a great aradhana in his honour. Satyabodha Tirtha travelled extensively all over India winning over adversaries in philosophical scholarly discussions acquiring shishyas and considerable wealth, landed properties and tamrapatras from Kings and Nawabs. =Peace treatise between two Kings= Satyabodha Tirtha has played a prominent part in the history of India. Once it so happened that Murari Rao of Gooty was occupying the Fort of Trichanapalli. Nizam-ul-mulk had put a seize to this fort in order to get back this fort. He was unsuccessful though he tried it for 3 months. Then the Nizam was told that if Satyabodha Swami were brought to Trichanappally from Ramanathpur and kept in jail, Murari Rao who was an ardent devotee would come out of the fort and yield. Satyabodha Tirtha brought about treaties between the these two Warring Kings and established peace in the Country. In culture Satyabodha Vijaya is a kavya of twentyone sargas written by Kanchi Vadiraj Acharya who was his disciple. The Mahakavya describes Satyabodha's life in detail. He was a saint of marvellous powers, his life is full of thrilling events. Let alone Hindus, even Mohammedans worshipped him with great reverence, Tippu Sultan, Nawab of Ramnad, Nawab of Savanur and many other Muslim princes felt it an honour to be puppets in his hands. There is also another work known as Guru Katha Kalpa Taru which also gives details about Satyabodha.

Early life and career Sands was born on May 26, 1806, in New York City. He was the son of Joseph Sands (1772‚Äì1825), a banker with Prime, Ward & King, and Maria Theresa (n√©e Kampfel) Sands (1782‚Äì1846). Among his family members was his paternal half-uncle Robert Charles Sands, a noted poet. He was a grandson of Mathias Kampfel and Comfort Sands, the merchant, banker and Continental Congressman. His paternal aunt, Cornelia Sands, was the wife of his father's banking partner, Nathaniel Prime. Sands graduated from Columbia College in 1824 and practiced as an attorney in New York. Personal life On March 15, 1830, Sands was married to Susan Bard (1812‚Äì1838) of Hyde Park, New York. Susan was the daughter of Catherine (n√©e Cruger) Bard and William Bard, founder and first president of the New York Life Insurance and Trust Company. Among her siblings were Anne Bard (wife of his first cousin, Edward Prime), Eliza Bard (wife of Rufus King Delafield), and John Bard (founder of Bard College with his wife, Margaret Taylor Johnston, daughter of merchant John Johnston and sister of John Taylor Johnston, founder of the Metropolitan Museum of Art). Together, they were the parents of five sons, including: * Joseph Sands (1830‚Äì1879), who married Charlotte Brion Foulke, daughter of Joseph Foulke, in 1855. * William Ferdinand Sands (1832‚Äì1857), who died unmarried. * Charles Edwin Sands (1835‚Äì1888), who married Letitia Campbell, daughter of John Campbell, in 1857. * Louis Joseph Sands (1836‚Äì1919), who married Ella Louise Faye, daughter of Thomas Faye, in 1893. * Arthur Sands (b. 1837), who married Miriam Maas.

The line was opened in 1860; it was a single line of seven miles length, and its route was in Lincolnshire and Rutland, England. There was talk of forming a through line with the Stamford and Essendine Railway, which was also at Essendine station, but on the other side of the main line, and this direct connection never took place. The Bourn and Essendine Railway was the first railway to reach Bourn, which later became a local focal point for single-track railways. The company never made money and sold itself to the GNR in 1864. The connection at Essendine faced north, making through running towards Peterborough awkward, and the line never developed. It was closed completely in 1951. Promotion Bourne railway stationThe Great Northern Railway opened its main line between Peterborough and Grantham in 1852.Robin Leleux, A Regional History of the Railways of Great Britain: volume 9: The East Midlands, David and Charles (Publishers) Limited, Newton Abbot, 1976, , page 197 Bourne (then spelt Bourn, until 1872Vic Mitchell and Keith Smith, Lines Around Stamford, Middleton Press, Midhurst, 2016, ) was a significant market town, and influential people in the town saw that a railway connection was important to its continued prosperity. Stamford already had a branch line: the Stamford and Essendine Railway had opened in October 1856. An army general, a clergyman and some tradespeople in the town put together a proposal which went to Parlaiment as a Bill.Ernest F Carter, An Historical Geography of the Railways of the British Isles, Cassell, London, 1959, page 284 The Bourn and Essendine Railway was incorporated on 12 August 1857Wrotteseley; Carter and Grant say 12 August 1857. with powers to construct a railway from Bourne to the main line station at Essendine. Authorised share capital was ¬£48,000.John Wrottesley, The Great Northern Railway: volume I: Origins and Development, B T Batsford Limited, London, 1979, , pages 142 and 143Stewart E Squires, The Lost Railways of Lincolnshire, Castlemead Publications, Ware, 1988, , pages 125 to 128Peter Paye, Great Northern Railway Branches from Stamford, Lightmoor Press, Lydney, 2017, Donald J Grant, Directory of the Railway Companies of Great Britain, Matador Publishers, Kibworth Beauchamp, 2017, , page 61 There were thoughts that this line and the Stamford and Essendine Railway might together form part of a long distance railway between the Midlands and the East Coast, but this never developed.Charles H Grinling, History of the Great Northern Railway, 1845 ‚Äì 1895, Methuen and Co, London, 1898, page 205 Moreover it had been considered to run through trains between Stamford and Spalding, so that the Bourne line was to cross all of GNR tracks at Essendine, so as to use the Stamford and Essendine Railway platform, on the down side of the main line. The GNR forbade that idea; an alternative put forward by the Bourne directors was to enter Essendine from the south to the S&ER; platform, but that would still need to cross all the GNR lines, and it was also ruled out. Opening Braceborough Spa HaltIt had been intended to open the line on 1 May 1860, but the Board of Trade inspecting officer's requirements delayed opening until Wednesday 16 May 1860.Paul Anderson, Railways of Lincolnshire, Irwell Press, Oldham, 1992, , pages 27 and 28 It was the first railway to reach Bourne: it was worked from the outset by the Great Northern Railway for 50% of receipts. In the first week these amounted to ¬£101, considered to be a good result. It was a single line; land and bridges were laid out for providing double track later, but this was never done. The Stamford and Essendine Railway already made a junction at Essendine, on the west side of the station, while the Bourne line joined at the east side. Both branches unhelpfully faced north. The line was 6 miles 51 chains in length, and there were two viaducts on the line. The company purchased Old Red Hall, stated to be a fine Elizabethan mansion, at Bourne for use as offices. Stations were at Braceborough Spa (a platform only, serving a nearby place where healing waters could be taken), Thurlby (which had a small goods yard) and Bourn. There was a siding at Wilsthorpe, east of Braceborough, serving Peterborough Corporation Waterworks. In the mid-1930s a halt was provided at this point on the main road, named Wilsthorpe Crossing Halt. As a turntable had not been installed at Bourn, the line had to be worked by a tank engine. Money problems The little company was always in financial difficulty, and the GNR was losing money on the working arrangement. It gave notice in 1863 that it would discontinue working, but it was persuaded to carry on for another year at 60% of the receipts instead of the previous 50%. It became obvious to the directors of the little company that there was no future in independence, and the agreed to sell to the GNR. This took effect on 16 May 1864, authorised by Act of 25 July 1864. Limited development Bourne stationThe north-facing connection at Essendine was a constant sticking point, and the GNR obtained powers in July 1865 for a southward spur at Essendine to allow direct running to and from the Peterborough direction, but this was never built. Bourne station developed as the focal point for trains from King's Lynn via Spalding, and from Sleaford, as well as Essendine. At this time there were eight trains each way between Essendine and Bourne. In 1894 the Saxby (Leicestershire) extension from Bourne was opened by the Midland and Great Northern Joint Railway. For most of its life there were eight trains each way with two extra on Thursdays and Saturdays. In 1938 one Down train had no intermediate stops, one Up stopped only at Thurlby. Four stopped only if required at Braceborough Spa, otherwise all stopped at all stations. From 1927 until closure the branch train was composed of an articulated twin set built out of two coaches from Ivatt steam- motor cars. Closure Bourne never became an important enough commercial centre to justify a decent train service making a connection at Essendine, and complete closure of the branch came on 18 June 1951.

By 1854, the union was wealthy enough to rent its own premises, the Spinners Institute, and in 1873 it purchased the building, by which time the union's name was the Preston Operative Cotton Spinners' Association. In 1870, it was a founder member of the new Amalgamated Association of Operative Cotton Spinners. In 1886 it became the Association of Operative Cotton Spinners of Preston and its Vicinity, at which time it had 760 members, a figure which remained steady for many years. In 1905, the union became the Preston Provincial Operative Cotton Spinners' Association, with the small Gregson Lane Operative Spinners' Association and Kirkham Operative Spinners' Association both affiliating. In 1920, the Farrington Operative Spinners' Association also affiliated, and the union for the first time admitted piecers, taking overall membership to a peak of 1,464. The Gregson Lane affiliate was closed in 1939, while the Farrington and Kirkham ones survived until 1959.

The waterway opened in 1999 and has become a popular tourist destination featuring many attractions. Downtown OKC Partnership and the Bricktown Association held a 20th anniversary celebration in 2019. History Part of the canal in 2016 The idea of a canal running through Bricktown started to first become noticeable in the late 1880s, in 1890 following a year of construction a canal had opened; however, two days later the canal had naturally drained itself leaving an empty waterbed through the area. Nearly a century later in the late 1990s in an attempt to bring \\"spark\\" to the area the idea begin to once again gain support, a canal was built and opened on July 2, 1999. The canal was funded by voters in the city who approved a temporary one- cent sales tax increase as part of the Metropolitan Area Projects (MAPS). It has proved to be a success for the area spurring over $109 million spent in development.

Brandon Gann jumped into the canal in an attempt to save Seeley was also shocked; Seeley died as a result of his injuries while Gann was taken to a hospital in critical condition and later recovered. The city council agreed to settle a claim by paying $169,650 to Gann and agreed to design and install new up-to-date lighting fixtures across the entirety of the canal. A second claim was settled when the city agreed to pay $175,000 to the estate of Seely.

The construction is defined in RFC 8452. About AES-GCM-SIV is designed to preserve both privacy and integrity even if nonces are repeated. To accomplish this, encryption is a function of a nonce, the plaintext message, and optional additional associated data (a.k.a. AAD). In the event a nonce is misused (i.e. used more than once), nothing is revealed except in the case that same message is encrypted multiple times with the same nonce. When that happens, an attacker is able to observe repeat encryptions, since encryption is a deterministic function of the nonce and message. However, beyond that, no additional information is revealed to the attacker. For this reason, AES-GCM- SIV is an ideal choice in cases that unique nonces cannot be guaranteed, such as multiple servers or network devices encrypting messages under the same key without coordination. Operation Like Galois/Counter Mode, AES-GCM-SIV combines the well-known counter mode of encryption with the Galois mode of authentication. The key feature is the use of a synthetic initialization vector which is computed with Galois field multiplication using a construction called POLYVAL (a little-endian variant of Galois/Counter Mode's GHASH). The POLYVAL is run over the combination of nonce, plaintext, and additional data, so that the IV is different for each combination. POLYVAL is defined over GF(2128) by the polynomial: : x^{128} + x^{127} + x^{126} + x^{121} + 1 Note that GHASH is defined over the \\"reverse\\" polynomial: : x^{128} + x^7 + x^2 + x + 1 This change provides efficiency benefits on little-endian architectures.

It was awarded to senior commanders for exceptional combat achievement; the majority of recipients received it for actions during the Russian Civil War.  History  Budyonny with his sword in the early 1920s After the October Revolution, the Order of the Red Banner, established in 1918, was the only Soviet decoration available to reward military personnel for their actions in the Russian Civil War. Instead of awarding the Order of the Red Banner, the All-Russian Central Executive Committee (VTsIK) gave Sergey Kamenev and Vasily Shorin what it described as \\"weapons with the badge of the Order of the Red Banner\\" on 8 August 1919 in recognition of their victories on the Eastern Front against the White forces of Alexander Kolchak. The award consisted of a sword (shashka) that had a badge of the Order of the Red Banner of the Russian SFSR superimposed on a gilt hilt. It was reminiscent of the Saint George Sword given to senior commanders of the Russian Empire during World War I, and thus represented an unacknowledged return to the Tsarist award system. Semyon Budyonny and Mikhail Tukhachevsky received the award later that year. The practice of giving successful commanders ceremonial shashkas was legitimized by a decree of the VTsIk on 8 April 1920 following a request from the Revolutionary Military Council. The decree empowered the All-Russian Central Executive Committee (VTsIK) and the Revolutionary Military Council to award an honorary revolutionary weapon in the form of a shashka to senior field commanders for \\"special distinction in combat,\\" and established a process for award recommendations. Naval commanders were to receive a dirk with the same ornamentation, but none of them received the award during the period that it was issued. On the same day, Ieronim Uborevich received the award for his command of a field army during the North Caucasus Operation. Shortly afterwards, another VTsIK decree retroactively regularized the awards to Kamenev and Shorin, integrating the previous ceremonial weapon presentations into the new system. Honorary Revolutionary Weapon awarded to Kliment Voroshilov The next group of awards came in November 1920, when Mikhail Frunze, Kliment Voroshilov, Filipp Mironov, August Kork, and Nikolai Kashirin received honorary revolutionary weapons for their leadership during the Perekop‚ÄìChongar Offensive, while Semyon Timoshenko received one for his actions during the Polish‚ÄìSoviet War. Awards to eight commanders for actions either during the Russian Civil War or the suppression of the Kronstadt rebellion followed in 1921 and 1922. Kamenev and Budyonny were each awarded a second honorary revolutionary weapon on 5 January 1921 for further merits, this time in the form of a Mauser C96 pistol with the badge of the Order of the Red Banner embedded in the pistol grip. Plaques on the pistols were inscribed with the name of the recipient and the inscriptions \\"RSFSR\\" and \\"from the VTsIK.\\" C96 awarded to Budyonny The award was modified on 12 December 1924 by a decree of the Presidium of the Central Executive Committee of the Soviet Union, which replaced the 1920 decree. It expanded the definition of the award to include a personal revolver in addition to the sword. The decree stipulated that the badge of the Order of the Red Banner and a silver plaque inscribed \\"To an Honorable Soldier of the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army from the Central Executive Committee of the USSR\\" were to be inscribed on the revolver grip. The Honorary Revolutionary Weapon in sword form was last awarded to Stepan Vostretsov, its only recipient under the 1924 decree, on 23 April 1930 for his leadership during the Sino-Soviet War of 1929; no further issues of the firearm form occurred after those for Kamenev and Budyonny. The award never found a permanent place in the Soviet awards system, and the title Hero of the Soviet Union was established in 1934 as the highest distinction of the state. As a commemorative item, in 1968, gilt swords were presented to 26 marshals and generals in honor of the fiftieth anniversary of the Soviet Army.  Recipients  The Honorary Revolutionary Weapon as a shashka was awarded to 21 commanders, with Kamenev and Budyonny receiving both the shashka and pistol: * Sergey Kamenev (8 August 1919 and 5 January 1921) * Vasily Shorin (8 August 1919) * Semyon Budyonny (20 November 1919 and 5 January 1921) * Mikhail Tukhachevsky (17 December 1919) * Ieronim Uborevich (8 April 1920) * Mikhail Frunze (25 November 1920) * Kliment Voroshilov (25 November 1920) * Filipp Mironov (25 November 1920) * August Kork (25 November 1920) * Nikolai Kashirin (25 November 1920) * Semyon Timoshenko (28 November 1920) * Vladimir Nesterovich (5 January 1921) * Yakov Balakhonov (2 February 1921) * Vasily Vinnikov-Bessmertny (2 February 1921) * Alexander Yegorov (17 February 1921) * Yevgeny Kazansky (3 June 1921) * Grigory Kotovsky (20 September 1921) * Voldemar Roze (12 December 1921) * Grigory Khakhanyan (12 December 1921) * Ivan Kutyakov (28 April 1922) * Stepan Vostretsov (23 April 1930)  References  = Citations = = Bibliography =  Category:Military awards and decorations of the Soviet Union Category:Honorary weapons Category:Awards established in 1920 Category:Awards established in 1924 ","title":"Honorary Revolutionary Weapon"},{"id":"61514289","text":"The Country Blues of John Lee Hooker (also known as The Folk Blues of John Lee Hooker) is the third studio album by blues musician John Lee Hooker recorded in Detroit in 1959 and released by the Riverside label.

The group has been described as \\"digital larping\\". The members of the group post in the manner of a stereotypical internet user from the baby boomer generation. Content The group was created in May 2019 by two 20-year-olds. Membership of the group grew rapidly in late June 2019 following a tweet which went viral, and in July 2019, the group had roughly 10,000 posts per day. The majority of group members are millennials aged between 23 and 28 years old, however there are members of all ages, including those from the boomer generation itself. Members of the group post in character as a stereotypical baby boomer. The style of speech used in the group has been termed a register called \\"boomerspeak\\" by linguist Gretchen McCulloch. Examples of this manner of speech include posts with spelling mistakes, posts written in all capitals, non sequiturs, and the large use of GIFs of minions. Due to older people more readily sharing fake news on Facebook, many members ironically post fake news in the group, in imitation. Due to older people stereotypically being seen as more conservative, there have been posts which imitate the perceived style of conservative baby boomers, using racist or bigoted language. This has caused problems, as Facebook does not largely moderate private groups itself, but leaves it to the group moderators, and so some posts have to be deleted. Some of the group's moderators have called on Facebook to provide more guidance on what is and isn't allowed on the platform. The group has been described as being successful for several reasons, including its comedic properties, envy of the boomer generation from the younger generations, and as a reaction to the often negative stereotyping of millennials by older people. Dr Elissa Perry said in The Guardian that \\"a very common reaction to stereotyping is the denigration of the other\\". Other sources, including ORF, have described this as being part of a \\"generational conflict\\", which has been linked to the political climate, where old and young people broadly disagree on political topics. However, the group has been criticised for perpetuating the stereotype that all older people are more conservative, and Dr Kelly Weeks has said in The Guardian that \\"so much research trying to show the differences between generations has actually resulted in showing that we‚Äôre so much more similar than we think\\". The group has led to several spin-off groups, including \\"a group where we all pretend to be millennials\\", \\"a group where we all pretend to be ants in an ant colony\\" which attracted over a million members, and \\"a group where we all pretend to be boomers pretending to be millennials\\".

He fought as a partisan of Mu'awiya against Caliph Ali during the First Muslim Civil War, leading a raid against the latter's forces in Iraq. Throughout his military career, he was major commander in the wars with the Byzantine Empire. Though the medieval Arabic, Greek and Syriac accounts are not entirely consistent, he most likely was at the head of a large Arab army that was decisively defeated by the Byzantines in 673/74 and was slain during the battle. Life Sufyan belonged to the Ghamid branch of the Azd Sarat tribe resident in the southern Hejaz (western Arabia). He was a companion of the Islamic prophet Muhammad. During the Muslim conquest of Byzantine Syria, he took part in the siege and capture of Damascus in 634 or 635 as a lieutenant of Abu Ubayda ibn al-Jarrah. During the caliphate of Uthman (), he became a loyalist of Syria's governor Mu'awiya ibn Abi Sufyan. For a certain period, the latter appointed Sufyan ·π£ƒÅ·∏•ib al- ·π£awƒÅ æif, i.e. chief commander of the summer expeditions into Byzantine territory in Anatolia, across the northern frontier. During the First Muslim Civil War between Mu'awiya and Caliph Ali (), Sufyan led a raid against Ali's positions in Iraq in 659/660 or the summer of 660. Sufyan first reached Hit and Sandawda, both on the west bank of the Euphrates, and upon finding them deserted by their garrisons and inhabitants, who fled at the news of Sufyan's impending assault, he proceeded toward Anbar, on the east bank of the river. During the attack, the commander of the Anbar garrison, Ashras ibn Hassan al- Bakri, and thirty of his soldiers were slain. After looting the town, Sufyan withdrew to Syria without proceeding to al-Mada'in as instructed by Mu'awiya, who nonetheless praised him for the expedition's efficiency and success. He promised to install Sufyan to any office he wished. The attacks contributed to the flight of many Iraqis to Syria during the war. Mu'awiya ultimately prevailed in the conflict and became caliph in 661. He restarted the campaigns against Byzantium after the lull caused by the civil war and in 665 appointed Sufyan alongside his own son Yazid to lead a summer raid against the Byzantines; Sufyan and his men entered Byzantine territory before Yazid, but shortly after withdrew as a result of disease. In the medieval Muslim accounts of al-Ya'qubi (d. ) and al-Tabari (d. 923), Sufyan was a commander of a raid against Byzantine territory in 670/71. According to the Muslim traditional historians al-Waqidi (d. 822), Khalifa ibn Khayyat (d. 854), al-Ya'qubi and al-Tabari, Sufyan led an expedition against the Byzantines in 672, during which al-Waqidi and al-Ya'qubi state he died. According to the Syriac historian Theophilus of Edessa (d. 785), Sufyan was slain with 30,000 of his men by a Byzantine army led by the patricians Florus, Petronas and Cyprian in 673/74; Michael the Syrian (d. 1199) further notes that the location of the battle was at a Lycian coastal city under siege by the Arabs. The battle was a turning point at this stage of the Arab‚ÄìByzantine wars, setting the Byzantines up for a counter-offensive over the following several years. In the biography of Sufyan by Ibn Asakir (d. 1176), Sufyan is said to have been killed in Byzantine territory in 674.

This example shows strong H+ influx closer to the root tip, and slight H+ efflux further from the tip. Non-invasive micro-test technology (NMT) is a scientific research technology used for measuring physiological events of intact biological samples. NMT is used for research in many biological areas such as gene function, plant physiology, biomedical research, and environmental science. Most living things experience a constant exchange of ions and molecules with their surroundings as a result of biological processes. NMT uses specialized flux sensors, derived from microelectrodes, to measure this dynamic ion/molecule activity called flux around an intact sample. These fluxes reveal information about physiological phenomena. Each NMT flux sensor is selective or specific for a particular ion/molecule of choice. Some of the more commonly published ion/molecule flux sensors are those that are commercially available, such as Ca2+, H+, K+, Na+, Cl‚àí, Mg2+, Cd2+, NH4+, NO3‚àí, Pb2+, Cu2+, O2, H2O2, and IAA (indole-3-acetic acid). Some other flux sensors include glutamate, glucose, Zn2+, Hg2+, and more that have been designed by individual laboratories. NMT measures how much, how fast, and in what direction the chosen ions/molecules are moving. This is defined as diffusion flux, which is the amount of substance per unit area per unit time. The principle of how NMT measures flux was described in the 1990s by a few different laboratories; Lionel Jaffe at the Marine Biological Laboratory described the Vibrating Probe technique, and Ian Newman at the University of Tasmania described the MIFE‚Ñ¢ technique. There are also technologies SERIS and SIET that use this principle.  Basic procedure  = Live sample preparation = Different samples need different amounts of preparation work. For example, small organisms, condensed organelles, and cultured cells, tissues, or organs can be measured with little alteration, but anything below the skin or surface of large organisms must be exposed in order to measure. Generally, once the sample is prepared so that the desired measurement site is revealed, NMT causes no further damage or interference with the test; because of this, NMT is most commonly used for measuring live, intact samples. The live sample must be secured in a Petri dish so it doesn‚Äôt move or shift. A single cell can be adhered by means such as a polylysine-coated slide; this also works for other small samples like condensed organelles. Large tissue samples like roots may be weighted down with filter paper and resin tiles. Plenty of other large samples can be measured as well, such as organs or whole small organisms like zebrafish. An example of raw flux data unfolding as NMT measures oxygen efflux from a leaf sample. During this test, a light is turned on and off periodically, each time causing a change in O2 flux due to photosynthesis. = Liquid media composition = The sample must be surrounded by liquid media, which will be different depending on the sample type, purpose of the test, and ions/molecules that will be measured. This media is a useful way to manipulate the sample‚Äôs environment by adding things like drugs, stressors, or other biotic/abiotic stimuli. This step can be the most challenging simply because it allows many possibilities for test manipulation. To get started in designing a specific new test, there is plenty of literature documenting successful composition of liquid media. = Recording = The prepared sample is placed under a microscope with a flux sensor which is controlled by a computer. The operator uses arrow keys to move the flux sensor to the desired point and distance from the sample, aided by a microscope camera. The NMT flux sensor measures the flux and the data are plotted on- screen during the test. These fluxes are most often measured in the unit 10‚àí12 moles ‚Ä¢ cm‚àí2 ‚Ä¢ s‚àí1, or sometimes as small as 10‚àí15 moles ‚Ä¢ cm‚àí2 ‚Ä¢ s‚àí1, allowing flux to be measured from something as small as a single cell. During the test, further changes can be introduced like a stressor or other abiotic stimulus, and the flux patterns will change on-screen to show the physiological changes. For example, cold stress can be studied by adding ice- cold test buffer to the solution during testing.  Variations  A picture of what an NMT system may look like. A Faraday cage holds the microscope and flux sensor manipulator to block interference, while a computer system controls and calculates from the outside. = 1-dimensional = This is the most common NMT test in which the flux sensor is moved in one direction in reference to the sample, generally perpendicular to the sample boundaries. = 2-dimensional = There is not much documented application of 2-dimensional measurement in NMT; the possibility was demonstrated with the Vibrating Probe technique by Degenhardt et al in 1998. They moved the flux sensor both perpendicular and then parallel to a plant root, then summed up the flux vectors to generate the 2-dimensional flux direction. In this kind of manner, NMT can measure 2D fluxes as well, using the same software that measures 3D fluxes. = 3-dimensional = One of the pioneers of 3D ion/molecule flux mapping is Joseph Kunkel. To generate a 3-dimensional view of fluxes, the flux sensor must take measurements in the X, Y, and Z directions at each point around a sample. In 2006, a view of H+ and O2 3D flux vectors around a pollen tube was produced using Mageflux software developed by Yue Xu. A breast tumor sample is measured simultaneously by H+ and O2 flux sensors. The data show how the fluxes change together, which is useful for research in areas like cancer metabolism. = Simultaneous = NMT flux sensors can be set up to measure two or more different ion/molecule fluxes at the same time, allowing the user to see the flux changes simultaneously, and to see the relationship between them. Combining two particular flux measurements simultaneously can be a strong indicator of physiological phenomena. For example, measuring both H+ and O2 simultaneously from a tumor sample (see figure to the right) can provide significant information about cancer metabolism that is far more useful than measuring only one at a time.  Applications  NMT flux sensor measuring a mesophyll cell = Genetics = It is widely accepted that both intracellular and extracellular ionic and molecular activities are vital to many physiological processes, also making them useful indicators of gene functions. By measuring dynamic ion/molecule fluxes, NMT has helped research on genes related to factors such as cold stress, salt tolerance, cadmium uptake, and nutrient uptake in plants. In biomedical genetic research, NMT has measured samples such as liver cells to investigate gene expression through fluxes. = Plant biology = NMT has been widely applied in plant biology in fields such as abiotic/biotic stress, plant nutrition, plant growth and development, plant/microbe interaction, plant defense, photosynthesis, signal transduction research, and more. Roots are commonly measured, in addition to many other plant samples such as leaf tissue, root hairs, guard cells, salt gland cells, mesophyll cells, and condensed organelles like chloroplasts and vacuoles. NMT can help identify plants that are more resistant to stressors like salt, temperature, drought, and disease. It‚Äôs also a useful tool for studying plant nutrition absorption and regulation mechanisms in ways such as monitoring rates of nutrient uptake at the root surface. An individual neuron measured by NMT flux sensor = Biomedical = NMT is applied in biomedical research in various fields such as neuroscience, tumor research, drug screening, metabolism, and bone research. NMT is a useful tool for evaluating the effects of treatments for diseases like diabetes and cancer in tissue samples, as it can measure the flux changes in response to treatments. Measured samples include tumor tissue, neurons, brain tissue, liver cells, bone, muscle, and many more. Metabolism rates can be measured by NMT using O2 and H+ fluxes. In bone research, the flux of Ca2+ measured by NMT helps research on bone healing and growth. = Environmental = Various areas of environmental research in which NMT has been applied include water pollution detection, biological early warning, water quality assessment, and heavy metal detection. With global heavy metal pollution of crops on the rise, more NMT heavy metal flux sensors such as Cd2+, Cu2+, and Pb2+ have been used in research to identify plants that can tackle this problem with phytoremediation. For water quality and pollution research, water plants and algae have been measured, as well as biofilms and fish embryos.

From 2013 to 2015 she served as the co-chair of the National Congress of Australia's First Peoples and during her tenure pressed for policies which allowed Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians to gain the ability for self-determination. She has served on the board of Reconciliation Australia and other public policy commissions aimed at improving the lives of Indigenous people. She was the third Aboriginal person to serve on the Australian Press Council. In 2018, her unpublished manuscript The Making of Ruby Champion won the David Unaipon Award of the Queensland Literary Awards, which included both publication and prize money. She is currently the Director of Aboriginal Affairs and Reconciliation for the government of South Australia. Early life Kirstie Parker was born as the third child of four siblings in 1967, the daughter of a Yuwallarai mother and her father was originally from London. Her mother, Pam, had one year of formal schooling, but taught herself to read and write by studying Anne of Green Gables. Her father, Roger, was also an avid reader and they encouraged Parker in her writing. She was raised in northern New South Wales, Australia.  Personal life  Career At 16, Parker began working as a junior journalist and throughout her career has worked in print media, radio and television. Among the media outlets she has been associated with are ABC Radio, The Tablelander regional paper in Atherton, Queensland and The West Australian newspaper of Perth. In 2006, she became the editor of the Koori Mail, a newspaper written and owned by Indigenous Australians, where she wrote for seven years. In 2013, Parker was elected to serve a two-year term as co-chair of the National Congress of Australia's First Peoples, along with Les Malezer, a Gubbi Gubbi-Butchulla man from Queensland. During her tenure, a crisis in funding threatened Aboriginal communities across Australia with closure. Parker and Malezer strongly opposed the eviction of Indigenous people from their homelands, citing previous failures in adequately integrating Aboriginal people into new areas in various states and stressing the need for self- determination policies. The duo worked on the panel reviewing the status of recognition for Australia's Indigenous people in 2014. The following year Parker was one of the delegates who met with Prime Minister Tony Abbott and Opposition Leader Bill Shorten. She urged a recognition plan which allowed Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people to provide input into the recognition process. When Abbott agreed, a First Peoples National Convention was held. The convention recommended that the Constitution of Australia be amended to grant Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people representation in the federal Parliament and the establishment of a commission to supervise negotiations between First Nations and the government. Parker is an activist and public policy advisor on Indigenous affairs. Some of her work in this area includes working at the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies in Canberra managing media and communications; serving as a director at Tandanya National Aboriginal Cultural Institute in Adelaide; directing public affairs for the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission; and serving as media advisor to Robert Tickner, Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs. She has served as a director of Reconciliation Australia and co-chair of the Closing the Gap campaign, an initiative which focuses on health issues of Indigenous Australians. She is a public speaker often discussing policies affecting Indigenous peoples and how the media can be used to empower Aboriginal people. In 2015, she began working as the CEO of the National Centre of Indigenous Excellence in Redfern, New South Wales. In 2017, she became the third Indigenous person to be appointed to the Australian Press Council. Her role on the adjudication panel is to advise the council on Aboriginal issues. That year, she also joined the Department of Premier and Cabinet in South Australia as the Director of Aboriginal Affairs and Reconciliation. Awards and honours Parker has received numerous awards for both her writing and advocacy. In 2001, she received the Australian Government's Centenary Medal for her work with Indigenous communities and women. She received a Centenary Medal for contribution to the Indigenous community and Australian life (2003), and an International Women‚Äôs Day Award for service to the SA community in 2000. Her journalism was recognized in 2008 with the Print Media Award of the Australian Human Rights Commission for her article, National Apology: commemorative lift out. In 2012, Parker was recognized for her activism on behalf of Indigenous people with the 100 Women of Influence Awards presented by the Australian Financial Review. She was one of the inaugural women honoured with the Australian Peacewomen Awards of the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom at the organization's centennial celebrations in 2015. In 2016, Parker was a finalist in the 2016 NSW Women of the Year Awards (Aboriginal Woman of the Year category).In 2018, her unpublished manuscript The Making of Ruby Champion won the David Unaipon Award of the Queensland Literary Awards, which included both publication and prize money.

A grammarian of the school of al-K≈´fah, who rivalled the grammarians of al-Ba·π£rah in poetry recital. He was famous for his knowledge of rare expressions and for transmitting the famous anthology of ancient Arabic poetry, Al-Mufa·∏ç·∏çalƒ´yƒÅt. The meaning of the word A'rƒÅbƒ´, and its difference to the word Arabƒ´, is explained by the exegete al-SijistƒÅnƒ´, in his book on rare Qur‚ÄôƒÅnic terms: A'rƒÅbƒ´ is a non-Arab desert inhabitant, whereas Arabƒ´ is a non-desert dwelling Arab. Life Ibn al-A‚ÄòrƒÅbƒ´ was born in al-K≈´fah in 760. His father, ZiyƒÅd, had been captured from Sindh, probably by the Ban≈´ HƒÅshim, or possibly by the Ban≈´ ShaybƒÅn or some other tribe. He himself was a mawla (client) of al-AbbƒÅs ibn Mu·∏•ammad ibn Alƒ´ ibn ‚ÄòAbd AllƒÅh. He was said to have a cast. His mother had been a servant of, and later married, al-Mufa·∏ç·∏çal ibn Mu·∏•ammad al-·∏åabbƒ´, the author of Al-Mufa·∏ç·∏çalƒ´yƒÅt, and as his stepson, Ibn al-A‚ÄòrƒÅbƒ´ received a broad education in the ·∏§adƒ´th, poetry, history, theology, genealogy and literature. The centres of scholarship in these fields encompassed by the term ‚Äòphilology‚Äô were at al-Ba·π£rah, al-K≈´fah, and later at BaghdƒÅd. Apart from al-Mufa·∏ç·∏çal, Ibn al-A'rƒÅbƒ´'s principal tutor was the qƒÅ·∏çƒ´ (judge) al-QƒÅsim ibn Ma‚Äôn ibn ‚ÄòAbd al-Ra·∏•mƒÅn. Ab≈´ Mu‚ÄôƒÅwiyah al-·∏åarƒ´r, and al- KisƒÅ‚Äôƒ´, also tutored him. Ibn al- A‚ÄòrƒÅbƒ´ became a scholar of the Arab tribes and of the poets of the Jahiliya (pre-Islamic) and Islamic era, up to the beginning of the rule of the Ban≈´ al-‚ÄòAbbƒÅs. Other scholars were Ab≈´ ‚ÄòAmr al- ShaybƒÅnƒ´, KhƒÅlid ibn Kulth≈´m , Mu·∏•ammad ibn ·∏§abƒ´b, al-·π¨≈´sƒ´, and al-A·π£ma‚Äôƒ´. His lectures were very popular and Ab≈´ al-AbbƒÅs Tha‚Äôlab, who was his student of ten years, reports that a hundred people typically attended his lectures, coming from as far afield as Isfƒ´jƒÅb in Transoxiana, and from Spain. A glimpse into the setting for scholarly debate occurring at this time is indicated in an anecdote told by Tha‚Äòlab, where a group of scholars, that included al- Sukkarƒ´, Ab≈´ al-‚ÄòƒÄliyah and Ibn al-A'rƒÅbƒ´, had assembled at the home of A·∏•mad ibn Sa‚Äôƒ´d. It appears that A·∏•mad ibn Sa‚Äòƒ´d and Ibn al-A‚Äòrabi were astonished, presumably impressed, by Tha‚Äòlab‚Äôs precocious critique of a poem by al- ShammƒÅkh. Ibn al-A‚ÄòrƒÅbƒ´ quoted such Arabian linguistic authorities as al- ·π¢am≈´tƒ´, al-Kalbƒ´, and Ab≈´ Mujƒ´b. His pupils included IbrƒÅhƒ´m al-·∏§arbƒ´, Ibn al- Sikkƒ´t, and Ibn al-Azhar. As a leading philologist, Ibn al- A‚ÄòrƒÅbƒ´ was critical of rival scholars of rare linguistic expressions (al-kalƒÅm al- gharƒ´b), and in particular of Ab≈´ Ubaydah and al-A·π£ma‚Äôƒ´. He proposed orthographic liberalisation and urged permissiveness in the substitution of the letter dƒÅd (ÿ∂) for the letter zƒÅ (ÿ∏). Mu·∏•ammad ibn ·∏§abƒ´b, quoted Ibn al-A‚ÄôrƒÅbƒ´, along with Qu·π≠rub, Ab≈´ ‚ÄòUbaydah, Ab≈´ al-Yaq·∫ìƒÅn, et al. Tha‚Äôlab and al-·π¨abarƒ´ wrote Ibn al-A'rƒÅbƒ´'s biography, while anecdotes about him and his philological commentaries were popular. Tha‚Äòlab reports never seeing a book in his hand, even when he was over eighty years old. This was a huge tribute as scholars attached great importance to facility of memorisation. Tha'lab also claims no one surpassed Ibn al-A'rƒÅbƒ´ in his knowledge of poetry. Al-Nadƒ´m read Ibn al-K≈´fƒ´ ‚Äòs account that Tha‚Äòlab had heard him say he was born the night Ab≈´ ·∏§anƒ´fah died. Al-QƒÅsim had met, and was an admirer of, Ab≈´ ·∏§anƒ´fah. Ibn al-A‚ÄòrƒÅbƒ´ died in 846 (231 AH), in Surra Man Ra‚ÄôƒÅ, (i.e. the ancient name of SƒÅmarrƒÅ), Iraq, aged eighty years, four months and three days. Works Among his books there were: * KitƒÅb Al-Nawadir (); (‚ÄòAnecdotes‚Äô), a large book; Rare Forms, which was quoted by a group of scholars among whom were al- ·π¨≈´sƒ´, Tha‚Äòlab, and others ‚Äîsome say there were twelve and some say nine quotations (transcriptions); * Al-AnwƒÅ‚Äô () Al-AnwƒÅ‚Äô; * ·π¢ifat al-Khayl (); ‚ÄòDescription of the Horse‚Äô; * ·π¢ifat al-Zara‚Äô () ‚ÄòDescription of the Palm (or Corn in the Blade)‚Äô; * Al-Khayl () ‚ÄòHorses‚Äô; * Madh al-QabƒÅ‚Äôil () ‚ÄòTribute of the (History [epochs] of the) Tribes‚Äô; * Ma‚Äôanƒ´ al-Sha‚Äôir () ‚ÄòMeaning of Poetry‚Äô; * Tafsƒ´r al-AmthƒÅl () ‚ÄòExplanation of Similes‚Äô, or ‚ÄòExposition of Proverbs‚Äô * Al-NabƒÅt () 'Plants'; * Al-AlfƒÅz () ‚ÄòPronunciations (Dialects)‚Äô or ‚ÄòVocabulary‚Äô; * Nisba al-Khail () ‚ÄòPedigrees of Horses‚Äô; * Nawadir al- Zabƒ´rƒ´yƒ´n () Rare Forms of the Inhabitants of Dabƒ´r; * NawƒÅdir banƒ´ FakƒÅs () ‚ÄòAnecdotes of the Ban≈´ Faq‚Äòas; * Al-DabƒÅb ‚Äì bi kha·π≠ al-Sukkarƒ´ (); ‚ÄòFlies' ‚Äì copied in the handwriting of al-Sukkarƒ´. * Al-NabƒÅt wa-al-Baqal () ‚ÄòPlants and Herbs‚Äô; * Gharƒ´b al-·∏§adƒ´th () The Strange in the ·∏§adƒ´th Legacy Al-A'rƒÅbƒ´'s importance as a philologist, or linguistic scientist, of the Arab language, and his milieu, can be estimated by the account given by the tenth-century bibliophile Al-Nadim, who writing about a hundred and fifty years after the death of Ibn al-A'rƒÅbƒ´, describes visiting the library in the city of al- ·∏§adƒ´thah of Mu·∏•ammad ibn al-·∏§usayn, known as ‚ÄòIbn Abƒ´ Ba‚Äòrah‚Äô, who had received a collection of ancient writings from a Shƒ´‚Äôƒ´ book-collector of al- K≈´fah. Among the material on the sciences of Arabs and other nations, there were documents written on double parchment, deeds, ta‚Äòlƒ´qƒÅt, poems, papers on grammar, anecdotes, historical traditions, names, genealogies, etc., on adam skins and on paper from Egypt, China, TihƒÅmah, and KhurƒÅsƒÅn; notes written in an ancient calligraphy by ‚ÄòAllƒÅn the Grammarian and al-Na·∏çr ibn Shumayl; and ·∏§adƒ´th authorities, such as SufyƒÅn ibn ‚ÄòUyaynah, SufyƒÅn al-Thawri, al- AwzƒÅ‚Äòƒ´.Of the scholars, whose handwritten notes on Arabic grammar and philological literature, and other ancient works, he lists are Ab≈´ ‚ÄòAmr ibn al-‚ÄòAlƒÅ', Ab≈´ ‚ÄòAmr al-Shaybanƒ´, al-A·π£ma‚Äôƒ´, Ibn al-A‚ÄòrƒÅbƒ´, Sƒ´bawayh, al-FarrƒÅ‚Äô, al-KisƒÅ‚Äôƒ´, Ab≈´ al-Aswad (in the handwriting of Ya·∏•yƒÅ ibn Ya‚Äòmar). Ibn al-A‚ÄòrƒÅbƒ´ transmitted the authorised edition of the Al-Mufa·∏ç·∏çalƒ´yƒÅt, one hundred and twenty-eight poems, that begins with a poem of Ta‚Äôabba·π≠a Sharran ThƒÅbit ibn JƒÅbir, where others selected, extended, and reordered the poems.

At the end of the season the club adopted the new name AFC Fylde. In 2009 Fylde achieved their third successive promotion by winning the North West Counties Premier Division title, they were promoted into the Northern Premier League Division One North. Fylde were unable to successfully defend the FA Vase losing 2‚Äì1 in the fourth round to Needham Market. The club were entered into the FA Cup qualifying rounds for the first time in the 2008‚Äì09 season, losing to Sheffield in the preliminary round. The 2009‚Äì10 season saw the club play in the FA Trophy for the first time and the 2010‚Äì11 season they were runners-up in the promotion play-offs. Their third season in Division One North saw them win the championship title and were promoted into the Premier Division. The club spent two seasons in the Premier Division qualifying for the play-offs in both, in the first season play-offs they were eliminated in the semi-finals by Hednesford Town in a penalty shoot-out; in the second they defeated Worksop Town in the semi-final and Ashton United in the final on penalties to achieve promotion to the Conference North. In their first season in the Conference North they finished as runners-up in the league only two points behind champions Barrow and automatic promotion, in the play-offs they were eliminated by Guiseley in the two-legged semi-final 3‚Äì1 on aggregate. The following season the Conference North was renamed National League North. The club's third place finish meant they qualified for their fourth consecutive play-offs, they reached the final but were runners-up to North Ferriby United. Fylde won the 2016‚Äì17 National League North title and were promoted in the National League, the highest level of the National League System and fifth- highest of the overall English football league system. Fylde finished in seventh-place in their first National League season and qualified for their sixth play-offs tournament, this time losing to Boreham Wood in the quarter- final. In the 2018‚Äì19 season they finished in fifth-place and once again qualified for the play-offs, beating Harrogate Town in the quarter-final and Solihull Moors in the semi-final before losing to Salford City in the final. Also during this season the club reached the 2019 FA Trophy Final, their first FA Trophy final, where they played National League champions Leyton Orient and defeated them 1‚Äì0 to win the competition.

He contributed specialist articles to the medical literature but is mainly remembered for his contributions to golf. He planned and designed the course that became Royal St Georges in Kent and was an important figure in the establishment of the Ladies Golf Union in the United Kingdom. He was a prime mover in introducing the rules of handicapping into British golf.  Early life  Purves was born in Hill Place, Edinburgh, in 1842, the third son of a surgeon William Brown Purves (1799‚Äì1852) and his wife Margaret Purves (n√©e Laidlaw) (1798‚Äì1855).Scotland Births and Baptisms, 1564‚Äì1950,\\" database, FamilySearch (https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:XTRW-M3L : William Purves in entry for William Laidlaw Purves, 16 Apr 1842; citing Saint Cuthberts, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland, reference ‚Äì 2:18M6P16; By the time he was 13, both his parents had died and he was brought up by two spinster aunts, Jane and Euphemia Laidlaw. From this time, as a tribute to them and his mother he styled himself \\"Laidlaw Purves\\". He went to school at the Royal High School, Edinburgh, and was then apprenticed as a lawyer to William Forbes Skene, a Writer to the Signet, who later became known for his work as a historian, author of the acclaimed Celtic Scotland, and Historiographer Royal for Scotland. Realising that he did not wish to embark on a career in law, Purves began to study medicine in his spare time, going on to enter the University of Edinburgh Medical School. In 1862, while still a student, he joined the crew of the whaler SS Polynia, completing an eight-month round trip from Dundee to Newfoundland. This was common practice amongst Edinburgh medical students, the best known example being Arthur Conan Doyle. In 1864 he qualified as a member of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh (MRCS) and Licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh (LRCP), graduating MD from the University of Edinburgh later that year.  Surgical career  Purves worked in hospitals in Edinburgh and Cardiff before emigrating to Australia where he set up in medical practice in Horsham, Victoria. Here he also acted as a coroner for Victoria. After five years he returned to Europe where he trained in ophthalmic surgery and aural surgery at Berlin, Vienna, Paris and Utrecht. In Utrecht he worked with Professor Franciscus Donders (1818‚Äì1889), who had established the first eye hospital in the Netherlands and made major contributions to the study of refraction and of astigmatism. Donders also pioneered standardization of voice tests of hearing and made research contributions in the science of phonetics. In 1874, with this experience in ophthalmic and aural surgery, Purves was appointed lecturer and aural surgeon to Guy's Hospital, London. He began a private practice in aural and ophthalmic surgery in Hanover Street, London. His contributions to the specialty literature were published mainly in Guy's Hospital Gazette. In 1884, just one year after the introduction of the audiometer, he gave a full account of the way in which a hearing test should be conducted. He published an article on the common problem of removal of foreign bodies from the ear, which was a practical guide intended for students and general practitioners. He retired from his Guy's appointment in 1902.  Golfing achievements  Purves had played golf at Bruntsfield Links in Edinburgh as a student and by the time of his London appointment he was a member of both the Honorable Company of Edinburgh Golfers and the Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews. In 1874, on his move to London, he joined the London Scottish and Wimbledon Golf Club. Shortly after this the club separated into two separate clubs, The London Scottish Golf Club and the Wimbledon Golf Club although they both continued to play on Wimbledon Common. In 1882 the Wimbledon became the Royal Wimbledon Golf Club and Purves became an active committee member and was later elected Captain. The golfers had to share the Common with the public and were restricted as to when they could play. Purves, together with a fellow Scot and keen amateur golfer Henry Lamb (1844‚Äì1893) began to look along the south coast of England for the site for a links golf course, similar to the ones they had both played on since childhood in the east coast of Scotland. In 1887 they selected a site at Sandwich in Kent where Purves designed and supervised the laying out of a course which he called St George's and later became Royal St George's Golf Club. His aim was that the course should emulate and rival St Andrews, and it was, in 1894, the first course outside Scotland to host the Open Championship. In 1888 he designed the Littlestone golf course at New Romney, Kent. Purves became an active supporter of women's golf. In 1872, the Wimbledon Golf Club had laid out a nine-hole course for women and created the Wimbledon Ladies Golf Club. Purves arranged and presided over a meeting of the 15 ladies' golf clubs in the UK in 1893 which led to the formation of the Ladies' Golf Union (LGU) later that year. Issette Pearson, a Wimbledon Ladies member, was its first secretary. The support of Purves was described as crucial in its foundation and Amy Pascoe, who won the Ladies Championship in 1896, described Purves as the \\"fairy godfather of ladies' golf\\". Purves, Henry Lamb and Issette Pearson were the three key figures in the introduction of the system of handicap into the UK. The golf historian C.B. Clapcott in his History of Handicapping wrote that \\"Dr. Laidlaw Purves set out the rules for universal handicapping (1898) which were evolved at Wimbledon. These rules indeed may be regarded as the basis upon which the British Golf Union's Joint Advisory Council have built up their system of uniform handicapping (average of the best three scores over two years of medal scores with compulsory handing in of signed scorecards)\\". The LGU adopted the system before the British Golf Union adopted them for men and also developed a system of course rating. Issette Pearson appointed 'handicap advisers' who visited LGU clubs giving standard scratch score ratings to the courses. In 1898 Purves with Henry Lamb and Issette Pearson were at the forefront of the introduction of similar standards in British men's golf.  Later life and death  Purves became a member of the Worshipful Company of Girdlers and on his retirement from Guy's became master of the Company. He was a member of no fewer than 32 golf clubs by the time of his death. He died at his home Hardwick Cottage, Wimbledon Common on 30 December 1917.  Family  In 1867 in Melbourne, Australia, Purves married Rebecca Grant (c.1845 ‚Äì 4 October 1877), daughter of James Grant, of Edinburgh. There were no children. After Rebecca's death, he married Elizabeth Adie in London. She was a member of the Edinburgh-based family firm of opticians and instrument makers, her father running the London branch. They had two daughters and four sons. Proud of his Scottish roots, Purves sent his sons for schooling at Fettes College in Edinburgh. The two eldest played rugby for Scotland. Alexander Buckholm Laidlaw (Alex) Purves represented London Scottish and was capped ten times for Scotland. The second son, William Donald Campbell Laidlaw Purves played for London Scottish and was capped six times for Scotland.

It is an extension of the War on drugs and developed after the Colombian peace process of 2016. The existence of the war was officially announced in August 2019 after a Human Rights Watch (HRW) investigation. Colombian media reports that the war has directly affected an estimated 145,000 people, with the HRW estimating this at 300,000. Development =Beginnings= In November 2016, the Colombian government signed a peace treaty with the FARC militia. FARC had been engaging in violence across Colombia, and were absorbed into the government. However, the government still maintains a small presence, and without the organized crime control of the FARC, the Catatumbo region was left in a power vacuum. Seeking to gain control of the region's fruitful drug trade, several different guerilla groups arose or reorganized. Key reasons for groups to focus on controlling the area include the unrestricted access to Venezuela, through which drugs can be trafficked, and the vast coca plant fields for drug production. It is also suggested that Catatumbo is one of few regions where there may be army officers who are willing to covertly work with drug traffickers after the peace process. The Human Rights Watch describes the War as starting proper in \\"early 2018\\", including early alerts by the Colombian Ombudsman in January 2018. Insight Crime places the start of the war as 14 March 2018, but says by this point it \\"had already been brewing for months without authorities intervening to put a stop to it\\". =Progression to war= The main groups vying for control over Catatumbo are the Popular Liberation Army (EPL) and the National Liberation Army (ELN). The EPL had existed quietly in Catatumbo for a long time before the ELN made moves to expand into the region. After the power vacuum, both groups began to assert power over civilians in the region. This caused conflicts, as each group wanted complete control; they developed ways to diminish the influence of the other, including battles. They also used propaganda tactics: one event that \\"intensified\\" the discord in January 2018 was a press release from EPL criticizing ELN for guerilla actions towards indigenous people of Venezuela. A ceasefire had been declared in October 2017 to allow peaceful discussion for three months, but no progress was made, and in early 2018, the ELN and EPL declared \\"war to the death\\". This attracted other armed groups, who would lend their support to one side or the other. Separately, the Frente 33 faction of FARC gained its own momentum in the region and became a party to the conflict when trying to exert power. A massive influx of Venezuelan migrants in the later stages of the crisis, many willing to work for armed militia to survive, added manpower to the developing conflicts, and as they are particularly vulnerable, it drove up human rights abuses, too. Drug trafficking prevention consultant and ex-military official Andres Valencia opined that the Venezuelan crisis is the reason for the development of the conflicts into a war, as it provides thousands of people for cheap labor both in farming and warfare. Valencia added that the deterioration of the Venezuelan military Bolivarian National Guard (GNB) is also a factor, as they ignore or even help with the formation of drug routes across the country. In an effort to control human rights abuses, the military were deployed to the area, with over 5,600 personnel assigned to the war by August 2019, as reported by Reuters. Local media suggests the number of soldiers is over 10,000. Groups and leaders The three main militia groups involved in the conflict are the EPL, ELN, and a group composed of former FARC soldiers known as Frente 33. From 2019, the Colombian Army has been engaging the groups. EPL leader Mauricio P√°cora The two leaders of the EPL, who are also known as \\"Los Pelusos\\", were Mauricio P√°cora (an alias), until he was killed in a military operation in August 2019 at the age of 46 or 47, and Reinaldo Pe√±aranda, also known as \\"Pepe\\" (b. 1978/1979). Insight Crime reported in 2018 that P√°cora and Pepe were seen as rivals, having each been the disciple of different past EPL leaders. They had different strengths, P√°cora as a military strategist and Pepe as a political strategist, and were matched by a rank-rising member of EPL known as \\"Manuel\\", who was seen as the ruthless one in the trio. One of the ELN leaders, the one which the Colombian Army confirmed to be strategically leading the group in the war, is Nicol√°s Rodr√≠guez, also known as \\"Gabino\\". Leading the section of the ELN on the ground in the region, the Nororiental de Guerra, was Manuel Guevara. Guevara is famous for the 2016 kidnappings of several journalists from El Tiempo and RCN. He went off-grid in 2018, and may have been replaced by a leader with the alias \\"Alfred\\". Frente 33, or the 33rd Front of FARC dissidents, is a faction group allied to Frente 1. A senior Frente 1 leader, G√©ner Garc√≠a Molina, also known as \\"Jhon 40\\", traveled to Catatumbo in early 2018 to help organize the group there. As former FARC militants, Frente 33 is protected from attack or retaliation by a military presence but only to a certain date. The Nation has expressed concern that after this point, the other groups and the military may kill them all. In July 2018, Brigadier General Mauricio Moreno Rodr√≠guez took position as the army commander for the 2nd Division, active in the war, with General Jos√© Mar√≠a C√≥rdova succeeding him at some point before 14 August 2019. In 2019, a Venezuelan militia group, the Urabe√±o block, that operates in the Catatumbo region of Venezuela across the border, declared war on the groups on the Colombian side. There have also been reports that the GNB have been helping militia in Colombia. Violent strategies trancazo set on fire The militia groups are said to engage in murder and kidnappings of civilians, sexual violence, forcing displacement, and forcing children to join their ranks. They attempt to control civilians through intimidation tactics, including the murder of community leaders and human rights defenders located in the region. Military tactics they have used include reports of planting anti-personnel mines. Among those killed by militia are nine community leaders and human rights defenders. =Displacement= Displaced residents looking for refuge in June 2019 The Catatumbo region is in Eastern Colombia but also covers parts of Western Venezuela, with certain stretches of the Catatumbo River forming part of the international border. During the war, more than 40,000 residents have had to leave their homes in the area according to government statistics. This number includes displacements starting in 2017, though the Human Rights Watch says the majority were counted in 2018. The HRW also analyses the causes of displacement: in 2018, most displacements stemmed from fighting between the EPL and ELN; in 2019, more were caused by the violent intervention of the Colombian armed forces fighting the militia groups. Besides those being forced away by destruction of land and property, or out of fear for their safety, some have been driven away by threats from the different groups. =Effect on Venezuelan migrants= The area is one of the border access points for Venezuelans fleeing the crisis in their country to enter Colombia. The \\"desperate and often undocumented\\" migrants are vulnerable and targeted for abuse by armed groups. The United Nations (UN) Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) reports that at least 25,000 Venezuelan migrants live in Catatumbo. Battles and operations Trenches on the hillside An offensive front was set up on 14 March 2018 between EPL and ELN, with 600 men fighting to try and finally decide the retake of land and power in the region. This paralyzed infrastructure and closed schools and shops. In April 2018, the EPL announced armed strikes to continue the battle. The 30 July 2018 El Tarra massacre saw 10 men open fire at a club, killing 8. Though no group claims the attack, it was suspected to be perpetrated by the ELN, who were growing increasingly concerned of EPL gaining recruits. A few days earlier, the ELN were suspected of a farm massacre on the Venezuelan side of the border. In April 2019 a military approach resulted in the death of an ELN second-in- command, \\"Camilo\\". The military Operation \\"Escudo\\" (English: \\"Shield\\"), a programme of 47 operations in July 2019 with more than 1000 soldiers, resulted in the capture of 143 people across the different militia groups. Several of these were leading members of the groups: 26 were ELN, 6 were EPL, and 5 were Frente 33. Additionally, 13 were Rastrojos. In a paratrooper operation undertaken by the 2nd Division on Tuesday 6 August 2019, the EPL leader P√°cora was killed. This battle was begun by the 30th Brigade of the Colombian army, confronting the EPL at a base near the Venezuelan border; the brigade successfully took the base. A 12 August 2019 army reconnaissance mission over suspected ELN territory in Hacar√≠ resulted in 3 injured soldiers, according to a military colonel. On 25 August 2019, Norte de Santander Assembly candidate Emiro del Carmen Ropero was attacked by members of Frente 33; before the peace process, Ropero was a leader of Frente 33 and known as Rub√©n Zamora. On the evening on 3 September 2019, the house of Betsaida Montejo, a San Calixto mayoral candidate was bombed. Nobody was harmed. It is suspected the attack was perpetrated by the EPL, since the house was tagged with graffiti of the group. On 6 September 2019, a group of former FARC dissidents in the region were kidnapped and murdered, which Ropero said was, like his attack, \\"retaliation\\" of some form. =Militia captures and arrests by local police= In August 2019, 5 suspected members of ELN, and a 26-year-old man presumed to be a head of logistics for EPL, were arrested by Norte de Santander police in separate raids. Public response =Protests= Protests have been held in the region, with citizens asking for peace. Local dioceses have asked for consideration of the community, saying that \\"this new war [threatens] the paths, the urban centers\\" and adding that \\"[c]hildren at home and in schools must be respected and protected, families cannot be cornered and forced again to move away from fear and the threat of death.\\" =Criticisms of military presence= There have been criticisms of military presence. Some residents who had been far enough away from the centers of conflict were not affected until the arrival of the soldiers; one farmer had six hectares of his land incinerated by the army so they could build trenches. The number of displacements rose after the army began engaging the militia groups, and there have been incidents of the army mistakenly killing civilians that they believe are insurgents, as well as creating an atmosphere of war in everyday life. Human Rights Watch report The Human Rights Watch published a 64-page report on the conflict in early August 2019, based on research conducted in April 2019. The report was titled \\"The War in Catatumbo\\". The report was compiled from original interviews, written testimonies in possession of the Colombian government, NGO and international publications, and reviews of official reports and statistics. The HRW conducted interviews with over 80 people in the region, some by telephone and some in person in C√∫cuta, and saw written testimonies from almost 500 victims of abuses from the conflicts. The report makes sure to point out that all statistics related to deaths, attacks, and abuses are almost certainly higher than documented because of a multitude of restrictions in recording complete information. Some of those who conducted the research were interviewed about their experiences carrying it out, mentioning surprise that though Colombia seems like a modern society with a government that has departments to respond to inquiries, this does not operate in some parts of the country, instead there is hyper-control of society in those parts by armed militants. The director of Human Rights Watch Americas, Jos√© Miguel Vivanco, assured that despite a peace treaty making appearances good, \\"[t]he country is at war in Catatumbo!\\" The report concludes that \\"[t]he Colombian government is not meeting its obligations to protect and vindicate the rights of civilians who are victims of the conflict between armed groups in Catatumbo and who are suffering serious abuses by the armed groups\\" and \\"[t]he Attorney General‚Äôs Office has, so far, largely failed to ensure justice for serious abuses committed by armed groups\\".

Situated on a high mount on the Iori River, the complex consists of a castle and a domed dodecagonal church, both dated to the 10th century, as well as another small hall church, and some other accessory structures. All structures within the complex are half-ruined or significantly damaged. They are all inscribed on the list of the Immovable Cultural Monuments of National Significance.  Architecture  Bochorma church of St. George. Frescoes in the church of St. George. The Bochorma complex is located 2 km east of the modern village of Bochorma, on the left bank of the Iori, overlooking the river valley from a 300 m-high mountain ridge on the southwestern slopes of the Gombori Range. The fortress is relatively easily accessible from the east. Otherwise, its walls follow the ragged mountainous terrain, making most of the surrounding natural defenses. The fortress occupies the area of 1.5 ha. The inner part of the citadel stands on the irregular ground and is surrounded by a high curtain wall, with towers. The citadel contains the domed church of Saint George, a palace, a small hall church, a cylindrical tower, and some other accessory structures. The church of Saint George is a hexaconch‚Äîa six- apse domed building‚Äîoriginally constructed in the 10th or 11th century and since then remodeled several times. Built of sandstone, both inner and outer walls were once faced with dressed stone slabs. The entrances are located in the southwestern and northwestern apses. The southwestern porch is topped by a belfry, which is a 17th-century annex. The altar apse is demarcated by an 18th-century brick iconostasis. The outer layout is dodecagonal, each facet covered by a pitched roof. The base of the dome, now in ruins, is pierced with six windows. The interior bears frescoes, which are, judging from the style of paintings, dated to the early 12th century and in a very poor state of preservation. These includes scenes from the lives of Jesus and Saint George and portraits of various saints. In the lowest register of the northeastern conch of the church is a donor who is identified with King David IV of Georgia (r. 1089-1125). He stands next to an image of the Byzantine emperor Constantine the Great and his mother Helena. The iconography illustrates David's promotion of his status as a Christian monarch and a claim to symbolic succession to the Byzantine emperor in the region, which he had only acquired in 1104. A nearby small church is a hall church design, with the dimensions of 4.7 √ó 3.7 m, built of cobblestone. It is a late medieval structure, with a semicircular apse and the southern doorway.  History  The Bochorma fortress is first mentioned in the medieval Georgian chronicles in an account of the Sajid invasion of Georgia of 914. When the Sajid army advanced to Bochorma, then one of the principal strongholds of the principality of Kakheti, the fortress was abandoned without a fight, in contrast to the earlier steadfast defense of the Ujarma fortress. Later, Bochorma was seized by Shurta, an estranged brother of Kvirike II of Kakheti (), and turned by him over to George II of Abkhazia. The fortress was soon recovered by the Kakhetians, but they lost it to Bagrat III of Georgia in the war of 1008‚Äì1010. In 1069, Bagrat IV of Georgia bartered Bochorma and Ujarma away to Aghsartan I of Kakheti in exchange of the captive emir Fadl ibn Muhammad of Arran, whom Bagrat wanted to keep as his prisoner. The Bochorma fortress was functional well into the 18th century, being renovated by King Heraclius II in 1749.

Pizzo (born December 1944) is an American professor, physician, and scientist. He is the David and Susan Heckerman Professor of Microbiology and Immunology at Stanford University, and founding director of Stanford's Distinguished Careers Institute. He served as the 11th Dean of the Stanford University School of Medicine from 2001 to 2012. He spent over two decades at the National Institutes of Health, and has devoted much of his medical career to the diagnosis, management, prevention and treatment of children with cancer and AIDS. He has also focused on the future of higher education, specifically for individuals in mid- to late-life. Early life Pizzo was born and raised in The Bronx, New York, into a first-generation Sicilian immigrant family. He was the first in his family to attend college. He received his bachelor of science degree in biology from Fordham University in 1966, and his medical degree from the University of Rochester School of Medicine in 1970. Career Following medical school Pizzo completed an internship and residency in pediatrics at Children's Hospital Boston. His clinical research examined a wide range of issues involving infection and fevers in children with cancer, helping to identify the best ways to treat the infections. He went on to a teaching fellowship at Harvard Medical School, and a clinical and research fellowship in pediatric oncology at the National Cancer Institute (NCI), a part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), where he focused on infectious diseases and cancer. In 1976, after his fellowship ended, he was appointed to work at NIH as an investigator in pediatric oncology in the US Public Health Service. In 1980 he was named head of the infectious disease section of the pediatric branch of NCI, and he was named NCI's chief of pediatrics in 1982. At the time of his appointment, NCI focused on cancer, but Pizzo realized the focus should also be on HIV, as the AIDS epidemic had begun to unfold, and he influenced the NIH leaders to take on the care of pediatric HIV cases, developing new approaches to treating and preventing AIDS in children. In 1996, Pizzo relocated to Boston to serve as physician-in-chief and chair of the Department of Medicine at Children's Hospital Boston and the chair of the Department of Pediatrics at Harvard Medical School, where he was the Thomas Morgan Rotch Professor of Pediatrics from 1996 to 2001. His focus during those years was mainly on education, ultimately playing a lead role in the authorization of the Children's Hospital Graduate Medical Education (GME) Program. He joined Stanford University in April 2001 and served as Dean of the School of Medicine through December 2012. During this period, he was also the Carl and Elizabeth Naumann Professor of Pediatrics and of Microbiology and Immunology. Pizzo reshaped the Medical School curriculum to focus on the education and training of physician-scientists. During his tenure as dean, Pizzo oversaw a major expansion of facilities, and a major increase in hiring of faculty, sponsored research, and philanthropic support. He was instrumental in building the Li Ka Shing Center for Learning and Knowledge at Stanford, which opened in 2010, and Stanford's medical school became the first in the US to stop accepting industry financing for specific topics in postgraduate educational programs. In 2013 Pizzo created the Stanford Distinguished Careers Institute (DCI), serving as its founding director, and was also named the David and Susan Heckerman Professor of Pediatrics and of Microbiology and Immunology. The Stanford DCI provides an opportunity for individuals in mid- and later life to return to higher education. Pizzo is credited with leading the initiative in the late 1990s to secure federal funding for resident training in children's hospitals, which is roughly $300 million per year. He played a key role in the development of the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act, which was enacted in 2002 and promoted clinical trials in children. His advocacy at the Food and Drug Administration helped quicken the development of drugs for children with AIDS. His leadership efforts were specifically highlighted and acknowledged in the Congressional Record. He helped establish The Children's Inn at the NIH, which houses the families of children being treated at NCI. Pizzo has served as chair of the Association of Academic Health Centers and of the Council of Deans of the Association of American Medical Colleges. He was elected to the board of directors of the American Society for Clinical Oncology and the Infectious Diseases Society of America. He led two major NAM reports: Relieving Pain in America: A Blueprint for Transforming Prevention, Care, Education and Research (2011) and Dying in America: Improving Quality and Honoring Individual Preferences Near the End of Life (2016). Personal life Pizzo married Peggy Daly in 1967, who works in early childhood education and public policy and is currently a senior scholar in Stanford's School of Education. Pizzo has been a marathon runner for more than four decades.

In November 1911 she was arrested for breaking a window in the Home Office for which she received a 21 day sentence Holloway Prison. Life Turner was born Minnie Sarah Turner on 6 May 1866 in London. She ran a guest house in Brighton, the \\"Sea View\\", which served as a vacation spot, but also a haven for British suffragettes who had been imprisoned for the suffrage cause, many who were recovering from force- feeding. Her boarders included Lady Constance Bulwer-Lytton, Mary Jane Clarke, Emily Davison, Flora Drummond, Annie Kenney, Mary Naylor, Christabel Pankhurst, Emmeline Pankhurst, Emmeline Pethick-Lawrence, Vera Wentworth, and Ada Wright. Turner had hosted Minnie Baldock, and paid the travel costs for her to support the local efforts of Mary Clarke in campaigning during the summer. Turner was arrested twice for her involvement in suffragette protests. In 1910 she was arrested for demonstrating outside the House of Commons of the United Kingdom on Black Friday. In November 1911 she was arrested for breaking a window in the Home Office for which she received a 21 day sentence Holloway Prison. Turner was given a Hunger Strike Medal 'for Valour' by WSPU. Turner's own windows were threatened in retaliation in an anonymous postcard, from 'WHAT HO ALF', and one or two were indeed broken. Turner put a note in the windows affected saying Masculine logic. Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery.\\" In 1912, Emily Davison recuperated from her prison experience with Turner until she was able to travel to Northumberland to see her mother. Turner was a member of the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies (NUWSS) the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU) and the Women's Tax Resistance League(WTRL). She also served as honorary secretary of the Women's Liberal Association in Brighton. Turner died in 1948. Legacy In 2018 a blue plaque honoring Turner was unveiled at the site of the \\"Sea View\\" at 13 Victoria Road, Brighton. Her \\"Holloway brooch\\" was included in the Brighton Museum's 100 years since the Representation of the People Act, 1918-2018 exhibition.

The player characters have no physical attacks, and can only defeat enemies by jumping on them or kicking specific objects at them. The sky surrounding the Master Explorer's airship acts as the central hub, from which the player can access any of the game's worlds. There are four main worlds, each one a closed environment that the player can explore at their own pace. Progression is similar to Super Mario 64: when the player enters a world, they are presented with a task to complete such as gathering coins, finishing an obstacle course, or defeating a boss, among others. Completing one of these tasks will grant the player an Explorer Medallion and return them to the hub world to choose their next destination. A certain number of Explorer Medallions are required to unlock each new world, with a total of 101 Explorer Medallions available to collect in the game. While exploring a world, the player can pick up coins that act as in-game currency and hearts that restore their character's health. Checkpoints are placed throughout each world; if the player character runs out of health, they lose any coins they have collected in that world and their progress is reset back to the last checkpoint they touched. Each world also contains many other collectibles to find, including points of interest on the map, fossils to be excavated, and extra costumes that change the player characters' appearance. The player can use the coins they collect in the worlds to purchase Explorer Tools from the Master Explorer. Some of these tools are passive upgrades that enhance the player characters, such as a magnet to draw in coins from further away or an extra heart to increase the characters' maximum health; others are items that the player can equip and use, including a shovel to dig up fossils and a camera to take photographs. Coins can also be exchanged with a traveling merchant for access to challenge stages that will grant the player additional Explorer Medallions upon completion. As the player collects Explorer Medallions and completes certain tasks, the sky around the airship will populate with landmasses containing entrances to smaller bonus worlds and minigames, as well as other non-player characters to interact with. These characters will reward the player with additional Explorer Medallions for completing extra objectives or finding each world's bonus collectibles, such as an archaeologist searching for fossils or another adventurer in need of golden gears to repair her airship. Completing the game unlocks a more difficult New Game Plus mode, which mirrors the game's worlds and severely limits the player character's health. Development Poi was the first game developed by PolyKid, a small independent studio founded by DigiPen Institute of Technology graduates Paul Ewers and Ben Gable. The two sought to create a new 3D platformer that evoked the spirit of classic entries in the genre such as Super Mario 64, Banjo- Kazooie, and Super Mario Sunshine. The game was first announced in June 2015 for release on Microsoft Windows and Wii U, alongside plans for a Kickstarter campaign to help fund its development. The campaign launched on August 4, 2015, with a target goal of $80,000, but ultimately proved unsuccessful, raising only $27,236. However, PolyKid maintained that development on the game would continue in spite of the campaign's failure. On November 6, 2015, Poi was released via the Steam Early Access service. PolyKid continued active development on the game over the following year, updating the early access build as progress was made. The game ultimately left Early Access and was officially released via Steam on February 1, 2017. Ports of the game for the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One were released digitally on June 27, 2017. A port for the Nintendo Switch published by Alliance Digital Media, dubbed the \\"Explorer Edition\\", received a digital and physical release on October 23, 2017. This version includes optional motion control support, as well as new character costume pieces and a digital art book. Reception The Nintendo Switch version of Poi received an average score of 65/100 from review aggregator Metacritic, indicating mixed reception. Destructoid called the game \\"a competent love letter to the 3D Mario games we love that manages to give players a nice taste of nostalgia while still having its own charm.\\" Nintendo World Report similarly praised the gamplay and feel of the game, but lamented that it often felt derivitave of the previous 3D Super Mario titles it was inspired by, drawing direct comparisons between various elements in Poi and Super Mario 64. Nintendo Life praised the breadth of content and constant influx of new things to do, but criticized the repetition of some of the game's tasks as well as the occasional imprecision of the controls.

He established a Protestant mission on Achill Island, County Mayo, in 1834 and worked there for eighteen years with the aim of bringing Protestantism to the Native Irish Christians who were impoverished in large part due to the colonial policies of the Protestant Ascendancy. Edward Nangle was involved in evangelical attempts to convert Catholics to Protestantism. He opened a Christian school on the island where children were taught reading, writing, agricultural skills and Christianity as part of a Missionary Colony. His presence on the island led to some press coverage and parliamentary debates. The island itself was developed with a pier built at Dugort, a courthouse at Achill Sound and a road network between numerous key locations on the island. A plaque hanging in St. Thomas Church, Dugort, dedicated to Edward Nangle and erected by friends after his death, reads: 228x228px  Early life  Edward Nangle was born into a family from Athboy, County Meath. He descended from the Nangle family who had held the title of Barons of Navan for over six hundred years. Although by tradition, the family was Roman Catholic, Nangle was raised in the Protestant faith since his mother, Catherine Nangle (n√©e Anne Sall) was a practicing Protestant. Nangle's mother died when he was only nine years old and shortly afterwards his father sent him to Cavan Royal School. It is supposed he studied alongside Robert Daly the Bishop of Cashel.  Ordination  Trinity College Dublin After secondary education, Nangle completed a Bachelor of Arts Degree in Trinity College, graduating in 1823. Although contemplating a career in medicine, Nangle decided to enter the ministry. In his biographer's words, he looked ‚Äòforward to ordination as a means of securing an eligible social position‚Äô. It is believed that Nangle's decision to enter the ministry was the first step in what became his 'conversion experience'. As required for his theological education, he read the Bible and through this, 'the Holy Spirit enlightened the young student and he experienced true conversion'. After his theological studies in Trinity College, in the summer of 1824, he was ordained deacon by Thomas O‚ÄôBeirne, Bishop of Meath, for the curacy of Athboy in County Meath. He failed as a curate at first in Athboy and then in Monkstown, where he stayed for less than three weeks. He finally settled in Arva, a small town near Cavan Town, for the following two years. Edward Nangle is described as a 'tall, thin, pale man who spoke in gentle tones coming across as serious and intense'. Nangle's biographer Henry Seddal described his personality: ‚ÄòMr. Nangle was doubtless at times headstrong in forming his opinions, stubborn in holding them and harsh in giving them expression.‚Äô In the words of a close contemporary: ‚Äòwhen animated, the most extraordinary fire lights up his eyes.‚Äô After beginning his ministry in Arva, Edward was affected by the Second Reformation religious revival in Cavan among the tenants of Lord Farnham, the landlord of a thirty-thousand-acre estate. Hundreds of tenants were arriving at Farnham's home converting from Catholicism. He suffered a nervous breakdown and during his convalescence he underwent a conversion experience and decided to dedicate himself to Protestant evangelicalism.  Founding of the Achill Mission Colony  = Beginning = In July 1831, Edward Nangle paid his first visit to Achill Island. He sailed there on the relief ship Nottingham after famine and cholera swept through Mayo and Sligo. After spending a night at Achill Sound, he travelled around the island on horseback. Describing his initial encounter with the island, Nangle wrote: ‚ÄòThe deep silence of desolation was unbroken, except by the monotonous rippling of the tide as it ebbed or flowed, or the wild scream of the curlew disturbed by some casual intruder on its privacy‚Äô. Apparently moved by what he perceived as the spiritual and temporal destitution he witnessed among the people living on the island, Nangle decided to establish the Achill Mission Colony. In the following three years, Nangle bought land on the island and negotiated a thirty-one-year leasing contract with Sir Richard O‚ÄôDonnell, the landlord of the Burrishoole estate, which comprised most of Achill. The Nangle family settled in Dugort on 30 July 1834. They were soon joined by Nangle's assistant, Joseph Duncan, two Scripture readers and Dr Neason Adams and his wife, Isabella. The Achill Mission Colony = School = On 23 December 1834, Nangle opened the Achill Mission's first school. Forty three children attended on the first day, and it was the first free school to open on the island. Within a couple of months there were schools in Dugort, Slievemore, Cashel and Keel, catering for 410 children. In December 1835, a printing press was established at the Mission Colony headquarters at Dugort. It had been granted as a gift to the group by friends in London and York. On 31 July 1837, Nangle printed the first edition of the Achill Herald. This was a monthly Protestant newspaper and within two years, its circulation exceeded three thousand amounting to approximately a third of The Times circulation at that time. The Achill Herald was published continuously each month from 1837 to 1868 when it merged with other Protestant publications. Four years after he took up residence on Achill, Edward Nangle wrote: ‚ÄòThe Missionary Settlement has since grown into a village ‚Äì the sides of a once barren mountain are now adorned with cultivated fields and gardens ‚Ä¶ and the stillness of desolation which once reigned is now broken by the hum of the school and the sound of the church-going bell.‚Äô An orphanage was established in 1838, and in the summer of that year, Archbishop Trench visited the island for the first time. In 1839, the Slievemore Hotel was built, and a year later hotels were built at Achill Sound and in Newport. By 1840, a traveller could leave Dublin in the mail on a Thursday evening, sleep in Newport on Friday, reach Achill Sound on Saturday, and worship in Saint Thomas's Church, Dugort, on Sunday morning. By the early 1840s, the Achill Mission Colony included two-storey slated houses, a printing press, an orphanage, a hospital, a post office, a dispensary, a corn mill and farm buildings, surrounded by fields reclaimed from the wet mountain slopes. In 1842, the colony accommodated fifty-six families comprising 365 individuals. Only eleven of these families (one-fifth of the total) were originally Protestant; the remaining forty-five families were originally Catholic. = Famine years = During the famine, in the spring of 1847, Nangle and the colony employed 2,192 labourers and fed 600 children a day. In July 1847, it was suggested that 5,000 out of Achill's total population of 7,000, were receiving practical support from the mission, which had planted twenty-one tons of blight-free foreign potatoes. Allegations of ‚Äòsouperism‚Äô - offering material benefits in return for religious conversion - were made against Edward Nangle in the famine years as food was provided to children in the Colony schools and conversions increased. Thomas Plunkett, the Protestant Archbishop of Tuam, arrived at the island in the autumn of 1848 to find that there were over 2,000 children attending the mission schools. The same year, more than 3,000 were working for the mission, clearing land and building roads and walls. In November 1848, the barque William Kennedy, freighted with 220 tons of Indian meal, arrived in Achill from Philadelphia. It had enough supplies to feed 2,000 people and cost ¬£2,200 paid for out of the mission funds. In March 1848, hundreds of people from Dooniver, Bullsmouth and Ballycroy approved a declaration of thanks to Nangle for supplying them with potatoes and turnips during the famine, without which they would have starved. In September 1849, 400 children were confirmed at the Achill Mission. Only twenty-eight of these were children of Protestants - the remaining 372 were converts, the majority of children in the Achill Mission schools. =St. Thomas Church= In 1848, a site was obtained for a new church in Dugort. The church was eventually erected with the aid of funds from a widow in Cheltenham, England who had donated a sum of ¬£2,400. On 18 March 1855, St. Thomas Church was opened for divine service by Bishop Plunkett. The service was attended by 500 people including one convert of 107 years of age who walked five miles to attend.  Opposition from the Roman Catholic Church  Catholic Archbishop John MacHale The Catholic Church opposed Nangle and the Achill Mission Colony from the start. At the first Sunday school, a devout Catholic is reported to have stood near the gate with a rod threatening to beat each of the attending children. Additionally, one of the scripture readers was reportedly assaulted by two men, thrown to the ground and his clothes torn. Nangle was warned of a secret plan to attack the colony, kill those living there, burn the buildings and put an end to the Achill Mission. No attack took place but it is believed that the preparations made deterred the assailants. In the summer of 1835, John MacHale made his first visit to Achill as Catholic Archbishop of Tuam. Followed by a crowd holding banners with the words, ‚ÄòDown the Schematics‚Äô, the Archbishop led a procession of thirteen priests. A succession of the priests addressed the crowd and denounced the colony, pronouncing a curse on all who dared associate themselves with the nearby Protestant settlement. In 1835, after the Mission opened schools in Dugort, Cashel, Keel and Slievemore, the local parish priest responded by opening three competing schools. Nangle had an immediate grievance against the master of Dugort national school because he had reportedly ‚Äòwith a knife in his hand threatened to take the head of one of the children attending a school under [mission] patronage.‚Äô In 1836, John MacHale again visited Achill. This time speaking to a large crowd outdoors he said: ‚ÄòI call upon you to make a solemn promise this day not to have anything to do with the Achill Mission people ... There is no place outside of Hell which more enrages the Almighty than the Protestant colony ... I shall not dirty my mouth with the names of some of the people who are sending their children to the colony school. I hope they will give up doing so.‚Äô In 1837, McHale made another visit, this time stirring up the populace against what he called ‚Äòthese venomous fanatics‚Äô referring to those involved with the Achill Mission Colony. Not long after his visit, a schoolmaster and scripture reader from the Mission Colony, were beaten on Clare Island, and were forced to take refuge in a lighthouse before they could escape the island on a coastguard vessel. On 2 January 1839, Francis Reynolds, a coastguard officer who was denounced by name at Catholic services on several successive Sundays, died as a result of being hit on the head in a house in Keel. John and Bridget Lavelle were cleared of his murder at a trial in Castlebar in spring 1839. The two main witnesses in the case of the Reynolds murder were schooled in their evidence by a local Catholic priest who was aggressive to the Mission. Nangle accused the Crown of holding a ‚Äòmock‚Äô trial and as a direct consequence of these and other incidents, a new courthouse was built at Achill Sound. A significant development occurred in 1851 when the Achill Mission purchased a considerable amount of land from the Encumbered Estates Court and became the largest landlord on Achill Island. Shortly afterwards Edward Nangle was transferred to the parish of Skreen, County Sligo. In 1851, MacHale decided to buy 1,200 acres of island land from Sir Richard O‚ÄôDonnell. Shortly afterwards, the foundations were laid for a Franciscan monastery, a school for the local children, a glebe house for two priests and a model farm to provide education in modern systems of agriculture. In MacHale's own words, he planned to counteract ‚Äòthe mischievous speculators, who, more than twenty years ago, bought a farm in Achill and planted themselves there to drive a lucrative trade on English credulity‚Äô. In the process of building the new monastery complex, Archbishop MacHale's workmen were accused of stealing stones from Nangle's land. On Wednesday, 7 October of the same year, the police arrested a man charged with theft in relation to a heap of stones. After the workmen continued to steal stones from Nangle's land, a court case proceeded. But Daniel Cruise, the judge, dismissed the court case on the grounds that ‚Äòboth sides were equally to blame‚Äô.  Public scrutiny  In the summer of 1842, Samuel and Anna Hall visited the Achill mission. The visit was part of an Irish tour which the couple had embarked on with the aim of producing a guide book of Ireland for tourists entitled, Ireland: Its Scenery and Character. Arriving at the Colony, they conducted a brief overview of the mission, taking into account the finances expended and the practical results. However, they were not 'enamoured' by Nangle's strict approach to the entrants of the school, the mission and the orphanage. Although they were at the Colony for less than two hours on 22 June 1842, the Halls branded the Mission ‚Äòa complete failure‚Äô and targeted Nangle, labelling him as a man without any genuine sense of gentle, peace-loving, Christian zeal. In a personal letter to Nangle, Samuel Hall wrote: ‚ÄòBe assured, sir, that religion is strong enough to overcome your miserable attempts to degrade it ‚Äì that Christianity cannot be permanently tainted by coarseness, ignorance and bigotry of which you are representative. I have done my duty.‚Äô In a response to the Halls' visit, Edward Nangle highlighted the significant fact that the visit had only lasted less than two hours: ‚ÄòTruly, sir, the rapidity with which you can require experience throws into shade the wonders of the steam press!‚Äô As to the Halls‚Äô references to the cost of the Mission's activities, Nangle replied: ‚Äòas if the salvation of immortal souls for which Christ died, was not a worthy object for the expenditure of a smaller sum of the world‚Äôs wealth than is often squandered without a rebuke, on the follies and vanities of this perishing world‚Äô. Asenath Nicholson The Halls‚Äô report of the Mission along with the record a similar visit undertook by Asenath Nicholson, an American author, drew unwelcome attention to the expenditure and income of the Achill Mission Colony and raised questions about the benefits of the organisation. The Halls drew up another report of the Mission in 1849, towards the end of the Great Famine, this time with a more benign approach. They paid tribute to the work of the mission staff during the crisis months of the famine, saying they were ‚Äòindefatigable in their efforts to raise funds‚Äô and ‚Äòdistributed with no sparing had to those who must otherwise have perished‚Äô. By 1853, the Halls were trying to avoid being drawn in to comment on the island and advised visitors to make their own judgment. By then Nangle had left Achill, and the previous allegations continued to surround the Achill Mission Colony.  Final years  In 1852, Nangle left Achill after 18 years working on the island, and moved to County Sligo, where he became Rector of Skreen. Shortly afterwards he married - for the second time - Sarah Fetherstonhaugh. From the early 1860s, Edward Nangle began a legal battle with Joseph Napier, one of the trustees of the Achill mission committee. The case started as a minor disagreement over the election of committee members, but it escalated into a major court case that dragged on for years, draining the resources of the Achill estate. Edward Nangle returned to Achill briefly in 1879 writing ‚ÄòAs I have now completed my 80th year, and am very infirm, I am unable to work for our dear people in Achill as I did for upwards of 40 years of my life.‚Äô In 1881, he moved to Dublin and died on Sunday 9 September 1883, at the age of 84. He died at his home 23, Morehampton Road, Dublin with his second wife, Sarah by his side. Nangle is buried in Deansgrange Cemetery, Monkstown, in Dublin. Immediately following Nangle's death, the opposing views of the members of the Protestant community in Ireland were evident. The Irish Ecclesiastical Gazette ‚Äì an organ of the Church of Ireland ‚Äì labelled Nangle as ‚Äòan Evangelical of the old school‚Äô while also passing judgment on the Achill Herald professing that it was ‚Äòstrangely deficient in Church teaching‚Äô. The negative critique of the Gazette continued into another article reviewing Nangle's biography: ‚ÄòEveryone has their own idea of heroism, and practices hero-worship after their own fashion. We are free to confess that the late Rev Edward Nangle was not a hero to our mind...‚Äô In contrast, the Church Advocate which had amalgamated with the Achill Herald stated that ‚Äòfew clergymen of the Church of Ireland were better known or more highly valued in his day, as he was a man of much intellectual power, a clear expositor of sound scripture, and a powerful writer‚Äô.

It is an indolent disease which on rare occasions progresses to a more aggressive lymphoma that spreads beyond these originally involved sites. The disorder now termed DFL had been considered to be a follicular lymphoma that develops in one or more sites of the GI tract (i.e. stomach, duodenum, jejunum, small intestine, large intestine and rectum) as well as in various sites outside of the GI tract; this contrasts with other forms of follicular lymphoma which do not involve the GI tract. The disorder was regarded as a subtype of follicular lymphoma termed primary intestinal follicular lymphomas or Primary gastrointestinal tract follicular lymphomas. However, follicular lymphomas of the duodenum and other parts of the small intestine differ from the other forms of primary intestinal lymphomas in that they are indolent, highly localizes disorders that have a low rate of progression to a systemic disease. In consequence, the World Health Organization (2017) kept the more widespread primary intestinal lymphomas within the follicular lymphoma category and reclassified duodenal-/small intestinal-localized lymphoma as a distinct disease entity, DFL. DFL, while currently considered a malignant disease, has many clinical features which are more similar to the benign predecessor of follicular lymphomas viz., in situ follicular lymphoma, than to follicular lymphoma. Like in situ follicular lymphoma, DFL is most commonly a symptom-free disease that is diagnosed incidentally in patients who are undergoing endoscopy for other reasons. Also like in situ follicular lymphoma, DFL may in rare cases regress spontaneously or progress to a more serious and aggressive form.  Presentation  DFL most commonly afflicts middle-aged adults with a male to female ration of ~1. The disease is usually asymptomatic and diagnosed as an unexpected finding when examining patients by upper GI tract endoscopy conducted for other reasons. A minority of patients present vague abdominal symptoms or, rarely, more specific and serious symptoms such as obstructive jaundice caused by tumors in the duodenum which occlude the bile duct. The endoscopic examination typically reveals one or more polyps, nodules, or confluent whitish granules located in various parts of the GI tract which in a study of 54 patients conducted in Japan were distributed as follows: first (i.e. superior or bulbus) part of the duodenum, 4 patients; second (i.e. descending) part of the duodenum, 54 patients; combined third (i.e. horizontal or inferior), and fourth (i.e. ascending) part of the duodenum, 31 patients; jejunum, 44 patients; ileum, 17 patients; cecum, 13 patients; colon and rectum, each 2 patients; and stomach and esophagus, no patients. Lesions were limited to the second part of the duodenum in only 7 patients. In some cases, the lesions may be ulcerated.  Pathophysiology  DFL is due to the accumulation of monoclonal (i.e. cells descendent from a single ancestral cell) centrocytes and their precursor centroblasts to form follicle-like structures in the duodenum and other parts of the small intestine. In virtually all cases of the disease, these cells bear a pathological genomic abnormality that is typical of most but not all forms of follicular lymphoma, i.e. a translocation between position 32 on the long (i.e. \\"q\\") arm of chromosome 14 and position 21 on chromosome 18's q arm. This t(14:18)q32:q21) translocation juxtaposes the B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL2) gene on chromosome 18 at position q21.33 near to the immunoglobulin heavy chain locus (IGH@) on chromosome 14 at position q21, and in consequence causes the overexpression of this gene's product protein, BCL2 apoptosis regulator (i.e. Bcl2). Blc2 functions to inhibit programmed cell death thereby prolonging cell survival. The overexpression of Bcl2 in the B-cells of ISFL is thought to be a critical factor in their pathological accumulation and subsequent malignant progression. Gene expression profiling studies find that the tissues involved in DFP highly express certain genes that are unlike those expressed by the tissues in other forms of follicular lymphoma and more closely match those expressed by the tissues in MALT lymphoma, a lymphoma involving the mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue of the GI tract, airways, conjunctiva, vulvo-vagina tract, and skin. The highly express genes in both disorders include: 1) CCL20, a chemokine that is a chemoattractant for lymphocytes and 2) MAdCAM-1, a cell adhesion protein on mucosal vascular endothelial cells that binds to the Œ±4Œ≤7 homing receptor on lymphocytes. and 3) C-C chemokine receptor type 6, which is the lymphocyte receptor for CCL20. Working together, these genomic abnormalities are thought to deliver virtually immortalized centrocytes and centroblases to the involved GI tract tissues in duodenal-type follicular lymphoma. Furthermore, The malignant cells in DFL express immunoglobulin heavy chains made from specific rather than various gene segments of the IGH@ region on chromosome 14. In one study, for example, heavy chains made form VH4 and VH5 segments were expressed in a higher percentage of DFL cases than expected. These findings, along with those showing similarities in the profiles of highly expressed genes in DFL and mantle cell lymphoma suggest that DFL, like mantle cell lymphoma, develops as a consequence of chronic inflammation and specific antigen stimulation. In support of this possibility, there have been reports that DFL regresses in patients who are successfully treated for concurrent Helicobacter pylori infestation of the GI tract.  Diagnosis  Histological examination of the lesions in DFL usually reveals them to be localized to the GI tract mucosa and submucosa. The lesions consist of abnormal germinal center-containing lymphoid follicles overcrowded with a uniformly-sized population of malignant centrocytes and rare centroblasts. The lesions are classified as low grade (i.e. Lugano classification Grades 1 or 2) in 95-100% of cases. Immunochemical analyses indicate that the latter cells express CD20, CD10, BCL6, and CD79A and have a very low proliferation rate as defined by the intensity of their expression of Ki-67. They also overexpress Bcl2 as a consequence of having the t(14:18)q32:q21) translocation. These findings are similar to those in follicular lymphoma but the malignant cells in DFL generally have fewer genomic abnormalities than those in follicular lymphoma and the profile of overexpressed genes in DFL tissues more closely resemble those in marginal zone than follicular lymphoma tissues. The diagnosis of DFL depends on finding: the cited histological, and immunolochemical abnormalities; the t(14:18)q32:q21) translocation; and no evidence that the disease ranges outside of the GI tract as evidenced by negative results for, e.g. bone marrow biopsy and CT scan of the abdomen which thereby rule out involvement of the bone marrow and mesenteric as well as other abdominal lymph node, respectively. = Differential diagnoses = Follicular lymphoma differs from DFL by having: lesions which commonly lie outside of the GI tract sites outlined in the Presentation section; a histology more often categorized as Grade 3; and malignant cells that express activation-induced cytidine deaminase but not CD27, CCL20, MAdCAM-1, or C-C chemokine receptor type 6. MALT lymphoma differs from DFL by having: lesions which commonly lie in the stomach and other tissues outside of the GI tract sites outlined in the Presentation section (except for a special subtype of malt lymphoma termed immunoproliferative small intestinal disease that is endemic to the Middle East); involvement of malignant B-cells that do not express CD5, CD10, or BCL6 and commonly have a translocation between chromosomes 18 and 11, i.e. t(11:18) but not the t(14:18)q32:q21) translocation; and associations with chronic inflammatory diseases and chronic antigen stimulation; Mantle cell lymphoma differs from DFL by having: only occasional involvement of the GI tract with polyps that on histologic examination may involve the lamina propria and often infiltrate between rather that replacing intestinal glands and malignant cells which commonly express cyclin D1 and a translocation between chromosomes 11 and 14, i.e. t(11:14) but not the t(14:18)q32:q21). translocation.  Treatment  DFL is generally an indolent disease which progresses to a more aggressive form in <10% of cases. A watch-and-wait strategy has been a generally recommended treatment for the disease in the United States, Japan, and Europe. However, numerous approaches have been used to treat the disease. Patients with disease that is contained within a limited radiation field have been treated with radiation therapy to attain overall 10 year survival rates of 60-80%. However, one study found that radiation-treated patients had a relapse rate of 48%. A retrospective analysis conducted on a small number (i.e. 63) of patients found complete regression rates for a watch-and-wait tactic, radiotherapy, and rituximab (a monoclonal antibody directed against CD20) of 29%, 100%, 80%, respectively. The complete regression rate for a CHOP chemotherapy regimen, CHOP plus rituximab regimen, radiotherapy plus rituximab regimen, pancreaticoduodenectomy (i.e. surgical removal of the duodenum and pancreas), and other chemotherapeutic regimens, when combined as a single group, was 64%. Only two patients in this study had diseases which progressed to outside of the GI tract; both were in the watch-and-wait group. Until further studies are conducted to define the optimal regimens for treating DFL, most patients with the disease are being initially treated with a watch-and- wait approach in order to avoid the toxic side-effects of the cited alternate regimens.

It first appeared in the border regions of England and Wales in 1959, and has since spread world-wide. Lambs that are born with BD are commonly known as 'hairy shakers' due to the primary presentation of the disease. The disease was recognized before the virus, therefore the common name of the disease predates the understanding of the viral pathology. The virus can cause a significant reduction in the percentage of surviving lambs, thus it has a large economic impact on farmers.  Virus  Border disease is caused by Pestivirus D, also called simply \\"border disease virus\\" (BDV), in the family Flaviviridae. It is the same virus causing the disease. It was given a scientific name in 2018 by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses, after it had been identified. This virus is not host exclusive. It is noncytopathogenic -it does not kill its host cells. It is a single stranded RNA virus that is labile in the environment.  Epidemiology  Transmission is vertical or horizontal by nose to nose contact. The main source of infection is persistently infected animals. While border disease is caused by border disease virus, in areas of the world where close contact between sheep and goats and cattle occurs, similar clinical signs may be caused in sheep and goats by bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV). It is therefore important to identify truly infected animals through direct detection of the virus by finding viral RNA in the blood or tissues, or by isolating the virus, growing it in a cell culture, and identifying it with immunostaining.  Vaccination  There is currently no vaccine available in the UK, but there are vaccines available in the USA and other areas of Europe. While there are vaccines, not all authorities consider them efficacious. BVDV vaccines for cattle have been used, but the viruses are distinct, and therefore will not work. Control is established through blood-testing sheep, and culling seropositive animals.  Clinical signs  Lambs with Border disease While border disease primarily causes congenital issues, it can also manifest as acute infection or persistent infection. =Acute infection = Most healthy animals will only experience subclinical disease or very mild infection. A slight fever and a mild leukopenia may be seen with a short-lived viremia, detectable between days 4-11 post infection, at which point the virus is neutralized by the animal's immune system. =Fetal infection= While the level of evident maternal infection may be minimal, the consequences for the fetus are serious before day 85 of gestation. After day 85, the lamb is most likely to be born normal with antibodies to the virus, given the state of the fetal immune system at this stage in gestation. Fetal infection manifests as four syndromes: # Early embryonic mortality # Abortion and stillbirth # Congenital malformation # Birth of small weak lambs with immunosuppression The animals that do survive to live birth will frequently show the 'hairy shaker' signs. The virus gathers in fetal lymphoid tissue, hair follicles, and the central nervous system. The 'hairy shakers' are born with hair (not wool) and the shaking comes from cerebellar hypoplasia. =Persistent viraemia= Feti that are infected between 60‚Äì85 days of gestation have a 50% chance of survival. The fetus is not immunocompetent at this stage and viral replication within fetal tissues is uncontrolled. Feti that survive infection at this stage of gestation will be tolerant of the virus and their immune system will not properly respond to it. As such there is no inflammatory response, but the characteristic 'hairy shaker' changes are still present. Some animals will continue to survive with viremia, while most will die by 6 months of age.  Diagnosis  Diagnosis is made through observation of clinical signs, presence of disease in the area, and confirmation made by serology: ELISA for virus antigen  References  Category:Pestiviruses Category:Sheep and goat diseases ","title":"Border disease"},{"id":"61515111","text":"Roslin in a famous character actress in Malayalam film and TV industry who won Kerala State Film Award for Second Best Actress for her role in 2003 movie ; Paadam Onnu: Oru Vilapam.

It is the first of several stories he wrote concerning duels between knife-fighters, which Borges recognized as one of his archetypal themes. \\"The story is one I have been retelling, with small variations, ever since. It is the tale of the motiveless, or disinterested, duel‚Äîof courage for its own sake.\\"  History of publication  A version of the story was first published on February 26, 1927 under the name \\"Police legend\\" (original Spanish title: \\"Leyenda Policial\\") in the literary magazine Mart√≠n Fierro, and then in 1928 in El idioma de los argentinos as \\"Men Fought\\" (original Spanish title: \\"Hombres Pelearon\\"). Under the pseudonym Francisco Buscos, Borges published a third version, \\"Men of the Neighborhoods\\" (original Spanish title: \\"Hombres de las Orillas\\"), in Cr√≠tica in 1933. A revised version was later published in the 1935 collection A Universal History of Iniquity.  Plot summary  The story is told from the first-person perspective of an unnamed narrator, who recounts the events of a particular night at a Villa Santa Rita bar and brothel. The clientele, including the narrator, spend the evening drinking and dancing the tango. Their festivities are interrupted by the arrival of a formidable stranger in black. When the narrator and some of the other patrons try to fight him, he effortlessly brushes them away. As he leads his gang into the room, the stranger introduces himself as Francisco Real, also known as \\"the Yardmaster,\\" a knife fighter from the Northside district of Buenos Aires. He announces to the group that he has come to challenge the local tough, \\"the Sticker\\" Rosendo Ju√°rez, who at the time commanded the respect and admiration of the entire neighborhood. Ju√°rez ignores the challenge despite the urgings of his girlfriend, the local beauty, La Lujanera. To her disgust, Ju√°rez flings his knife out the window and slips out into the street. La Lujanera decries his cowardice and, wrapping her arms around the Yardmaster, chooses to dance with him, instead. Eventually the two of them step outside, arm in arm; the Yardmaster implies that they will sleep together. The narrator, overwhelmed with feelings of shame and dishonor, follows them outside. He reflects on his sense of insignificance, on Rosendo's (and his) impotence in the face of a \\"bully\\" like the Yardmaster. At some point the narrator returns to the brothel. La Lujanera returns shortly thereafter, followed by the Yardmaster, who is dying from a knife wound to the chest. La Lujanera tearfully explains to the patrons that after the two of them left, a stranger ‚Äì not Rosendo ‚Äì appeared, challenged the Yardmaster to a fight, and stabbed him in the dark. The Yardmaster dies on the floor of the brothel. When a patron accuses La Lujanera of murdering him, the narrator comes to her defense and mocks the group by pointing out the irony of a man as fierce as the Yardmaster dying in a backwater neighborhood where nothing ever happens. The patrons hear the police approaching, and wanting to avoid the law, they loot the Yardmaster's body and dispose of it in the river. Dawn breaks, La Lujanera takes her leave, and the brothel returns to normal. The narrator concludes by describing to his audience ‚Äì revealed to be Borges himself ‚Äì how he returned to his house. As the narrator strolls down the street inspecting his dagger, he looks up to see a light burning in the window of his house. It is implied that the narrator is the one who killed the Yardmaster, and that La Lujanera is in his home, waiting for him.  Connections to Borges' other works  In 1970, Borges published a prequel to \\"The Man on Pink Corner,\\" called \\"The Story from Rosendo Ju√°rez,\\" which retells the night's events from Ju√°rez's perspective.  Adaptations  \\"Man on Pink Corner\\" was adapted into a 1962 film of the same title by Argentine director Ren√© M√∫gica. It was shown at the Cannes and San Sebasti√°n film festivals, and was favorably received by Borges, who commented that the director \\"did a good job with the possibilities provided by the plot.\\" References Category:Short stories by Jorge Luis Borges Category:1927 short stories ","title":"Man on Pink Corner"},{"id":"61515131","text":"Arunava Sen is an Indian politician.

She has written, researched, and translated many English novels and political articles. She resides in Canada since 1998 when she had emigrated from Iran.  Biography  Born and raised to a working class family in Kashan, Pedramnia studied English literacy at the University of Tehran. She was admitted then to Iran University of Medical Sciences and graduated as a physician in 1997. In Canada, she obtained a Health informatics degree from McMaster University. She is currently writing and translating about a variety of matters, including novels, literature critics, and social issues. Pedramnia has also frequently written for international Iranian newspapers and websites.  Books  She is the author of three novels in the Persian language, ŸÜŸÅ€åÿ± ⁄©Ÿà€åÿ± (Nefir Desert), ÿ≤€å⁄ØŸàÿ±ÿßÿ™ (Ziggurat), and ÿ≤ŸÖÿ≥ÿ™ÿßŸÜ ÿ™ŸæŸá‚ÄåŸáÿß€å ÿ≥ŸàŸÖÿß (Winter on the Soma Hills), on themes which reveal underlying social issues in Iran. She has also translated into Persian texts by various authors such as Colm T√≥ib√≠n, E. L. Doctorow, Naomi Klein, Joan London (Gilgamesh), Noam Chomsky (Failed States: The Abuse of Power and the Assault on Democracy), Richard B. Wright (Clara Callan), F. Scott Fitzgerald (Tender Is the Night, 2009), Vladimir Nabokov (Lolita, 2014) and James Joyce (Ulysses). A translation of Margaret Atwood's Alias Grace had not been published as of January 2019, as, according to Pedramnia, the publishers had requested cuts which she did not agree to. She received a scholarship to carry out research at the James Joyce Foundation in Zurich, to aid her translation of Ulysses.  Activism on censorship  Pedramnia is best known for her work in challenging and criticizing Iranian censorship opposing freedom of speech and expression of writers and artists. In 2013 she translated Vladimir Nabokov's Lolita into Persian, almost sixty years after its only other Persian translation. The book was published in Afghanistan, another Persian language speaking nation and Iran's neighbouring country, by a Kabul-based publisher named Zaryab Publication. Soon after Lolita found its way to the Iranian underground market. In response, the Iranian Minister of Cultural and Islamic Guidance declared that Pedramnia's translation is banned and has been disseminated illegally. The book was later published in a different format as samizdat inside Iran. Due to the same argument her recent work, the translation of James Joyce's Ulysses, another forbidden book, has been planned for publication in six volumes by Nogaam Press, a Persian-language publisher based in London, England which aims to publish Persian writing and translation beyond the censorship concerns faced inside the country. The first volume was released in April 2019. An article in The Globe and Mail describes her as \\"one of the strongest-willed translators active today. Confronting pernicious state-sponsored censorship, watching as dubious publishers eight time zones away put her work into print without permission or payment.\\" The Italian newspaper, Il Foglio writes: \\"This (Lolita) is my translation sold on the streets of Tehran,\\" says Akram Pedramnia at this week's The Boston Globe. \\"The book is forbidden, but people send me these photographs, hiding their faces, of course. And they publish these images on social platforms, showing smuggling\\". A German language newspaper Neue Z√ºrcher Zeitung says: ‚ÄúHer translations are distributed as pirated or over the Internet without her earning a cent ‚Äì but that does not bother Akram Pedramnia.

It stars Leguizamo, Jorge Lendeborg Jr., Angel Bismark Curiel, Will Hochman, Corwin Tuggles, Jeffry Batista, Ramses Jimenez, Rachel Bay Jones and Michael K. Williams. It is scheduled to be released on September 4, 2020, by Vertical Entertainment. Plot Set in 1998, Critical Thinking tells the true story of Cuban-American teacher Mario Martinez and his national championship winning chess team at Miami Jackson High School. Mario Martinez (Mr T) finds himself working as an elective chess teacher with students who were either people of color or minority. Sedrick, a black kid living with his stay at home jobless dad takes chess as an elective course under Mr T, with Ito another black kid who works after school and overtime to support his education. The class comprise of Rodelay known to be the class clown and Gil of Spanish descent. Mr T deals with interference from Principal Kestel who feels the class is made up of academic misfits and chess brings little or no glory to the school name. It was later revealed a student was deported and another one shot dead over a little argument by Andre Lamar and Principal Kestel threatens to cut off funding as the school has been really shot in football than chess. Mr. T then gave up his savings for offset the registration ticket for the Regionals which the boys took easily. At the end of the road trip, Sedrick happily tells his dad about his victory who tells him to get his life straight and decide on his future rather than chess. Ito on the other hand, lost his job and his single mom threw him out of her apartment, he then reveals that he's quitting on the team as he lost all. It dawned on the boys that they needed money for registration for the State Championship and they needed Ito who had previously qualified at the regionals or risk forfeiture. Ito faced interrogation from some officers who believed his homeboy Andre murdered one of the student and would be exonerated if he confess that Andre did it. Soon, Ito, dealing with financial troubles is recruited by the street drug pin for quick numbers. The boys were able to raise funds from carwashing to pay for the States also recruiting a super player, Marcel who Mr. T calls Duchamp. At the last minute, Ito changed his mind and went on road trip with the boys for the tournament. An airline company had promised free flight tickets sponsorship for them if they make it to the Nationals, which they narrowly qualified for due to Rodelay refusal to accept a draw thereby causing him to be Zugzwang. Ito stayed home to fix his life with drug pin Andre straight, either offering him up to the cops or quitting which wasn't much of an idea. The boys progressed with good numbers to be pitted against Akopyan the three time back to back reigning champion. Akopyan was played individually by Marcel who had the best record for the team. At some point in the game, Akopyan who was having a difficult time beating Marcel hands down decided to take bathroom break and suggested Marcel should do same too, meanwhile, mistakenly leaving his clock timer running. Inside the bathroom, Akopyan talked Marcel to a draw, who replied that a win is all his team need to win the tournament. The game is resumed, but Akopyan is upset to find his clock running which puts Marcel up in time advantage, but Marcel wait out about five minutes without a move to level the game time and the two finalist resume fire for fire. Eventually, Marcel checkmates Akopyan and he is crowned new champion alongside the boys and Mr. T. Back home, Ito invited Donny and Andre over for supposedly business talk, but Andre suspects something to be off about the meeting. He seizes Ito's walkman and forbade him from answering the phone, going on talking about Sedrick and his girl Chanaya and what he might do to them. Ito is pissed and grabs Andre and bashes his head on the refrigerator glass till Andre is unconscious and then leaves the store into the street. The movie returns to modern day Ito and Marcel during the end credits. Cast * John Leguizamo as Mario Martinez * Michael K.

It is the twenty-fourth installment in the Need for Speed series and commemorates the series' 25th anniversary. It was released on November 8, 2019. The game received mixed reviews from critics, who mostly found the game to be an improvement over the 2015 Need for Speed reboot and Payback but not enough to be a full return to form for the franchise. Heat was Ghost Games' final game both for the Need for Speed franchise and as a lead developer. In February 2020, EA shifted development of the franchise back to Criterion Games‚Äîthe developers of the Burnout series, Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit (2010) and Need for Speed: Most Wanted (2012)‚Äîand reduced Ghost Games to an engineering studio for the Frostbite engine, reverting their name back to EA Gothenburg.  Gameplay  Need for Speed Heat is a racing game set in an open world environment called Palm City, a fictionalised version of the city Miami, Florida and its surrounding area. The in-game map features diverse geography, including mountainous areas and open fields. Unlike Need for Speed Payback, the game does not include a 24-hour day-night cycle, but players can switch between day and night. During the day, players can take part in sanctioned race events, which reward players with cash to spend on new cars and upgrades. They can also take part in illegal street races at night, which would earn players REP. The more REP a player earns, the more aggressive the police will be during the night. Players must escape the cops and get back to their safehouse, before they are busted, or their car is wrecked. When players return to a safehouse, the REP they have earned during the night will be multiplied by their \\"Heat Level\\". If players are arrested, they will lose their REP multiplier, but will still receive their unmultiplied REP. The REP multiplier mechanic works similarly to the Speed Points multiplier from Rivals. The game also features a storyline in which the players interact with the city‚Äôs police force, led by authority figure Lt. Frank Mercer. Players can smash neon flamingos hidden within the map, which rewards them with a small amount of money or rep depending on the time of day. They can also find graffiti, referred to as \\"Street Art\\" in the game, and send it to the livery editor to use it on their car(s). Lastly, they can complete activities around the open world such as smashing billboards, beating scores on drift zones, getting the highest speeds passing through speed traps, and going the longest distances when performing long jumps. Players may complete \\"Crew Time Trials\\" which allows them to complete short timed events in an attempt to get the #1 spot on the leaderboard in their crew. The game features 127 cars from 33 manufacturers, with Ferrari returning to the game after being absent from Payback due to licensing issues. Unlike Payback, performance upgrades no longer come in random Speedcards and are unlocked by earning REP and winning races. The game does not feature loot boxes; however, time savers, which reveals collectibles on the map, and paid downloadable content was included. Electronic Arts released the NFS Heat Studio app for iOS and Android devices. Users can collect and customise their cars which can be imported into the main game upon release.

Lt. Frank Mercer (Josh Coxx), leader of the police's High-Speed Task Force, announces his intent to ruthlessly pursue and arrest all street racers in the city. The player buys their first car from Lucas Rivera (Jonny Cruz), a local mechanic and retired street racer, who also helps the player enter their first Showdown race, and becomes their mechanic and mentor. Lucas's younger sister, Ana Rivera (Ana Marte), is a street racer whose crew recently disbanded after the task force nearly killed one of her friends. Ana introduces the player to The League, an exclusive crew of Palm City's best street racers, which she aspires to join, and which Lucas almost joined until he suddenly quit racing after their father died. Ana and the player form a new crew to climb the ranks of Palm City's street racers and earn a place in The League. After winning a race, Ana and the player are confronted by Officer Shaw (Josh Collins) of Mercer's task force, who has Ana's Nissan 350Z impounded. When Ana calls the city about her car later, they claim to have no record of it. The player and Ana race The Dreamkillers, another crew vying for The League's attention. After defeating them, they unexpectedly witness Shaw meeting Eva Torres (Shontae Saldana), another task force officer. Shaw shows Torres bags of money in the trunk of his car, extorted from street racers per Mercer's orders. Torres takes one of the bags but warns that Shaw and Mercer's brashness is endangering their unit's activities. Ana steals her father's 1967 Chevrolet Camaro from Lucas's shop so she can join the player in a final showdown against the Dreamkillers, but the race is interrupted by Shaw. The player wrecks Shaw's car, scattering the money from Shaw's trunk onto the street, which creates a publicized spectacle and raises public suspicion about Mercer's and the High-Speed Task Force. However, Lucas is angered by Ana using their father's car without permission. Ana and the player are contacted by Torres, who admits that the High-Speed Task Force is corrupt, but wishes to have Mercer taken down because he's become too reckless. Torres leads them to a warehouse that acts as an illegal chop shop, stripping cars seized by the High-Speed Task Force, or preparing them to be shipped out of the city. Ana realizes her 350Z has already been processed after finding its license plate. The player and Ana enlist The League's help to expose Mercer's activity by crashing a publicity event for the Showdown, and leading the police and local media to the warehouse. En route, they are ambushed by the High-Speed Task Force, and news reporters find the warehouse empty. Ana and the player evade the police and return to Lucas's garage to find him bound and tortured by Mercer, who holds them at gunpoint. Mercer reveals he anticipated the Player's plans after observing them on a security camera in his shop. Mercer forces the player and Ana into his police car, but Lucas, having escaped his bonds, intercepts them in his father's Camaro and rams Mercer's car. Ana steals Mercer's laptop and escapes with Lucas and the player. Lucas takes them to a new hideout on the city's outskirts and admits to Ana the reason he quit street racing was that he believes that their father had his fatal heart attack after hearing about him being arrested for street racing that same night. Ana and Lucas send incriminating files from Mercer's computer to various outlets, proving his corruption and forcing him into hiding, then learn that Mercer is preparing to have the stolen cars in his possession shipped out of Palm City before fleeing as well. As they do not know which cops are complicit or innocent, Ana and Lucas convince The League and other crews across the city to simultaneously goad and draw as many police cars as they can to the port where the cars are being loaded. Confronted by the swarm of police and street racers, Mercer attempts to escape in the BMW M3 GTR from the 2005 Need for Speed: Most Wanted. The player chases down and wrecks Mercer's car, leaving him to be confronted by Torres, who pulls her pistol in response to his threats and is implied to have shot him. Over a week later, Mercer is missing and presumed dead. Torres has been promoted to lead the High-Speed Task Force, and she announces her commitment to end street racing in Palm City. Lucas, having reconciled with Ana, gives her the keys to their father's repaired Camaro. The player and Ana, now members of The League, plan to continue racing and tackle any future challenges together.  Development  The game was revealed with a trailer released on August 14, 2019, followed-up by a gameplay trailer released on August 20, 2019. It was released on November 8, 2019.

Tarrio was convicted of two separate felonies in 2004 and 2013. In 2020, he was a candidate in the Republican primary election for Florida's 27th congressional district, but withdrew. Tarrio is the Florida state director of the grassroots organization Latinos for Trump.  Early life  Tarrio grew up in Little Havana, a neighborhood in Miami, Florida. He identifies as Afro-Cuban. He has been married and divorced. Felony Convictions In 2004 when he was 20 years old, Tarrio was convicted of theft. He was sentenced to three years of probation, community service, and ordered to pay restitution. In 2013, Tarrio was sentenced to 30 months (of which he spent 16) in federal prison for rebranding and reselling stolen medical devices.  Career  After 2004, Tarrio relocated to a small town in North Florida in order to run a poultry farm. He later returned to Miami. He has also started a security equipment installation firm and another providing GPS tracking for companies. Tarrio owns a Miami T-shirt business, known as the 1776 Shop, an online vendor for right-wing merchandise. Slate described the 1776 Shop as a \\"freewheeling online emporium for far-right merch\\" that sells a range of Proud Boys gear including shirts stating \\"Pinochet did nothing wrong\\".  Proud Boys  Tarrio volunteered at a Miami event for far-right commentator Milo Yiannopoulos in May 2017 where he encountered a member of the Proud Boys who encouraged him to join the group. In August 2017, Tarrio attended the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia. His stated intention for attending was to protest the removal of Confederate statues. Tarrio went on to become a fourth-degree member of the Proud Boys, a distinction reserved for those who get into a physical altercation, after punching someone who is believed to be an antifa member in the face in June 2018. He assumed the role of chairman for the organization on November 29, 2018, succeeding Jason Lee Van Dyke, who held the position for two days, and Van Dyke's predecessor Gavin McInnes. Tarrio helped organize the End Domestic Terrorism rally held in Portland, Oregon, on August 17, 2019. The event, co- organized by Joe Biggs, was framed as a response to the June 2019 assault on conservative blogger Andy Ngo.  Political views  In regards to his views on extremist groups and ideologies, Tarrio has been quoted as saying, \\"I denounce white supremacy. I denounce anti-Semitism. I denounce racism. I denounce fascism. I denounce communism and any other -ism that is prejudice towards people because of their race, religion, culture, tone of skin.\\" In regards to his own ethnicity, he has said, \\"I'm pretty brown, I'm Cuban. There's nothing white supremacist about me.\\" After Tarrio confronted and shouted expletives at House Speaker Nancy Pelosi in Coral Gables in late 2018, the chairman of the Miami-Dade GOP apologized and Senator Rubio compared the disruptors to the \\"repudiation mobs Castro has long ago used in Cuba.\\" In 2018, Twitter removed Tarrio's account, amongst others related to the Proud Boys, citing how platform policy prohibited accounts related to violent extremist groups. The following year, another account created by Tarrio to evade the suspension was detected and removed from the platform by Twitter. Tarrio is a close friend of Roger Stone. After Stone was arrested in January 2019, Tarrio appeared outside the courtroom in a shirt emblazoned with the message \\"Roger Stone did nothing wrong\\". Tarrio began a run for Congress for Florida's 27th district in 2020, but withdrew before the Republican Party primary. In his campaign's responses to a Ballotpedia survey done in 2019, Tarrio listed criminal justice reform, protection of the Second Amendment, countering domestic terrorism, ending the war on drugs, free speech on digital platforms, and immigration reform among some of his priorities.

History Sramik Karmachari Oikya Parishad was established on 13 April 1983 by 12 national unions in Bangladesh. This traces to a meeting of 5 unions in Bangladesh in 1982, when union activities where banned under martial law in Bangladesh, that sought to restore workers rights to unionize. The number of participating unions increased to 11 by the end of 1982. The Bangladesh Jatiyatabadi Sramik Dal, aligned with Bangladesh Nationalist Party, joined in 1983 and they collectively formed the Sramik Karmachari Oikya Parishad. The formation was announced at the Jatiya Press Club. They declared a 5-point demand to the Chief Martial Law Administrator of the Government of Bangladesh concerning labour rights. In 1983, Jatiya Sramik League, aligned with Bangladesh Awami League, joined the Sramik Karmachari Oikya Parishad. The military regime led by General Hussain Mohammad Ershad initially tried to ignore demands. Smaller unions in Bangladesh started to follow the Sramik Karmachari Oikya Parishad. The Minister of Industry, Golam Mostafa and Minister of Labor, Aminul Islam, met with representatives of the Sramik Karmachari Oikya Parishad. The government facing the threat of national strike signed an agreement with the Sramik Karmachari Oikya Parishad to increase the rights of workers on 21 May 1984. The Parishad went on strikes to ensure the government implemented the agreement. In 1984, Kazi Zafar Ahmed of Bangla Sramik Federation and Sirajul Hossain Khan of Bangladesh Workers Federation joined Jatiya Party led by Hussain Mohammad Ershad and were appointed government ministers. Their respective organization left the Sramik Karmachari Oikya Parishad following. Tajul Islam of the parshiad was killed by the Bangladesh Police while participating in the strike. In 1986, Ruhul Amin Bhuiyan of the Jatiya Sramik Jote and Shah Mohammad Abu Zafar of the Jatiya Sramik League joined the Jatiya Party which further weakened the parshidad. In the 1990s, the Sramik Karmachari Oikya Parishad signed a number of agreements with the government of Bangladesh for improving labor conditions and carried out a number of strikes to force the government to implement those strikes. Beyond labour issues the organizations has campaigned for greater rights for religious minorities.

Moss became an independent facility in 1952. During the 1990s, MossRehab merged back into the Einstein Healthcare Network. MossRehab's Main Campus is located at 60 Township Line Road, Elkins Park, Pennsylvania.  History  Named after philanthropist Lucien Moss, grandson of John Moss, the Lucien Moss Home for Incurables of the Jewish Faith was founded by the Jewish Hospital Association of Philadelphia in June 1900. The Moss Home initially accepted patients with advanced cases of tuberculosis, but would go on to welcome patients with other chronic illnesses during the years to come. In 1928, Frank H. Krusen founded the Department of Rehabilitation at Temple University, which became home to MossRehab's physical medicine and rehabilitation residency program. In 1961, the Moss Home moved from its original location, where it had been since the early 1900s, into a building with 124 beds in North Philadelphia on Tabor Road. Eventually, the Moss Home became known as Moss Rehabilitation. Between 1961 and 1964, the Moss Home became a stroke evaluation and care clinic. After this, it helped develop the field of physical rehabilitation and officially changed its name to MossRehab. MossRehab established a Rehabilitation Training Center in 1970 and appointed Dorothea Glass, MD, as its Medical Director. Glass was one of the first women to achieve this type of leadership role in rehabilitation. In 1974, MossRehab began a driver training program to teach people with disabilities how to drive safely and independently. MossRehab encourages accessibility through programs such as Camp Independence, a week long camp for adults with physical disabilities; the Clubhouse, a program for people experiencing disabilities after brain injuries; and Young Empowerment Stroke Support Group known as the YESS program, a support system for stroke survivors under the age of 65. MossRehab also participates in They Will Surf Again a day-long event located in Wildwood, New Jersey, that helps people with disabilities experience surfing.  Medical Milestones and Innovations  The following is a list of the most significant milestones for MossRehab: *The Drucker Brain Injury Center: The Philadelphia region's first center dedicated to helping people with traumatic brain injurie was founded in the 1980s. *The Moss Rehabilitation Research Institute**\\\\- Founded in 1992 in order to organize research occurring at MossRehab and start new initiatives. The program focuses on cognitive neuroscience and rehabilitation, traumatic brain injury treatment and outcomes, and movement science and mobility rehabilitation. *ReWalk: In 2009, MossRehab launched the first clinical trials for a wearable motorized robotic exoskeleton. ReWalk is worn around the legs and back to help patients recovering from spinal cord injuries walk again. *The New Accessible Icon: In 2014, MossRehab became the first healthcare facility to adopt. *Dixie James Becoming the President and COO: In 2019, MossRehab appointed Dixie James President and Chief Operating Officer. James is the first African American woman to have this position. *All About Ar: In a way to cope with being diagnosed with disabilities, MossRehab created the All About Art program for patients to create art that will be displayed at MossRehab.  Awards  In 1993, MossRehab was listed on the inaugural list of U.S. News & World Report \\"Best Hospitals for Rehabilitation\\". It has since been on the list for 25 years, and ranked in the top ten for the past decade. In 2019, MossRehab, along with other Einstein Hospitals and Rehabilitation Centers, gained Magnet¬Æ recognition which is the highest honor a healthcare organization can receive for nursing excellence. Accreditation from the Commission on Accreditation of Rehabilitation Facilities, CARF, was awarded to 15 MossRehab programs over a three-year period. 9 MossRehab Physicians have been named to the Philly Magazine's Top Docs list in 2020.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2015. At the time of its nomination it contained 403 resources, which included 291 contributing buildings, of which 201 are houses and 90 are garages, and 112 non-contributing buildings. The historic district is a residential area located to the west of the central business district. It was platted between 1912 and 1916. Initial development in the 1910s was slow, but from the 1920s into the early 1940s, development was steady. It dropped off again after World War II as most of the lots had been developed by then. The houses range in height from one to 2¬Ω-stories. Those on Crescent, Linden, and Beaumont are larger in scale, while the rest are more modest in size. The foundations are generally brick or tile and the exteriors are clad in wood, with a few clad in brick. Architectural styles that were popular from early to mid-20th century are represented. The most popular include Prairie School, American Craftsman, Tudor Revival, Colonial Revival, and Modern. For the most part, the house designs came from a pattern book or catalogue. The streets on the west side of the district follow a grid pattern, while those on the east side are curvilinear.

The buildings have been demolished and the site is now used as a summer camp by Esbjerg Municipality. History Rendbjerg Brickworks was founded in 1783. Hans Heinrich Dithmer, a son of the vicar in Broager, acquired the brickyard in 1805. Under his management it grew to become one of the largest in the Nordic countries. In 1822, Dithmer went to Germany and the Netherlands on a travel stipend from Frederick VI. This inspired him to make hard-burnt, waterproof floor tiles. In 1723, he was awarded the Order of the Dannebrog. Hans Heinrich Dithmer passed away in 1848 and Rendbjerg Brickworks was then continued by his eldest son, Hans Heinrich Dithmer Jr. Another son established Klostermosegaard Brickworks at Helsing√∏r while a third son ran a brickworks at Flensburg. Hans Heinrich Dithmer Jr. went bankrupt in 1883 but the brickyard was then continued by new owners. It closed in 1928.

The site encompasses the ruins of churches, a castle with a circuit wall, and burials. Parts of these ruins correspond to the extinct town of Cheremi known from the early medieval Georgian chronicles and are inscribed on the list of the Immovable Cultural Monuments of National Significance.  History  Cheremi is located on the Chermistsqali, a right-bank tributary of the Alazani River, on the northeastern slopes of the Gombori Range. In Late Antiquity, this area was a strategical borderland between Kartli‚ÄîIberia of the Classical sources‚Äîand Albania. The first recorded mention of Cheremi occurs in the chronicle of Juansher, composed , which credits Vakhtang Gorgasali, the late 5th-century king of Kartli, with building two churches at Cheremi and a citadel between them. Vakhtang is also reported to have bestowed \\"the city of Cheremi\\" upon his elder son, Dachi. Later in Vakhtang's reign, the fortress of Cheremi was destroyed in a Persian attack. Cheremi never fully recovered but retained its function as the seat of a bishop into the 18th century. Troubled by lekianoba, a series of marauding inroads from Dagestan, the Cheremi area had virtually been depopulated by 1757, when its episcopal sea was dissolved and the territory assigned to the neighboring Georgian eparchies of Alaverdi, Bodbe, and Ninotsminda.  Archaeology and layout  Ruins of Cheremi. Ruins of Cheremi. A quest for the ancient city of Vakhtang Gorgasali's times led to an archaeological expedition in the newly revived village of Cheremi in 1979. It unearthed layers from the Late Bronze to the High Middle Ages, among them several stone cist burials, mostly collective, dated to the period between the 3rd and 7th century AD, some of them containing pottery, jewelry, and Roman coins. A 4th‚Äì5th century hall church, that of Saint Marina, was also revealed in this territory. The ruins of the town of Late Antiquity, associated by the medieval chronicles with Vakhtang Gorgasali, was found on a hill some 5 km west of the modern village. The remains of old Cheremi include a citadel, occupying the area of 10 ha, with the ruins of a castle, palace, churches, a circuit wall, and other structures. The Cheremi castle was located on a rocky promontory at the western edge of the hill. Occupying the area of 300 sq. m, it consisted of six chambers, 2 corridors, and a tower. East of this building, there was a palace, with the dimensions of 30.50 √ó 15.70 m. It had three halls, each with a doorway opening to the south. Both these buildings were built of large stone blocks and roofed with red tiles. Further east, a wall led down to the riverbed; the southern segment was a double wall, containing a city gate, with a cobblestone road running through it. Two churches stand on the territory of the ruined Cheremi fortress. One, that of Saint Barbara, is a now-restored hall church, stylistically dated to the late 5th century. It was part of the palace complex. The other is named after Saint George and is also known as Tsverodabali after a small hill it is perched on. This early medieval church, measuring 10.27 √ó 3.74 m and built of dressed sandstone blocks, is also a hall church, with a semicircular apse, horseshoe conch arch, and a heavily damaged ambulatory. The cathedral of Saint Nicholas, in the centre of the modern village, is a three-aisle basilica, with a pentagonal projecting apse in the middle aisle and semicircular apses in the north and south aisles. It was probably built in the 10th or 11th century, on the site of an older church. The south facade of the north aisle bear a stone inscription in the medieval Georgian asomtavruli script, mentioning \\"the catholicos Melchizedek\\". Adjacent of the church are the ruins of a square domed building‚Äîdemolished by the Communist anti-religion activists in 1924‚Äîan oldest Christian shrine or a former Zoroastrian altar. East of the village, at a cemetery, there is a 5th‚Äì6th-century church of Saint David‚Äîa three-aisle basilica of which survives only the middle nave with a horseshoe apse.

Educated at the London School of Economics and qualified as a psychiatric social worker, she worked in an Italian state institution for illegitimate and abandoned children before moving to a home for single mothers in Milan, overseeing changes to the education of children and the training of staff, leading to a transformation of childcare in Italy. Goldschmied developed the concept of \\"heuristic play\\" as a means of relax play for babies under the age of two and for maintaining a special relationship with an individual member of staff. She also introduced a \\"treasure basket\\" containing non-dangerous household items in a low, open basket, an exploration task that was designed not to have any physical intervention from an overseeing adult. Biography =Early life= Elinor Violet Sinnott was born to a middle-class family in rural Gloucestershire on 15 December 1910. She was the fourth of seven children and was raised in the countryside. Goldschmied's brother died when she was eight years old and the death of her mother followed shortly afterwards. The family sent Goldschmied to live with her grandmother and she was educated at the Clifton High School in Bristol. There, she made the decision to enter into a career in education and trained to be a nursery teacher at the Froebel College in Roehampton. Goldschmied worked in the Dartington Hall Junior School for five years in the 1930s. She won a scholarship to enroll on a mental health course at the London School of Economics' Department of Mental Health in 1937 and qualified as a psychiatric social worker. Goldschmied took part in left-wing causes while she was at the university and was a member of the Communist Party of Great Britain. During the Second World War she began as an employee in the mental health sector in the city of Bradford, where she worked with refugees and evacuated children; the latter group with whom she worked with were between the ages of two and four and all were deemed \\"unbilletable\\" because of poor behaviour. Goldschmied got the children to behave better by undertaking a major reorganisation of their daily routines. =Career to death= In 1946, she and her husband Guido relocated to Trieste, Italy, while the commune was under British administration. Goldschmied found a job working in a state institution for illegitimate and abandoned children. During this period she observed babies and children in local orphanages barred from having toys or relationships with other human beings and sought change in this area. In 1948, Goldschmied met Elda Scarzella, the founder of a home for single mothers in Milan, called the Villaggio della Madre e del Fanciullo. There she oversaw the nursery education of the children and training of the staff and pioneered a transformation of childcare in Italy. This experience led to the publication of Goldschmied's first book, The Child in the Nursery, which was one of the first works to address the group care of infant children. In 1954, she took part in the production of two films in Trieste. The first, Lasciatemi almeno giocare, discusses play and how it aids in the development of a child's motor and psycho-affective in situations of social distress and institutionalisation. The other film was entitled L‚Äôadulto nel mondo dei pi√π piccoli was created with assistance from residents of Trieste, and is centred on the role and function of an educator in the relationship with a child in a nursery. After her husband's death in 1955, Goldschmied flew to England to ensure that her son could receive a secondary education in the country. She was employed by London County Council from 1960 to 1965 as a social education worker in the field of mental health of small children, and lobbied against the practice of putting children into care for non-attendance. Goldschmied was later made Head of the Office for Wellness and Education at Inner London Education Authority and she served in the role until 1972, her final full-time occupation. While Goldschmied was working for the Inner London Education Authority, she and the educational psychologist Anita Hughes chose to review what babies were provided with and observed their fixation for independent learning and playing. The two developed courses for child minders and individuals who specialised in children's play. It led to the introduction of \\"heuristic play\\" to promote a relaxed form of play for babies under the age of two and for maintaining a special relationship with an individual member of staff; Goldschmied had in 1948 introduced a \\"treasure basket\\" containing non- dangerous household items that vary in feel and texture and are presented in a low, open basket, which was theorised as an exploration activity that lasted for less than an hour with no physical intervention by an overseeing adult. Goldschmied further developed the concepts into play sessions that play nurseries were introduced with adults not required to direct the play by action or verbal commands. The ideas were published in the 1994 book People Under Three: Children in Daycare, which she co-authored by Sonia Jackson. From 1978 to 1998, she visited Italy three times per year as a consultant. Goldschmied also performed consultancy roles in the London boroughs of Hammersmith, Fulham and Islington as well as in the Spanish community of Catalonia. She died on 27 February 2009 and was buried at the Highgate Cemetery in North London. Personality The Therapeutic Care Journal obituarist described Goldschmied as \\"a very small woman with a huge personality\\" and a person who was not judgemental and accepting of others. She eschewed grand theories, and refused to categorise or label any child as having special needs. Legacy Sonia Jackson, the professor of social care and education at the UCL Institute of Education, called Goldschmied \\"one of the pioneers of early childhood care and education\\". In early 2018, her original treasure basket was discovered and the Goldschmied family loaned it to The Froebel Trust for display at the Foyle Special Collections room at the University of Roehampton.

Early life  Menashi's grandparents were Jewish immigrants from Iraq and Ukraine and his maternal grandfather's relatives who stayed in Europe were murdered in the Holocaust.  Education and career  Menashi earned a Bachelor of Arts, magna cum laude, from Dartmouth College, graduating in 2001. He then worked at the Hoover Institute for three years. From 2004 to 2005 he was an editorial writer for The New York Sun. Menashi returned to school in the fall of 2005 at Stanford Law School, where he was an editor of the Stanford Law Review. He graduated in 2008 with a Juris Doctor and was inducted into the Order of the Coif. Menashi served as a law clerk to Judge Douglas H. Ginsburg of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit during the 2008‚Äì2009 term, and to Associate Justice Samuel Alito of the Supreme Court of the United States during the 2010‚Äì2011 term. In between, he was an Olin-Searle Fellow, a program offered by the Federalist Society, at Georgetown University Law Center. From 2011 to 2016, Menashi worked in the New York City office of Kirkland & Ellis, where he became a partner. While at Kirkland & Ellis, Menashi was a Research Fellow at the New York University School of Law and the Opperman Institute for Judicial Administration for three years, from 2013 to 2016. From 2016 to 2017, Menashi was an assistant professor of law at George Mason University's Antonin Scalia Law School, where he focused on administrative law and civil procedure. = Trump administration = He took a leave of absence beginning in 2017, to become the deputy general counsel for postsecondary service at the United States Department of Education, and to serve as general counsel on an acting basis for that department as of May 24. At the Department of Education, Menashi helped devise a plan by the Department of Education to deny debt relief for thousands of students who claimed to have been cheated by for- profit colleges. The plan, which used students' private Social Security data, was ruled illegal by a federal judge. His role as acting general counsel ended on April 23, 2018, after Carlos G. Mu√±iz was confirmed to that position by the U.S. Senate. In September 2018, Menashi moved to the White House to become a Special Assistant to the President and Associate Counsel to the President.  Federal judicial service  On August 14, 2019, President Trump announced his intent to nominate Menashi to serve as a United States Circuit Judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. On September 9, 2019, his nomination was sent to the Senate. That same day, the American Bar Association rated Menashi as \\"well qualified,\\" its highest rating. He has been nominated to the seat vacated by Dennis Jacobs, who took senior status on May 31, 2019. On September 11, 2019, a hearing on Menashi's nomination was held before the Senate Judiciary Committee. During his hearing, Menashi was criticized by senators from both parties for refusing to answer their questions regarding the legal advice he gave on the Trump administration's immigration policies. He was also questioned about an article he had written in the University of Pennsylvania Journal of International Law about ethnonationalism and Israel. On November 7, 2019, his nomination was reported out of committee by a party-line vote of 12‚Äì10. On November 13, 2019, the Senate invoked cloture by a vote of 51‚Äì44. On November 14, 2019, the Senate confirmed his nomination by a vote of 51‚Äì41. He received his judicial commission the same day.

It was released in 1990. Background The album was the third that von Stade and McGlinn made together, coming after their recordings of Jerome Kern's Show Boat and Cole Porter's Anything Goes.Kern, Jerome: Show Boat, conducted by John McGlinn, EMI Records CD, CDS 749108-2, 1988Porter, Cole: Anything Goes, conducted by John McGlinn, EMI Records CD, CDC7 49848-2, 1989 Like its predecessors, the album presents its music in original orchestrations where these are extant.

Recording The album was digitally recorded in September 1989 in Studio No. 1, Abbey Road, London.My Funny Valentine: Frederica von Stade sings Rodgers and Hart, conducted by John McGlinn, EMI Records CD, CDC7 54071-2, 1990 Cover art The cover of the album features a photograph of von Stade taken by Julian Broad. Critical reception =Reviews= Richard Rodgers (left) and Lorenz Hart in 1936 Adrian Edwards reviewed the album in Gramophone in February 1991. Frederica von Stade's anthology of songs by Richard Rodgers and Lorenz Hart was, he wrote, \\"well- nigh indispensable\\". It presented an imaginative mixture of numbers that listeners would already know and others that they would probably be hearing for the first time. They would discover that Rodgers and Hart had come up with many songs just as enjoyable as \\"Bewitched, bothered and bewildered\\" or the CD's title track.Edwards, Adrian: Gramophone, February 1991, p. 1567 Edwards had approached the disc unsure about whether he would like it or not. Von Stade was an opera singer, and a high mezzo-soprano. Most of the songs on her disc had been conceived for voices that were lower than hers, and that had been trained for Broadway rather than for bel canto. (\\"Falling in love with love\\" was one of the few of the album's songs that Rodgers had intended for a voice of the von Stade kind.) As things turned out, she suited the repertoire well. In her earlier Rodgers album - Erich Kunzel's recording of The Sound of Music - she had not seemed as deeply engaged with Oscar Hammerstein's lyrics as she might have been. Surprisingly, although Rodgers and Hart's work was more remote from opera than Rodgers and Hammerstein's, the former elicited \\"a far keener\\" response from von Stade than the latter, \\"the Rodgers of the 1920s and 1930s [bringing] a far livelier personality to the fore\\" than the composer of 1959. It was difficult to say which of the tracks on von Stade's album was the best. She was good in typical interwar fare like \\"Atlantic blues\\", and just as good in introspective numbers like \\"A ship without a sail\\". Her record reminded one that there was more to Hart than his \\"sharp, cynical way with a rhyme\\"; he could also dream up romantic couplets like \\"You're nearer than my head is to my pillow, Nearer than the wind is to the willow\\". \\"The accompanying Rodgers tune, if you'll forgive the pun, would melt any heart.\\" As in his seminal recordings of Show Boat and Anything Goes, John McGlinn had presented his material in a form as close as possible to that of its first performance. The period orchestrations which he had championed \\"[did not] miss a trick to underline the syncopation in Rodgers's writing\\". The playing of the London Symphony Orchestra was \\"tip-top\\", and McGlinn's advocacy of Rodgers and Hart was enthusiastic. The album's only fault was that its accompanying booklet gave an inaccurate date for Rodgers's death. Edward expected that \\"at a ration of three or four songs per sitting\\", he would return to it many times. David Deutsch reviewed the album in Fanfare in May 1991. Frederica von Stade's recording offered an engaging programme that blended famous songs with others, like \\"Atlantic blues\\", that even some Rodgers devotees would probably never have come across before. Most of them were performed in the \\"delightful\\" orchestrations crafted for their theatrical debuts by Hans Spialek and his contemporaries. Several included passages of dance music which were particularly entertaining.http://www.arkivmusic.com/classical/album.jsp?album_id=167008 Von Stade had ventured into musical theatre before in her recordings of Show Boat and Anything Goes. Rodgers and Hart took her beyond comedy into a territory that brought new challenges. \\"These she meets with characteristic intelligence, integrity and emotional honesty\\", but not with unqualified success. The photograph of her happy face on the cover of her album could be taken as a symbol of both her talents and her limitations. There was \\"no warmer, no more spiritually aligned opera star today\\" than von Stade - her Magnolia Hawkes in Show Boat and her Hope Harcourt in Anything Goes were both notable for their \\"sunniness and generosity of spirit\\". It was when Rodgers's music was most in sympathy with her own artistic temperament that her interpretations of his songs were at their best, In \\"I must love you\\", for example, she was perfect for the line \\"And if my life is blessed with joys, I owe each thing to you\\". The wistful \\"You're never here\\" was beautiful, and \\"When or where\\" \\"simply lovely, the melody a gift to her voice - and vice versa\\". In \\"Bye and bye\\", the second refrain \\"with its intimate, personal tone\\" was as wonderful as a sunburst. There were also sadder songs which she handled satisfactorily. In \\"A ship without a sail\\", \\"that sublime outpouring of pain and loss, she finds a parched, 'lost' sound, tinged with just the right hint of melancholy and self-pity\\", However, some other numbers were disappointing. \\"I didn't know what time it was\\", \\"To keep my love alive\\" and \\"Bewitched, bothered and bewildered\\" all failed to hit the mark. One could hear that von Stade was striving to convey the \\"underlying masochism or despair\\" of Hart's dark lyrics - her Mrs Simpson from Pal Joey, for instance, was delivered with a hard-edged tone to express the matriarch's bitterness. But she was far less eloquent in numbers like these than she had been as Magnolia or Hope, when \\"grief, sorrow or yearning or anger are given their due, but we can be confident that self-healing has already begun\\". Orchestrator Don Walker, photographed by Greg Penn In matters of technique, too, von Stade's success was only partial. While never sounding anything but an opera singer, she did go at least some way towards the speech-like delivery which Broadway vocalism demands. And it was obvious that she was conscientiously trying to sing with appropriately informal diction, sometimes to the point of excess - her frequent pronunciation of \\"t\\" as \\"d\\" sounded artificial. She also erred in sometimes eliding consonants at the ends of phrases, and perpetrated a \\"tousled\\" that needed a retake. Conducting, John McGlinn was his usual, straightforward self, judicious in his choice of tempos but lacking \\"a taut inner rhythm in the fast numbers\\". It was a pity that he had not encouraged von Stade to make her music more subservient to her texts: it was at those moments when she gave herself permission to bend her line in the interest of her words that she was most evidently the \\"great, imaginative artist\\" who was so wonderful in Rossini or Mozart. But all in all, the strengths of her album greatly outweighed its weaknesses, and it was a disc that was worth listening to and returning to.

In 1957 she took up pottery and she studied the subject deeply, whilst presenting her work to friends as a hobby with an annual sale of work. Adrian died and after a number of years she remarried Ian Angus who was a librarian and an expert of George Orwell. They would spend part of the year in Italy where Stokes had another studio. Her new husband would amuse himself caring for their olives. They were happy together. Stokes ceramics were collected in her lifetime. She would create sculptures of animals like crocodiles, fish and birds as well as painted plates. Her influences included ancient Cretan pots, Mediterranean pottery and the work of Alfred Wallis. She was chosen as the first modern potter to exhibit at the Hayward Gallery in 1985 - and thirty years later there has not been another.

The game was released for iOS in September 2019, macOS in October 2019, with Microsoft Windows, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One versions released on May 28, 2020. Gameplay As a return to the style of the first three entries in the series, the game follows the half-genie Shantae as she explores an interconnected world. During her journey, Shantae encounters towns with non-player characters to interact with, as well as dungeon-style labyrinths containing new abilities to unlock and bosses to defeat. Shantae retains her ability to transform into other creatures, now utilized via an ability called \\"fusion magic\\" that allows her to instantly transform and use a creature's ability with a button press instead having to select it like in past games, functioning similarly to the Pirate Weapons in Pirate's Curse. Additional special abilities can be performed by dancing, such as revealing hidden objects or healing wilted plants. Defeated enemies will sometimes drop collectible Monster Cards bearing their image. By finding a certain number of a given card, Shantae can equip it to augment her abilities, providing bonuses such as increased movement speed or magic automatically refilling over time. Up to three cards can be equipped at once, with a total of 50 different cards to collect. Like other games in the series, completing the story awards the player with bonus artwork based on their final time and completion percentage. A New Game Plus mode allows the player to replay the game with higher magic but lower defense. Plot The half-genie Shantae and her friends are invited to Paradise Island for the Half-Genie Festival, where she meets and befriends a group of fellow half-genies. However, during a performance at the festival, the other half-genies are kidnapped. Determined to uncover the reason for their disappearance, Shantae begins exploring the Sunken City beneath the island in search of the other half-genies. Along the way, she encounters her longtime arch-nemesis Risky Boots, who seeks a mysterious treasure said to reside beneath the island, and battles the half-genies' captors and rulers of the island, the Seven Sirens. Development On March 25, 2019, WayForward revealed the game under the working title Shantae 5, and stated it would be released on multiple platforms, including the newly-announced Apple Arcade service, later that same year. The official title and first gameplay details were confirmed the following August. Seven Sirens features 2D hand-painted artwork designed for 4K resolution devices, along with animated cutscenes. The game's opening sequence was animated by Trigger and features an original song, \\"Rise and Shine Shantae\\", with vocals by Shantae voice actress Cristina Vee. The first part of the game was released for iOS on September 19, 2019 as a launch title of the Apple Arcade subscription service; the remainder of the game will be added with a forthcoming update. iPadOS and tvOS versions of the game on Apple Arcade were released on September 30. macOS versions of the game on Apple Arcade were released on October 7. The console and PC versions of the game were released on May 28, 2020. The Part 2 update for the Apple Arcade versions was released on March 28, 2020.

It is located northwest of Barlow Pass along the Mountain Loop Highway, near the Monte Cristo area, on land administered by the Mount Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest. Its nearest higher peak is Big Four Mountain, one mile to the south-southwest. Both mountains can be prominently seen from the Big Four picnic area, where the trail to the Big Four Ice Caves starts. The peak is named for mining prospector George Hall, who in 1891, discovered the Forty Five claim.Forty Five Mine Climate Hall Peak is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach the North Cascades, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades (Orographic lift). As a result, the west side of the North Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. Due to its temperate climate and proximity to the Pacific Ocean, areas west of the Cascade Crest very rarely experience temperatures below or above . During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer. Because of maritime influence, snow tends to be wet and heavy, resulting in high avalanche danger. Geology The North Cascades features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks, ridges, and deep glacial valleys. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to the various climate differences. These climate differences lead to vegetation variety defining the ecoregions in this area. Hall Peak from Big Four picnic area The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape leaving deposits of rock debris. The ‚ÄúU‚Äù-shaped cross-section of the river valleys are a result of recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the North Cascades area.

Blue circle is the electron travelling in a conductor with the width d. Red stars are corresponded to the collisions with lost of total momentum of the electron system. The Gurzhi effect was theoretically predicted by Radii Gurzhi in 1963, and it consists of decreasing of electric resistance R of a finite size conductor with increasing of its temperature T (i.e. the situation dR/dT < 0 for some temperature interval). Gurzhi effect usually being considered as the evidence of electron hydrodynamic transport in conducting media. The mechanism of Gurzhi effect is the following. The value of the resistance of the conductor is inverse to the l_{lost}=\\\\min\\\\\\\\{l_{boundary}, l_V\\\\\\\\} ‚Äî a mean free path corresponding to the momentum loss from the electrons+phonons systemR\\\\propto \\\\frac{1}{l_{lost}},where l_{boundary} is the average distance which electron pass between two consequence interactions with a boundary, and l_{V} is a mean free path corresponding to other possibilities of momentum loss. The electron reflection from the boundary is assumed to be diffusive. When temperature is low we have ballistic transport with l_{ee} \\\\gg d, l_{lost} \\\\approx l_{boundary} \\\\approx d, where d is a width of the conductor, l_{ee}is a mean free path corresponding to effective normal electron-electron collisions (i.e. collisions without total electrons+phonons momentum loss). For low temperatures phonon emitted by electron quickly interacts with another electron without loss of total electron+phonons momentum and l_{ee}\\\\approx l_{ep}, where l_{ep}\\\\propto T^{-5}is a mean free path corresponding to the electron-phonon collisions. Also we assume d \\\\ll l_V. Thus the resistance for lowest temperatures is a constant R \\\\propto d^{-1}(see the picture). The Gurzhi effect appears when the temperature is increased to have l_{ee} \\\\ll d . In this regime the electron diffusive length between two consequence interaction with the boundary can be considered as momentum loss free path: l_{lost}\\\\approx l_{boundary} \\\\approx d^2/l_{ee}, and the resistance is proportional to R \\\\propto l_{ee}(T)/d^2 \\\\propto T^{-5}d^{-2}, and thus we have a negative derivative dR/dT < 0 . Therefore, Gurzhi effect can be observed when l_{ee}\\\\ll d \\\\ll d^2/l_{ee} \\\\ll l_V . Gurzhi effect corresponds to unusual situation when electrical resistance depends on a frequency of normal collisions. As one can see this effect appears due to the presence of a boundaries with finite characteristic size d. Later Gurzhi's group discovered a special role of electron hydrodynamics in a spin transport. In such a case magnetic inhomogeneity plays role of a \\"boundary\\" with spin-diffusion length as a characteristic size instead of d as before. This magnetic inhomogeneity stops electrons of the one spin component which becomes an effective scatterers for electrons of another spin component. In this case magnetoresistance of a conductor depends on the frequency of normal electron- electron collisions as well as in the Gurzhi effect.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2015. At the time of its nomination the district consisted of 56 resources, including 38 contributing buildings, one contributing structure, and 17 noncontributing buildings. West Union was platted in 1850 and retail businesses began the same year around the public square. The square also served as the center for county government and as a place for many of the community's social activities. The wide streets and sidewalks in the central business district also facilitated the city's commercial and social life. The buildings in the district have housed various commercial businesses, government operations, and churches. The residential buildings are mostly associated with the churches. Most of the buildings are one and two-stories in height, although a couple are three-stories, and built of brick. Most of them are in the revival styles built in the Victorian era, including Italianate, Queen Anne, Neoclassical, and Colonial Revival. There are also buildings designed in the Commercial style.

He is the eldest son of prolific modern artist, Thornton Dial Sr. His work is best identified by its bold, evocative political and social commentary.  Life  Thornton Dial Jr., also known as \\"Little Buck,\\" is the eldest son of Thornton Dial Sr. and Clara Mae Murrow. Dial attended William A. Bell High School through the eleventh grade. He married Angela Campbell in April 1972 and together they had one son and one daughter. After they divorced in 1981, Dial remarried Angela Jackson in April 1986. Together they raised one son, one daughter, and one stepdaughter. Dial and his brothers, Richard and Daniel, grew up surrounded by a creative extended family. Dial's uncle, Arthur, and cousin, Ronald Lockett, were also artists who influenced and were influenced by Thornton Dial Sr. and his inspired children. After high school, Dial worked for a construction company in the Bluff Park area of Birmingham, roughly twelve miles away from Bessemer. After eight years of working in construction, he began working at the Pullman Standard Company where he learned to bend and shape metal. Many Dial men worked for Pullman and it was their experiences working with industrial materials that inspired their artistic methods.  Career  1986 brought a creative and economic bloom to the Dial Family. That year Richard Dial, Thornton's brother, opened Dial Metal Patterns from which he would begin to make his signature metal \\"comfort\\" chairs. It was also the year that Thornton began making his own personal body of work. Thornton Dial Jr.'s subject matter is almost always a commentary on social, racial, or political relations in the United States. He used controversial imagery, as in The Gorilla Lends a Helping-Hand to the United States and the Telephone Company, to emphasize the roll that African Americans played in creating and building American progress. Although his imagery was complex, his messages were not subtle. In his piece The President And His Staff Trying To Decide What To Do About Children On Drugs, Dial paints a frog sunbathing atop a pile of rocks while tadpoles writhe on the river bank, \\"holding nothing back with his searing commentary.\\" Dial often uses animals as a stand-in for human subjects in his work. Lions are his symbol for black men in Africa, such as King of Africa, or those in positions of authority, such as Three Lions (Honoring Dr. King and the Kennedy's). However, Dial typically portrays working class black men in America as gorillas. This cynical metaphor is particularly potent in his work Trees to Climb which the shrub-like trees represent the lack of opportunities in America for black working class men and women. Many scholars have also noted Dial's affinity for pattern and repetitive motifs, such as the American flag, dots, stars, stripes, daisies and other flowers. Dial's experience working in construction and welding guide his painting and sculpting techniques. Common industrial materials such as oil-based paint, Bondo, enamel, sealant, corrugated tin and plywood are the basis of most of Dial's work. His familiarity with these technical materials and processes allow him to use them in innovative, creative ways in his art. His paintings are typically larger than four feet square and his sculptures and assemblages are three feet tall or taller. = Exhibitions and Permanent Collections = Dial's work has been featured in the following exhibitions: # # Outside the Main Stream: Folk Art in Our Time.

Gameplay aspects Most roguelike deck-building games present the player with one or more playable characters, each character having a pre-established deck of cards that are used within the game, typically in turn-based combat. As the player progresses through the game, they gain the ability to add cards to this deck, most often through either a choice of one or more random reward cards, or sometimes through an in-game shop. There also may be mechanism to remove cards from the deck, or to update a card already in the deck. Because the player cannot predict which cards will be presented as rewards, they must build their deck \\"on the fly\\", trying to develop potential combinations and synergies between cards and other gameplay elements, while at the same time avoid diluting their deck with cards that do not work as well. For example, the player in Slay the Spire can gain relics that provide permanent effects for the character as rewards from defining powerful enemies, and the deck-building strategy subsequently will be tied for synergizing the effects of cards with the power of these relics. This approach to building out the deck is comparable to developing a character in a tabletop role-playing game, thus adding some depth to the game. Some games in this genre do allow players to edit decks directly, in manners similar to collectible card games, but still use randomization for how the cards play out within the game. The \\"card\\" metaphor is used most commonly, but other randomized elements may be used, for example Dicey Dungeons replaces cards with dice, but otherwise plays similarly to other roguelike deck-building games. Many games in this genre use turn-based combat, similar to console role-playing games. On the player's turn, they are drawn a hand of cards, and may play one or more cards, frequently based on limited amount of \\"mana\\" or \\"action cost\\" used in other collectible cards games. Card effects can range from simple damage, defense or healing to complicated effects that may linger for several turns, similar to other collectible card games. Enemies typically follow more straight-forward combat, attacking, defending, or applying buffs and debuffs to themselves or the player. Many games in this genre utilize permadeath, another roguelike feature; should the player's character lose all their health, the character is dead and the player must start anew with the original starting deck for the character. Often, these games include metagame aspects, with players unlocking the potential for new cards to be obtained with each runthrough, or gaining a small bonus perk on starting a new runthrough. Such turn-based combat is not always an element: Hand of Fate and its sequel use the player's card deck for randomizing the layout of the dungeon, equipment, enemies, and rewards, but combat is played out through a real-time action game. Encounters in these roguelike deck-building games are typically randomized, following roguelike producedural generation rules to make fair but different pathways through the game. Players are often given choices of which encounters, with more dangerous encounters offering greater rewards. There is often a final boss character and several mini-boss characters the player must fight through to successfully complete a runthrough. The randomness of cards which are available to the player force them to develop strategies on the fly as they progresses further in the game. A player can improve themselves in a roguelike deckbuilder by learning from their past mistakes and finding new combinations of cards and effects that can help them succeed. History Dominion was introduced in 2008 as the first tabletop deck-building game, inspiring several tabletop card games that followed. Some of these games were digitized for play on personal computers or mobile devices, but remained faithful adaptions of the physical game. The first true roguelike deck-building game is Dream Quest, a mobile game developed by Peter Whalen and released in 2014 (subsequently released for personal computers about a year later). Dream Quest, while graphically simple, incorporated the core elements of the genre. It caught the attention of Richard Garfield, the designer of Magic: The Gathering. While Garfield had played more traditional deck-building games before, he stated of Dream Quest, \\"I became completely hooked when I realized that you really had to build a well rounded deck. Most deck building games reward you for picking a strategy and following it to the absolute exclusion of anything else.\\" While other roguelike deck-building games emerged following Dream Quest such as Hand of Fate, the genre gained more attention with Slay the Spire, which was developed by Megacrit. Slay the Spire was released into early access for Microsoft Windows computers in November 2017, and had its full release in January 2019, eventually expanding to release on several consoles as well. The developers of the game had wanted to make a game like Dominion, while using some of the concepts of the tabletop card game Netrunner, and had used the Netrunner community to test the game's balance before release. Despite a slow start after its early access, interest in the game quickly built from online streamers and videos of the game, and by June 2018, had over one million units sold.

After this, he followed Farquhar on board the Liverpool, serving on this ship from 1814 to 1816, and becoming involved in the blockade of √éle Bourbon. Upon his return to England, he is believed to have been almost lost off Dover, with the frigate having taken ground at the foot of Shakespeare's Cliff, only freed when masts and spars were cut away, and guns, provisions and stores were thrown overboard. In April 1816, he became one of the first to pass the examination for navigation at the Royal Naval College, and just four months later was serving at the bombardment of Algiers on board the Albion, captained by John Coode. Aboard this ship, as well as the Rochfort and the Revenge, he was employed in the Mediterranean Sea, serving under Sir Charles Penrose, Sir Thomas Fremantle, Sir Graham Moore, and Harry Burrard-Neale. In January 1826, he was appointed acting-lieutenant of the Weazel, captained by Richard Beaumont, having passed his examination for seamanship just five and a half years previous. In May of the same year, he was confirmed to the vessel, and was then employed for many months in the Ionian Islands to protect British commerce during the Greek War of Independence. He returned to England in March 1827, and then officiated as first-lieutenant from May 1829 to June 1833 aboard the Algerine, captained by Charles Talbot and John Frederick Fitzgerald De Roos. During this period, he recovered the remnants of treasure which had been lost at Cape Frio aboard the Thetis, and received the thanks of the Commander-in-Chief. Upon leaving the ship, he was presented by his captain with a \\"handsome sword, bearing an appropriate inscription\\" as well as a silver snuff-box from the warrant officers, seamen, and marines \\"in grateful acknowledgement of his unwearied efforts to promote their happiness and comfort during a period of four years' service\\".

Biography  Durand was born on August 23, 1902 in Picuris Pueblo, where her father, Miguel Lopez, raised her. Durand married Roland Durand in the 1920s and the couple had four children. Before she started working as a potter, she held many different kinds of jobs, including working for the Bureau of Indian Affairs, the Picuris Pueblo Day School, the Taos Pueblo Indian Hospital and in two different boarding schools in Towaoc, Colorado and Holbrook, Arizona. Her husband died in a car accident in the 1950s, which brought her back to Picuris. In Picuris, she began to work as a potter. Durand stayed active in the community, volunteering at the Picuris Catholic Church and involved in the Picuris Valley Home Extension Club. Durand died on January 23, 1998. She was buried in the Picuris Cemetery. A historic marker in New Mexico celebrates her contribution to preserving traditional pottery methods.  Work  Durand's pottery was intended by her to be used and was therefore utilitarian in design. She follows the tradition of the creation of hand-built, micaceous pottery which had been made for many years in Picuris and Taos. She sourced her own clay in the Picuris area. Durand's work had been influenced by potter, Juanita Martinez. Durand was part of a 1974 Smithsonian Institution exhibition, representing the Picuris Pueblo pottery tradition. She also exhibited at the Bond House Museum and Cultural Center in 1987. Durand's pottery was featured at the Arizona State Museum's 1994 American Indian Pottery Fair. Her work was featured in the Museum of Indian Arts and Culture in 1996. By the 1990s, Durand was one of the last of her people working as a potter.

Born in Xi'an, China, he moved to Vancouver permanently in 1991. He established the dance company Wen Wei Dance in 2003 and has since created 8 full-length works for the company. He is currently the artistic director of both Wen Wei Dance and Ballet Edmonton as of 2018.  Early life and career  Wang's parents had hoped he would be involved in different art forms like painting or music, but his love of dance propelled his professional career. He began training at the Langzhou Army Song and Dance Company at the age of 12. In four years was he promoted to a full-time company dancer position at only 16. Wang trained in Russian style ballet as well as other movement forms like; Chinese folk dancing, tai chi, and martial arts. All these various movement studies inform his choreography today. Wang moved to Vancouver in 1986 on a short term cultural exchange with Lorita Leung Chinese Dance Company. He danced and taught for the company on his five-month tenure before moving back to China. Once back in China, he began choreographing and won his first award in 1986 in Gansu Province. He then began his education at People's Liberation Army Academy of Art in Beijing, participating in the country's only university-level choreography program at the time.  Moving to Canada  Wang moved to Vancouver in 1991 when he was invited to the Contemporary Arts Summer Institute hosted by Simon Fraser University. From 1991 onwards, Wang resided in Vancouver full-time where he danced with Judith Marcuse Dance Company for two seasons and Ballet BC for seven seasons. He also participated in a choreography summer session with SFU in 1993 and briefly moved to Montreal to dance with Les Grands Ballet Canadiens for one season in 1995. Wang also taught as a freelance teacher during the same period he danced professionally with Judith Marcuse, Ballet BC, and Les Grands Ballet Canadiens. He taught for various local institutions such as; Goh Ballet, Dancers Dancing, Arts Umbrella Junior Company, and the Chinese Cultural Centre. His career as a full-time teacher and choreographer followed his performance career. Outside of Wen Wei Dance, Wang has made pieces for Ballet BC, Ballet J√∂rgen, Alberta Ballet, North West Dance Project, a Vancouver Opera Production: Nixon in China, and for the San Francisco Opera Production of Nixon in China. In 2005, Wang partnered with Edam Dance's Peter Bingham. Together they created and performed Thirst in 2005.  Company career  Wang formed his own company called Wen Wei Dance in 2003 after the premiere of his work Tao. Early on, the company was invited to tour internationally. Wang's solo work, One Man's, was created in 2005 and performed in the 7th Temporada Internacional de Danza Contemporanea Colombia. Wen Wei Dance's 2006 work, a commission from CanDance Network, premiered in Ontario. The premiere was well- received and the company was afforded additional international touring opportunities in Italy, China, and across Canada. In 2009, Wang began a collaborative process with Beijing Modern Dance Company creating pieces for the company with co-choreographer Gao Yanijzi. Under The Skin was their first work together and premiered in Ottawa in 2010. They later co-choreographed a production called Made In China that premiered in Banff, Alberta in 2015. The piece focused on their shared Chinese heritage. In recent years Wen Wei Dance premiered two pieces, one of which the cast is all male and the other completely female. The former, Dialogue (2017), focuses on ideas of communication, mis-communication, language barrier, and sexuality. The latter, Ying Yun (2019), was named after and created for Wang's late mother.

Early life and education Rothberg was born to parents Sondra and Joseph alongside his sister Madeleine. In his first year at Swarthmore College, Rothberg discovered Literary Theory through reading Jonathan Culler's book Saussure. Rothberg stated this left a big impression on him and led him to read Jacques Derrida, Michel Foucault, and Jacques Lacan. While attending graduate school at Duke University, Rothberg studied with Fredric Jameson, among other people, around Marxist theory. After taking a few years off from school, he returned to his graduate studies, this time at CUNY Graduate Center. Rothberg wrote his dissertation, \\"Documenting Barbarism: Memory, Culture and Modernity after the \\"Final Solution\\" in 1995 under the direction of Nancy K. Miller. Career Rothberg's interest in Holocaust studies and postcolonial studies began during his studies at CUNY Graduate Center. He was interested in investigating the relationship between Jewish American culture and African American culture. After reading Paul Gilroy‚Äôs book The Black Atlantic in the 1990s, Rothberg began constructing his first book, titled Traumatic Realism. The book was published while Rothberg was an assistant professor in the Department of English at the University of Miami. Traumatic Realism was published by the University of Minnesota Press in 2000 and it used a multitude of writings to understanding different representations of the Holocaust. Following this, Rothberg earned a position at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.

Description Monet painted the Doge's Palace from several viewpoints during his three month sojourn in Venice, from October to December 1908. The title Le Palais Ducal generally refers to three similar paintings dominated by the palace itself, painted from a boat moored in the lagoon: one in the collection of Adele and Hubert J. Klapper in the US, a second in the Brooklyn Museum, and a third in a private collection of the Goeritz family in the UK from the 1920s until it was sold at Sotheby's in February 2019. They are catalogued by Wildenstein as W1742 to W1744. The Impressionist work is painted with dappled brushstrokes in a bright palette of pinks, yellows and blues, bathed in a warm light. It is roughly divided into two horizontal zones. The upper part depicts the pink and white diamond patterned stonework of the Venetian Gothic palace walls pierced by arched windows with colonnaded arcades on the lower two floors, the blue sky above, the Lion of Venice column in the Piazzetta di San Marco to the left, and Ponte della Paglia and the New Prison (Prigioni Nuove) building to the right. The lower part is filled with the rippling waters of the Venetian lagoon and the reflection of the buildings. Monet had intended to return to paint in Venice again, but the illness of his second wife Alice Hosched√© prevent him travelling. He continued to work on many of his Venetian paintings when he returned home to Giverny, until they were shown in a critically acclaimed exhibition at Galerie Bernheim-Jeune in May 1912. Paul Signac considered these paintings to be one of Monet's greatest achievements. Versions One version of Le Palais Ducal (W1742) was exhibited at the Galerie Bernheim-Jeune in Paris in 1912, and sold via the Galerie Durand-Ruel in 1917 to Pierre Dubeid in Neuch√¢tel, and then via in Munich to in Berlin. Emden, a Jewish department store owner, was persecuted by the Nazis in the 1930s, and some of his artworks were sold in unclear circumstances via Swiss dealers. It seems the painting came into the private collection of Hermann L√ºtjens of K√ºsnacht near Z√ºrich, and was later acquired by Erich Maria Remarque and held in his collection in Locarno by 1959. It was sold by Remarque's widow Paulette Goddard in New York in 1979, and acquired by a dealer who sold to Adele and Herbert J. Klapper in 1980. The painting measures , and is signed and dated \\"Claude Monet 1908\\". The Klappers kept it in their private collection until at least 2011. After the deaths of Herbert in 1999 and Adele in 2018, some works from their collection (but excluding this Monet) were auctioned at Christie's in New York in November 2018. A second version in the Brooklyn Museum (W1743) measures . It was auctioned in New York in 1920, along with other works by Monet from the collection of the doctor Arthur Brewster Emmons. It was bought by the American leather dealer and art collector Aaron Augustus Healy and donated to the Brooklyn Museum the same year, the year before his death. A third version (W1744) was also exhibited at the Galerie Bernheim-Jeune in Paris in 1912. It was consigned to Paul Cassirer in Berlin in 1914, and sold to Hans Wendland in 1918. It was sold via Thannhauser Galleries to the German textile merchant and art collector in 1926, and was held mainly in England after he emigrated in the 1930s.

Headquartered in the city of Cachoeira Paulista (SP), it occupies an area of 372,000 m2 and has a long-range radio and television system, extending to other countries such as Portugal, Italy, Israel, France and Paraguay. History Four decades ago (1976), when Archbishop Antonio Afonso de Miranda, Emeritus Bishop of Taubat√©, told then Father Jonas Abib: \\"Since you work with young people, start with the young that is easier,\\" this priest understands as called God and that has leveraged the first members and continues to intensify today. In 1968, the first meetings with young people began, and from 1972 began the experiences of prayer in the Holy Spirit in Lorraine for the first personal meeting with Christ and the baptism in the Holy Spirit, when the need arose and a structured and adequate room for such meetings, was when in the city of Areias (SP) found a farm that instituted the birth of the Can√ß√£o Nova Association, after two years, began to the first Mission House was built in the neighboring city of Queluz, which was named ‚ÄúCan√ß√£o Nova - the House of Mary‚Äù. In June 1976, the first meeting for girls, called the Maranath√° of girls, was held by Monsignor Antonio Afonso de Miranda, then Bishop of Lorena. Thus the evangelizing bases of the Can√ß√£o Nova were born, with Father Jonas attending the office where he was given the mission to put into practice the Apostolic Exhortation Evangelii Nuntiandi: Evangelization in the Contemporary World, signed by Pope Paul VI on December 8 and published on December 21, 1975. In the year following 1977, Fr. Jonas through a catechesis course aimed at young people, turning into meetings called ‚ÄúCatechumenates‚Äù, he surpassed the limits, attracting the parents of this youth who perceived the transformation of their children and awakened their desire for this ‚Äúsomething new‚Äù, happening faithfully. This was reflected in the document presented by the aforementioned bishop: ‚Äú... Touched by grace, they gradually discover the face of Christ and expound nurtured the need to give Him up ‚Äù(EN, n. 44). Later, Father Jonas went further, decided to start an internal ‚ÄúCatechumenate‚Äù, but the young people would have to leave their families, their homes and their studies to give themselves to the Holy Spirit, and the first to be invited to this challenge were the young people of Queluz and only 12 accepted, so on February 2, 1978, the Can√ß√£o Nova Community began. More and more, Fr. Jonas continued to follow another chapter of the pontifical document: ‚ÄúIn our century so marked by mass media, the first proclamation, catechesis or the deepening of the faith cannot fail to use these means, as we have already emphasized. Put at the service of the Gospel, such means are capable of widening, almost to infinity, the field to be able to hear the Word of God and to bring the Good News to millions. The Church would feel guilty before Her Lord if she did not use these potent means which human intelligence makes ever more perfect. It is by using them that he 'preaches upon the terraces' the message that she is the keeper. In them you find a modern and effective version of the pulpit. Thanks to them you can talk to the crowds ‚Äù(EN, n.45). After the 1979 Carnival Retreat, called \\"Rebanh√£o\\", held in the city of Cruzeiro, began the construction of four mission houses in Cachoeira Paulista, even knowing they received by donation only a strip of land, and only one building was built. After numerous achievements, Jonas Abib, now Monsignor, declared: ‚ÄúCachoeira Paulista is the place where God has placed us to live the mission of evangelization in a privileged way to carry out this evangelization through the media: the media, ‚Äùconcludes Monsignor Jonas.Como nascemos? - On November 3, 2008, Can√ß√£o Nova reached the Pontifical Recognition, receiving approval of its statutes from the Holy See and on this date were present in Rome, the founder of the Catholic community, Monsignor Jonas Abib along with the co-founders, Luzia Santiago and her husband Wellington Jardim; surrounded by dozens of Brazilian missionaries, friends and bishops, they celebrated the ‚Äúyes‚Äù of the Church so that the mission of this Work of Evangelization could spread throughout the world.1 ano de Reconhecimento Pontif√≠cio- Evangelization The Can√ß√£o Nova Community is one of the largest media systems for Catholic Evangelization in the world.

In particular, its daily meetings and prayer times that take place at your headquarters. In the other hours of their stations, it broadcasts only indoctrination programs, and some others indirectly focused or based on this purpose.

Salette Ferreira, Deacon Nelsinho Corr√™a, Rogerinha, Juliana de Paula, Thiago Tom√©, Laura Pitter, Emanuel St√™nio and M√°rcio Todeschini are some of the singers. Members of the music ministry include Brais Oss, Rinaldo, and conductor Sapo. Monsignor Jonas Abib is also one of the Catholic evangelists through Christian music in the Can√ß√£o Nova Community. =Evangelization Club= Previously, communication with people who help the Catholic community through donations was done by the Listener Club. But the Can√ß√£o Nova Communication System has grown and, in addition to the listeners of radio - Can√ß√£o Nova's first vehicle of evangelization - today, it also reaches viewers, through TV Can√ß√£o Nova; and the netizens, by Portal Can√ß√£o Nova. For years a new name had been thought of that encompassed this larger universe of action. After much discernment and prayer, we came to a \\"global\\" name: Evangelization Club, which better reflects the strong and active reality of all members.Clube da Evangeliza√ß√£o- Evangelization Centers Can√ß√£o Nova is headquartered at Ch√°cara Santa Cruz in Cachoeira Paulista, and has two spaces for holding events, Rinc√£o and Dom Jo√£o Hip√≥lito de Moraes Evangelization Center. The DAVI-Visual Audio DepartmentDAVI- acts as a distribution center for all Can√ß√£o Nova products. Like Catholic orders and other religions, the Can√ß√£o Nova Community has the contribution of the faithful through donations in general. It is estimated that the community generates about 15 million reais per month. This money comes from spontaneous donations Listeners Campaigns. The sale of products related to the \\"Can√ß√£o Nova\\" image is also pointed as a great source of revenue. Among the main products sold are bibles, DVDs, CDs, T-shirts, books and images of saints. =Thug= There is a large meeting space for the faithful, known as the Dom Jo√£o Hip√≥lito de Moraes Evangelization Center, one of the largest covered spaces for Catholic events in Latin America, with a capacity of 80,000 people;. There is also behind the Evangelization Center a food court, ATMs, parking and restrooms. The Evangelization Center is used for large national and international meetings. =Sanctuary of the Father of Mercies= In 2008 began the works for a sanctuary at the Can√ß√£o Nova headquarters in Cachoeira Paulista. The purpose of the Sanctuary of the Father of Mercies is to welcome pilgrims who come to the Can√ß√£o Nova as best as possible to seek a deep experience with God through prayer events held in the community. The site is designed to hold about 10,000 people and will also have a permanent worship chapel to attend confessions and pray, as well as toilets. The built area is approximately 6,260 m¬≤. The title of Shrine was made official in December 2012 by Bishop Benedito Beni, Bishop of the Diocese of Lorena. On December 5, 2014, the Sanctuary's dedication ceremony was celebrated as part of the 50th anniversary of the priesthood of Monsignor Jonas Abib, whose priestly ordination was on December 8, 1964. =Hosanna Brazil= The event originated in 2004, when the construction of the Dom Jo√£o Hip√≥lito de Moraes Evangelization Center was completed. The intention was to create a different camp to inaugurate the site and to thank God for this great victory achieved by the Can√ß√£o Nova Community, which was only possible thanks to the gold donation made spontaneously by thousands of people. The John Paul II Foundation - maintainer of the New Song Communication System - held a contest among employees to choose the name of the event, which would be held in celebration of the inauguration of the Evangelization Center. The winner was Eug√™nio Jorge, who is music minister and founder of the Message Brazil mission. He suggested this name because he believed that the ‚ÄúNew Rinc√£o‚Äù - as the place is also known - would be the place from which praises rise without ceasing to heaven through the children of God: ‚ÄúHosanna Brazil!, for if our praise ceases the stones will cry out ‚Äù(cf. Luke 19:40). The camp is the biggest event held by Can√ß√£o Nova. In its first edition, it brought together approximately 200,000 people and each year thousands more come from all over the world.

Tsao took over his family shipping business in Shanghai and moved it to Hong Kong when the Communists took over China. He founded International Maritime Carriers (IMC Group) in Hong Kong, before moving it to Singapore in the early 1990s. Tsao helped build Singapore into an international shipping hub, and co-founded MISC and Unithai, the national shipping companies of Malaysia and Thailand, respectively, as well as Suntec City in Singapore. For his contributions, he was awarded the nobility title Tan Sri by the King of Malaysia, the Silver Bauhinia Star of Hong Kong, and the Honorary Citizen Award, Singapore's highest honour for non-citizens.  Early life in Shanghai  Tsao Wen-king was born in 1925 in Shanghai, into a moderately wealthy business family. His grandfather started a shipping company on the Huangpu River. His father, George Tsao Ying-yung (), continued to run the shipping and import-export business. The family also branched into banking. His mother, Tsao Ng Yu-shun, was an heiress who inherited a major stake of the China National Development Bank. Tsao studied economics at the prestigious St. John's University, Shanghai, and took over the family business when his father \\"lost interest\\" in it.  Hong Kong  During the Chinese Civil War, Tsao moved to British Hong Kong in 1947. With the Communist takeover of China in 1949, his family fled to Hong Kong in a hurry, and 30 members of the extended family squeezed into a single house. His parents and two sisters later moved to Brazil. Tsao later recalled the period as \\"a matter of survival\\", when he worked desperately to salvage the family business. In 1949, Tsao co-founded the Great Southern Steamship Company by purchasing an old ship from Singapore. After the Korean War broke out in 1950, the US-led Western world blockaded the newly established People's Republic of China. Tsao's business took off by trading with the PRC, shipping beans, chemicals, and steel between China, Hong Kong, and Japan. In 1966, he founded International Maritime Carriers (), which later became IMC Group.  Southeast Asia  In 1958, Tsao founded Textile Corporation of Malaya, the first textile company in Malaysia, together with other Shanghainese industrialists in Hong Kong. Their main purpose was to circumvent import quotas imposed on Hong Kong's textile industry by Western countries. He later expanded his venture by establishing Malayan Weaving Mills and Malacca Textiles, and developed a close friendship with Mahathir Mohamad, the longest-serving prime minister of Malaysia. In 1968, Malaysian businessman Robert Kuok sought Tsao's help with setting up Malaysia's first national shipping company, Malaysia International Shipping Corporation (MISC), and Tsao became the company's co-founder. He initially owned 15% of MISC's shares, second to the Kuok Brothers' 20%, and served as its Vice Chairman. Tsao also helped establish Unithai, the national shipping line of Thailand, and, more significantly, bailed the company out during a period of financial difficulty in 1986‚Äì1987 by investing in the company through IMC. By the early 1990s, he owned an estimated 70% of Unithai's shares. Tsao helped build Singapore into an international shipping hub and moved the headquarters of IMC Group to Singapore in the early 1990s. In 1985, on the invitation of the Singaporean government, Tsao and a group of Hong Kong tycoons, including Li Ka-shing, established Suntec City Development, which developed Suntec City in the 1990s. In the mid-1990s, he passed active management of IMC Group, by then a multi-business conglomerate, to his third child, Frederick. As of 2019, IMC Group operates 21 tankers and five bulk carriers. Philanthropy Tsao regularly donated to the Tsao Foundation of Singapore, which he established with his mother in 1993 to help the elderly. He cofounded the Centre for Maritime Studies at the National University of Singapore, and supported maritime education at many Chinese universities, including Dalian Maritime University, Dalian University of Technology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai Maritime University, Tongji University, Tsinghua University, as well as Hong Kong Polytechnic University.  Honours  For his contributions to the country's shipping industry, the King of Malaysia conferred Tsao the noble title Tan Sri, equivalent to a knighthood. In the 1990s, he was awarded Malaysian citizenship by Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad. In 2006, he was awarded the Silver Bauhinia Star by the Hong Kong government and honorary citizenship by the city of Dalian. In 2008, he was granted the Honorary Citizen Award, Singapore's highest honour for non-citizens.  Personal life  Tsao was married to Maisie Chow Tsao for seven decades until her death in 2014. They had two sons and two daughters: Calvin (of Tsao & McKown Architects), Mary Ann, Frederick and Cheryd. On 12 August 2019, Tsao died in Singapore at the age of 94 from kidney failure.

Biography  Ernesto Cozzi was born in Trent, in the South Tyrol, in the Austro-Hungarian Empire, on 6 July 1870. He became a priest of the Catholic Church and served as a military chaplain in Bolzano. From May 1901 he was a parish priest and missionary to the northern mountain tribes of Albania. Albania was then under Ottoman rule, with Austria-Hungary providing for its Catholic population. Cozzi publicly espoused Albanian independence. In 1914 he was briefly an archbishop's secretary and in 1915 was sent on a diplomatic mission to Poland. With the Austro-Hungarian invasion of Albania in 1916, he became a military chaplain again. At the end of World War I, he returned to Albania and became a parish priest in Obot. In 1919 he was appointed an apostolic visitor and traveled throughout Albania in 1920 to produce a report for the Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith (CPF) and on 12 November Pope Benedict XV named him the first Apostolic Delegate to Albania. On 16 December Pope Benedict named him a titular archbishop as well, the customary rank for papal diplomats. Cozzi received his episcopal consecration on 27 December from Cardinal Willem van Rossum, Prefect of the CPF. Most of his research, written in Italian, was published between 1909 and 1914 in Anthropos, a Viennese scholarly journal, the Revue d‚Äôethnographie et de sociologie, and others. His interests included folklore and superstition, women‚Äôs religious observance, blood feuds, and‚Äìhis most significant contribution‚Äìpopular legal norms. He died on 23 March 1926 on board a ferry en route to Bari, Italy. He was initially buried in Bari, but his remains were exhumed, returned to Albania, and buried in Shkodra on 29 May.

Povinelli's research in nanophotonics focuses on the behavior of light inside complex materials. Povinelli completed her doctoral research at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 2004, followed by a postdoc on Stanford University from 2004 to 2008. She became a professor at USC in 2008. In 2010, Povinelli was awarded a Presidential Early Career Awards for Scientists and Engineers. She was appointed to a full professorship in 2018.  Education and career  Povinelli received her bachelor's degree in physics from the University of Chicago and masters in physics from the University of Cambridge, both in 1998. She completed a Ph.D. in physics titled Characteristics of defect modes, slow light, and disorder in photonic crystals at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 2004, with John Joannopoulos as her advisor. Povinelli was a postdoc at Stanford in the Gintzon Laboratory under a L'Oreal For Women in Science Postdoctoral Fellowship from 2004 to 2008. She joined the University of Southern California (USC) in 2008 under the Gabilan Assistant Professorship in the Women in Science and Engineering program. Povinelli received two research awards in 2010: the National Science Foundation Career Award and an Army Research Office Young Investigator Award. Povinelli became a Fellow of the Optical Society of America in 2016 for contributions to the theory and application of light forces in optical nanostructures and for \\"the understanding and realization of nanostructures for solar energy conversion\\". In 2018, Povinelli was promoted to a full professorship at USC. That year, she and Lorraine Turcotte organised the Women in Science and Engineering Research Horizons Symposium following an anonymous donation of $20 million towards increasing gender diversity in science at USC.  Research  Povinelli's research is primarily in nanophotonics, focusing on the behavior of light as it moves through devices like solar cells and optical chips. An early branch of research undertaken by Povinelli involved using laser beams to trap and assemble two-dimensional nano-structures - hundreds at a time - for creation of new materials and chemical filters. Unlike optical traps consisting of free-space laser beams, Povinelli patterned a silicon wafer with holes to create a photonic crystal, each hole 300 nm in diameter. Particles are then moved into the holes to form a square crystal lattice. Povinelli predicted and proved that light could exert a force when guided through silicon strip waveguides, which was shown to move a nearby strip. Such methods are useful for optical circuits and re- routing of signals. Another prediction of Povinelli is increased solar cell efficiency when incorporating nanostructures. Working with Northrop Grumman, Povinelli developed a new material able to self-regulate the temperature of satellites made of a mixture of silicon and vanadium dioxide. To combat temperature variations of over 200 degrees Fahrenheit without relying on physical shutters or heat pipes that consume large amounts of power, the phase change behaviour of vanadium dioxide is used instead. At low temperatures it acts as an insulator, and at high temperatures it is a conductor which radiates heat. With a 20 fold improvement in temperature management, this research may have applications in maintaining building temperatures. In 2019 it was announced that the research group of Povinelli will work in the Breakthrough Starshot project, towards a proof-of-concept demonstration of ultra-fast light-driven nanocrafts. This is work towards the first launch to Alpha Centauri, led by a consortium of scientists such as Steven Chu, Mae Jemison, and Martin Rees. Povinelli is working towards the light sail portion based on research on thermal regulation. = Awards and honours = * 1993: The White House Presidential Scholar * 2006: L'Oreal for Women in Science Fellowship * 2009: NSF Career Award * 2009: Army Young Investigator Award * 2010: MIT Innovators Under 35 * 2010: Presidential Early Career Awards for Scientists and Engineers * 2016: Fellow of the Optical Society of America * 2018: Gabilan Distinguished Associate Professorship in Science and Engineering at University of Southern California * 2019: Fellow of SPIE Povinelli has been a member of Phi Beta Kappa and Sigma Xi. = Notable talks = * 2018 Plenary talk Microstructured Materials for Thermal Heating and Memory, META conference * 2018 Plenary talk Using Microphotonic Structures for Optical Trapping and Thermal Logic, Annual Meeting of the American Physical Society Far West Section  Personal life  Povinelli studies capoeira.

Lendorff then emigrated to Australia. Niver√∏d and Lerbjerggaard brickworks were in 1863 merged into one company. A narrow-gauge railway to Niv√• Station was constructed in 1907-8 and remained in use until c. 1930. Niver√∏d Brickworks was in 1911 acquired by Harald Simonsen. The brickyard was then referred to as Simonsen's Brickyard. The brickworks was later acquired by a man named Kofoed< and it was from then on referred to as Kofoed's brickyard. In the early 1900s, when the clay deposits on land had nearly been exhausted, Niver√∏d and S√∏lyst brickworks obtained a license to extract clay from the sea bed and a dyke was therefore constructed. in 1930, water broke through the dyke during a storm, flooding the clay pit.

Hudson News store From the 1950s through the 1970s, Asher Schwartz of the law firm O'Donnell & Schwartz served as counsel to the union against the National Labor Relations Board and the New York Times. ) In the 1970s, mobster Samuel \\"Red\\" Levine was involved with the NMDU: > Formed in the early 1900s, the Newspaper and Mail Deliverers Union was equal > parts Irish, Italian, and Jewish, a reflection of the city's then dominant > ethnic groups. Well into the 1970s, Jewish racketeers played a major role in > the union. One of them, Red Levine, was reputed to have been one of the > assassins of Salvatore Maranzano, the old-school mobster who helped to found > America's Cosa Nostra. Law enforcement officials, as well as longtime union > members and mob associates (often the same thing in the NMDU) say that > Levine cleverly allowed each of the city's five Mafia families to have a > piece of the newspaper delivery action, which included bootleg sales of > stolen papers as well as loan-sharking and gambling among drivers. In 1978, the Federal Bureau of Investigation began inquiring into the union's line of business and possible connections to organized crime. A federal grand jury under Robert B. Fiske Jr., United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, began holding hearings. The FBI alleged that allegations that the union's president had demanded payoffs from wholesalers. In 1981, Robert B. Cohen pleaded guilty in federal court to paying NMDU officials $37,000 in exchange for favorable treatment in dealings between the union and his companies. He was fined $150,000 as part of the guilty plea. By 1993, that union president was accused and convicted for extortion, racketeering, and other charges. Mugshot of Joseph Bonanno of the Bonanno crime family, with whom the NMDU got involved In the 2000s, Bonanno crime family members and associates involved in the News and Mail Deliverer's Union were incarcerated for racketeering with regard to circulation of the New York Post (see entry on Robert Perrino). In 2009, the NMDU affiliated for the first time in nearly a century, choosing the 14,000-member International Brotherhood of Teamsters union. In 2014, the FBI arrest six people associated with the NMDU for conspiring obtain a union job fraudulently for the some of an organized crime underboss. In 2018, the NMDU accepted a buyout package worth $155,000 each for 70 members to let the Daily News eliminate some 40 delivery routes. Function The union defends the rights of its members. It provides a pension plan for retired members and their beneficiaries, as well as a welfare plan for members and their families that include life insurance and death benefits. Organization =Leadership= Joseph D. Bannon was the union's founding president from 1901 to 1928. Harry Feldman was the union's second president from 1928 to 1935. Joseph Baer was president from 1959 to 1969. Carl Levy was president from 1969 to 1976. Douglas LaChance was president from 1976 to 1980. Jerry Cronin was a president in 1986. Michael J. Alvino was president from 1989 to 1991. Levy, LaChance, Cronin, and Alvino were all indicted and convicted on corruption charges. Ronald O'Keefe was union president in 2002. Currently, Thomas Bentvena serves as president and Charles Setteducato as vice president, secretary, and treasurer. =Membership= In 1964, NMDU membership was about 2,700 members. In 1990, NMDU membership was about 3,000 members. In 2009, NMDU membership was about 1,500 members. Legacy In 1991, the New York Times described the union as \\"tainted with corruption that sent some of its leaders to jail, with father-son nepotism that kept black and Hispanic drivers out of its ranks for decades, and with unswerving self-interest that has sometimes engendered mistrust by fellow unions and, critics say, may even have speeded the death of some ailing newspapers.\\" See also * Robert B.

It was found in the Burgersdorp Formation, part of the uppermost Cynognathus Assemblage Zone of the Beaufort Group in the Karoo Basin. The type and only known species is U. mukanelai. It was a large, beaked herbivore like other Triassic dicynodonts, lacking tusks, and is mostly characterised by unique features of the skull. It is known from three specimens, two of which were previously referred to the Tanzanian dicynodont Angonisaurus. The separation of Ufudocyclops from Angonisaurus indicates that the Middle Triassic fauna of the Beaufort Group in South Africa was part of a larger shared fauna with those of the Manda Beds in Tanzania, as was previously supposed, and suggests that they were separated as more localised faunas, possibly by geographic barriers or in time. Ufudocyclops then would have been a unique part of the uppermost Cynognathus Assemblage Zone in South Africa. It is also the oldest known member of the family Stahleckeriidae, and implies that the family was already diversifying in the Middle Triassic alongside other kannemeyeriiforms, not just in the Late Triassic after other families died out. Description Scale diagram of Ufudocyclops to a human Ufudocyclops is a large dicynodont, with the largest specimen reconstructed to have an estimated skull length of and the smaller complete holotype skull at approximately long, and an estimated overall body size similar to that of Kannemeyeria. Only skulls and one partial lower jaw are definitively known, and no postcrania from the body has been identified, but it likely resembled other stahleckeriid dicynodonts with a heavily-built body, short tail, and stocky limbs, possibly including upright hind-limbs paired with sprawling forelimbs like other large dicynodonts. Like some other stahleckeriids, Ufudocyclops appears to have lacked the tusks characteristic of many other dicynodonts, and was completely toothless. =Skull= The skull of Ufudocyclops superficially resembles Angonisaurus, being relatively tall and notably broad behind the snout, with large, sideways facing eyes and prominent tuskless caniniform processes on the maxilla that project away down and forwards from the snout, flaring out slightly to sides, with blunted tips. The lower surfaces of the maxilla are heavily pitted and rugose, as is the premaxilla and the palate on the roof of the mouth. These textures correspond to the eponymous tortoise-like keratinous beak typical of dicynodonts like Ufudocyclops. The isolated tip of the premaxilla demonstrates that these pits are superficial and do not continue deeper into the bone, as the inner texture of the bone is smooth and tabulate, and so are not foramina. Like various other dicynodonts, the face is ornamented with bony bosses on the snout around the eyes. The bulbous nasal bones on the top of the snout each sport a single ovoid-shaped boss that overhangs the nostrils and stops just short of the orbits (eye sockets) in front of the eyes. The paired bosses are separated by a 3‚Äî7 cm (1‚Äî3 in) wide gap of flat, featureless bone between them on top of the snout where the premaxilla and the nasals meet. This is an unusual condition for kannemeyeriiforms, which typically only have a single large boss across the whole surface of the snout. In fact, the bosses are superficially more like those of cryptodonts‚Äîa group of Permian dicynodonts unrelated to kannemeyeriiforms‚Äîthat also had a pair of divided nasal bosses. Similar, but smaller, bosses are found on the prefrontal and postorbital bones, situated around the upper front and back corners of the eyes, respectively. Like the nasal bosses, these two bosses are clearly separated as individual growths, and do not form a continuous rim around the top of the eyes. The skull of Ufudocyclops is otherwise fairly standard for dicynodonts, however it has some other unique characteristics, such as the form of the jugal bone. In most other dicynodonts the jugal is small and restricted under the eyes, but in Ufudocyclops it extends along much of the lateral (outside) face of the zygomatic arch beneath the eyes and cuts off the maxilla, which usually joins to the squamosal on the zygomatic arch. This unusual setup of the jugal also causes the zygomatic arch to noticeably jut out from the skull under the eyes, compared to other kannemeyeriiforms where it gradually curves out away from the skull. In addition, while most kannemeyeriiforms have the front of the orbits formed only by the jugal and the lacrimal bone, Ufudocyclops also has a very small portion of the maxilla between them too. Ufudocyclops is also characterised by the unique 'X'-shaped intertemporal bar on the roof of the skull between each temporal fenestra, where the large jaw muscles attached. The bar is broad at the front just behind the eyes and at the back of the skull, while the middle is pinched inwards between the two temporal fenestra, creating the characteristic 'X'-shape. The eponymous pineal foramen on the roof of the skull is also proportionately \\"enormous\\" ( long), implying Ufudocyclops had a very well-developed parietal \\"third eye\\". The pineal foramen also has a characteristic depression behind it on the intertemporal bar that is deep and triangular in shape. =Mandible= The lower jaw of Ufudocyclops is only partially known, and is only known from one of the referred specimens. Most of what is preserved consists of the front half of the mandibles, namely the two dentaries, as well as a splenial and portions of the angulars. The jaws are also missing the tip of the mandibular symphysis at the very front where the two jaw bones are fused, but enough is preserved to suggest the lower beak was somewhat squared off. The dentaries are toothless and covered in pits and grooves like those of the upper jaws, typical of the beaked lower jaws of derived dicynodonts. Additionally, parts of both the articular bones were found attached to the quadrates of the skull. These show the typical dicynodont arrangement with two rounded condyles divided by a ridge between them that allows for the lower jaw to slide backwards and forwards during feeding. History of discovery The first specimens of Ufudocyclops (BP/1/5530 and BP/1/5531) were discovered by palaeontologist P. John Hancox while fossil collecting in the southern Karoo Basin near Sterkstroom in the Eastern Cape Province in an expedition to assess the stratigraphic range of the dicynodont Kannemeyeria. Together with his colleague Bruce S. Rubidge, the skulls were reported in a research letter to South African Journal of Science in February 1994, where the fossils were recognised as a third distinct genus of dicynodont from the Cynognathus Assemblage Zone (AZ), following Kannemeyeria and Kombuisia. At the time Hancox and Rubidge did not attempt to identify the specimens and simply referred to them as a \\"tuskless dicynodont\\". They speculated that large dicynodont postcranial remains from the upper Cynognathus AZ, previously attributed to Kannemeyeria, may have also belonged to their new dicynodont, and that their new dicynodont could be used to further subdivide the Cynognathus AZ above the range of Kannemeyeria. Hancox and Rubidge later briefly described the specimens in August 1996, and then again in more detail in May 2013, referring them both times to the Tanzanian dicynodont Angonisaurus after favourably comparing their skulls. However, the South African specimens were not identical to the Tanzanian A. cruickshanki, interpreted as either a difference between species, sexual dimorphism, or intraspecific variation between different populations, so Hancox and Rubidge provisionally diagnosed them as Angonisaurus sp. Nonetheless, they were regarded as the first record of Angonisaurus outside of the Manda Beds in Tanzania. This was suggested to support a shared Middle Triassic fauna between the uppermost Cynognathus AZ (now Subzone C) and the Manda Beds, based on the shared presence of Angonisaurus. The third and best preserved specimen of Ufudocyclops‚ÄîBP/1/8208, which would become the type specimen‚Äîwas not discovered until 2014 and then collected in 2017 as part of a series of joint excavations by the Evolutionary Studies Institute of the University of the Witwatersrand (Johannesburg) and the University of Birmingham (United Kingdom). The skull was found upside down and isolated in a metre thick block of greenish grey fine grained sandstone, alongside an undescribed large cynodont skull that had fallen out of the main exposure of rock in the field. The earlier specimens BP/1/5530 and BP/1/5531 were shown to be identical in form to the type specimen of Ufudocyclops, prompting a reinterpretation of the two fossils as specimens of Ufudocyclops, and not Angonisaurus as originally believed. The genus Ufudocyclops was named from the Xhosa word ufudo, meaning \\"tortoise\\", in reference to its toothless, tortoise-like beak, and the Ancient Greek cyclops, referring to the very large size of the pineal foramen (\\"third eye\\"). The species is named in honour of Mr. Pepson \\"Pepsi\\" Mukanela as recognition for his skills in fossil preparation at the Evolutionary Studies Institute, including his work on the holotype, who had recently retired before its publication. The holotype skull is nearly complete, missing only its left temporal arch and the tips of the caniniform processes. The tip of the snout was also accidentally sawed through during excavation, separating the very front face of the premaxilla from the rest of the skull, but nothing was lost during collection. The condition of the skull is good, preserving much of the surface features including sutures on the skull roof and palate, as well as much of the ornamentation with only some wear on the top of the snout and to the back of the skull. The two referred skulls are much more incomplete and disarticulated, with BP/1/5530 consisting of only a partial skull roof and a single caniniform process, while BP/1/5531 also includes pieces of the palate, braincase and lower jaw. Classification Initial examinations of the referred specimens BP/1/5530 and BP/1/5531 identified them as belonging to the genus Angonisaurus. This was argued on the basis of a combination of shared features between these specimens and Angonisaurus thought to be unique to them (although they are now known to be more widespread in Kannemeyeriiformes) rather than shared unique traits. The poor preservation of these specimens made identification difficult, and it wasn't until the discovery of the nearly complete holotype skull that the distinctiveness of Ufudocyclops could be properly appreciated. Interestingly, while not yet recognised as their own genus, the referred specimens of Ufudocyclops were correctly determined to belong to the family Stahleckeriidae, contrasting with associations of Angonisaurus with Shansiodontidae at the time. Ufudocyclops is distinguished from other kannemeyeriiform dicynodonts, as well as Angonisaurus, by its 'X'-shaped intertemporal bar and deep triangular depression behind the pineal foramen, as well as by the extension of the jugal beneath the eyes and the two distinctly separated nasal bosses. The relationship of Ufudocyclops with other dicynodonts was tested phylogenetically by Kammerer and colleagues by combining the data from three other recently updated analyses (Angielcyzk & Kammerer 2017, Angielcyzk et al. 2018, and Kammerer 2018) and the new information from the holotype of Ufudocyclops. A simplified cladogram, an excerpt from the full analysis, focused on the relationships of Ufudocyclops within Kannemeyeriiformes is shown below: Skull of Stahleckeria, possibly the closest relative of Ufudocyclops. Their results were generally similar to previous studies, although notably within Kannemeyeriiformes the family Shansiodontidae was found to be paraphyletic. Ufudocyclops and Stahleckeria were found to be each others closest relatives, sharing at least two characteristics between each other. However, Kammerer and colleagues also identified one feature more like those of earlier kannemeyeriiforms, and found that it was almost as equally plausible that Ufudocyclops could be the most basal species of Stahleckeriinae. This would also be consistent with Ufudocyclops being older than all other stahleckeriines, however, the ancestral appearance of stahleckeriids is poorly understood and so it is unclear whether Ufudocyclops is indeed less derived than Stahleckeria and other stahleckeriines. Palaeoeocology Ufudocyclops is known from the uppermost Cynognathus Assemblage Zone, informally referred to as Subzone C, which corresponds to the Burgersdorp Formation and is roughly dated to the Middle Triassic in age, possibly late Anisian. The Burgersdorp Formation is largely made up of maroon clay-mudstones, believed to have been deposited in an environment with a meandering river flowing through it. The unit of rock that preserved the holotype skull of Ufudocyclops grades from cross-bedding and laminated ripples to fine siltstone, and some units also preserve traces of roots. These indicate that the area was part a vegetated floodplain close to flowing water, possibly in a river channel itself or formed as a crevasse splay when the river burst its banks. The fauna of Subzone C of the Cynognathus AZ is characterised primarily by the presence of the large mastodonsaurid temnospondyl amphibian Paracyclotosaurus morganorum. Ufudocycylops also coexisted with another large dicynodont that is referred only to Shansiodon sp., as well as various cynodonts including the predatory Cynognathus, the herbivorous Diademodon (both of which are ubiquitous to the entire Cynognathus AZ) and a trirachodontid tentatively referred to Cricodon. The Cynognathus AZ Subzone C directly overlays the older Subzone B that was characterised by the presence of the dicynodont Kannemeyeria, which Ufudocyclops had seemingly replaced ecologically as a large browsing herbivore. =Palaeobiogeography= Because specimens of Ufudocyclops were once thought to belong to Angonisaurus, it was believed that Subzone C of the Cynognathus AZ and the Manda Beds in Tanzania were part of a larger shared fauna distributed throughout Africa during the Middle Triassic, even extending into Antarctica. However, the distinction of Ufudocyclops from Angonisaurus suggests that dicynodonts in Middle Triassic Africa were more divided than had been assumed, separated into different localised faunas and habitats. It is unclear whether Ufudocyclops was geographically restricted to the Karoo Basin from the Manda Beds, or if the two localities were separated in time, but in either case Ufudocyclops was an endemic part of the Karoo dicynodont fauna. The discovery of Ufudocyclops in the uppermost Karoo Basin also adds to a growing number of stahleckeriids from the Middle Triassic, along with the African genera Zambiasaurus and Sangusaurus. Stahleckeriid dicynodonts were mostly known from the Late Triassic, and had been suggested to have been a 'slow fuse' lineage that radiated only after the older families of kannemeyeriiforms, such as Kannemeyeriidae and Shansiodontidae, had already gone extinct. As the oldest and possibly most basal member of the family, Ufudocyclops demonstrates that the group had already diversified alongside other kannemeyeriiforms. Nonetheless, Ufudocyclops suggests that stahleckeriids were able to replace other kannemeyeriiforms following local ecological turnovers, at least locally in the Karoo Basin, where it replaced Kannemeyeria after the latter had dominated the preceding Subzone B of the Cynognathus AZ.

Built in 1931 by Horace Ginsbern & Associates, with exteriors by Marvin Fine, the building forms part of the rich tapestry of Art Deco apartments in the West Bronx. It was made a New York City designated landmark in 2010. Description The Noonan Plaza Apartments is a 300-dwelling, garden apartment that occupies much of the book bounded by West 168th Street and Ogden and Nelson Avenues. It rises between six and eight stories, with facades on three sides and a central 15,000-square-foot courtyard garden bounded by a one-story arcade at the corner of Nelson and 168th. History In the 1920s, the population of New York grew substantially, with migration from the crowded environs of Manhattan to the outer boroughs. Jews, in particular, eagerly decamped from crowded tenement ghettos to new, modern housing that was being built in locations such as the West Bronx, centered along the Grand Concourse. Horace Ginsbern and his company, Ginsbern & Associates, collaborated with Marvin Fine on a number of apartment buildings in the Bronx. Fine had been inspired by watching the Art Deco skyscrapers going up from Ginsbern & Associates' Midtown Manhattan offices, and was inspired to use the Daily News Building's multicolored brick as the firm's trademark in the Bronx. Ginsbern and Fine built one of the earliest Art Deco apartment buildings in the Bronx at 1005 Jerome Avenue, the Park Plaza Apartments, from 1929‚Äì1931. Ginsbern's work on Park Plaza impressed Bernard Noonan, an Irish developer who was building housing in the Bronx, and he recruited them to build a much larger version of those apartments, to be called \\"Noonan Plaza\\". Noonan intended the Plaza to be the apotheosis of design and craftsmanship of his building.

A loudspeaker that becomes hot from use may not produce as much sound pressure level as when it is cold. The problem is much greater for hard-driven professional concert systems than it is for loudspeakers in the home, where it is rarely seen. Two main pathways exist to mitigate the problem: to design a way for the voice coil to dissipate more heat during operation, and to design a more efficient transducer that generates less heat for a given sound output level. High power audio transducers have a low efficiency, with less than 5% of the amplifier signal turned into sound waves. The other 95% or more of the electrical energy is turned into unwanted heat, which causes the voice coil to increase in temperature.Button, Douglas J. (1992). Heat Dissipation and Power Compression in Loudspeakers. JBL. Published by the Audio Engineering Society. Too much heat ‚Äì more than ‚Äì can destroy the voice coil, but long before that happens the loudspeaker will experience power compression. A voice coil made of copper wire will have its DC resistance increase by about 72% when heating up from 20¬∞ C (room temperature) to 200¬∞ C, and its sensitivity will decrease by 4.7 decibels. Silver wire has a slightly worse problem with power compression, while aluminum wire is slightly better. Link to page 2. In multi-way systems, power compression is often observed to occur first in one of the low frequency bandpasses. This causes the total system to have an imbalance in frequency response, a reduction of level in one bandpass compared to the others. In passive loudspeakers with internal crossover components, power compression will change the electrical characteristics of the crossover filters, and the crossover point can shift, introducing distortions related to an incorrect crossover filter. To counteract power compression, one solution is to increase heat dissipation. Typical methods include cooling fins on the magnet housing, a larger diameter voice coil, ferrofluid in the gap between voice coil and magnet, venting of the pole piece, metal parts that conduct heat to the outside, increasing the enclosure's internal chamber volume behind the magnet, and electric cooling fans. Another solution is to design a system that increases efficiency, such as by using a horn loudspeaker rather than a direct-radiating design. Or by choosing a transducer other than the voice coil, such as Bruce Thigpen's rotary woofer (1974) or Tom Danley's servo-motor subwoofer (1983).Danley, Thomas J. (1986) \\"The Elimination of Power Compression in Servo Drive Loudspeakers,\\" Presented at the 81st Convention of the AES. Power compression is usually considered a long-term problem, arising over time with extended strong signal sent to the loudspeaker. However, if the change in resistance is short term, observed as heating up and cooling down with each cycle of low frequency waves, then the loudspeaker will increase in total harmonic distortion.

Early life Phyllis Young was born Phyllis Brett on May 23, 1914 in Toronto, Ontario, the daughter of British-Canadian parents Marion Grace Brett and George Sidney Brett. Her father was the head of the Department of Philosophy at the University of Toronto, and wrote the three-volume A History of Psychology (1912‚Äì21). Young's childhood was split between winters attending public and private schools in Toronto, and summers in Muskoka. Young studied interior decorating at the Ontario College of Art (now OCAD University), but ended her studies and secretly wed her childhood sweetheart Douglas Young. Two years later, her public wedding would be called off when her father learned that she had already had a secret civil ceremony. Young soon had a daughter, Valerie, and focused on family during the financial hardships of the 1930s. Career Though Young was a steadfast wife and mother, she was eager to find something to do that would fill her time without interfering with her responsibilities. She considered dress designing, painting, and writing, with, in her own words, a \\"sewing machine in the bedroom, easel in the dining-room, and typewriter on the kitchen table where I could watch the stove\\". She eventually decided that writing would satisfy her the most. When Douglas found work for a branch of the United Nations after World War II, the family relocated to Geneva, Switzerland. With her daughter now a teen in school, Young began writing her first novels. She planned to put the first away in a drawer with the rest of her writing, until her husband insisted that she submit it to an agent. Soon after the family moved back to Canada, her maiden name was added to her pen name, and Psyche by Phyllis Brett Young was published in 1959. In her first year, Young was the author of two bestselling novels.Argue, p. xxii Her second work, The Torontonians (1960), was published as she moved back to Toronto and became a fixture of the country's literary scene. Excerpts of the novel were published in the Chatelaine magazine, and that winter, she lost Canadian Press' Woman of the Year in Literature and Art to Marie-Claire Blais. Young told the Ottawa Citizen in 1960: \\"I write because I love Canada and I wish more and more people would write about Canada as it is today.\\" Despite Young's attempts to keep the title The Torontonians, the book was reprinted abroad as Gift of Time, The Gift of Time, or The Commuters.Argue, p. x In the next two years, Young published two more novels. First was her most personal, the memoir Anything Could Happen!, which offered a collection of short stories detailing a summer in Muskoka as a child. It would be followed by her only novel under a pseudonym, The Ravine, written under the name Kendal Young. Written as an experiment, Young asked for it to be printed under a pseudonym. Her publisher obliged, but still used Young's real name in the marketing and press, as well as the pages of the book itself. After the rapid-fire release of Young's first four books, her pace slowed for her final two. First she re-purposed the Medieval legend of Undine to tell the story of a woman battling the ghost of her new husband's ex-wife in Undine (1964). Five years later, she released her final book, a murder mystery titled A Question of Judgment. Film adaptations Shortly after the release of Psyche, English director Victor Saville obtained the film rights. In 1961, the United Press International distributed news that he would direct the adaptation, and Susannah York would star. The project never came to fruition, as Saville stopped making films the same year. The Ravine was adapted into a film, renamed Assault, a 1971 British pulp film was adapted by John Kruse and directed by Sidney Hayers. Later years As her daughter wrote in the foreword to The Torontonians re-release in 2007, after her last novel, \\"family needs took precedence over personal fulfillment, and unfortunately she never got back to her writing\\".Argue, p. xii Some of Young's books were republished in the 1970s, and then the author fell into obscurity until her first two novels were posthumously re-released by McGill‚ÄìQueen's University Press.

The film is about two drug users who hide out in an abandoned farmhouse to prepare a huge batch of crystal meth, only to be tormented by terrifying visions.  Synopsis  After having stealing the precursor chemicals needed to illicitly produce crystal meth from bikers, a young couple decides to set up a temporary drug lab and make a large batch of the drug, in hopes of making a large profit. The man is a meth addict with extensive experience taking the drug; his girlfriend is an expert in illegal drug preparation. On the advice of friends, they set up their production in an old abandoned house in the middle of a forest. However, they cannot prepare the drug without trying some of it. The couple are already stressed about the risk of being found by the bikers thet stole the raw drug materials from, so taking meth only increases their anxiety. The two drug-makers, nicknamed \\"cookers\\" in drug subculture slang, end up getting increasingly paranoid in the dark, isolated house. When a friend (who visits to bring supplies) tells them an urban legend about a horrible murder of a little girl in the old house, the couple gets increasingly afraid. While taking meth, the couple think that they might be seeing glimpses of the dead girl; or it might just be paranoia and drug- fuelled hallucinations. Is there really a ghostly presence in the house, or are the pair just tripping on their newly-cooked drugs?
