Francis Picabia, The Spring, Museum of Modern Art Background The Spring is an oil painting on canvas with dimensions 249.6 x 249.3 cm (8' 2 1/4\\" x 8' 2 1/8\\"). It was executed by Picabia upon return from a road trip with two friends; the poet Guillaume Apollinaire and the composer Claude Debussy, during the summer of 1912. During the trip, Picabia is quoted: \\"Are blue and red unintelligible? Are not the circle and the triangle, volumes and colors, as intelligible as this table?\\" 1912 Salon d'Automne Salon d'Automne, Salle XI, Grand Palais des Champs-√âlys√©es, Paris, between 1 October and 8 November 1912. Exhibited: Joseph Csaky (Groupe de femmes, sculpture front the left), Amedeo Modigliani four sculptures on white bases. Other works are shown by Jean Metzinger (Dancer in a caf√©), Franti≈°ek Kupka (Amorpha, Fugue in Two Colors), Francis Picabia (The Spring) and Henri Le Fauconnier (Mountaineers Attacked by Bears) The Salon d'Automne of 1912, held in Paris at the Grand Palais from 1 October to 8 November, saw the Cubists regrouped into the same room XI. The history of the Salon d'Automne is marked by two important dates: 1905, bore witness to the birth of Fauvism, and 1912, the xenophobe and anti-modernist quarrel. The 1912 polemic leveled against both the French and non-French avant-garde artists originated in Salle XI where the Cubists exhibited their works. The resistance to foreigners (dubbed \\"apaches\\") and avant-garde artists was just the visible face of a more profound crises: that of defining modern French art, and the dwindling of an artistic system crystallized around the heritage of Impressionism centered in Paris. Burgeoning was a new avant-garde system, the international logic of which‚Äîmercantile and m√©diatique‚Äîput into question the modern ideology elaborated upon since the late 19th century. What had begun as a question of aesthetics quickly turned political, and as in the 1905 Salon d'Automne, with his infamous \\"Donatello chez les fauves\\",Louis Vauxcelles, Le Salon d'Automne, Gil Blas, 17 October 1905. Screen 5 and 6. Gallica, Biblioth√®que nationale de France, the critic Louis Vauxcelles (Les Arts, 1912) was most implicated in the deliberations. Recall too, it was Vauxcelles who, on the occasion of the 1910 Salon des Ind√©pendants, wrote disparagingly of 'pallid cubes' with reference to the paintings of Metzinger, Gleizes, Le Fauconnier, L√©ger and Delaunay.Louis Vauxcelles, A travers les salons: promenades aux ¬´ Ind√©pendants ¬ª, Gil Blas, 18 March 1910 The Cubist contribution to the 1912 Salon d'Automne created scandal regarding the use of government owned buildings, such as the Grand Palais, to exhibit such artwork.

It is stupefying to look at. The catalog says it's a Woman in blue. Poor woman. Man on a Balcony, by Mr. Gleizes, is more comprehensible. At least in the chaos of cubes and trapezoids we find a man.

(former name: AS Vopak E.O.S.) is an oil products terminal operator located in Tallinn, Estonia. It operates four oil terminals in the Tallinn area in Estonia. History Liwathon E.O.S. (then Vopak E.O.S.) was created in 2008 by merger of oil terminal operators AS Pakterminal and AS E.O.S. Pakterminal was established on 30 June 1992 as a joint venture of Paktank International (later part of Vopak) and N-Terminal, a company controlled by Estonian businessmen Endel Siff, Aadu Luukas and Anatoli Kanajev. Shortly after the establishment of Pakterminal, the shareholding of N-Terminal was transferred to Trans-Kullo, another company controlled by Siff, Luukas and Kanajev. Another shareholders of Trans-Kullo were Aleksander Denisoff, Vladimir Ossavolyuk and Igor Lepetukhin‚ÄîRussian businessmen related to the Russian oil industry. In 2007, Vopak acquired all shares of Pakterminal. History of Estonian Oil Service (EOS of E.O.S.) reaches back to 1993 when the company started its operations. It was owned by Coastal Baltica Holding Company, a Cayman Islands company which was owned by Coastal Corporation and Baltica Finance N.V. In 1994, a state-owned enterprise Eesti K√ºtus was reorganized and a separate company Esoil was established. Esoil was privatized by and consequently merged into E.O.S. in 1996. In 2002, Coastal Baltica Holding Company sold E.O.S. to another Cayman Islands company, Estonia Holding Ltd, controlled by Baltica Finance N.V., and El Paso Corporation which acquired Coastal Corporation in 2001, exit oil business in Estonia. In 2004, Severstaltrans (later named: N-Trans) acquired a majority stake in E.O.S. through its Cyprus-based subsidiary Transportation Investments Holding Limited and later's subsidiary O√ú Intercross Investments. Severstaltrans announced its plan to merger with E.O.S. other terminal operators in Estonia like Pakterminal and Eurodek, as also Latvian Ventspils Nafta, and to list the company on the stock exchange. However, this plan with exception of the merger with Pakterminal, was never implemented. In April 2008, Vopak and N-Trans merged their businesses in Estonia to create Vopak E.O.S. Originally N-Trans owned 65% of share and Vopak owned 35% of shares. In July 2008, Vopak used the option to acquire additional 15% of shares from N-Trans and Vopak E.O.S. became equally owned by these companies. Later that year N-Trans transferred its stake to its that time subsidiary Global Ports Investments. Later major shareholders in Global Ports Investments became Russian Delo Group and APM Terminals, a part of Maersk Group. In 2018, owners of Vopak E.O.S. announced their plan to sell the company. In April 2019, Vopak E.O.S. was acquired by the Abu Dhabi-based investment company Liwathon, owned by the British investor Barclay Rowland, a son of David Rowland. The company was consequently renamed Liwathon E.O.S. In June 2019, Gert Tiivas became a new CEO of the company and Edmund Rowland became a chairman of the board.

Originally released in Japan under the name Puyo Puyo eSports, the game was localized for international release in 2019 under the name Puyo Puyo Champions. As with Puyo Puyo Tetris, the international release features English characters voices, allowing the player to change between the original Japanese and the English localized voices; the game interface is also available in French, German, Italian, Spanish, Traditional Chinese, Simplified Chinese and Korean.  Mechanics and modes  The game features two separate gameplay mechanics based on the following earlier games: * Puyo Puyo Tsu * Puyo Puyo Fever The game modes available include: * Multiplayer, the main focus of the game; can be played locally on the same device or via LAN, or with other players online, casually or competitively * Tournament, a local multiplayer mode for up to eight players, featuring a single-elimination tournament * Lessons, a single- player mode for learning the basics of the game and training * Challenges, the only other single-player mode available, mainly to test players' skills and abilities As its original Japanese name implies, this game is aimed at esports and thus focuses on competitive multiplayer, so it lacks the single player campaign prominently featured in the previous games. Puyo Puyo Champions also features 24 playable characters, complete with their own distinct AI behavior and Fever drop pattern, though some of these characters simply reuse the existing AI of characters not appearing in the game as playable. These characters include fan-favorites from the original Compile game series such as Arle and Dark Prince, as well as newer characters such as Ally, who debuted in the Japan-only Nintendo 3DS game Puyo Puyo Chronicle. The 2.02 update, released on August 24, 2020, added two hidden characters, Rafisol and Paprisu, which have to be unlocked by inputting specific button combinations. The game also allows players to personalize their in-game profile image, with over a hundred characters to choose from both the main game series and Puyopuyo!! Quest, as well as a selection of backgrounds and borders, all of which seem to be carried over from Puyopuyo!! Quest.  Reception  The game received mostly favorable reviews. The Nintendo Switch version received a score of 74/100 at Metacritic, based on 10 reviews, while the PlayStation 4 one received a score of 74/100, based on 4 reviews.

Reports of researchers opening envelopes prematurely or holding the envelopes up to lights to determine their contents has led some researchers to say that the use of sealed envelopes is no longer acceptable. , sealed envelopes were still in use in some clinical trials.

She was also known as Lady Mary Forbes- Trefusis. She was a daughter of the 6th Earl Beauchamp and the wife of Lt.-Col. Henry Hepburn-Stuart-Forbes-Trefusis (a son of the 20th Baron Clinton) in 1905 and had issue. Lady Mary was a close friend and correspondent of her brother Lord Beauchamp. She was a friend and promoter of the composer Edward Elgar and is thought to be commemorated anonymously in one of his Enigma Variations entitled \\"Romanza (***)\\". She was the first Secretary of the English Folk Dance Society (founded 1911) and was for a time a collector of English folk dances. Trefusis Hall in the EFDSS HQ, Cecil Sharp House, is named after her. She was also Lady of the Bedchamber to Queen MarySeddon British Women Composers and Instrumental Chamber Music in the Early Twentieth Century; Trefusis, Mary (having joined her household while Mary was Princess of Wales), directed a number of choirs and was the joint founder of the Association of Competitive Festivals in 1904 (Mary Wakefield was the other founder). Foxlease Lady Mary was instrumental in the acquisition of the house of Foxlease by the Girl Guides Association. During the preparations for the marriage of Princess Mary, who happened to be President of the Girl Guides Association Rose Kerr was contacted by Lady Mary Trefusis (Lady of the Bedchamber to HM Queen Mary), because Olave Baden-Powell, the World Chief Guide, was not in London. Lady Mary Trefusis was on the committee of a fund to which all the Marys of the British Empire had contributed, for a wedding present to the Princess. The Princess insisted that she could only accept a proportion of the fund as a personal gift. Trefusis proposed to Kerr that the remainder be spent buying a training centre for the Girl Guides, a cause close to the Princess's heart. Kerr suggested that the fund could furnish and equip Foxlease, but this was not immediately accepted as the Fund wanted a place that would be associated with Princess Mary's name. As the matter had to be settled by the next day, Kerr gave Trefusis the phone number of Pax Hill, the Baden-Powells' home.

Her primary research investigates sea level changes during interglacial periods to predict future sea level rise.  Early life and education  Andrea Dutton was born in Fairfax, Virginia and spent most of her childhood in Atlanta, Georgia and Westport, Connecticut. Dutton graduated from Staples High School in Westport, Connecticut in 1991. From 1991‚Äì1995, Dutton attended Amherst College where she studied music and focused on classes that would prepare her for the MCAT. Dutton took her first geology class at Amherst, and was immediately \\"fell in love\\" with the geological sciences. This altered the direction of her career towards geology. She graduated from Amherst College in 1995 with a BA in music. Following her time at Amherst, Dutton taught science at Saint Ann's School in Brooklyn Heights, New York City where she taught 3rd, 6th, 10th, 11th and 12th grade science. In 2003, Dutton returned to school and earned an MS and a PhD from the University of Michigan in geology. She continued her training as a postdoctoral scholar for two years at the Australian National University, where she continued on as a research fellow for four years.  Career and research  Dutton was a professor of Geology at the University of Florida in Gainesville, Florida from 2011 to 2019, and now Dutton is a professor of Geology at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison. She co-led an international group that utilizes the geological record to understand sea level rise from 2013 to 2017. Her professional career began when she taught science at the Saint Ann's School in Brooklyn. Through the variety of age groups that Dutton taught, she learned a lot about public speaking on scientific topics, provoking an attentiveness to scientific communication in her future work. In 2000, Dutton received an M.S. in geology from the University of Michigan and a Ph.D. in Geological Sciences in 2003. For her Ph.D., Dutton researched paleoclimate between the Cretaceous and Eocene periods in the Antarctic Peninsula. Dutton completed a postdoctoral fellowship between the years of 2004 and 2005 at the Research School of Earth Sciences at the Australian National University (ANU) in Canberra, Australia. She then worked as a research fellow from 2006 until 2011 at ANU. During her time at ANU as a research fellow, Dutton worked in collaboration with Kurt Lambeck, a geophysicist, to develop an interdisciplinary approach to reconstructing past sea levels using radiometrically dated fossilized coral. Dutton specializes in paleoceanography and paleoclimatology. Her most recognized work concentrates on reconstructing past sea level variation to predict future changes. To understand how sea level will fluctuate in the future, Dutton looks at what is preserved in the rock record. Specifically, Dutton utilizes fossilized coral and limestone rocks to understand how past sea level increased during warming climates throughout earth's history. Because corals live in shallow waters, they can advantageously be used to track past sea level positions. By studying an entire reef including the assemblages, algae, and other aspects that inform how the coral grew, Dutton and other researchers can provide a holistic comprehension of sea level. She also uses other sedimentary archives to further analyze geologic changes throughout earth's history. In 2019, Dutton was awarded a Fulbright Scholarship to work with researchers in New Zealand to combine records of past sea level rise with models of Antarctic ice dynamics to better understand the effects of warming temperatures on sea levels. When assessing sea level fluctuations, Dutton studies the geochemistry, geophysics and biology of each reef. In her research, Dutton uses chemistry techniques to find the age of the coral and combines this information with the elevational changes of the reef through time to understand sea level changes. This research also provides knowledge about how ice sheets melted, which can better inform projections of ice sheet fluctuations with future climatic changes. Dutton primarily focuses on sea level rise from 125,000 years ago, when earth temperatures were similar to today's. She studies sea level rise throughout the world, including Florida, the Seychelles Islands, and Mexico's Yucat√°n Peninsula. One of her research objectives is to determine when the West Antarctic ice sheet collapsed in the past to help us understand when and how this may occur in the future. The findings of Dutton's work are influential for urban planners as coastal communities struggle to adapt to rising seas.

It is located in the San Lorenzo neighborhood in the western side of the CBD adjacent to Washington SyCip Park and near Greenbelt. The park, best known as the location of a weekend market known as the Legazpi Sunday Market, is maintained by the Makati Commercial Estate Association which is headquartered in a two-storey building at the adjoining parking lot since 2017. Its name is in reference to its location along Legazpi Street within the former Legazpi gated village that was merged with neighboring San Lorenzo gated village and formed the barangay of San Lorenzo. Overview Children's playground at the Legazpi Active Park The park occupies the southern third of an L-shaped block bounded by Rufino and Legazpi streets to the north, Rada Street to the east, Salcedo Street to the west, and Gamboa Street to the south. It sits next to a parking lot containing the CBD administration building and is framed by a mix of office and residential towers. The park is in the quieter side of Legazpi Village, midway between Greenbelt and Makati Medical Center. It is equipped with park benches, tiled walkways and jogging paths, a children's playground, and washrooms. The park, as its name suggests, is the active counterpart of the adjacent \\"passive\\" Washington SyCip Park. It is a fitness park for outdoor activities such as calisthenics, yoga, jogging, frisbee, and cycling. The Makati Commercial Estate Association moved in to its new home at the active park in 2017 after 24 years being headquartered at the former Legazpi Village Mini Park. The park underwent a seven-month reconstruction in the same year and now features a collection of ornamental plants and improved landscape design. Legazpi Sunday Market The weekend market was founded in 2005 by Mara Pardo de Tavera, an organic market pioneer and advocate, a year after a similar concept was tested in Salcedo Park on the other side of the central business district. The market operates every Sunday from early morning until early afternoon under an agreement with the local government of San Lorenzo and the Makati Commercial Estate Association. It actually replaced Pardo de Tavera's weekend bazaar called Mara's Organic Market (MOM) which operated at the Greenbelt park since 1994 until its closure in 2004 when reconstruction began at the shopping mall and park. Like its sister market in Salcedo Village, the Legazpi Sunday Market features a wide variety of items for sale including farm fresh and organic produce from Luzon and Mindanao and homemade local and international foods. It has a strictly vegetarian section and also sells natural personal care products and artisan crafts. In March 2019, the parking lot beside the Legazpi Active Park was closed down to make way for the construction of a multi-level parking building. According to the Makati Central Estate Association, the Legazpi Sunday Market would be temporarily relocated to the Corinthian Plaza parking lot beside the Asian Institute of Management while construction at the site is ongoing.

Qushayr‚Äôs brothers were progenitors of the large tribes of Banu Uqayl and Banu Ja'da.Della Vida 1986, p. 526. The mother of Qushayr was Rayta bint Kunfudh ibn Malik of the Banu Sulaym. History In the pre- Islamic period, the Qushayr were attached to their parent tribe, the Banu Amir, and were resided in the region of al-Yamama (central Arabia). They were involved in all the wars between the Banu Amir and rival tribes, particularly the Banu Tamim and Banu Shayban. During one of these wars, the Qushayri leader Malik ibn Salama al-Khayr, known as Dhu'l-Ruqayba, captured the Shaybani chief Hajib ibn Zurara. The Salama al-Khayr family were the princely household of the Banu Qushayr. The Qushayr embraced Islam along with the Banu Amir in 630.

It covers the processes that can be taken by conservators, archaeologists, and other museum professionals to conserve waterlogged wood. This practice includes understanding the composition and agents of deterioration of waterlogged wood, as well as the preventive conservation and interventive conservation measures that can be taken.  History  Waterlogged wood is a wooden object that has been submerged or partially submerged in water and has affected the original intended purpose or look of the object. Waterlogged wood objects can also include wood found within moist soil from archaeological sites, underwater archaeology, maritime debris, or damaged wood objects. Conservation of waterlogged wood has changed throughout time. Due to the delicate structure of this organic material, conservationists and museum professionals alike have struggled with finding a textbook method An example of the conservation of wood and how it has changed over time can be illustrated by the conservation treatments of a Kefermarkt alter. The earliest attempt at wood conservation is recorded as late as 1852-1855, A. Stifter treated the Kefermarkt altar in Austria with table salt in an attempt to protect the wood against pests. In around 1916-1918 Councillor Bolle attempted to conserve the wood alter from pests included brushing the wood with petroleum and hexachloroethane. Finally, in 1929 the use of hydrogen cyanide relieved the pest problem and preserve the woods longevity. From a conservation standpoint, waterlogged or not, wood has been difficult to preserve because it is an organic material. = About wood as a material = Mary Rose, an English warship, was raised from the ships underwater site on October 11, 1982. Since then there has been extensive conservation and preservation on the vessel. This part of the vessel is almost exclusively wood, making conservation imminent. The extracted vessel is on exhibit at the Mary Rose Museum in the United Kingdom. Wood is an organic material and decays under biological and chemical degradation when buried or submerged above water or soil. Wood, an organic material produced by plants, are chemically composed of: carbohydrates (cellulose and hemicellulose), lignin and other components (aliphatic acids, alcohols, proteins and inorganic substances) in a smaller amount. The most important composition of the plant is the cellulose. The cellulose accounts the majority of the cell from 40% to 50% of the wood's total mass. Hemicellulose represents the second most important carbohydrate with accounts 20% to 30% of the wood's cell. In cases of extreme wetness or dryness wood can be preserved until the extreme environment is disrupted. Conservation of wooden waterlogged objects is completely dependent on the natural wood type and biological structure. Wood is separated into two categories, hardwoods and softwoods. Based on which category the waterlogged wood falls into can determine the amount of porous absorption. Hardwoods are classified as angiosperms. Angiosperms are considered porous woods because of the vessel pores. Softwoods are gymnosperms and are considered non-porous because of the lack of vessel pores. The type of wood and the availability of vessel pores largely affect how conservators treat and preserve waterlogged wood. Places where waterlogged wood objects are found can range. For example, waterlogged wood is something that archaeologist might stumble upon during an excavation either from the wood being submerged or near water or being in moist soil over time, while some waterlogged wood can be accidental.  Agents of deterioration  For waterlogged wood, the major threats of agents of deterioration include physical forces, pests, incorrect temperature, incorrect relative humidity, and custodial neglect. Attempts at preventive conservation focus on creating a stable storage environment, documentation, and resources to provide the environmental settings that keep an object as stable as possible. There are several agents of deterioration that affect waterlogged wood, mostly environmental based. Due to the fragile state of waterlogged wood and with the object being removed from it is an anaerobic environment; the conditional environment is a great force. An incorrect environment with incorrect relative humidity and relative temperature can affect waterlogged wood by creating bacteria, fungi, pest risk. Environmental agents of deterioration are so fragile on organic material like waterlogged wood, that the conservation process of removing the water in an attempt to stabilize includes the task ‚Äúto remove the water logging water (not the 'bound' water which is part of the wood structure itself) without causing shrinkage or cell wall collapse‚Äù. Since Brown is referencing a conservation procedure an alternative in preventive conservation would be keeping the waterlogged wood in its original state (in water or a solution) with routine maintenance. = Relative humidity and temperature = Inconsistent relative humidity and temperature provide the perfect environment for mold and fungi growth on waterlogged wood. Growth of mold or other bacteria requires immediate attention to control damage. Natural fibers cause the best environment for mold spores to grow and mature. \\"Mold is a microorganism that produces enzymes that convert the cellulose in fibers to soluble sugar that is metabolized as food. Proteins are generally less susceptible, but keratinophilic fungi will feed on, and damage, these fibers as well\\". Similar to wood found in nature, mold and other feeding organisms are attracted to the material, this includes pests and naturally occurring fungi and bacteria. Mold is a high-risk for waterlogged wood regardless of the controlled relative humidity and temperature due to the resilient nature of the organisms and the perfect environment waterlogged wood provides as a food source to the growth of spores. = Pests = Diagram showing shipworm boring into a piece of wood. Within maritime environments one of the largest pest threats to waterlogged wood includes shipworms (Teredinidae). Shipworms bore into wood that is immersed in seawater. Within a museum exhibit or storage environment and post treatment of waterlogged wood objects, there are numbers of wood-boring pests that feast on wood. Two of which include the wood- boring/powderpost beetle and termites. wood-boring beetles can include several different types within the board category. Each type of beetle could target a different type of wood. Evidence of pest deterioration includes powder like frass in addition to entry and exit holes within the wood. Termites feast of wood and live below the surface of the wood so they are sometimes more difficult to find on a wooden object. Termites discharge sized sided fecal pellets and if found on a wooden object could be used to determine the type of pest damage = Physical = Physical deterioration of waterlogged wood can happen immediately through the evaporation of the water within the wood. If this happens rapidly the cells in the wood can shrink and collapse. This damage might be inevitable depending on accessibility to treatment. Additionally pre or post conservation treatment, waterlogged wood should not be handled extensively or put on exhibit for long periods of time.  Preventative conservation  = Environment and Storage = Waterlogged wood should be in the environment that it is found in until a stable treatment proposal is found. Most waterlogged wood is such that the cells in the material fill up with water. Depending on the wood type and how long the wood has been in water, removal of the water from the cells too rapidly (in the form of natural dehydration or other) could apply major stress to the cell walls and cause them to collapse and deteriorate. Waterlogged wood, prior to treatment, should be kept in a similar environment of hydration. To limit the growth of mold, waterlogged wood should be stored with proper relative humidity that does not encourage growth. Since moisture of the waterlogged wood is imminent, waterlogged wood is best stored for preventative conservation submerged in a solution to what the wood is waterlogged with. Similar to the preservation of zoological specimen, temporarily preserving waterlogged wood in the environment it was in helps minimize the severity of change. Waterlogged wood will retain its structure as long as it is wet. If the wood is exposed to air, and water evaporates, there is a change in surface tension that forces the evaporating water out of the weakened cell walls which cause the walls to collapse. This force ends up shrinking and ultimately distorting the object.  Conservation treatment  The problem with conservation treatments to waterlogged wood and to stabilize the materials has been changed throughout the course of time. Some treatments include the Polyethylene Glycol (PEG) method, Sucrose method, Acetone-Rosin method, alcohol-Ether method, Camphor-Alcohol method, freeze drying, and silicone oil treatment. One of the largest issues with treatment on waterlogged wood is finding a way to remove the water in the wood but keep the water that is part of the material. Preserving the cell walls of the wood represent the largest struggle in treatment. = Evaporation/displacement/replacement of heavily waterlogged wood =  PEG Treatment  The purpose of PEG is to remove water while simultaneously bulking wood. A waterlogged object is placed in a ventilated vat with a solution of PEG and a solvent of water and alcohol. Additional percentages of PEG are added to the solution and through this process the water and alcohol are able to evaporate bringing wax into the waterlogged wood as a form of displacement. Depending on the porous nature of the wood, PEG could provide a success treatment that targets removal of a large portion of the water but keeps the structure of the material.  Sucrose Treatment  Identical to PEG treatment process but sucrose is used instead of PEG solution. The cells of the wood are replaced by sucrose, rather than water.  Acetone-Rosin Treatment  Acetone-Rosin Treatment is used on dense wood that cannot be penetrated by PEG. This would include softwoods that are nonporous. The goal of this treatment is to replace cells of wood with natural rosin. Rosin is a natural resin that is produced within some woods, for example pines naturally produce resin and are considered a softwood. = Dehydration =  Alcohol-Ether Treatment  This treatment follows the similar treatment of the PEG solution but instead of replacing the cells with another solution, the cells are replaced with alcohol and when the alcohol evaporates the cell and overall object is dehydrated.  Camphor- Alcohol Treatment  Camphor treatment is similar to the Alcohol-Ether treatment but instead of a quick evaporation of the alcohol inside of the cells, the camphor alcohol slowly replaces cell walls with camphor which goes from a solid to a gas state over time, keeping walls of cells bulked. Treatment must also take into account the type of water the wood was found in. Soluble salts must be removed from the waterlogged wood. This can be done by a desalination process. The removal of soluble salts, desalination, of wood extracted from a marine environment is crucial. Desalination is done with clean water, with disinfectant added to prevent the development of harmful organisms. The disinfectant fungicide, algaecide, orthophenyl phenol; however, the most commonly used and recommended because of its lesser toxicity is a mixture of boric acid and borax. The desalination process takes a long period of time and is necessary that the water is changed until the concentration of excreted of soluble salts reach its maximum.  Case studies  = Alexandria Ship Project = January 2016 a mid 18th century ship was discovered on the waterfront of Alexandria, Virginia. Conservation efforts include keeping the wood submerged and wet since the wooden framed was waterlogged. the conservation history of this ship is ongoing. When the waterlogged wooden frame was originally removed from the archaeological site, the timber frames were stored in fresh water vats until June 2017. The framed structure was then packaged and sent to the Conservation Research Laboratory at Texas A&M; University for conservation. Documenting and conservation included laser scanning, modeling, X-ray, and wood degradation analysis before the treatment using polyethylene glycol and vacuum freeze drying = Mary Rose = Mary Rose being sprayed with water in a Plymouth conservation facility, March 1984. After finding the vessel Mary Rose objects and what was left of the ship were placed in a passive storage which slowed down the process of immediate deterioration removing the vessel from its extreme environment. In 1994, an elaborate three phased conservation treatment began on Mary Rose. From 1993 to 2003 was the first phase that consisted of the wood getting sprayed with low- molecular-weight PEG to replace the water in the cellular structure of the wood. The second phase from 2003 to 2010, raised the molecular-weight of the PEG solution with the purpose to strengthen the outer surface layers. The third phase in 2016, included controlled air drying. = Vasa = Vasa on exhibit, from the picture you can tell that a large majority of the ship was preserved. The Vasa is a Swedish 1628 ship found archaeologically and was very well preserved. Completely submerged for 333 years allowed for the wood to be completely waterlogged but pollution in the 20th century off of the city Stockholm was able to kill any microorganisms that would have feast on the wreck, like the shipworm. The Vasa was sprayed with a PEG solution for 17 years followed by a period of drying which is still currently happening.

She served as the president of Disney Publishing Worldwide from 2002 to 2006, CEO of British media company Entertainment Rights from 2007 to 2009, and CEO of (RED) from 2011 to 2019. Dugan has contributed to the Huffington Post and Forbes.com and appeared on Mad Money with Jim Cramer, PBS News Hour, and NPR's All Things Considered, among other outlets. She has been the co-chair of the storytelling nonprofit the Moth since 2008. Early life and career Dugan grew up on Long Island and in Florida. Her father was Thomas Dugan, who worked for a time in the U.S. Justice Department and co-founded the Peace Corps with Sargent Shriver, and her mother, a homemaker. Thomas passed away when his daughter was six, and she worked from a young age. She attended the University of Florida, majoring in education, making the dean's list, and graduated. She then went to and graduated from the University of Utah Law School. Dugan became a business affairs attorney on Wall Street while doing pro-bono work for Volunteer Lawyers for the Arts. Career She transitioned to working at SBK Records, where she worked with artists like Wilson Phillips then when the company merged with EMI/Capitol Records, she became its executive vice president serving musicians like Paul McCartney, George Harrison, Tracy Chapman, and Joan Baez. She then worked for Disney Publishing Worldwide for eight years, becoming its president in 2002, where she oversaw 275 magazines, including Discover and Disney Magazine, and published more than 4,000 new books, leading a team of more than 500 employees worldwide and generating $1.8 billion in global retail sales. She then worked for British media company Entertainment Rights as president and CEO of the North America division, restructuring it and growing its biggest content work, one year, 27 percent. =CEO of (RED)= In 2011, Dugan started work as CEO of (RED), co- founded by Bono and Bobby Shriver after interviewing for a job that wasn't the right fit. The nonprofit foundation aims to enlist the help of private companies and citizens in the global fight to eradicate AIDS in Sub-Saharan Africa (it now tasks itself to also combat the effects of Covid-19). She rearranged her life to travel to Africa, among other things, and, under her tenure, (RED) began to partner with Coca-Cola, Salesforce, Bank of America, Vespa, Snapchat, Nickelodeon, Moschino, Jeremy Scott, Latin America's telecommunications companies Claro and Telcel, German multinational SAP, among others. Notable campaigns under Dugan also include the Super Bowl, Jimmy Kimmel Live, Beats by Dre, Starbucks, and Amazon. During this time the foundation, with a team of 25 in New York, reached $660 million for the Global Fund and impacted the lives of more than 110 million. From 2011 to 2015, Dugan also contributed to Huffington Post, in 2017 and 2018, to Forbes.com. In 2017 she was awarded PTTOW!'s Nelson Mandela Changemaker Award. =Recording Academy presidency= In response to the outrage over the low female representation at the 2018 Grammys and then-CEO/President Neil Portnow's comment that women musicians needed to \\"step up\\" in order to achieve parity, a 18-person task force led by Time's Up co-founder Tina Tchen was created to study the Recording Academy's problems and make recommendations. After a search, on May 8, 2019, its board of trustees confirmed that Dugan would be its next president and CEO. She began her tenure on August 1, 2019, succeeding Portnow. Dugan was the first woman president of the $60M nonprofit, and her contract was for three years. On January 16, 2020, Dugan was relieved of her duties and placed on administrative leave, accused of bullying her assistant, whom she inherited from Portnow, resulting in the assistant taking a leave of absence. Recording Academy Chairman Harvey Mason Jr. took over as interim president and CEO. In response, Dugan made claims that the organization was complicit in corruption, citing \\"voting irregularities, financial mismanagement, 'exorbitant and unnecessary' legal bills, and conflicts of interest involving members of the academy‚Äôs board, executive committee and outside lawyers\\". On March 2, 2020, the Recording Academy announced that it had officially fired her. A letter was sent to its members informing them of the action taken by its board of trustees.

The government controls what information the mass media relays, and the law prohibits any criticism of the Sultan or government. In November 1974, Oman TV began broadcasting news broadcasts, government announcements, children's shows and nature programs. Though Articles 29, 30 and 31 of the Basic Statute of Oman calls for freedom of the press and freedom of expression, there is some underlying material including \\"public discord, violates the security of the state, or abuses a person's dignity or rights,\\" which complicates the meaning of the law. The Basic Statute, founded in 1996, is the foundation of the government and has only been modified once in 2011. The 1984 Press and Publications Law has more rules and regulations than any country in the Arab world. The media is heavily controlled and libel is a criminal offense. To combat freelance journalism, journalists have to apply as employees \\"of a specific outlet\\" as of 2005. With the Telecommunications Act in place, people can be prosecuted if they communicate against the operations of society. Because of the many regulations, all media is monitored and advertising is prohibited on radio and television.  Television and broadcast journalism  Television in the Sultanate of Oman, including broadcast journalism, began in 1974 and largely focused on the capital city of Muscat. Coverage expanded to other parts of the country in 1975. Private television companies were prohibited in Oman for 30 years until the Sultan Qaboos bin Said al Said announced a \\"royal decree\\" that lifted prohibition on private television in 2004. In 2009, five years after the royal decree, the first private television station began, called Majan TV. As of 2015, Majan TV was the only privately run television station in Oman according to the BBC media profile of Oman, and there were only two other television stations including the most popular Sultanate of Oman Television, Oman TV. It is allowed to use satellites to reach stations from Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Yemen. Oman TV channels are controlled and regulated by the government through the Ministry of Information. Criticisms of the government, or the Sultan, are not taken lightly. In 2004, two Omani intellectuals called the government reforms a way to improve the image of Oman across the globe, on a program on the Iranian TV channel Al-Alam. Following this, the Omani Ministry of Information banned interviews or any sort of publication with the two Omani intellectuals across all media platforms. While it isn't normal for Omani TV to televise political debates, Omani media did cover a political trial in 2005, where 30-to-40 Omanis were accused \\"of conspiring to overthrow the Sultan's rule by organizing an Ibadi religious group\\".  Print journalism  Print journalism in Oman has been a delicate business for many decades. Much like many other facets of Omani journalism, print journalism is monitored and necessarily controlled by the Ministry of Information. The Ministry does little to hide the fact, with article 12 of Royal Decree No. 49, created in 1984, stating \\"Before publishing any publication, the Printer shall obtain permission in advance from the Ministry of Information approving the publication.‚Äù Because of this decree, print publications, such as Alwatan and Al Shabiba, have an extremely hard time gaining any credibility. This fear has come to fruition too, with plenty of journalists being arrested in the 21st century alone. In August 2016, the high-ranking editors of the newspaper Azamn were detained: Editor-in-Chief Ibrahim al-Maamari, Deputy Editor Yousif al-Haj and Editor Zaher al-Abri. The three were detained after being linked to an article on July 26 of that year, in which al-Maamari published an article accusing unnamed Omani officials of influencing the Chief Magistrate of the Supreme Court at the Ministry of Justice, Ishaq Bin Ahmed Al Bousaidi, in a case involving an inheritance dispute. Following a second article being published soon after, the Ministry of Information ordered Azamn to stop all publications. Soon after, the website URL which originally linked to Azamn's homepage was unavailable, and instead redirected to pictures of the three arrested journalists. Radio Radio broadcasting in Oman began in 1970 with the stations Radio Sultanate of Oman and Radio Salalah, partly in an effort to counteract anti-Oman propaganda originating from the Marxist country of South Yemen. Initial plans for a radio station began in the 1950s, with talks between the Omani and British government. These specific plans never came to fruition, limiting the scope of radio in Oman to a single Land Rover used to broadcast important alerts from the city of Muttrah. As of 2000, there were 1.4 million radios in the country, being broadcast from 14 stations. Listeners have access to a variety of programs broadcast in both Arabic and English, ranging from contemporary musical hits to readings of the Quran. Broadcast journalism is another prevalent force over the airwaves, with a 2017 survey reporting that 29.8 percent of journalists sampled work in radio. Nearly all media is controlled and funded by the Omani government. Radio broadcasts are overseen by the director general of radio, who reports directly to Oman's Minister of Information. Following the Sultan's 2004 royal decree establishing the legality of private radio and television stations, citizens could now apply for a 10-year license granting them the ability to operate independent stations. This led to the establishment of Hala FM, Oman's first privately owned radio station in 2009. The Omani government is strict in what it allows to be broadcast, though it has loosened its grip in recent years. After a period of civil unrest, several call-in programs started broadcasting out of the capital. These programs allow citizens to share their thoughts on what Oman needs.

Her work focuses on complex ecosystem dynamics and the application of ecological theories to agricultural systems.  Early life and education  Ivette Perfecto was born in Puerto Rico. As a child, she was fascinated by the environment of the Caribbean. She enjoyed the outdoors, particularly the underwater world she could explore while snorkeling. The interactions she observed between organisms sparked her original interest in biology. However, the contamination of many of Puerto Rico's ecosystems that resulted from the industrialization programs of Operation Bootstrap instilled a passion in Perfecto for environmental sciences. She enrolled in the Universidad Sagrado del Cor√°zon in Santurce, Puerto Rico and graduated with a B.S. of Biology in 1977. After earning an undergraduate degree, Perfecto was accepted as a graduate student at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, Michigan. At the time she was a single mother and was often unable to start her work until after she had put her son to bed in the evenings. In 1982 she earned her Masters of Ecology and then returned to Puerto Rico where she taught college biology. She taught biology for a year in Puerto Rico, but her desire to continue conducting research lead her to return to the University of Michigan where she earned a PhD in Ecology and Natural Resources in 1989.  Career and research  Perfecto is a professor in the School for Environment and Sustainability at the University of Michigan and became the George W. Pack Professor of Natural Resources and Environment in 2009. Her work can be generalized under the category of ecology, but specifically she studies agroecology, diversity in coffee agricultural systems, and conservation biology. Some of her major findings have included a better understanding of complex ecosystem dynamics through the analysis of spatial factors and trait mediated effects. Perfecto's research regarding the improvement of agricultural systems through the application of ecological theories is inherently interdisciplinary. It reflects her career as a scientist and efforts as an engaged activist to improve the livelihoods of Puerto Rican agriculturists through research and communication. Her work regarding the role of pest species in agroecosystems has been utilized to the effect that the use of pesticides can be reduced to the benefit of farmers. In addition, Perfecto has researched the effect of shade trees in agroecosystems as a potential alternative to increased irrigation in the face of climatic alterations such as increased temperature and decrease precipitation. Perfecto has a large volume of published books and scientific articles. More than 100 journal publications and articles that she has authored or co-authored have been cited over 27,000 times. = Selected grants = * 2018 United States Department of Agriculture-National Institute of Food and Agriculture.

Perfecto and Vandermeer also developed a board game called \\"Azteca-Chess\\" to improve coffee farmers' understanding of the ecological complexity of their farms. The game incorporates the pests common to coffee farms and is designed to educate players about the beneficial roles these insects can have in a coffee agroecosystem. Through the dissemination of this game, farmers will better understand the interconnected nature of the ecosystems they cultivate and use this knowledge to inform decisions regarding pest management.

With local support groups in both the eastern and western coalfields, CEP also advocated for women on issues such as sexual harassment, mine safety, equal access to training and promotions, parental leave, and wages. Founding The superstition that a woman even entering a mine was bad luck and results in disaster was pervasive among male miners. The spark that lead to the organization's founding was when a woman team member from two Tennessee grassroots advocacy organizations, the East Tennessee Research Corporation (ETRC) and Save Our Cumberland Mountains, was barred from a planned mine tour. The ETRC director contacted attorney Betty Jean Hall and the two began to seek funding for an organization to research issues related to women's employment in the industry. The first funding came from a $5,000 grant from the Ms. Foundation. Legal strategy The initial legal strategy was based upon a 1965 Executive Order of U.S. President Lyndon Johnson that bars sex discrimination by companies with federal contracts. Tennessee Valley Authority, the largest publicly owned U.S power company, held coal contracts with many Kentucky and Tennessee coal companies. Based upon this, CEP founder Betty Jean Hall filed a landmark discrimination complaint in 1978 with the Department of Labor Office of Federal Contract Compliance Program. Named were 153 companies, among them coal companies Peabody and Consolidated, which produced about half of nation's coal. The complaint called for the hiring of one woman for every three inexperienced men until women constituted 20 percent of the workforce. The Kentucky Human Rights Commission began cases against coal companies on discrimination against women in 1975. This legal strategy was successful. Almost 3,000 women were hired by the close of 1979 as underground miners. In December 1978, Consolidated Coal Company was ordered to implement affirmative action and agreed to pay $360,000 in compensation to 78 women who had been denied jobs between 1972 and 1976. Originally headquartered in Jacksboro, TN, CEP moved to Oak Ridge and added field offices in Hazard, KY, Westernport, Maryland, and Denver, Colorado, as well as regional support teams. Its last headquarters were in Knoxville, TN. CEP produced a grassroots newsletter, Coalmining Women‚Äôs Support Team News and held national meetings. United Mine Workers of America United Mine Workers of America (UMWA), the largest miners‚Äô union, initially had a lukewarm approach to CEP and support for women miners. An 1978 CEP endorsement request resulted in the failure of President Arnold Miller to submit to the International Executive Board. By the next quarter, with a concerted effort by UMWA women, the IEB passed the support endorsement. Nine women were among the 1,267 delegates to the UMWA constitutional convention a year later. Miller's successor, Sam Church, responded with an off-color joke when pressed by the women for the addition to the contract for affirmative action and improved sickness and accident coverage. With the election in 1982 of Church's opponent, Richard Trumpka, UMWA's support for women miners changed substantially. UMWA women strongly supported his candidacy. The union officially endorsed the CEP Annual Conference, and Trumpka was the keynote speaker in 1983. Trumpka approved excused absences for women to attend CEP conferences and sent letters to local unions urging them to send women to the conferences. Job loss in the nineties At the close of the 1980s, women in coal mining peaked at about 4,000, four percent of the total. In the 1990s, the demand for coal decreased, mechanization in underground mining increased, and production in surface strip mining increased. These factors led to widespread layoffs. CEP, at its 1990 national meeting, held sessions on options for displaced miners meeting women's needs based on changes in the industry. Noted by an Illinois miner, ‚Äú...no one wants to hire women anymore; they don‚Äôt even make excuses about why it‚Äôs done on seniority alone.‚Äù The ‚Äúlast hired first fired‚Äù practice meant that thousands of women lost their jobs. In 1996, the number of women miners had dropped to about a thousand. Media Coverage Appalshop, a media group in Whitesburg, Kentucky produced a film Coalmining Women in 1982. CEP staff as well as well as women miners and support groups started by CEP are featured throughout the film. Interviewed at home and on the job, the women miners talk about why they sought these jobs. They also tell of the problems encountered once hired. CEP Archives In August 2013 a reunion of CEP staff, women miners (current and former) and their supporters was held in Jonesborough, TN. Attendees were from the U.S., Canada, and England. During the reunion a visit to Eastern Tennessee State University (ETSU) was planned. The Coal Employment Project records are archived at the Center for Appalachian Studies and Services at ETSU.

In the following years the club played variably until the season 1971‚Äì72, when lead by manager Ivica Petkoviƒá took the first place in the Sarajevo zone, gaining the right to play in the Yugoslav Second League (Group South). In the 1973‚Äì74 season, the club got relegated back to the republic league. =Golden years= At the beginning of the Bosnian War, the club stopped all of its activities.

He was also one of the founders of the study of international health.  Early life  Baker was born the son of Frank A. Baker, former president of National Sash Weight Corp, and Alice Candler Baker, a landscape artist, in Baltimore, Maryland. Baker was raised in Mount Washington. Baker credited his desire to travel the world as a physician after reading a book about an American doctor who had practiced worldwide when he was still just 12 years old. In 1942, Baker began at Johns Hopkins University studying chemical engineering, but after taking time off from his studies to serve in World War II in the United States Air Force on an assignment in the base's hospital in 1943 after an oversupply of would-be pilots grounded him, his interest returned to medicine.  Education  Baker earned a bachelor's degree from Johns Hopkins University in 1948. He then earned his medical degree from the University of Maryland in 1952, followed by a master's degree in public health from the Johns Hopkins University School of Hygiene and Public Health in 1954. Baker then pursued advanced medical training at St. Bartholomew's Hospital in London and at the University of Maryland Hospital before completing his residency at the New York Department of Public Health.  Career  Baker began his career in public health in New York State as a district health officer. In 1959, Baker returned to Johns Hopkins as an Assistant Professor of Public Health Administration and Assistant Dean of the School of Public Health. In the decade that followed, he co-founded the world's first academic department of international health with Ernest Lyman Stebbins (which opened in 1961) and also founded the general preventive medicine residency program. Baker built the department of international health with then-chair Carl E. Taylor and professor William Reinke, while also playing an instrumental role in establishing one of Johns Hopkins' first endowed professorships, now the Edgar Berman Professorship in International Health. Baker served on the governing council of the American Public Health Association and also was the chair of both the epidemiology and the international health sections for the APHA. Over the course of his career, he served on the editorial boards of American Journal of Public Health, Health Services Research, Journal of Family and Community Medicine, and Maryland Medical Journal.  International career  Baker's first international experiences came when he went to combat malaria in India and Ceylon (present-day Sri Lanka). During the 1950s, Baker became an assistant chief of the Health Division for the U.S. Technical Cooperation Mission (which later became USAID) and helped convince Indian government officials to increase spending on the malaria eradication campaign. He was a highly sought-after health systems consultant to state governments and national governments on five continents, as his career spanned 50 years and included work in more than 40 countries. In fact, Baker consulted for the health systems of four state governments and 24 national governments on five continents He was also a pioneer in conducting the first health workforce studies across South America as well as in Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, and Vietnam. Between 1986 and 1993, he served as the founding director of the Hubert H. Humphrey Fellowship Program at the Johns Hopkins University School of Hygiene and Public Health, which trained senior foreign health professionals. Baker is often credited as being one of the first people to recognize the importance of injury as a cause of disability when trying to understand the burden of disease, especially in developing countries.  Awards and honors  In 1993, Baker received the Lifetime Achievement Award from the American Public Health Association. In 2014, the Delta Omega honorary public health society established the Dr. Timothy Baker Award for International Health Development.  Personal life  Baker was married to Susan Pardee Baker, a pioneer in injury prevention and founder of the Johns Hopkins Center for Injury Research and Policy. He had two sons, Timothy D. Baker Jr. and David Baker, and one daughter, Susan L. Baker. He also had two grandchildren, Timothy and Daniel.

Kubelka used intricate editing strategies to produce a work about anti- colonialism. Production Director Peter Kubelka in 2015 =Photography= Kubelka was hired in 1961 by a couple from Wels, Austria, to document a hunting trip they were taking with three other people. The group traveled from Wels through Yugoslavia to Athens, Greece. From there, they took a ship to Cairo, Egypt and traveled up the Nile. Over the course of the trip, Kubelka recorded three hours of film and fourteen hours of audio. He shot on Gevaert color positive stock. Since the film stock was sensitive to overexposure, he often intentionally underexposed it. Kubelka used simple compositions whose quick recognizability became useful as part of his elaborate editing strategies. =Editing= Once the group returned to Vienna, the couple who commissioned the film expected Kubelka would take four to six weeks to complete the film; however, the process ended up lasting five years. Kubelka produced what he described as a \\"vocabulary\\" from his recordings. Without money to create a workprint, he worked from a black-and-white negative. He cut out three frames from each shot and placed them on a card, arranging them by color, rhythm, subject, and theme. There were roughly 1,400 shots in total. For each of the audio recordings, he transcribed the sounds phonetically into a version of a symphonic score. Kubelka initially worked from an editing table belonging to a correspondent for a foreign news service. It became apparent to his financiers that the film he was making was radically different from the film they were expecting from him. In a compromise with their lawyers, Kubelka agreed to give them all material he did not use in his version. In 1964 Jerome Hill gave him a grant to go to the United States and spend two years working on the film. After returning to Vienna, he found that was unable to make optical sound on 16 mm film. Stan Brakhage arranged for him to deliver a lecture in Denver, where Brakhage's lab Western Cine was able to print the film. =Soundtrack= Kubelka did not do any audio mixing on the film, so all of the sound on Our Trip to Africa was recorded live. He incorporated dialogue, music, and intermittent gunfire. He recorded live music as well as songs broadcast on the radio, with clips of contemporary pop songs, British dancehall music, Egyptian tango, and the score of Around the World in 80 Days. Kubelka's editing was designed to create \\"synch events\\" in which image and sound are combined in unique ways. He cited Dziga Vertov and Luis Bu√±uel as predecessors in his use of juxtaposition in image and sound. Themes The editing strategies of Our Trip to Africa form a rendering of colonial exploitation. The violence of hunting wild game is mixed with other footage, suggesting violence against other subjects of the camera. The film's final sequence, in which an indigenous man remarks \\"I like to visit your country if I find chance\\", is intended to address the asymmetric relationship between ethnographers and their subjects. Release and reception In 1966 Kubelka premiered the completed film for the people who commissioned the film, along with friends and other artists. Upset with how they were portrayed, they nearly attacked him after the screening. Their lawyers demanded that he turn over the film so they could destroy it; the parties reached an agreement that Kubelka would not screen Our Trip to Africa in their hometown. Our Trip to Africa is now part of Anthology Film Archives' Essential Cinema Repertory collection. In the 2012 Sight & Sound poll, the film received votes from two film critics and two directors. Michael Finnissy's 1998 composition Unsere Afrikareise takes its title from Kubelka's film.

Moody is a scholar, author, teacher, public speaker, Abenaki Repatriation and Site Protection Coordinator, and the Director of the Winter Center for Indigenous Traditions. Repatriation and Site Protection Coordinator Moody served as the Repatriation and Site Protection Coordinator for the Abenaki Nation from September 1994 to December 2013. This meant working with state agencies in New Hampshire and Vermont, federal agencies, museums, colleges/universities and private holding entities to recover, repatriate, and reinter ancestral remains, grave goods, and items of cultural patrimony for the Abenaki Nation. Over those nineteen years, Moody also worked to foster positive and productive communications between the Abenaki Nation and the many universities throughout New England that currently reside in the homelands of the Abenaki and other related indigenous peoples. At the University of New Hampshire in Durham, Moody established a relationship in October 1994 with Robert G. Goodby, anthropology professor and president of the New Hampshire Archeological Society. This later led to the discovery of the remains of three individuals by Goodby in 1996, which had been lost in the attic of the UNH Archaeology Lab since their excavation from an archaeological site in Seabrook, New Hampshire, in 1975. From 1997 to 2017, Dr. Moody and ethno-historian John Moody designed and managed the first exhaustive research and repatriation project in Abenaki country on the extensive UNHAC (University of New Hampshire Archaeological Collection), which resulted in the identification of several more human remains, numerous additional grave goods, and sacred items, many of which were repatriated to the Abenaki Nation. An historic, best practices, long-term research and curation set of protocols were developed in collaboration with the UNH Archaeological Department and administration to carefully and collaboratively manage the UNHAC. Since the Abenaki Nation is only federally recognized in Canada, Moody had to manage several additional steps to facilitate a number of NAGPRA (Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act)-mandated repatriations to the Abenaki Nation. In three of the more recent repatriations, the NAGPRA Review Committee also requested that the Abenaki Nation receive letters of support to repatriate from the Wampanoag Confederation and Wabanaki tribes of Maine. Then she worked to create a broad coalition of Abenaki groups. This directly led to the New Hampshire Division of Historic Resources' repatriation of the three lost individuals' remains to the Abenaki Nation in 2002, along with the remains of 14 other individuals from other sites across New England. This process led to the repatriation of numerous Abenaki burials, grave goods, and sacred items from several museums, universities, state, and federal agencies including the University of New Hampshire, Franklin Pierce University, Harvard University, Dartmouth College, the University of Vermont, the NHDHR, the Vermont Division for Historic Preservation, and the United States Natural Resource Conservation Service. It also has made it possible to rebury and protect Abenaki remains and burial grounds, as well as numerous sacred places in the Abenaki homeland. In addition, Dr. Moody and the Abenaki Nation coalition partners including Dr. David Stewart Smith have facilitated the repatriation of several sets of Indigenous remains, numerous grave goods, and thousands of sacred items to several other Native Nations and Confederacies including the Penobscot Nation, the Seneca Nation, the Haudenausaunee, and the Chickasaw Nation of Oklahoma. Dr Moody and the Abenaki Nation coalition have also facilitated the reburial of several non-Native sets of remains and associated grave goods in Bradford and Etna, New Hampshire. Winter Center for Indigenous Traditions Moody founded the WCIT (Winter Center for Indigenous Traditions) with her husband John Moody in 1997, and is currently the director. The WCIT is based in the Upper Valley region of Vermont and New Hampshire, and is a service non-profit created for the purpose of strengthening and sustaining Native communities. The WCIT Archives, Library, and Research Center works to forward the ethical accessibility of indigenous people's documents, records, oral histories, and videos. These archives are used as a public educational resource and for the purposes of site protection and repatriation, historical studies, educational and indigenous language survival, and informational programs for the public.

Although it was actually in force only for two brief periods, 1822-23 and 1836-38, it was fundamental to the history of democracy in Portugal. It was replaced by the Constitutional Charter of 1826. Origins The constitution was the result of the work of the Constituent Cortes of 1820, convened after the Liberal Revolution. The Cortes began its work in January 1821 and concluded after king Jo√£o VI of Portugal swore allegiance to it in October 1822. Key elements Considered as generally progressive for its time, the constitution was largely inspired by the Spanish Constitution of 1812 as well as by the French Constitution of 1791. It was divided into six sections and 240 articles. Among its key principles were: * enshrining individual rights and duties for all citizens, with human rights such as individual liberty, equality before the law, and property rights guaranteed. * establishing the nation of all Portuguese people as the basis for national sovereignty, which resided with and was to be exercised by duly elected the Cortes. * defining the territory of the nation, the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves, constituted by the Kingdom of Portugal, the ‚ÄúAdjacent Islands‚Äù of Madeira and the Azores, the Kingdom of Brazil and the territories in Africa and Asia. * removing the feudal privileges of the Clergy and the Nobility. * the separation of powers between executive, judiciary and legislature. * establishing that the Cortes was to be elected by the nation, and that legislative power, through the Cortes, was supreme. * reducing the powers of the king under a constitutional monarchy * United monarchy with Brazil * no religious freedom - the Catholic faith was declared to be the sole religion of the Portuguese nation. Legislative power resided with the unicameral Cortes, elected by the nation every two years. Executive power was exercised by the king, as head of the government. He could exercise a suspensive veto over decisions of the Cortes, but could not suspend or dissolve the Cortes itself. The constitution provided for a State Council, elected by the Cortes, who could advise the king alongside his ministers. Judicial power was exercised exclusively by the courts. Article 34 of the constitution granted the vote to all men aged 25 or over who could read and write, who voted directly for representatives in the Cortes (the indirect elections practised until this time were abolished). Women, the illiterate, members of religious orders and servants were not permitted to vote. At this time 80% of Portuguese people could not read, so the franchise was far from ‚Äòuniversal‚Äô. Impact The constitutional monarchy established under the constitution faced a number of challenges. It only remained in effect for two short periods! The first from its approval on 23 September 1822 to 3 June 1823, when Jo√£o VI suspended it during the Vilafrancada uprising and never, despite his promise, reintroduced it. The second was between 10 September 1836 when the September Revolution broke out and 20 March 1838, when a new constitution was approved. When news of the new constitution reached Brazil, it prompted the country‚Äôs Declaration of Independence.

During the First World War, Davies worked with the Admiralty on tanker transportation and was rewarded with the Order of the British Empire. Career A barque in 1878 Born in Pembrokeshire, Wales, Davies went to sea in 1875, shipping as a boy in a Welsh barque. He got his Master's Certificate in 1885 and his Extra Master's Certificate in 1887, bringing with it the title of master mariner. He quickly specialized in the new business of moving bulk oil across the Atlantic and around the world, which led to his observations on the expansion of oils in tankers. In 1903 he published his work, with other seafaring information, for the use of his fellow tanker officers.\\"The Late Captain Wm.

Shevenell is an American marine geologist who specializes in high- latitude paleoclimatology and paleoceanography. She is currently an Associate Professor in the College of Marine Science at the University of South Florida. She has made notable contributions to understanding the history of the Antarctic ice sheets and published in high-impact journals and, as a result, was awarded full membership of Sigma Xi. She has a long record of participation in international ocean drilling programs and has served in leadership positions of these organizations. Shevenell is the elected Geological Oceanography Council Member for The Oceanography Society (2019-2021).  Early life and education  Shevenell earned a bachelor's degree in Geology and Studio Art at Hamilton College in New York State. Shevenell worked as a laboratory technician and environmental scientist in Juneau, Alaska, before attending the University of California, Santa Barbara, where she studied Antarctic ice sheet evolution and paleoceanography and earned her Ph.D. in Marine Science (2004). Shevenell was a postdoctoral fellow at the Program on Climate Change at the University of Washington School of Oceanography. From 2007‚Äì2011, Shevenell was a lecturer in Earth Sciences and Geography at University College London. In 2011, Shevenell joined the faculty of the University of South Florida College of Marine Science, earning tenure in 2017.  Career and impact  Amelia Shevenell's research is aimed at the evolution of Antarctica's ice sheets over the last 65 million years. Shevenell uses the sedimentological, geochemical, and micropaleontological properties of marine sediments from the deep-sea and Antarctica's continental margins to reconstruct relationships between Antarctica's ice sheets and Earth's oceans, carbon cycle, and climate on million - to decadal timescales. Shevenell's research is relevant to Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) concerns that ongoing oceanic and atmospheric warming is accelerating polar ice cap melting and global sea level rise. She has participated in eight oceanographic expeditions to the Southern Ocean, several of which are featured in her scientific blogs. Antarctic ice sheet development during the Cenozoic. Shevenell's research has focused on Antarctic ice sheet development in the Miocene when a spurt of expansion occurred. Her work discovered that Southern Ocean cooling during the Middle Miocene Climate Transition occurred before the expansion of Antarctica's ice sheets at ~14 million years ago. Shevenell has since shown that progressive ice sheet expansion on Antarctica began around 16 million years ago, during the Miocene Climatic Optimum, when average global temperatures were warmer than present. Ice growth was paced by changes the eccentricity of Earth's orbit around the sun. Another study established that glaciers reached the Sabrina Coast of East Antarctica by at least the late Paleocene to early Eocene.Gulick, S.P.S., Shevenell, A.E., Montelli, A., Fernandez, R., Smith, C., Warny, S., Bohaty, S., Sjunneskog, C., Leventer, A., Fredrick, B., and D. Blankenship, 2017. Initiation and long‚Äìterm instability of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet. Nature 552, 225-229. This finding was counter to earlier studies that placed the beginning of ice expansion in Antarctica at the start of the Oligocene roughly 34 million years ago. Carbon cycling in high-latitude oceans. In a study of Holocene marine sediments in the western Pacific Shevenell found evidence for increased upwelling in the North Pacific. The increased upwelling was caused by stronger winds, which in turn released more CO2 into the atmosphere enhancing global warming during the Holocene and the shrinkage of ice sheets. Thus, demonstrating that a possible cause of the warming was a change in ocean circulation. Holocene ocean temperature and climate evolution of the western Antarctic Peninsula. TEX86 proxy analysis of sediments from the western Antarctic Peninsula continental shelf documented the changing influence of warm Circumpolar Deep Water on regional glacier and sea ice extent since the last deglaciation, ~13,000 years ago. Cooling rather than warming occurred, driven by changes in local solar irradiance associated with changes in Earth's orbit. At present, atmospheric connections to the tropical Pacific allow warm ocean waters to move onto Antarctica's continental shelves, melting regional glaciers. Shevenell's research indicates this process has occurred in past warm climate intervals, and will likely continue as Earth's climate continues to warm. Participation in scientific ocean drilling. Shevenell is involved in scientific ocean drilling and has worked both as an onshore laboratory scientist and twice as a shipboard scientist on seven Ocean Drilling Program/International Ocean Discovery Program (ODP/IODP) expeditions. She participated as a sedimentologist on ODP Leg 189 to the South Tasman Rise. This expedition tested the hypothesis Antarctic Ice Sheets developed in association with the development of the Southern Ocean and the Antarctic Circumpolar Current. Shevenell led the sedimentology group on IODP Expedition 374 to the central Ross Sea, Antarctica. This Expedition was designed to understand the factors influencing ice sheet development over the last 20 million years including the formation and history of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet. Shevenell has also served within the leadership of the IODP Scientific Advisory Structure, as a member of the Science Evaluation Panel (2011-2014) and the United States Advisory Committee for Scientific Ocean Drilling (2014-2018).  Honors and recognition  In 2006, Shevenell was awarded the Storrs Cole Memorial Research Award of the Geological Society of America for her publications on invertebrate micropaleontology. Based upon her scientific ocean drilling research, Shevenell was selected as an IODP Distinguished Lecturer for 2014‚Äì2015. Lecturers are nominated by the scientific ocean drilling community and selected by the United States Science Support Office for ocean drilling. Distinguished lecturers visit institutions that are not typically involved in ocean drilling and may not have funds to host visiting speakers. In 2016, Shevenell was recognized by American Geophysical Union (AGU) journal editors as an AGU Outstanding Reviewer for Geophysical Research Letters. In 2019, Shevenell was elected as a Full Member of Sigma Xi, the scientific research honor society. Her Nature paper, Gulick and Shevenell et al. was featured as a cover image by the journal and highlighted in its News and Views section.  Media coverage  The significance of Shevenall's work to the understanding of changes affecting the Antarctic ice sheets have been featured in Discover Magazine, National Geographic, and Reuters. Her research is featured in an episode of the Forecast Podcast a podcast about climate science and climate scientists with Nature‚Äôs editor for climate science, Michael White. Shevenell also maintains a blog for Antarctic research cruises on ice breaker Laurence Gould LMG12-11 (October, 2012); LMG13-11 (October 2013); icebreaker Nathaniel Palmer NBP14-02 (January‚ÄìMarch, 2014), and IODP Expedition 374 (January‚ÄìMarch, 2018).

He graduated in law from the Albertina University of K√∂nigsberg, and became an assessor at the Civil Tribunal, and then a sub-prosecutor at the Court of Appeal of the Duchy of Warsaw. After the establishment of the Congress Poland in 1815, he started a legal practice and participated in the trials at the cassation Supreme Court as a legal representative. In political trials, he defended Polish conspirators who acted against Russian domination in the Congress Poland. In the first trial of the Patriotic Society, Tarczewski defended Miko≈Çaj Dobrzycki. In the second trial, he was a representative of Stanis≈Çaw So≈Çtyk, the president of the Patriotic Society, and made So≈Çtyk was given pardon. His speeches and pleadings were printed and publicized. In 1820s, he was a member of the Governmental Committee of Internal Affairs and Police of the Kingdom of Poland. Together with his wife Aleksandra n√©e Ta≈Ñska, he ran a popular salon in Warsaw. At the end of the November Uprising he was a candidate for the Minister of Justice in the National Government. He refused to accept the position.  Biography  He was born in 1782, coming from middle nobility. His father, Maciej Tarczewski, was a burgrave of the town Wyszogr√≥d, leaseholder of the villages Kad≈Çubowo, ≈ªoch√≥w and ≈ªoch√≥wka, and died around 1790, survived by his wife, J√≥zefa n√©e Ta≈Ñska (who died only after 1830), the mother of Marceli. Marceli was the nephew of writer Ignacy Ta≈Ñski. He had a younger sister, Dominika J√≥zefa Cyryla (c. 1783 ‚Äì after 1821), the wife of Grzegorz Doma≈Ñski (a laborer and former soldier); and brothers Bruno Placyd Franciszek (born 1786) and Ferdynand (1788‚Äì1827), owner of Mas≈ÇomiƒÖca. After the death of Maciej Tarczewski, Marceli's mother J√≥zefa married Wincenty Ferreriusz Kraszewski (c. 1752‚Äì1830), the ensign of the National Cavalry. Marceli Tarczewski graduated in law from the Albertina University of K√∂nigsberg in 1805, and came back to Warsaw, where in 1809 he was appointed an assessor at the Civil Tribunal of the First Instance of the Warsaw Department of the Duchy of Warsaw (Trybuna≈Ç Cywilny I Instancji Departamentu Warszawskiego). On August 13, 1812, he passed the judge's exam before the Supreme Examination Commission and since then served as the sub-prosecutor of the Court of Appeal. From 1811 he was a member of the masonic lodge Temple of Izis (≈öwiƒÖtynia Izys). After the establishment of the Congress Poland in 1815, Tarczewski changed his activity to legal practice. In 1816 he became a legal representative at the Supreme Court (SƒÖd Najwy≈ºszej Instancji), participating in trials as a representative of aristocratic families. From 1818 until 1830 he was a plenipotent of the Tax Department (Wydzia≈Ç Skarbowy) and the Treasury Department (Kasa) of the Municipal Office (UrzƒÖd Municypalny) of the capital city of Warsaw. From 1823 until 1830 he was an assessor at the General Council for Monitoring Hospitals (Rada Og√≥lna Dozorcza Szpitali). As a member of the Governmental Committee of Internal Affairs and Police (Komisja RzƒÖdowa Spraw Wewnƒôtrznych i Policji) of the Congress Poland, he was active in the City Committee (Komisja Miast) and was also a legal advisor in the General Secretariat (Sekretariat Generalny, 1824‚Äì1830). In 1820, together with Jan Olrych Szaniecki, he made an unsuccessful attempt to establish an agricultural and commercial association in Pi≈Ñcz√≥w. The project of this organization later became the prototype of the Land Credit Society (Towarzystwo Kredytowe Ziemskie) established by Franciszek Ksawery Drucki-Lubecki. In 1826, acting on behalf of Aniela Paulina Pop≈Çawska, the illegitimate daughter of banker Maciej ≈Åyszkiewicz, Tarczewski won the trial to drop ≈Åyszkiewicz. In 1827 he participated in the trial to take over the part of the Pi≈Ñcz√≥w Ordinance on the behalf of Jan Olrych Szaniecki. In the spring of 1827 Tarczewski found himself among the founders of the publishing company A. Ga≈Çƒôzowski Printing House and Company (Drukarnia A. Ga≈Çƒôzowskiego i Kompania). The printing house issued one hundred and sixteen items within ten years, including the series of Polish Writers' Library (nineteen volumes) and the Themis legal magazine. In May 1827, Tarczewski bought the indebted estates of Komor√≥w and Soko≈Ç√≥w, with the foundation privileges of the parish in Pƒôcice, from Ignacy Sobolewski, the Minister of Justice of the Kingdom of Poland. Tarczewski was a representative in political processes, defending Polish conspirators who were against Russian domination. In the first trial of the Patriotic Society, Tarczewski defended Miko≈Çaj Dobrzycki. In the second trial, ran on the forum of the Sejm, he was a defender of the president of the Patriotic Society, Stanis≈Çaw So≈Çtyk. For firm statements in this trial, Tarczewski was punished with a reprimand, accused of the offence of prosecutor Onufry Wyczechowski. Nevertheless, as a defender, he proved effective; he pointed to numerous formal failures, and in effect obtained an acquittal, approved at the beginning of 1829 by Tsar Nicholas I. The speeches of Tarczewski were published in the Collection of Speeches and Documents of the Sejm Process (Zbi√≥r m√≥w i dokument√≥w procesu sejmowego, 1828). Tarczewski was a deputy censor in the Warsaw Savings Society (Towarzystwo Oszczƒôdno≈õci) from 1828 until 1830 . After the outbreak of the November Uprising, on December 29, 1830, dictator J√≥zef Ch≈Çopicki appointed Tarczewski to a commission that was to recognize documents concerning people suspected of spying. The head of the commisiion was castellan Micha≈Ç Potocki. The commission operated until March 12, 1831. Shortly before the capitulation of Warsaw, on the evening of September 7, 1831, after the dismissal of General Jan Krukowiecki from the position of the President of the National Government, Tarczewski refused to take the post of Minister of Justice in the government of Bonawentura Niemojowski. On May 24, 1833, he was appointed by the Administrative Council as a member of the Main Council of the Welfare of Charitable Institutions (Rada G≈Ç√≥wna Opieku≈Ñcza Instytut√≥w Dobroczynnych). He held this position for the next decade, until his death in 1843. From 1835, he headed the Legal Section in the Government Commission of Internal and Spiritual Affairs (Komisja RzƒÖdowa Spraw Wewnƒôtrznych i Duchownych). In 1836, he was suspected of selling illegal prints from A. Ga≈Çƒôzowski Printing House and sending the money he received from this title to his brother-in-law, Karol Boromeusz Hoffman, who was staying in exile. He was therefore questioned by Russian authorities and in 1837 he was under police surveillance. A. Ga≈Çƒôzowski Printing House was closed. Tarczewski was the co-author of the Regulations in Force When Carrying Out Court Medical Investigations on Corpses (Przepisy obowiƒÖzujƒÖce przy wykonaniu sƒÖdowo lekarskich dochodze≈Ñ na trupach , 1840). In 1841, he proved himself noble in the Kingdom of Poland. After the liquidation of the Supreme Court in 1842, he became a legal representative at the Warsaw Departments of the Governing Senate. In the years 1842‚Äì1843, he had a dispute with the parish priest W. Litwinowicz about church lands. Tarczewski was married to his cousin Aleksandra n√©e Ta≈Ñska (1792‚Äì1850), the daughter of Ignacy Ta≈Ñski and Marianna n√©e Czempi≈Ñska, contributor to magazine Rozrywki dla Dzieci (Entertainment for Children), co-founder of the Union of Patriotic Charity of the Varsovian (ZwiƒÖzek Dobroczynno≈õci Patriotycznej Warszawianek) during the November Uprising. Their wedding, that took place on September 17, 1816, was a subject of Bogna Wernichowska's popular book on ‚Äûmemorable weddings‚Äù of Polish nobility (1990). Aleksandra Ta≈Ñska, like her sister Klementyna, has been writing a memoir, which was published as The Story of My Life. Memories of a Varsovian (Historia mego ≈ºycia. Wspomnienia warszawianki) by Ossolineum in 1967, more than one hundred years after Ta≈Ñska's death. Together with his wife Tarczewski ran a popular salon in Warsaw. His sister- in-law, Klementyna Hoffmanowa, issued a high grade for his moral stance. Marceli and Aleksandra Tarczewscy had twelve children (of whom more than half died in childhood or early youth): Ignacy Juliusz (1818‚Äì1819), W≈Çadys≈Çaw Wojciech Jozafat (born 1819), Helena Katarzyna (1820‚Äì1845), the wife of Aleksander Radwan, real state councilor; Kazimierz Maciej (1822‚Äì1872), an official of the Bank of Poland; Gustaw Jan (1822 ‚Äì after 1864), a staff cavalry master of the Russian army who was the organizer of the uprising in Bia≈Ça Podlaska, for which he was sent to exile; Maria Stefania (born in 1823), married to J√≥zef Konstanty Grodzicki; Marcjana Stanis≈Çaw Jana de Matha (born 1825); Ignacy Onufry Antoni (1826‚Äì1829); Maria Regina (1826‚Äì1827); Maria Klementyna (1828‚Äì1828); Aleksandra Wincent (1830‚Äì1836) and Adam Jan Hieronim (1832‚Äì1833). Marceli Tarczewski also brought up his younger stepbrother, Jan Kraszewski. Tarczewski died in Warsaw on August 31, 1843. He was buried two days later, on September 2 at the cemetery in Pƒôcice. Aleksandra Tarczewska as a widow became a lifetime owner of the Komorow estate, which after her death was auctioned.

The cyclone also caused significant damage in the Comoro Islands and Tanzania. The fourteenth tropical storm, record-breaking tenth tropical cyclone, and tenth intense tropical cyclone of the 2018‚Äì19 South-West Indian Ocean cyclone season, Kenneth formed from a vortex that the M√©t√©o-France office on La R√©union (MFR) first mentioned on 17 April. The MFR monitored the system over the next several days, before designating it as Tropical Disturbance 14 on 21 April. The disturbance was located in a favorable environment to the north of Madagascar, which allowed it to strengthen into a tropical depression and later a tropical storm, both on the next day. The storm then began a period of rapid intensification, ultimately peaking as an intense tropical cyclone with 10-minute sustained winds of 215 km/h (130 mph) and a minimum central pressure of 934 hPa (27.58 inHg). At that time, Kenneth began to undergo an eyewall replacement cycle and weakened slightly, before making landfall later that day as an intense tropical cyclone. As a result of land interaction, Kenneth became disorganised as it made landfall and rapidly degenerated thereafter. The storm then shifted southward, with the MFR cancelling all major warnings for inland cities. Kenneth was reclassified as an overland depression after landfall, with the MFR issuing its warning at midnight UTC on 26 April. Thunderstorm activity developed off the coast of Mozambique on 27 April as the system began drifting northward. Kenneth re-emerged off the coast of northern Mozambique on 28 April, before dissipating on the next day. Prior to Kenneth's landfall, local authorities evacuated over 30,000 people in the path of the storm in northern Mozambique. Kenneth killed at least 52 people in total; in the country of Comoros; Kenneth's wind and rainfall caused at least seven deaths, while 45 people were killed in Mozambique. Damage is currently estimated at $100 million (2019 USD). Meteorological history On 17 April, the MFR began monitoring a vortex to the north of Madagascar. The MFR continued to monitor the system over the next several days, noting a significant increase in deep convection on 21 April. On 22 April at 12:00 UTC, the MFR began issuing advisories on the system, designating it as Tropical Disturbance 14. Soon after, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a tropical cyclone formation alert, noting that the disturbance was located in a favorable environment with low vertical wind shear and warm sea surface temperatures of . Early on 23 April, the JTWC began issuing warnings on the system, classifying it as Tropical Cyclone 24S. A few hours later, the MFR upgraded the system to a tropical depression while it was moving west, under the influence of a low-to-mid-level ridge located to the south. The MFR upgraded the depression to a moderate tropical storm at 12:00 UTC, assigning the name Kenneth to the storm. At that time, the MFR stated that cloud top temperatures had decreased to and that the overall organization of the system had improved. Soon after being named, Kenneth began to rapidly intensify, with the JTWC noting that a formative eye feature had developed. Around 00:00 UTC on 24 April, the MFR upgraded the system to a severe tropical storm. A few hours later, the JTWC followed suit, upgrading Kenneth to the equivalent of a Category 1 hurricane on the Saffir‚ÄìSimpson hurricane wind scale. At 12:00 UTC, Kenneth was upgraded by the MFR into the record-breaking tenth tropical cyclone of the season. At that time, the MFR stated that an eye was attempting to form within the central dense overcast of the storm, and that wind shear was beginning to decrease. Around 18:00 UTC, Kenneth strengthened into the equivalent of a Category 3 major hurricane. At that time, the Hahaya International Airport on the Comoros island of Grand Comore reported winds of while Kenneth was located about 55 km (35 mi) to the north. Six hours later, the MFR upgraded Kenneth to intense tropical cyclone status, noting that the storm had a very cold convective ring and that the core had become more compact. On 25 April, at 06:00 UTC, Kenneth reached peak intensity, with 10-minute sustained winds of 215 km/h (130 mph) and a minimum central pressure of 934 hPa (27.58 inHg). At that time, Kenneth had a pinhole eye surrounded by very strong convection; however, the storm also began to undergo an eyewall replacement cycle. Meanwhile, the JTWC estimated that Kenneth peaked as a Category 4-equivalent tropical cyclone, with 1-minute sustained winds of 230 km/h (145 mph). As Kenneth approached the Mozambique coastline, the system slowly began to weaken due to the eyewall replacement cycle and the frictional effects of land interaction. Later that day, at 13:15 UTC, Kenneth made landfall in Mozambique as an intense tropical cyclone, just north of Pemba, with 1-minute sustained winds of 220 km/h (140 mph), equivalent to a Category 4 hurricane. This made Kenneth the most intense landfalling tropical cyclone in the recorded history of Mozambique. This also marked the second time in Mozambique's recorded history in which two storms have made landfall during the same cyclone season at intense tropical cyclone intensity or higher. Satellite image of Cyclone Kenneth approaching the Comoro Islands on 24 April After landfall, Kenneth was re-classified as an overland depression, with 10-minute sustained winds of 155 km/h (100 mph), just below intense tropical cyclone strength. As the storm drifted further inland, it rapidly degenerated. Shortly afterward, the JTWC issued its last warning on the system. Kenneth's central convection had drastically shrunk, with only a small area remaining over land. Despite still being in a favorable atmospheric environment, Kenneth continued to rapidly weaken due to interaction with land. At 00:00 UTC on 26 April, the MFR issued its last warning on Kenneth, reporting 10-minute sustained winds of 65 km/h (40 mph), while the system was located about 110 km (70 mi) inland in Mozambique. Kenneth continued to weaken, with its winds falling below gale force as it continued its southward motion. On 27 April, thunderstorms developed off the coast of Mozambique, although the center of Kenneth remained over land, as the system began drifting northward. On 28 April, Kenneth emerged off the coast of northern Mozambique, but continued to weaken due to unfavorable conditions. Subsequently, Kenneth dissipated by 12:00 UTC on 29 April. Preparations and impact Overall, Kenneth killed at least 52 people and damage is estimated to be at least US$100 million. In the country of Comoros, Kenneth's winds and rains killed at least seven people and injured more than 200 others. Preliminary estimates state that approximately 60‚Äì80% of staple crops were destroyed. Kenneth struck Mozambique about a month after Cyclone Idai had devastated the southern part of the country, raising fears that the ongoing humanitarian crisis there could be worsened by the storm. Local authorities in northern Mozambique evacuated more than 30,000 people ahead of the storm, given the expected impacts. Cyclone Kenneth made landfall just north of Pemba, Mozambique on Thursday evening, 25 April, at about 4:15 p.m., local time (12:15 UTC), with 1-minute sustained winds of 220 km/h (140 mph). The IFRC reported widespread damage in the city, with power outages recorded throughout the city and numerous trees felled, which caused even more damage. In Mozambique, a total of 45 people were killed, including a woman who was killed by a falling coconut tree near Pemba. Additionally, four ships sank off the coast of the town of Palma. On Ibo Island, it was reported that 90% of the homes were destroyed. In Cabo Delgado Province, 2,500 homes were destroyed with multiple schools and hospitals also sustaining damage. Aftermath After the storm, the European Union released ‚Ç¨1.5 million (US$1.7 million) as an immediate assistance for those being affected by the cyclone in Mozambique and Comoros. The United Nations provided an emergency aid of $13 million to Mozambique and Comoros, which can help provide food and water, as well as repair the damaged infrastructure. The storm also resulted in a temporary reduction of violence amid the Islamist insurgency in Mozambique, though rebel attacks resumed in May 2019.

An ethnically pro-Germanic while anti-national ideology, particularly against the French nation; the movement had influenced German nationalists and intellectuals such as Richard Wagner and Friedrich Nietzsche. Historians have described Gobinism as becoming cult-like by the end of the nineteenth century, with powerful and influential followers, specifically in the Pan-Germanism movement. The Gobineau Association (Gobineau-Vereinigung) was founded in 1894 by Ludwig Schemann, who also made the first German translation of Gobineau's An Essay on the Inequality of the Human Races. Becoming popular in German intellectual cliques, particularly the Bayreuth Circle, in the phenomena that Walter Charles Langer described as \\"Gobineau Societies\\", Gobinism was later adapted by the likes of Houston Stewart Chamberlain and Alfred Rosenberg to forge elements of Nazi philosophy. Gobineau's antisemitism was emphasized within Gobinism to ideologically bridge to the later Nazi movement. Historians have made much of the significant philosophical gap between the pessimism of Gobineau himself, particularly his insistence that his vision was of mythical Aryans as a fallen and lost people, versus the optimism and themes of rejuvenation of the disciples and members of the Gobinism movement. It has been suggested that the spawning of Gobinism went on to majorly influence all future racial theories of the period. Nietzsche's √úbermensch was largely inspired by the movement. Some historians believe the influence of Gobinism was still affecting racial discourse into the mid-20th-century.

It was published by Activision for various computer platforms. British studio Foursfield developed a version for Amiga, Amstrad CPC, Atari ST, Commodore 64, and ZX Spectrum. It features three levels based on scenes from the film. Dynamix developed a separate version for the DOS, also based on the film. The non-DOS versions were praised for the graphics and audio, but criticized for long loading times, disk swapping, and the final level. The Amiga, Commodore 64, PC, and ZX Spectrum versions were the only versions released in the USA. Gameplay Ghostbusters II follows the plot of the film, in which the spirit of Vigo the Carpathian intends to enter the Earth world and take it over, by inhabiting the body of Oscar Barrett, the baby son of Dana Barrett. The player controls the Ghostbusters team as they try to stop Vigo. The DOS version of the game begins with the Ghostbusters battling the ghosts of the Scoleri brothers in a courtroom, as in the film. Subsequently, the player can choose to do various activities, which include hunting for ghosts to earn money. Three ghost-plagued locations can be played: Central Park, Northrones Department Store, and the Docks. In each location, the player blasts ghosts until they become trapped. The player must avoid slimeballs and fireballs thrown by the ghosts. The player can also collect slime samples from an abandoned underground train tunnel, but must avoid Slimer ghosts in the process. The collected slime is then tested with the use of a CD player. The slime is placed in a beaker and the player selects a song from the CD player; nine songs are available to choose from, and the player must select three calming songs to stabilize the slime. If the player chooses incorrectly, the slime explodes out of the beaker and the player must return to the train station to retrieve more slime. If the player loses a ghostbusting job or the slime challenge, then the player's Ghostbuster is sent to the Parkview mental ward. As one of the other Ghostbusters, the player can choose to rescue the institutionalized character from the ward. The player must earn $55,000 to take control of the Statue of Liberty, which is used to reach an art museum, where the Ghostbusters battle Vigo. The other computer versions ‚Äì Amiga, Amstrad CPC, Atari ST, Commodore 64 (C64), and ZX Spectrum ‚Äì feature three distinct levels based on scenes from the film. In the first level, Ray Stantz is lowered into a subway tunnel to collect slime, while using three different weapons to deter various spirits. The player swings back and forth while descending the tunnel to collect the slime. The player has a courage meter which depletes if ghosts attack the player character, thereby scaring him. A life is lost if the meter is drained completely. The second level is a side- scrolling shoot 'em up in which the Statue of Liberty walks along Broadway in New York. The player uses the statue's lit torch to shoot fireballs at oncoming ghosts, turning them into slime. The player also controls pedestrians who retrieve the slime in order to keep the torch lit. The third level is viewed from an isometric view, and begins with the Ghostbusters trying to safely slide down a rope to land inside the art museum. The player then alternates between the four Ghostbusters as they rescue Oscar and defeat Vigo. Development and release The DOS game was designed by Doug Barnett, and was developed by Dynamix, while the other versions were developed by Foursfield. Activision published all versions of the game, except for the MSX version, which was published by MCM Software S.A.Opening credits for each version of the game. The Oliver Twins programmed the Amstrad CPC and ZX Spectrum versions. The DOS version includes digitized voice tracks, while the other versions include digitized images from the film. The MSX version was only released in Spain as Cazafantasmas II, which was published by MCM Software S.A. In the United States, Activision planned to release the DOS, Commodore 64, and Amiga versions in October 1989. In the United Kingdom, the game was released in early December 1989. The Amiga version is divided among three different disks, while the Atari ST version was released as a four-disk game; this requires the player to swap disks at certain points in order to proceed through the game. The Amiga version received a budget re-release in late 1991, published by The Hit Squad. The ZX Spectrum version also received a 1991 budget re-release by Hit Squad. Reception David Wilson of Computer Gaming World wrote a mixed review of the DOS version. Wilson praised the graphics, the Statue of Liberty level, and the digitized voice tracks, and called the game \\"well-designed and easily learned.\\" However, Wilson wrote, \\"Since the game can be played in less than an hour and players will probably play the game, at least, fifteen times before mastering it, some may feel that this is less than a bargain.\\" =Non-DOS versions= The other computer versions of the game were generally praised for their graphics, and their audio, including the use of the \\"Ghostbusters\\" song. The final level was criticized, particularly for being anticlimatic, and for the difficulty in landing the Ghostbuster characters in the museum. Reviewers also criticized the long loading times, and the need to switch between several disks. Paul Glancey of Computer and Video Games considered it superior to the film and praised the gameplay, stating that the levels made good use of the film's action sequences. Amstrad Action also considered it better than the film, and wrote that the \\"good graphics immediately set this game apart\\" from typical film- license games, stating, \\"It captures a cartoonesque quality that manages to convey the comic aspects of the movie excellently.\\" The Games Machine stated that the game \\"is quite addictive and succeeds in capturing the atmosphere of the film.\\" Commodore Format praised the gameplay, while Mark Mainwood of Commodore User praised the game as a good film tie-in and stated that it would appeal to almost anyone. Andy Smith of Amiga Format called the game a \\"good translation of the film and a worthy successor\\" to the original Ghostbusters video game (1984). Sinclair User also considered it a good adaptation of the film. Brian Nesbitt of ACE wrote that the game \\"fails to succeed both as a film conversion and as a game in its own right.\\" Your Sinclair criticized the gameplay as repetitive and stated that the levels feel too distinct from each other with \\"no real feeling of progression\\". Mark Higham of ST Format considered the gameplay tedious and worse than the original Ghostbusters game. Writers for Zero criticized the gameplay in their review of the Amiga and Atari ST versions, while Zzap!64 criticized the gameplay and graphics of the C64 version. Amiga Computing wrote that while the game \\"is undoubtedly an audio-visual feast, there is little game in it that is fun to play.\\" Amiga User International stated that none of the levels were particularly addictive, and opined that the game \\"offers pretty poor value for money\\" considering that the player's \\"only motivation is to see the following stage\\". Reviewers for Amiga Action criticized the minimal number of levels. In 1991, Amiga Power called the game a \\"disgrace\\" and wrote, \\"Almost everything you could possibly do in Ghostbusters II called for a disk swap - even getting killed on the very first level - and the playing-time-to-time-spent-buggering-around-with-disks ratio was so completely ridiculous that some people thought they'd been sold a demo version by mistake.\\" The following year, Amiga Powers Stuart Campbell reviewed the re-release and criticized the gameplay as \\"lame and uninspired\\". Games-X also reviewed the re-release and called the game a \\"fairly impressive film conversion\\".

Webfeats, 319 F.3d 770, 778 (6th Cir. 2003) was a United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit case concerning trademark infringement under the Lanham Act due to the unauthorized use of a domain name and website. The appellate court held that Taubman's trademark infringement claim did not have a likelihood of success and that the use of the company's mark in the domain name was an exhibition of Free Speech. Taubman Co. v. Webfeats became the first federal appellate court case that addressed the phenomenon of \\"cybergriping\\". The legal battle also evolved into a civil liberties case, attracting the attention of organizations such as the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and the nonprofit advocacy group Public Citizen.  Facts  Taubman Company Limited Partnership announced that it is building a shopping mall called The Shops at Willow Bend at Plano, Texas. When Henry Mishkoff heard of the construction, which was near his home, he created a Website using a domain called shopsatwillowbend.com. It featured information about the mall, including maps directing visitors to its shops. Taubman company immediately filed a lawsuit before the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan and sent Mishkoff a cease-and-desist letter after learning of the existence of the latter's website. Mishkoff, who is a web developer, responded to the legal maneuver by registering new websites with derogatory domain names such as theshopatwillowbendsucks.com and taubmansucks.com. The plaintiff also asked the court to stop Mishkoff from using the web names attached to sucks.com. It is considered as a \\"complaint name\\" and the process is also known as \\"cybergriping\\", a phenomenon described as an Internet buzzword for a website that criticizes organizations, individuals, products, and services. The federal district court granted the plaintiff's petition for preliminary injunction and ordered the defendant to cease and desist from using the shopsatwillowbend.com domain and website as well as the other registered gripe domains. Mishkoff appealed the case to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit.  Ruling  According to the Court of Appeals, Mishkoff erred in claiming two assignments of error: that the U.S. District Court did not have jurisdiction over him; and, that the plaintiff's trademark claim will not succeed because it cannot demonstrate customer confusion regarding the origin of Taubman and Mishkoff's products. However, the court dissolved the lower court's injunctions. It ruled that Taubman's mark in Mishkoff's website is purely an exhibition of Free Speech and not a violation cited in the Lanham Act. The court acknowledged that defendant's websites might lead to economic damage but his right to do so is protected by the First Amendment, particularly since it falls under critical commentary without any confusion as to the source.

A serial entrepreneur, she formed her first company at 29; she now owns rehabilitation company Allstar Therapy, family entertainment business Blue Fox Enterprises, and medical testing company Swallowing Diagnostics.  Early life and education  Wilson-Foley graduated from Farmington High School in 1977. Wilson-Foley received a B.S. from Ithaca College in 1981, a masters in Public Health from Yale University 1988, and a degree in Executive Managed Care Division from the University of Connecticut in 1997. She received her doctorate from University of Montana in 2013.  Personal life and family She met her husband Brian Foley while in grad school; he was one of her professors. Together they have a blended family with seven children. At the age of 40 she had a golf handicap of 21.  Business career  A serial entrepreneur she formed her first company at 29. In 1997 she sold her original healthcare businesses and as a result of an agreement she was prohibited from re-entering the healthcare field for several years. This forced her to pursue investments in the entertainment field. She is also involved in her husband's businesses. At the time of her conviction her personal net worth was estimated to be US$23 million, this is separate from her husband's nine figure net worth. Many of her businesses are owned through her holding company LWF Holdings. Her friend Janet Peckinpaugh served as the marketing director of LWF Holdings. In 2010 her campaign claimed that she directly employed 500 people and had hosted a group of 15 Kenyan entrepreneurs on a tour of Connecticut. = Allstar Therapy= Allstar Therapy provides occupational, speech and physical rehabilitation in health care facilities throughout Connecticut, Massachusetts and Rhode Island. Allstar Therapy was sold in 2016. = Blue Fox Enterprises = In 1998 she acquired the Simsbury Bowling Center and renamed it Blue Fox Rock 'N Bowl and renovated it emphasize a family friendly atmosphere. In 1999 she acquired the Copper Hill Golf Club for $1.3m renaming it Fox Run at Copper Hill. The club was sold in 2010. The company recently sold three Victorian Bed and Breakfasts in Newport, RI.  Blue Fox Run Golf Course  Blue Fox Run is a 27-hole golf course owned by Wilson-Foley notable for being the first in the country to offer onsite childcare. In 1996 she purchased the property, then known as the Bel Compo Golf Course and having only 18 holes, for US$3.5m with her husband purchasing 55 adjoining acres. She was one of the first women in the United States to own a golf course. In 1997 Wilson-Foley successfully applied to rezone 15 of their acres to office park, the parcel was subsequently developed with three office buildings having been built as of 2012. = Hartford FoxForce = In 1999 Wilson-Foley and her husband franchised the World TeamTennis team Hartford FoxForce in Hartford, Connecticut. FoxForce's first drafted player was Monica Seles. In 2001 the team fielded brothers Murphy Jensen and Luke Jensen. Over the years the team fielded other well known players such as Bethanie Mattek-Sands, Boris Becker, and James Blake. The team played first at Hartford's 3,000 seat State Arsenal and Armory and later at a 2,500 seat outdoor stadium Wilson-Foley had built at her Blue Fox Run golf course. The Foley's shut the team down in 2007 due to a lack of corporate sponsorships. Mark Foley's Connecticut Pride also used the State Arsenal and Armory as a venue from 1993‚Äì2000.  Philanthropy  Before her conviction Wilson-Foley served as the vice-chair of the board at The Bushnell Center for the Performing Arts. Previously she served on the board of the Renbrook School and the American School for the Deaf.  Political campaigns  She is a political protege of former Governor of Connecticut John G. Rowland who called her \\"grasshopper\\" during his political tutelage. = Lieutenant Governor = In 2010 Lisa Wilson-Foley announced that she was running for Lieutenant Governor of Connecticut as a Republican. Wilson-Foley's campaign platform was unique, she said she would refuse the salary, car, and driver that traditionally came with the position. In addition she proposed evaluating after two years on the job whether the position of Lieutenant Governor should be abolished entirely. She was the only candidate in the 2010 Connecticut gubernatorial election who ran for Lieutenant Governor without a gubernatorial running mate. She lost the election to Nancy Wyman. = Congress = Lisa Wilson-Foley ran for the 2012 Congressional Election in Connecticut's 5th congressional district. Her run was endorsed by a number of prominent local politicians and was considered competitive. She declined public funding for her campaign and instead loaned her campaign just under a million dollars. In the Republican Primary she competed against Mark Greenberg, and Justin Bernier and Andrew Roraback. She was defeated by Roraback but waged a hard- fought campaign in which she and Roraback battled fiercely while largely ignoring the other two candidates. Roraback went on to be narrowly defeated by Democrat Elizabeth Esty. Soon after her loss her campaign became the subject of state and federal investigations. At the core of the investigations was her relationship with John Rowland. She had hired him to adviser her campaign but because he was a convicted felon and notoriously corrupt she chose to pay him more than US$35,000 through her husband's legitimate businesses in the hopes of avoiding negative publicity. By law all paid campaign staff must be reported, but the Foley-Wilson campaign neglected to report him. Rowland provided fraudulent invoices for services on behalf of the couple's nursing home company as cover for the payments. Prosecutors alleged that Wilson-Foley, Foley, and Rowland engaged in a conspiracy to steal the election along with a number of unindicted co-conspirators. In 2015 Wilson-Foley was sentenced to five months in prison and five months of home confinement. Federal Prosecutors had requested that she spend at least ten months in prison for her role in leading a \\"prolonged and calculated effort to defraud voters\\". In addition to the charges related to Rowland's contracting she also ran afoul of Federal Election Commission regulation regarding campaign contributions. The campaign failed to report a $500,000 contribution by Brian Foley to the campaign, instead choosing to report it as Wilson-Foley's own contribution. This violated was discovered when her husband testified as such during his 2014 trial. Brian Foley also used four individuals as straw donors to make donations that in and of themselves exceeded the individual contribution limit of US$2,500 in addition to being illegal due to their duplicitous nature. The straw donor contributions of the four individuals totaled more than US$30,000. These violations are especially egregious as Wilson-Foley also served as the campaign's treasurer. Foley and Wilson-Foley also used their business resources to directly support the campaign in violation of federal law, members of the Apple Rehab marketing staff were unofficially assigned to the campaign and other staff members got tasked to help personally persuade convention delegates to vote for Wilson-Foley.

The church is under the administration of the Oblates of Saints Ambrose and Charles. History and description The site formerly had a small chapel housing a 16th-century icon of the Madonna. On 24 April 1583, it was reported by some townsfolk that the icon was crying blood-tinged tears. This led to an investigation by archbishop, later saint, Carlo Borromeo, who then proposed the erection of a Sanctuary to celebrate the miracle. The first stone for the church was place on 6 March 1584, and the project proceeded under the designs of Pellegrino Tibaldi. The church, although unfinished, was consecrated in 1586 with the attendance of Archbishop Gaspare Visconti and Cardinal Federico Borromeo. The frescoed icon was now located on the main altar. Construction proceeded over the centuries tha followed, but the crossing lacked a dome until the 17th century. On 4 April 1755, a new consecration, dedicating the church to the Queen of the Martyrs was performed in the presence of Cardinal Giuseppe Pozzobonelli. It was around this time was added the dome, designed by Carlo Giuseppe Merlo and the bell-tower, designed by Giulio Galliori. After the Napoleonic wars ended after 1810, under the patronage of the Marchese Maria Lelia Talenti of Fiorenza (widow of Castelli) and her mother, Maria Selvagina Doria, the neoclassical facade, designed by Leopoldo Pollack, was finally added. The church was reinaugurated in 1895 under Cardinal Andrea Ferrari. A number of chapels have undergone restoration, including that of San Giuseppe (2004) and San Carlo (2007).Official site of Sanctuary. The interior however has a rich baroque decoration, sponsored by local nobility, including the Simonetta, Crivelli, Visconti, and Turri.

After earning his Ph.D. from Princeton University, he taught at Peking University, National Central University, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, and Fudan University. He led the development of China's first X-ray tube in 1953 and was elected a founding member of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in 1955. His research was disrupted when he was subject to severe persecution during the Anti-Rightist Campaign and the Cultural Revolution. Although later politically rehabilitated, he was plagued by poor health for the rest of his life.  Early life and education  Zhou was born on 21 December 1907 in Kunshan, Jiangsu, during the Qing dynasty. After graduating in 1929 from the Department of Physics of Tsinghua University, he won a Boxer Indemnity Scholarship to study at Princeton University in the United States. He studied under Karl Taylor Compton and Henry D. Smyth at Princeton and excelled in his research. He published three papers in major physical journals. His doctoral thesis, \\"The Spectrum of Sulphur Dioxide\\", was published in Physical Review in October 1933.  Career  =Republic of China= After earning his Ph.D., Zhou returned to China in 1933 and accepted a professorship in the Department of Physics of Peking University, where he established an optical lab. In 1936, Zhou was appointed Chair of the Physics Department of National Central University (NCU) in Nanjing. A year later, however, the Empire of Japan invaded China and occupied Nanjing, China's then capital. NCU evacuated Nanjing and moved with the Nationalist government to the wartime capital of Chongqing. In 1943, Zhou transferred to National Chiao Tung University, then also exiled in Chongqing. To augment his meagre income as a wartime professor, he also took up a technical position in the Kuomintang's National Revolutionary Army with the rank of a field officer. This later became a major reason why he was not trusted in Communist China. After the surrender of Japan in 1945, Chiao Tung University returned to Shanghai. Zhou served as dean of the university's School of Sciences and established its nuclear physics lab. =People's Republic of China= After the Communist Party defeated the Kuomintang in the Chinese Civil War, the new government reorganized China's universities on the Soviet model, and part of the Physics Department of Chiao Tung University (now called Shanghai Jiao Tong University) was merged into Fudan University. Zhou, together with his assistant and former student Fang Junxin (), moved to Fudan as part of the reorganization. In 1953, Fudan University established the X-ray Tube Laboratory with Zhou as its director and Fang as vice director. Soon they developed China's first X-ray tube. He also made contributions to the research of electric discharge in gases and vacuum tube technology. In 1955, Zhou was elected as a founding member of the Chinese Academy of Sciences.  Persecution and death  During the Anti-Rightist Campaign, Zhou was denounced as a \\"bourgeois intellectual\\" and underwent struggle sessions from 1958 until 1961. Although he was one of China's top experts and pioneers in optical physics, he was sidelined when Fudan created its laser research group in the early 1960s. When the Cultural Revolution started in 1966, many prominent academics came under persecution. At the Fudan Physics Department, Zhou and his colleague Mao Qingxian () were targeted for the worst treatment. The beatings and public humiliation drove Mao to suicide. Although the worst atrocities were over by 1969 and Zhou was later politically rehabilitated, he suffered from poor health for the rest of his life. On 13 February 1989, Zhou died in Shanghai at the age of 81.

The Minjung movement was a social movement that recognized the people who were culturally and systematically neglected by the South Korean government for economic advancement. The term, Undongkwon, is also understood as a \\"counter public sphere,\\" which is an environment where Minjung movement activists can plan their beliefs and ideals against the commonly accepted belief systems.LEE, N. (2007). INTRODUCTION: Minjung, History, and Historical Subjectivity. In The Making of Minjung: Democracy and the Politics of Representation in South Korea (pp. 1-20). Cornell University Press. Alternatively, Undongkwon is conceptualized to include the individuals and any activists who were involved. They believed in laws and social movements which would prioritize helping the common person or citizen above all other governmental focuses. In addition to a strong alliance with laborers, they had an equal devotion to community which began the opposition to western culture and the South Korean government. At this revolutionary time, there were many mobilized groups against the South Korean public agenda such as student movements, visual arts movements Madangg≈≠k and labor movements.  History  The Minjung is a Korean term that stands for \\"mass\\" or \\"the people\\". Minjung is a term that holds significant historical and cultural context. Minjung refers to the people who are oppressed politically, socially, and/or economically. The term has a great significance and meaning since it became identified with the struggle for democracy in South Korea in the 1970s-1980s. The term is also used and identified to understand the concept and view in which social reality is communicated. The term later became more focused upon the reality that was characterized by poverty, inequality, political oppression, and social dispute between rich and poor. The mass of Koreans born in the 1930s and 1940s deeply believed in anti-communism and pro Americanism beliefs. Such ideals include democracy, public safety, freedoms, and choice. They observed the United States as a model of how future Korea may become one day.McCormack, G. (1996). Some post-Cold War thoughts on ‚Äúthe Korea problem‚Äù. Asian Studies Review, 19, 125‚Äì136. The Undongkwan was both a culture and the individual activists who reassessed this perspective of the United States after colonial South Korea. Historically, Undongkwan activists were imagined by conservatives as insignificant pro- North Korean leftists, \\"the Reds\\" and anti-American.Lee, S. (2012). How can I be the protagonist of my own life?: Intimations of hope for teen subjectivities in Korean fiction and film. In J. Stephens (Ed.), Subjectivity in Asian children‚Äôs literature and film: Global theories and implications (pp. 95‚Äì114). , : Routledge. Within the Undongkwon culture, historical expectations and obligations were required to given up at the expense of the individual in order to fully commit for the communities pursuit of happiness. Additionally, activists believed entering activists were to also relinquish their own rights, educational status and privileges to join the movements.LEE, N. (2007). THE UNDONGKW≈éN AS A COUNTERPUBLIC SPHERE. In The Making of Minjung: Democracy and the Politics of Representation in South Korea (pp. 147-186). Cornell University Press. These activists challenged many aspects of South Korean idealism such as the government's view of the United States role in South Korea. During the Undongkwan's peak, constitutionalism and violence was most apparent within the June Democracy movement of 1987 which was considered a key moment in to a switch toward a more democratic government.West, J. M., & Baker, E. J. (1988). The 1987 Constitutional reforms in South Korea: Electoral processes and judicial independence. Harvard Human Rights Yearbook, 1, 135‚Äì177. Furthermore, to spread such beliefs and awareness of issues in South Korea, circles of conversation were conducted at every level and at every available forum which include underground, in open spaces, in factories, in farming villages, and in slum areas.  Student movement  The movements originated from university students between 1970s and 1980s had revolutionary impacts on the democratic state of South Korea. Many of these activists gave up their bright futures to support ideals larger than themselves. For instance, some social activists left or were removed from their schools due their actions, lost their lives during rallies, some entered highly physical demanding worker jobs and some even gave up their lives. Controversial topics such as the current regime's legitimacy, questions of distribution of justice, the truth about the Gwangju Uprising and reunification were often debated intensely by the students within this movement. These student-driven movements also innovated strategies to develop, organize and articulate a ‚Äúcounter public sphere‚Äù. The student movement were a training ground for the Minjung movement as a whole because large amounts of the students who attended these early rallies later shifted their attention toward different movements within the Minjung movement which include labor, women, farmers, and urban-poor living issues that further developed in to the late 1980s. Campus demonstrations needed devote activists who were prepared to go to prison and incredibly careful planning In the beginning of the 1970s, the student demonstrations were brief in time. Some instances, the students would gather, march around campus or into near by streets and read controversial manifestos or statements. For instance, at Seoul National University, a large number of students participated in a demonstration circle in the campus a few times. After some time then walked toward the entrance gate where the riot police were posted. At this junction, students threw rocks at riot police who in response shot tear gas in to the crowd.Undongkwon taehaksaeng tae haebu‚Äù [Dissecting undongkwon students]. Wolgan Choson, August 1988, 172‚Äì95. Another pressing issue were to get more followers and increase awareness of the movement. Students resorted to drastic tactics like pulling school buildings‚Äô fire alarms to gain enough time for their fellow students to distribute pamphlets among each other and in a visual way used mask-dance performances to begin protest demonstrations. Other techniques include raiding into movie theaters to pass out pamphlets or \\"banned books\\". One of the most iconic student democratic rebellions were the Gwanju Uprising. This movement was a protest in opposition to the election of Choi Kyu-hah, successor of presidency after president Park Chung-hee's death, and his non-democratic ideals. This ordeal quickly escalated and evolved into a large scale rebellion in Gwanju, South Korea. This event left 1,392 demonstrators arrested, including university students, a death toll between 1,000 and 2,000. Students were marked to affiliate themselves with the Undongkwon movement. In the late 1970s to the early 1980s for women it was straight hair, no makeup, and jeans. This was because they wanted to be recognized as equals between men. Women did not want a separate movement just for the women right because they wanted to be affiliated and seen as equals to men. For men in the Undongkwon movement it was a military training jacket, black rubber shoes, unwashed hard, and unshaven faces. This effort of change was to ensure that no trace of individuality was present in order to make the Undongkwon movement more distinct. During school hours at universities, the students would never talk about the uprising movement but would rather have a hunch about who was in it and who was against it. Normally if you were out of the norms in the Korean lifestyle you were part of the Undongkwon movement.  Traditional folk theater  masks were worn during maddangguk plays at schools and other events to promote the minjung movement Many rehearsals for the Minjung movement was carried out through the 1970s to the 1980s. Madangg≈≠k was a traditional drama that combined Korean traditional for dramas with Westernized ideas and cultures. Madangg≈≠k was an array of everything you would normally see within a drama. It included stereotyped characters that were easily relatable to the audience, chain linked connections in between scenes, satires, comical gestures, dances, songs, and even jokes. These Madangg≈≠k's were performed usually outside for the public to see. This was because as the years progressed into the 1980s Madangg≈≠k's evolved from being purely dramas for enjoyment to a form of cultural and political expression. Madangg≈≠k's popularity with expression of voice and political views swept across Korea. This became a site of a new form of art, social movement, and an overall new expression of politics and other subjectivity. Madangg≈≠k's had a major influence within university campuses which then spread over the years to influence factories, village squares, public halls, outdoor markets, and even Protestant and Catholic Churches. Scholars had characterized Madangg≈≠k's as peoples' theater and resistance theater. As well as a unique expression of the Korean spirit. Many people saw performing in Madangg≈≠k's as not only a way to express examples of a political satire or as just a drama, but as an alternative way of living and working in the capitalist system. The capitalist system was challenged but the emergence of the Madangg≈≠k's because it was the expression and voice of the people that was presented in a comedic and entertaining way. Madangg≈≠k challenged the fine line that divided labor and leisure, producer and consumer, and landowner and the workers. The counter public sphere, Undongkwon was portrayed in multiple plays and songs to represent the important role that the young had played in questioning the legitimacy of the military regime, distributive justice, and the other region of the divided Korea.  Labor movements  Gwangju Uprising From the 1970s-1980's, a counter-public sphere was created by intellectuals and laborers. This sphere reformulated the identities, interests, and needs of the individuals within this community. This alliance consisted of students, Christian labor organization, and many other intellectuals. This flowed into students joining the workforce and becoming worker-student solidarity (nohak yondae).LEE, N. (2007). THE ALLIANCE BETWEEN LABOR AND INTELLECTUALS. In The Making of Minjung: Democracy and the Politics of Representation in South Korea (pp. 213-240). Cornell University Press. A small number of dissident intellectuals and university students were thus poised to become involved in labor in the early 1970s. There were three general groups that were involved in the labor force throughout the 1970s. These three groups were textile workers, Christian organizations, and factory workers. The movement's goal was to change South Korean society. This group raised issues about low wages, dangerous working conditions, and violations of labor laws. In relation to Korean women under the labor force, they had less than half of the pay for men and were the ones to work the longer hours throughout the day. In addition, all workers in the labor force had experienced extremely unhealthy and unsafe working conditions that were caused by the negligence of factory owners and managers. Labor workers were known to be culturally humiliated and looked down upon by management and society. Jeon Tae-il was a 22-year-old worker who worked in the textile industry in Seoul, Korea. To bring awareness to this movement and situation that is occurring within the garment industry he poured gasoline and set himself on fire. His last words were, \\"we workers are human beings too and we should be guaranteed basic labor rights. Do not let my death be in vain\\". A few student activists began to think their social movement might have been too preoccupied with political issues and they worked on the idea that social change and democracy might involve a wider structure toward their goal and bring some organization to their plans on the labor movement. They decided to bring structural organization to elements in society, particularly the labor force.

Her work blends the cultures of Australia and her ancestral China and explores her Buddhist faith. She has exhibited widely, with shows outside Australia in the United States, Germany, Canada, China, Hong Kong, Japan, Malaysia, New Zealand and Singapore. In 2014, the University of Queensland Art Museum mounted a survey of her work to date.  Biography  Lee was born in 1954 in Brisbane, Queensland, the daughter of Chinese immigrants who fled China with their two older children after the rise of communism in that country. Lee's experiences with racism as a child in Australia coupled with her experience of feeling alienated when visiting China because of her inability to speak in the Chinese language contributed to her interest in melding the cultures in her work. She attended the Chelsea School of Art in London, after which she considered a career as an art teacher, but exposure to portraiture and contemporary art in London and elsewhere in Europe decided her to become a professional artist. During her years at graduate school at the Sydney College of the Arts in Australia she made her first portrait utilising photocopiers, a technique which featured prominently in her early work. In the 1980s, she began exhibiting her work. After decades as a practising artist, Lee attended the University of New South Wales, from which she achieved her PhD in Fine Art in 2001. She has served as a visual arts lecturer at the University of Sydney and a trustee at the Art Gallery of New South Wales.  Work  The Life of Stars by Lindy Lee in the forecourt of the Art Gallery of South Australia Lee's work began with a strong interest in originality and reproductions, utilising photocopiers to reproduce famous portraits over which she painted original work. Eventually, she began adding portraits of family and others before moving into other art forms, including sculpture. As she became more involved in Zen Buddhism, she began to incorporate elements of religion in her work, which often focuses heavily on the theme of suffering. She also reflects Daoist themes, including the interconnectedness of the universe and of nature and humanity. She has utilised a range of materials, from building texture with custard to creating burn holes on paper generated by a soldering iron. Lee's sculpture \\"The Life of Stars\\" is mounted on the forecourt the Art Gallery of South Australia, after being presented for the 2018 Adelaide Biennial of Australian Art: Divided Worlds. Concentric circles on the egg-shaped sculpture refer symbolically to the connectedness of the universe via a concept used in Mahayana Buddhism. Created in Shanghai in 2015, the sculpture's polished stainless steel surface reflects its surroundings while simultaneously radiating light. Over 30,000 perforated holes were individually placed by Lee resemble a map of our galaxy when lit from within. The sculpture was bought by the gallery as a farewell gift for departing director Nick Mitzevich in April 2018.

Nyay) was a proposed social welfare program by the Indian National Congress in its 2019 general election manifesto.Congress Will Deliver, Manifesto Lok Sabha Elections 2019, Indian National Congress It promised that the party, if voted to power in the 2019 Indian general election, would enact a law under which it would distribute cash to the bottom 20 percent of India's families in terms of wealth, as a minimum guarantee programme. These households would each receive up to a year, a program the Congress claimed would benefit 250 million people in India.Congress's Minimum Income Guarantee Scheme \\"NYAY\\" Explained In 10 Points, NDTV (26 March 2019), In May 2020, a reworked version of the Nyuntam Aay Yojana, named as the Rajiv Gandhi Kisan Nyay Yojana (RGKNY) in honour of former Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, was announced. Under the scheme, up to Rs 10,000 per acre a year will be transferred into the bank accounts of farmers; the first instalment totalling Rs 1,500 crore was transferred by Chief Minister of Chhattisgarh Bhupesh Baghel to nearly 2 million farmers during the launch.  Background  The Nyuntam Aay Yojana was proposed as part of the Indian National Congress campaign for the 2019 Indian general election, which primarily focused on agrarian distress while the Bharatiya Janata Party campaign for the 2019 Indian general election focused on infrastructural development and anti- immigration policies. The program was announced on 3 March 2019, at the manifesto‚Äôs release event at the All India Congress Committee‚Äôs headquarters at New Delhi. The scheme was backed by Rahul Gandhi, then-president of the INC, who stated that \\"the Nyantam Aay Yojana is \\"an extremely powerful, extremely dynamic, extremely well-thought-through idea\\"\\", claiming that it is supported by \\"the best economists\\"\\". According to Bhalchandra Mungekar ‚Äì a former member of India's Planning Commission and a member of Congress party's manifesto committee, the scheme would redistribute about a year. Mungekar stated that the Indian GDP in 2018 was $2.67 trillion, and the promised welfare program of the Congress party, if enacted and implemented, would collect and redistribute 1.9 percent of India's Gross Domestic Product to the poor. He states that the welfare program would be an affordable and just redistribution of national income.The NYAY scheme is a game changer, Bhalchandra Mungekar (12 April 2019), The Hindu Business Line According to P Chidambaram ‚Äì former Finance Minister of India, the proposed welfare program \\"will not affect other welfare program subsidies India already operates, will constitute 1.8 percent of India's GDP, and benefit 50 million families\\".Nyuntam Aay Yojana to be rolled out in phases: P Chidambaram, Scheme will not affect subsidies, Nidhi Bhati (28 March 2019), Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy,  Criticism  The Nyuntam Aay Yojana has been criticised by newspapers, politicians and economists on grounds of impracticality and the large expenses of maintaining such a scheme. According to The Economic Times, the Nyantam Aay Yojana is \\"yet another welfare program for India, but one that is \\"between promising the moon and simply loony\\". It will lead to fiscal ruin if existing welfare programs and food, fuel and other subsidies operate in parallel to the Nyantam Aay Yojana. The program will cost between and a year, worsen the fiscal deficit of the Indian government, lead to \\"soaring inflation\\" and a \\"flight of capital\\" from India. To pay for the new welfare program and maintain India's current deficit level, the Congress party will need to raise GST rate, income taxes and wealth tax. Since the proposed welfare program would be a cash redistribution without any link to work or jobs, it will create no new jobs and worsen the recent productivity growth India has witnessed\\".ET View: Between promising the moon and simply loony, The Economic Times (25 March 2019), View: Congress' Nyuntam Aay Yojana simply doesn‚Äôt work, The Economic Times (27 March 2019), The UK-based weekly The Economist stated that \\"India already has \\"over 950 centrally-funded schemes and subsidies\\", but the benefits of these welfare programs never reach the poor because it typically lands up in the government officials' pockets and those of the wealthier sections of society who are politically and bureaucratically well connected. Welfare programs that \\"prevent participants from doing any other work\\" are problematic. Another major flaw in Nyuntam Aay Yojana, stated by The Economist is its assumption that the government officials will be able to identify the poor. Given the incentive of government income for being within the poorest 20%, people will likely compete to be poor or appear to be poor so as to avail the benefits\\".India‚Äôs big, national parties vie for poor voters‚Äô affections, The Economist (4 April 2019)Welfare in India: A better anti-poverty plan for India, The Economist (6 April 2019) According to Raghuram Rajan ‚Äì the former governor of Reserve Bank of India, the Nyuntam Aay Yojana was \\"good in theory but needs to take into account the fiscal realities of India\\". The program details and \\"how it will roll out\\" are unclear, states Rajan, and such a program if implemented properly at the grassroots level can revolutionise things, but \\"given where we [Indian government fiscal deficits] are, can we add another 7 lakh crore subsidy? The answer is no.\\"Raghuram Rajan says Rahul Gandhi's NYAY scheme workable, conditions apply, India Today (26 March 2019) Any Direct Bank Transfer scheme, such as the Nyuntam Aay Yojana should aim to alleviate poverty, but to be effective they should bring \\"more people into productive work force\\" and they \\"should not discourage work\\".BTVI Exclusive: The Big Picture With Raghuram Rajan, BTVI (27 March 2019), 'Nyay' scheme poses fiscal challenge: Panagariya The Hans India (28 March 2019) James Crabtree ‚Äì a professor of Public Policy Practice and the former Mumbai Bureau chief of The Financial Times, states that the Nyuntam Aay Yojana idea is not supported by the \\"best economists\\" contrary to Rahul Gandhi's beliefs. The idea is a copy of Universal Basic Income idea that is currently fashionable among left-wing advocacy groups worldwide and is innovative compared to past proposals of the Congress party. However, it is unworkable, states Crabtree, in part because it is politically infeasible as it promises to discriminate between the poor by targeting the lowest 20% when similar impoverishment affects far more Indian families. Even if Nyuntam Aay Yojana can politically ignore the impoverished families above the bottom 20%, it is fiscally unaffordable because it would cost about 2% of India's gross domestic product, according to Jamestree. The Nyuntam Aay Yojana cannot end poverty in India, predicted Jamestree.Gandhi's universal income pledge cannot end Indian poverty, James Crabtree (3 April 2019), Nikkei Asian Review, Tokyo, Japan, Mayawati ‚Äì the president of Bahujan Samaj Party and a former Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh, asserted that the Nyantam Aay Yojana was \\"just vote bank politics\\" of the Congress party.Poor became poorer, rich got richer under BJP rule: Mayawati, Deccan Chronicle (12 April 2019), The Ford Foundation International Professor of Economics at MIT Abhijit Banerjee criticised NYAY, asserting that \\"it will only be funded with high taxes and inflation\\".MIT professor suggested minimum income plan to Congress, but not Rs 6,000 per month, Business Today (India) Notes Nyuntam is a Hindi word meaning \\"minimum\\", and is not to be confused with \\"NYAY\\" meaning justice.

It holds the photomask over the silicon wafer while a bright light is shone through the mask and onto the photoresist. The \\"alignment\\" refers to the ability to place the mask over precisely the same location repeatedly as the chip goes through multiple rounds of lithography. Aligners were a major part of IC manufacture from the 1960s into the late 1970s, when they began to be replaced by the stepper. There are several distinct generations of aligner technology. The early contact aligners placed the mask in direct contact with the top surface of the wafer, which often damaged the pattern when the mask was lifted off again. Used only briefly, proximity aligners held the mask slightly above the surface to avoid this problem, but were difficult to work with and required considerable manual adjustment. Finally, the projection aligner, introduced by Perkin-Elmer in 1973, held the mask entirely separate from the chip and made the adjustment of the image much simpler. Through these stages of development, yields improved from perhaps 10% to about 70%, leading to a corresponding reduction in chip prices. The stepper is similar to an aligner in concept, but with one key difference. The aligner uses a mask that holds the pattern for the entire wafer, which requires large masks. The stepper uses a mask for only a single chip on the wafer, and steps across the surface to repeat the pattern. This reduces mask costs dramatically and allows a single wafer to be used for different designs in a single run. More importantly, by focussing the light source onto a single area of the wafer, the stepper can produce much higher resolutions.

Thus, \\"Thunder\\" is not the character's genuine surname, making it unlikely that any familial connection exists between the two Johnnys. Johnny Thunder would go on to be a member of the group the Rough Bunch. In Impulse Annual #2 (1997), a backup story revealed that, at the time of his mother's death, Johnny Tane is inspired to create a secret identity by Max Mercury. The young Johnny is briefly under the impression Max is a genie, in a reference to the later Johnny Thunder. As revealed in DC Comics Presents #28 (1980), Johnny eventually retired from action, marrying the similarly-retired outlaw (and another All-Star Western feature) Madame .44 (Jeanne Walker), and the couple bore a daughter, Rebecca, and a son, Chuck. This was an intentional nod by writer Mike Tiefenbacher to Chuck Taine (with an I) which is the real name of Bouncing Boy of the Legion of Super-Heroes, but it has never been suggested in-canon that the latter is a descendant of the former. This incarnation of Johnny Thunder is the one that electro-rock band Judge Rock wrote about in their 2012 song Westerner : \\"The first paleface wore red and blue, went by the moniker of one Johnny Thunder. He was the youngest of the crew.\\" The track describes the pages 20 to 23 of Crisis on Infinite Earths, issue #3, when the DC western-related characters, namely Jonah Hex, Scalphunter, Bat Lash, Nighthawk and him, investigate a machine which has appeared in an abandoned mine.

Scriptural authority  The Atharvaveda-parishishta, composed in the 1st millennium BCE, mentions gosahasra, along with hiranyagarbha and tulapurusha donations. These three donations are included among the sixteen great gifts in the later text Matsya Purana; the relevant section of the text appears to have been composed during 550-650 CE. The Matsya Purana states that several ancient kings performed the great gifts, and these three donations are most prominent among the great gifts recorded in historical inscriptions. The Linga Purana also mentions the sixteen great gifts; according to R. C. Hazara, the relevant portion of the text was composed during c. 600-1000 CE, most probably after 800 CE. The great gifts are further detailed in the later digests devoted to the topic of charity (dƒÅna), such as Ballala's Dana-sagara, and the Danakhanda section of Hemadri's Chaturvarga-chintamani (13th century).  Historical performers  * The inscriptions of the Shalankayana and Vishnukundin kings (c. 4th-6th centuries) mention gosahasra and hiranyagarbha performances. * Attivarman (c. 4th century) of Ananda dynasty of Guntur region performed gosahsra and hiranyagarbha. Damodaravarman of this dynasty also made these two donations. * The Tugu inscription of Purnavarman (c. 5th century), a ruler of Tarumanagara in present-day Indonesia, records a gift of a thousand cows to brahmanas. * The Siripuram inscription of the Vasishtha king Anantavarman (c. 5th century) records gosahasra and other donations by his grandfather Gunavarman. * Jayantavarman alias Cendan (c. 7th century) of Pandya dynasty, according to one of his inscriptions, \\"castigated the Kali age\\" by performing gosahsra along with hiranyagarbha and tulapursuha. * An inscription of the Pandya king Varaguna I (r. c. 768-811) states that his father and grandfather performed hiranyagarbha, tulabhara and gosahasra many times. * The Pandya king Nedumaran, according to his Madurai inscription, performed many great gifts including those of gosahasra, tulabhara (tulapurusha), and hiranyagarbha. * Chandradeva (c. 1099 CE) of Gahadavala dynasty performed gosahasra and tulapurusha donations in front of an idol of Adikeshava, and then granted some villages, according to his Chandravati inscription * Anavema Reddi (14th century) of Reddi dynasty made the gosahasra donation. * Krishnadevaraya (r. 1509-1529) of the Vijayanagara Empire performed the sixteen great gifts according to the 1510 Rameswaram inscription and the 1513 Srikalahasti inscription.

Hatchery staff works to support the raising of approximately 700,000 catchable, ten-inch rainbow trout annually. The hatchery stocks fish along the Front Range from Loveland to the New Mexico border, and east almost to the Kansas border. History Chalk Cliffs was inaugurated in 1950. In 1986, the facility experienced a widespread death among fingerling trout. This was thought to be a result of using creek water. Water quality sampling by the Department of Public Health and the Environment found that the cause was high amounts of zinc and cadmium, from the Mary Murphy Mine upstream. In 1990, Chalk Creek was chosen for cleanup through the Division of Minerals and Geology. This was necessary as the levels were impacting fish habitats and water quality degradation in the Arkansas River. Yet, their clean up attempts were unsuccessful. Mission An overarching mission among the hatchery staff is educating the public. The facilities provide fish for stock in many areas which supports angling recreation. The facility offers educational materials and tours. Fish species The Chalk Cliffs Rearing Unit raises catchable rainbow trout, cutthroat trout. They obtain their water source from a nearby creek.

Biography He was probably the son of a violinist known as \\"Shoemaker\\" Matthias (?‚Äì1521) and may have studied painting with Hans Leonhard Sch√§ufelin.Frank B√ºttner and Gabrielle Wimb√∂ck: Das Bild als Autorit√§t, 2004, LIT Verlag Earlier sources indicate that he also studied with Hans Burgkmair. In 1525, he moved to Lauingen in the Duchy of Pfalz-Neuburg. He then married Anna Reiser, who was likely the daughter of Matthes Reiser (?‚Äìc.1519); also a painter. Gerung may have moved there to take over his workshop. He and Anna had two sons, Ambrosius and Hans, who became a goldsmith. In 1530‚Äì31, he carried out several commissions for Otto Henry, Elector Palatine, including wallpaper design at Schloss Neuburg, the production of genealogical tapestries and the creation of illustrations for what has come to be known as the , one of the most valuable medieval manuscripts in existence. The Bible had been started almost 100 years earlier and he added 117 illustrations. He appears once again in the tax lists for 1568, where he is also described as a constable and siegler (a type of notary). His detailed panel paintings provide a wealth of information about life in 16th century Germany. In addition to his clearly attributable works, he is also believed to have created several satirical pieces that criticized the Catholic Church and the Papacy. References  Further reading  * Anja F.

The crack is growing from left to right. Striations are marks produced on the fracture surface that show the incremental growth of a fatigue crack. A striation marks the position of the crack tip at the time it was made. The term striation generally refers to ductile striations which are rounded bands on the fracture surface separated by depressions or fissures and can have the same appearance on both sides of the mating surfaces of the fatigue crack. Although some research has suggested that many loading cycles are required to form a single striation, it is now generally thought that each striation is the result of a single loading cycle. The presence of striations is used in failure analysis as an indication that a fatigue crack has been growing. Striations are generally not seen when a crack is small even though it is growing by fatigue, but will begin to appear as the crack becomes larger. Not all periodic marks on the fracture surface are striations. The size of a striation for a particular material is typically related to the magnitude of the loading characterised by stress intensity factor range, the mean stress and the environment. The width of a striation is indicative of the overall crack growth rate but can be locally faster or slower on the fracture surface.  Striation features  The study of the fracture surface is known as fractography. Images of the crack can be used to reveal features and understand the mechanisms of crack growth. While striations are fairly straight, they tend to curve at the ends allowing the direction of crack growth to be determined from an image. Striations generally form at different levels in metals and are separated by a tear band between them. Tear bands are approximately parallel to the direction of crack growth and produce what is known as a river pattern, so called, because it looks like the diverging pattern seen with river flows. The source of the river pattern converges to a single point that is typically the origin of the fatigue failure. Striations can appear on both sides of the mating fracture surface. There is some dispute as to whether striations produced on both sides of the fracture surface match peak-to-peak or peak-to-valley. The shape of striations may also be different on each side of the fracture surface. Striations do not occur uniformly over all of the fracture surface and many areas of a fatigue crack may be devoid of striations. Striations are most often observed in metals but also occur in plastics such as Poly(methyl_methacrylate). Small striations can be seen with the aid of a scanning electron microscope. Once the size of a striation is over 500 nm (resolving wavelength of light), they can be seen with an optical microscope. The first image of striations was taken by Zapffe and Worden in 1951 using an optical microscope. The width of a striation indicates the local rate of crack growth and is typical of the overall rate of growth over the fracture surface. The rate of growth can be predicted with a crack growth equation such as the Paris-Erdogan equation. Defects such as inclusions and grain boundaries may locally slow down the rate of growth. Variable amplitude loads produce striations of different widths and the study of these striation patterns has been used to understand fatigue. Although various cycle counting methods can be used to extract the equivalent constant amplitude cycles from a variable amplitude sequence, the striation pattern differs from the cycles extracted using the rainflow counting method. The height of a striation has been related to the stress ratio R of the applied loading cycle, where R = K_\\\\text{min}/K_\\\\text{max} and is thus a function of the minimum K_\\\\text{min} and maximum K_\\\\text{max} stress intensity of the applied loading cycle. The striation profile depends on the degree of loading and unloading in each cycle. The unloading part of the cycle causing plastic deformation on the surface of the striation. Crack extension only occurs from the rising part of the load cycle.  Striation-like features  Other periodic marks on the fracture surface can be mistaken for striations. = Marker bands = Variable amplitude loading causes cracks to change the plane of growth and this effect can be used to create marker bands on the fracture surface. When a number of constant amplitude cycles are applied they may produce a plateau of growth on the fracture surface. Marker bands (also known as progression marks or beach marks) may be produced and readily identified on the fracture surface even though the magnitude of the loads may too small to produce individual striations. In addition, marker bands may also be produced by large loads (also known as overloads) producing a region of fast fracture on the crack surface. Fast fracture can produce a region of rapid extension before blunting of the crack tip stops the growth and further growth occurs during fatigue. Fast fracture occurs through a process of microvoid coalescence where failures initiate around inter-metallic particles. The F111 aircraft was subjected to periodic proof testing to ensure any cracks present were smaller than a certain critical size. These loads left marks on the fracture surface that could be identified, allowing the rate of intermediate growth occurring in service to be measured. Marks also occur from a change in the environment where oil or corrosive environments can deposit or from excessive heat exposure and colour the fracture surface up to the current position of the crack tip. Marker bands may be used to measure the instantaneous rate of growth of the applied loading cycles. By applying a repeated sequence separated by loads that produce a distinctive pattern the growth from each segment of loading can be measured using a microscope in a technique called quantitative fractography, the rate of growth for loading segments of constant amplitude or variable amplitude loading can be directly measured from the fracture surface. = Tyre tracks = Tyre tracks are the marks on the fracture surface produced by something making an impression onto the surface from the repeated opening and closing of the crack faces. This can be produced by either a particle that becomes trapped between the crack faces or the faces themselves shifting and directly contacting the opposite surface. = Coarse striations = Coarse striations are a general rumpling of the fracture surface and do not correspond to a single loading cycle and are therefore not considered to be true striations. They are produced instead of regular striations when there is insufficient atmospheric moisture to form hydrogen on the surface of the crack tip in aluminium alloys, thereby preventing the slip planes activation. The wrinkles in the surface cross over and so do not represent the position of the crack tip.  Striation formation in aluminium  = Environmental influence = Striations are often produced in high strength aluminium alloys. In these alloys, the presence of water vapour is necessary to produce ductile striations, although too much water vapour will produce brittle striations also known as cleavage striations. Brittle striations are flatter and larger than ductile striations produced with the same load. There is sufficient water vapour present in the atmosphere to generate ductile striations. Cracks growing internally are isolated from the atmosphere and grow in a vacuum. When water vapour deposits onto the freshly exposed aluminium fracture surface, it dissociates into hydroxides and atomic hydrogen. Hydrogen interacts with the crack tip affecting the appearance and size of the striations. The growth rate increases typically by an order of magnitude, with the presence of water vapour. The mechanism is thought to be hydrogen embrittlement as a result of hydrogen being absorbed into the plastic zone at the crack tip. When an internal crack breaks through to the surface, the rate of crack growth and the fracture surface appearance will change due to the presence of water vapour. Coarse striations occur when a fatigue crack grows in a vacuum such as when growing from an internal flaw. = Cracking plane = In aluminium (a face-centred cubic material), cracks grow close to low index planes such as the {100} and the {110} planes (see Miller Index). Both of these planes bisect a pair of slip planes. Crack growth involving a single slip plane is term Stage I growth and crack growth involving two slip planes is termed Stage II growth. Striations are typically only observed in Stage II growth. Brittle striations are typically formed on {100} planes.  Models of striation formation  There have been many models developed to explain the process of how a striation is formed and their resultant shape. Some of the significant models are: * Plastic blunting model of Laird * Saw-tooth model of McMillan and Pelloux * Coarse slip model of Neumman * Shear band model by Zhang  References   External links  * Characteristics of a fatigue failure in metals Materials science Reliability engineering Fracture mechanics Materials degradation Mechanical failure modes ","title":"Striation (fatigue)"},{"id":"60574749","text":"The Crystal River Hatchery is a Colorado Parks and Wildlife cold-water fish production facility located along the Crystal River in Garfield County, Colorado, near Carbondale.

Ellis and W. H. Ellis, is an American attorney and politician from the state of Florida. Ellis served twice as the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Florida.  Early life and education  Ellis was born in Pensacola, Florida on September 17, 1867, though he grew up in Quincy, Florida. After attending a business college in Atlanta, Georgia, Ellis attended Stetson University, graduating with his Juris Doctor in 1889. He was admitted to the Florida Bar in the same year. He began a private law practice in Quincy. Ellis was one of Florida's delegates at the 1900 Democratic National Convention.  Political career  = Early career = In February 1903, Ellis helped reorganize Florida's Office of the Expert Accountant into the Office of the Florida State Auditor. In return, Florida Governor William Sherman Jennings appointed him as to the position. Ellis served as the state's auditor until February 15, 1904, when he was appointed as the 18th Florida Attorney General by Jennings, finishing the term of James B. Whitfield, who had been appointed to the Supreme Court of Florida. Ellis was elected to his first full term later in 1904. While serving as attorney general, Ellis, a Progressive, contributed in the reorganization of the Florida Bar, transforming the organization from a simple benefit society to an active group of lawyers, publishing a legal journal and drafting court procedures. Ellis did not seek reelection in 1908, opting instead to return to private practice. From 1911 until 1915, he served as the general counsel of Florida's Internal Improvement Fund. = Supreme Court of Florida = On January 5, 1915, Governor Park Trammell appointed Ellis to the Supreme Court of Florida. Ellis served a long and distinguished career on the court, with his dissenting opinion for State v. Daniel (1924) foreshadowing what would become gender equality, writing: While on the court, Ellis served as the President of the Florida Bar from 1919 until 1920. In 1926, the Florida Constitution was amended to allow the justices to elect their own chief justice. In January 1927, Ellis became the first chief justice elected in this way, \\"because he was the member with the most seniority who had not yet served in that capacity\\".Joseph A. Boyd Jr., Randall Reder, \\"A History of the Florida Supreme Court\\", University of Miami Law Review (1981), p. 1051. He served as the court's Chief Justice twice, from 1927 until 1929 and from 1937 until he retired from the court due to illness on November 1, 1938. In 1935, Ellis delivered a speech titled The Spirit of Americanism to the Civitan Club of Jacksonville, Florida. Since the speech occurred on Confederate Memorial Day, Ellis invoked references to Robert E. Lee to stoke the flames against what he saw was the overreach of the federal government during the Great Depression, breaking with the progressive views of President Franklin D. Roosevelt in favor of the ideals of states rights, which would eventually turn into the Dixiecrat Party.  Death and legacy  Ellis died on April 14, 1948 in Jacksonville. He is buried in Quincy's Eastern Cemetery. In January 2018, Ellis' granddaughter donated many of his possessions to the Florida Supreme Court Historical Society, including his 100-page personal memoir.  Personal life  In 1894, Ellis married Minnie Ramelle Nicholson. They were married until her death in childbirth for their second son, Melville Hull, in 1902. In 1906, Ellis married Serena Taylor, the daughter of Florida Supreme Court Justice R. Fenwick Taylor. They had two children, twin daughters Julia Taylor and Amelia Fenwick, and were married until Ellis' death. Ellis was a member of the Freemasons and the Knights of Pythias, as well as Pi Gamma Mu and Phi Alpha Delta.

Hoyt MD, FACS is the Executive Director of the American College of Surgeons.  Education  Hoyt obtained his medical degree from Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine in Cleveland in 1976.  Career  Hoyt spent his entire medical training career at the University of California San Diego School of Medicine, completing his internship in 1977, his residency in 1979, a research fellowship in 1980, and two years as senior and chief resident from 1982 to 1984. He remained at UCSD after his training as an assistant professor of surgery between 1984 and 1989, associate professor of surgery between 1989 and 1995, and professor of surgery from 1995 to 2006. Hoyt served as the director of the division of trauma, burns, and critical care at the UC San Diego Medical Center from 1989 to 2006. While at UCSD, he was also the Monroe E. Trout Professor of Surgery and vice-chairman of the department of surgery, and had a dual appointment on the staff at the Veterans Administration Medical Center in San Diego and at Thornton Hospital in La Jolla. While in San Diego, Hoyt was active in the San Diego/Imperial County Credentials Committee, with which his involvement lasted 12 years. In 2006, he moved to the University of California, Irvine School of Medicine to serve as chairman of the department of surgery, the executive vice-dean of the school of medicine, and the John E. Connolly professor of surgery. He was also the medical director of the college's trauma programs while at UCI before he assumed his position at the ACS.  American College of Surgeons  Previous to succeeding Thomas R. Russell and assuming his position as the executive director of the American College of Surgeons on January 1, 2010, Hoyt served the organization in a number of ways. He became a Fellow of the American College of Surgeons in 1987, at which point he became involved in leading various ACS activities. Hoyt first became involved with the Committee on Trauma in 1980, and served as its chair between 1998 and 2002. Hoyt was a member of various ACS Board of Governors' Committees: Blood-Borne Infection and Environmental Risk, the Program Committee, and the Regents' Committee on Informatics. He was also a member of the national faculty for the college's Advanced Trauma Life Support course and served as a coordinator, instructor, and eventually the director of training for ATLS. As executive director, Hoyt has overseen the expansion of the college's Stop the Bleed Initiative as gun violence has increased in the United States. = Positions as executive director = When there was conflict over overlapping vs non-overlapping surgeries scheduled in hospitals, Hoyt supported research stating concurrent, overlapping surgeries are generally safe practice, as the ACS updated its position on its long-standing set of principles regarding the physician's responsibilities in the operating room. He has had a focus on sexual harassment in medicine, and is overseeing the development of a multi-year study to identify and understand the cultural elements that can ultimately be controlled to reduce the prevalence of harassment. In 2011, when the president-elect of the ACS, Lazar Greenfield, was caught in a controversy surrounding a Valentine's Day editorial he wrote touting the mood-enhancing effects of semen on women during unprotected sex, Hoyt oversaw the college's response, stating that it \\"deeply regrets the offense taken to Dr. Greenfield‚Äôs editorial about Valentine‚Äôs Day.\\" When the efficacy of surgical caps were called into question by inspectors, who instead supported bouffants, Hoyt's office released its own guidelines, arguing there was no reason to tamper with tradition, and that there is no evidence linking modest amounts of uncovered hair to wound infections. He has encouraged surgeons to wear clean, appropriate professional attire (not scrubs) during all patient encounters outside of the operating room, stating, \\"this statement reflects our strong commitment to surgical patient safety.\\" On the issue of surgical volume, Hoyt reported the ACS continues to look into the issue. In the \\"eyeball wars\\" between optometrists and ophthalmologists, ophthalmologists have maintained that optometrists do not have the same medical training or qualifications to perform eye surgery, and so, when Governor Rick Scott signed HB 239 into law in 2013, allowing optometrists to prescribe a limited number of oral medications, ophthalmologists were angry. Hoyt sent a letter of protest to Rep. Cary Pigman, an emergency care physician who chairs the Health Quality Subcommittee, explaining that the bill worked against the interests of patient safety and maintaining the highest standards of surgical care.

Its common names reflect its shovel nose specialization, burrowing behaviour and banded body colour.  Description  The narrow-banded shovel-nosed snake is on average in total length, reaching to approximately in total length.Cogger, H. (2018). Reptiles and amphibians of Australia (7th ed.). Genus Brachyurophis (pp. 864-869). Collingwood: CSIRO Publishing. Identification of B. fasciolatus from other species of this genus can be made by inspection of the preocular and nasal scales. This species has a scale situated between the two scales whereas other species of this genus have the preocular and nasal scale in contact. The Narrow-banded burrowing snake has cream to white coloured ventral scales, of which there are 140-175, and 15-30 subcaudal scales of which are divided. The anal scale is also divided. The dorsal scales are brightly coloured with a pale reddish-brown to cream coloured background and black-tipped scales that form 50 or more narrow bands across the body, giving the snake its banded appearance. The snout is light in colour, cream or brown and the head is black with a narrow lighter coloured band separating the black head and nape into two sections. There are 17 rows of scales mid-body on average.  Taxonomy  Brachyurophis fasciolatusis one of eight currently recognised species within the genus Brachyurophis, in addition there are two subspecies, Brachyurophis fasciolatus fasciatus and Brachyurophis fasciolatus fasciolatus. Originally named Rhinelaps fasciolatus when first described by G√ºnther in 1872,Kinghorn, R. J. (1955). Herpetological notes. No. 5. Records of the Australian Museum, 23(5), 283-286. doi: 10.3853/j.0067-1975.23.1955.638 Brachyurophis fasciolatus was renamed multiple times until its most recent rename in the early 2000s.Brachyurophis fasciolatus (G√ºnther, 1872). (n.d.). Retrieved from http://reptile- database.reptarium.cz/species?genus=Brachyurophis&species;=fasciolatus This most recent reclassification for this species, moved this species into the genus Brachyurophis. Synonyms include Rhinelaps fasciolatus (G√ºnther 1872), Rhynchoelaps fasciolatus (Boulenger 1896), and Simoselaps fasciolatus (Cogger 1983). = Phylogeny = Brachyurophis fasciolatus belongs to one of two burrowing clades of taxa found within Australian elapids and sea snakes.Sanders, K. L., Lee, M. S. Y., Leys, R., Foster. R., & Scott Keogh, J. (2008). Molecular phylogeny and divergence dates for Australasian elapids and sea snakes (hydrophiinae): evidence from seven genes for rapid evolutionary radiations. Journal of Evolutionary Biology, 21(3), 682-695. doi: 10.1111/j.1420-9101.2008.01525.x The Simoselaps group which B. fasciolatus is a part of has a basal lineage to Australian oxyuranines. Whereas positioning of the other clade is higher, therefore suggesting that rejection of monophyly for some burrowing forms should be rejected, however more research is required to determine the acceptance of diphyly.  Ecology, distribution and habitat  Brachyurophis fasciolatus is distributed throughout mainland Australia, except Victoria, in arid and coastal zones. The subspecies B. fasciolatus fasciolatus is found within the Western regions of Australia and B. fasciolatus fasciatus is distributed throughout central Australia. The IUCN risk assessment has B. fasciolatus assessed as Least Concern, globally, and the New South Wales department of Environment & Heritage lists this species as Vulnerable. Brachyurophis fasciolatus a fossorial snake with a habitat preference of slopes and crests, sandy habitat such as savannas, deserts, grasslands and shrubland areas, including spinifex dunes.How, R. A., & Shine, R. (1999). Ecological traits and conservation biology of five fossorial ‚Äòsand- swimming‚Äô snake species (Simoselaps: Elapidae) in south-western Australia. Journal of Zoology, 249, 269-282.  Behaviour and reproduction  The narrow- banded shovel-nosed snake is a nocturnal fossorial species, burrowing in sandy habitats. This species emerges to the surface on warm nights to forage for food. Reproduction occurs via sexual reproduction. This snake is oviparous with an average clutch size of three to five eggs. Oviposition (egg-laying) and hatching occurs during the warmer months with late spring to early summer as the expected time of oviposition with eggs hatched by late summer to early autumn (January - March).  Diet and venom  The narrow-banded burrowing snake forages on the surface for small terrestrial lizards and their eggs. Prey preference appears to be towards small skinks and their eggs.Goodyear, S. E., & Pianka, E. R. (2008). Sympatric ecology of five species of fossorial snakes (Elapidae) in Western Australia. Journal of Herpetology, 42(2), 279-285. Two genus of skink are considered to be preferred prey items are Lerista and Ctenotus. These small skinks are long and slender, with often overlapping habitat use such as in Lerista sp. which are also fossorial. Whilst B. fasciolatus is a venomous snake its venom is generally considered mild to humans*. *Note: All snake bites should be treated as serious, regardless of envenoming.  Predators and threats  The IUCN Red List considers threats to this species as minimal due to its large distribution in low human populated areas. Furthermore, in New South Wales its distribution covers a small area of its total range and threats are largely described as habitat fragmentation and damage to soil from undulates and farming practices.Narrow-banded snake - profile. (2017). Retrieved from https://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/threatenedspeciesapp/profile.aspx?id=10757 Little information is available on specific predators of this species, however there are likely opportunistic predators such as other snakes and avian species.

Kirke (born 1945/1946) is a Canadian sports and entertainment lawyer, university professor, and regular commentator on radio and television. He is a graduate of the Osgoode Hall Law School, and has Bachelor of Laws and Master of Laws degrees. He has been legal counsel to the Toronto Blue Jays since 1976, and prepared the original documents which led to the team's foundation. He was involved in contract negotiations in the Eric Lindros trade, and later became a player agent representing 45 National Hockey League players. Kirke teaches law at the University of Toronto Faculty of Law, and the Osgoode Hall Law School. He has published articles on law, and authored the 1997 Players First Report on sexual abuse and harassment in ice hockey. Kirke later became the first Canadian director of the Sports Lawyers Association of America, and served as its first Canadian president. He regularly appeared as a commentator on Off the Record with Michael Landsberg and on Sportsnet 590 The Fan radio with Bob McCown. Early life Kirke grew up in Toronto, wanting to become a cowboy. His father worked in a coin- operated machine business, and his mother was a stay-at-home wife. Kirke was proficient in martial arts, and played football and baseball while in high school. Playing baseball, he lost his first base position to Peter Mahovlich. Kirke was a fan of the Toronto Maple Leafs as a youth. Kirke graduated from the University of Toronto in 1967 with a Bachelor of Arts in literature and languages. Kirke earned a Bachelor of Laws from Osgoode Hall Law School in 1969, was called to the bar in Ontario in 1971, and earned a Master of Laws from Osgoode Hall Law School in 1977. In 1985, he was called to the bar in Alberta and made a Canadian Queen's Counsel. Kirke was given an honorary Juris Doctor from the International Bar Association in 1992. Legal career =1971 to 2000= Kirke began his legal career in 1971 as a litigation lawyer with Goodman & Goodman. He was introduced to sports and entertainment law, working under Herb Solway who had ties to the Labatt Brewing Company which was active in 1977 Major League Baseball expansion discussions. Kirke prepared the original documents which led to the foundation of the Toronto Blue Jays in 1976. He remained as legal counsel and negotiated player contracts on behalf of the team. When he negotiated a contract for Doyle Alexander, the team refused to pay Alexander if he injured himself while hunting. Kirke worked out a compromise where Alexander would collect money while hurt, \\"only if he was following all hunting regulations and wearing an orange hunting jacket\\". Other notable contracts Kirke worked on include Joe Carter, Roberto Alomar, Carlos Delgado and Roger Clemens. Kirke began a teaching career in 1985 as a professor of sports law at the University of Toronto Faculty of Law in 1985, and has taught the Bachelor of Laws and Master of Laws courses at the Osgoode Hall Law School since 1987. He has also been a guest lecturer at other schools in Canada and the United States, and has been published in journals and authored legal articles. In 1991, Kirke became an advisor to Eric Lindros after Lindros was chosen first overall in the 1991 NHL Entry Draft. Kirke was involved in negotiating the player's lucrative contract after the Eric Lindros trade to the Philadelphia Flyers. Kirke later stated about the incident that, \\"There were all kinds of allegations of Eric being anti-Quebec. But I knew it to be absolutely false. It had more to do with the management of the team\\". Kirke was commissioned by the Canadian Hockey League to report on sexual abuse and harassment in 1997, and published his findings in the Players First Report. His research included interviews with teachers, social workers, psychiatrists, police, and prison inmates. Kirke stated, \\"I was surprised at how prevalent this is in society. And the second surprise is how little we know or want to know about it. It's a yucky subject\\". The report was later used as a guideline for conduct in minor ice hockey. In the year 2000, Kirke was a managing partner in Sportsco International Corporation led by Pat Gillick, which submitted the highest bid in a court-supervised auction, to purchase the SkyDome where the Toronto Blue Jays played. =2001 to present= In 2001, Kirke co-founded KSR Sports Representatives Incorporated, and began working as an agent for professional athletes. He described his work by saying, \\"as a player agent, you touch on almost every discipline or area of law you can think of: contracts, anti-trust, judicial reviews, arbitration/mediation, dissemination, immigration, tax laws, criminal ‚Äî you name it\\". Through KSR, he represented 45 National Hockey League (NHL) players, of whom Lindros was the first. Kirke later represented Mike Modano and Rick Nash. The contract which Kirke negotiated on behalf of Nash in 2002, was the most lucrative contract for an NHL rookie at the time, valued at 1.2 million USD per season plus bonuses and incentives which ranged from 8 to 12 million USD. Kirke let his license as a player lapse in 2005. Kirke later established his own barrister and solicitor practice in Toronto. He became the first Canadian director of the Sports Lawyers Association of America, and later served as its first Canadian president. He represented the Toronto Blue Jays in the 2007 George J. Mitchell investigation into performance-enhancing substances in baseball. In 2008, Kirke joined Global Resolutions, which specializes in arbitration and mediation. He represented the Toronto Maple Leafs in recruiting a new president and general manager, and the signing of Brian Burke to fill the role. Also in 2008, Kirke helped mediate negotiations between the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) and Copyright Music & Visuals regarding The Hockey Theme, a theme song used during Hockey Night in Canada since 1968, composed by Dolores Claman. Kirke has regularly appeared in media as a commentator on Off the Record with Michael Landsberg on The Sports Network, and Sportsnet 590 The Fan radio with Bob McCown. Kirke is a frequent guest on television and radio networks which include ESPN, NBC, CBC Sports, CTV Television Network, SCORE, and Sportsnet. He served on the board of directors for the 95th Grey Cup, and has a recurring role as the chairman of the Memorial Cup site selection committee. =Notable clientele= Kirke has also acted as legal counsel to professional and amateur athletes in other sports besides hockey and baseball. Notable clients include professional wrestler Bret Hart, and race car driver Kat Teasdale. He also represented Olympic athletes Donovan Bailey, Elfi Schlegel, and Tara Teigan. When Hart was suggested as a client, Kirke said \\"I sat down to get this over with and say I didn't want to represent him but he totally won me over. He was a very warm individual and he showed me poetry he wrote\\". Kirke then agreed to be his lawyer and they became good friends. Kirke has been legal counsel to sports businesspeople including, Gord Ash, Paul Beeston, John Bitove, Ken Derrett, Rick Dudley, Pat Gillick, Chris Overholt, Richard Peddie, Keith Pelley, and Tom Wright. Kirke also represented teams including the Toronto Raptors, Toronto Argonauts, and Indianapolis Colts; and sports groups including the Canadian Hockey League, Ontario Hockey League, and World Wrestling Federation. Reputation Kirke has been referred to as one of Canada's top sports lawyers by The Globe and Mail, Hockey Canada and York University. The Canadian Lawyer Magazine said that Kirke was \\"Canada‚Äôs sports lawyer extraordinaire\\". He was listed number 21 on the \\"Top 25 in Canadian sports\\" in 2000 by The Globe and Mail, and appeared on the same list three times total. Pat Gillick from the Blue Jays said of Kirke that, \\"his style kind of stood out a little bit. Gordie has kind of a low-key style, so he puts pressure on people without the people knowing that pressure had been put on them\\". Canadian radio personality Bob McCown observed of Kirke, \\"You are in the ego business. You‚Äôre dealing with enormous egos. He has no mood swings I am aware of. He's always light-hearted and joking and never makes anything out to be World War Three. With him it never gets personal. But you always feel he is not your enemy, even on the other side of the table. And that is clearly his greatest asset\\". Personal life Kirke is married with two children, and resides in Rosedale, Toronto. He has served as a volunteer director for charitable organizations including, the Canadian Centre for Ethics in Sports, Children's Aid Society, Easter Seals, Prostate Cancer Canada, Scarborough Distress Centre, Scarborough Health Network, Special Olympics, and Tennis Canada. He also went to Kandahar with the Canada men's national ice hockey team to provide entertainment to Canadian soldiers in Afghanistan.

It was written by Raphael Bob-Waksberg and directed by Amy Winfrey. The episode was released in the United States, along with the rest of season five, via Netflix on September 14, 2018. Will Arnett, who voices the show's title character as well as his father, Butterscotch, is the only speaker in the episode. The episode received critical acclaim, and is considered one of the series' best episodes. In 2019, the episode was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Animated Program at the 71st Primetime Creative Arts Emmys.  Plot  BoJack gives a eulogy at a funeral for his mother, Beatrice Horseman. Throughout, he has some patter with the organist, who sometimes plays appropriate music. He also comments about how his mother requested an open casket funeral. He refuses this request because before her death, she makes a rather gruesome face, which BoJack imitates. He ponders his mother's final words, \\"I see you\\", and what they might have meant. The title is in reference to BoJack stopping at Jack in the Box on the way to the funeral, and receiving a free churro with his order out of sympathy when he tells a cashier about his mother's death. Moreover, he gives a couple of anecdotes about Horsin' Around, and makes parallels between life and TV shows such as Maude and Becker. In addition, he speaks at length about the abuse he endured from both of his parents, as well as how his father died. In the end, he finally opens the casket, realizing that he is at the wrong funeral and has been pouring his heart out to a roomful of geckos. The entire episode consists of two monologues: the first is delivered for two minutes by Butterscotch Horseman to BoJack in a cold-open flashback; the second is for 20 minutes, delivered by BoJack at a funeral to off-screen mourners. As both characters are voiced by Will Arnett, he is the only voice actor to appear in this episode.  Reception  The episode received widespread critical acclaim from both critics and fans upon release. Les Chappell of The AV Club, who gave the episode an \\"A\\" grade, called it a \\"jaw- dropping\\" episode, and lists it among the show's best. The Washington Post's Elahe Izadi described it as \\"unlike any other the show has pulled off before\\" and \\"very unusual for TV\\", praising its unique storytelling approach. Lester Fabian Brathwaite of Observer called Arnett's voicing a \\"tour-de-force performance\\". In Bustle, Rebecca Patton praises the episode's effectiveness of showing \\"BoJack's grieving process, grappling with the awful person his mother was and wondering why he's still heartbroken\\".

For example, decay of a tritium-labeled molecule yields an ionized helium atom, which might then break off to leave a cationic molecular fragment. The technique was developed in 1963 by the Italian chemist Fulvio Cacace at the University of Rome. It has allowed the study of a vast number of otherwise inaccessible compounds and reactions. It has also provided much of our current knowledge about the chemistry of the helium hydride ion . Carbocation generation In the basic method, a molecule is prepared where the vacant bond of the desired radical or ion is satisfied by an atom of tritium , the radioactive isotope of hydrogen with mass number 3. As the tritium undergoes beta decay (with a half-life of 12.32 years), it is transformed into an ion of helium-3, creating the cation . In the decay, an electron and an antineutrino are ejected at great speed from the tritium nucleus, changing one of the neutrons into a proton with the release of 18,600 electronvolts (eV) of energy. The neutrino escapes the system; the electron is generally captured within a short distance, but far enough away from the site of the decay that it can be considered lost from the molecule. Those two particles carry away most of the released energy, but their departure causes the nucleus to recoil, with about 1.6 eV of energy. This recoil energy is larger than the bond strength of the carbon‚Äìhelium bond (about 1 eV), so this bond breaks. The helium atom almost always leaves as a neutral , leaving behind the carbocation . These events happen very quickly compared to typical molecular relaxation times, so the carbocation is usually created in the same conformation and electronic configuration as the original neutral molecule. For example, decay of tritiated methane, (R = R‚Ä≤ = R‚Ä≥ = H) produces the carbenium ion in a tetrahedral conformation, with one of the orbitals having a single unpaired electron and the other three forming a trigonal pyramid. The ion then relaxes to its more favorable trigonal planar form, with release of about 30 kcal/mol of energy‚Äîthat goes into vibrations and rotation of the ion. The carbocation then can interact with surrounding molecules in many reactions that cannot be achieved by other means. When formed within a rarefied gas, the carbocation and its reactions can be studied by mass spectrometry techniques. However the technique can be used also in condensed matter (liquids and solids). In liquid phase, the carbocation is initially formed in the same solvation state as the parent molecule, and some reactions may happen before the solvent shells around it have time to rearrange. In a crystalline solid, the cation is formed in the same crystalline site; and the nature, position, and orientation of the other reagent(s) are strictly constrained. =Radical formation= In a condensed phase, the carbocation can also gain an electron from surrounding molecules, thus becoming an electrically neutral radical. For example, in crystalline naphthalene, a molecule with tritium substituted for hydrogen in the 1 (or 2) position will be turned by decay into a cation with a positive charge at that position. That charge will however be quickly neutralized by an electron transported through the lattice, turning the molecule into the 1-naphthyl (or 2-naphthyl) radical; which are stable, trapped in the solid, below . Persistent bound structures Whereas the carbon‚Äìhelium-ion bond breaks spontaneously and immediately to yield a carbocation, bonds of other elements to helium are more stable. For example, molecular tritium or tritium-hydrogen . On decay, these form a stable helium hydride ion (respectively or ), which is stable enough to persist. This cation is claimed to be the strongest acid known, and will protonate any other molecule it comes in contact with. This is another route to creating cations that are not obtainable in other ways. In particular (or ) will protonate methane to the carbonium ion (or ). Other structures that are expected to be stable when formed by beta-decay of tritium precursors include 3HeLi+, B2H53He+, and BeH3He+ according to theoretical calculations. =Other nuclear decay processes= Radioisotopic decay of other elements besides tritium can yield other stable covalent structures. For example, the first successful synthesis of the perbromate ion was through beta decay of the selenium-83 atom in selenate: : ‚Üí + Œ≤‚àí Decay of iodine-133 to give xenon is reported as a route to phenylxenonium, and likewise decay of bismuth-210 in a variety of structures is reported as a route to organopolonium structures. as cited by Appelman (1973) Practical considerations A major difficulty in using this method in practice is that the energetic electron released by the decay of one atom of tritium can break apart, modify, ionize, or excite hundreds of other molecules in its path. These fragments and ions can further react with the surrounding molecules producing more products. Without special precautions, it would be impossible to distinguish these \\"radiolytic\\" products and reactions from the \\"nucleogenic\\" ones due to mutation and reactions of the cation . The technique developed by Cacace and his team to overcome this problem is to use a starting compound that has at least two tritium atoms substituted for hydrogens, and dilute it in a large amount of an unsubstituted compound. Then the radiolytic products will be all unlabeled, whereas the nucleogenic ones will be still labeled with tritium. The latter then can be reliably extracted, measured, and analyzed, in spite of the much larger number of radiolytic products. The high dilution also ensures that the beta electron will almost never hit another tritiated molecule. Scientific literature Many papers have been published by about this technique, chiefly by Cacace and his successors at La Sapienza. An exhaustive survey was provided by M. Speranza in 1993.

He is known for his motto: \\"In America, everything is politics, from the day you are born, until the day you die.\\" Medrano rejected contemporary views of Mexican-American social and legal whiteness, in part because of the treatment he received because of his physical appearance: he was rejected from a work position because he looked \\"too much like a Negro to be hired\\". He expressed frustration with Mexican-American leadership, such as the League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC) and the American GI Forum, for being unwilling to organize protests. Medrano had no interest in identifying as Latino, and instead embraced the label of Chicano.  Early life  Pancho Medrano in boxing attire Medrano was born on August 2, 1920, to Sabas Medrano and Nicolasa Franco at their home in the Little Mexico neighborhood of Dallas, Texas.Birth Certificate, Texas Department of Health, Bureau of Vital Statistics. Francisco Medrano, 40954. August 2, 1920. Rec'd April 11, 1942. He grew up attending Our Lady of Guadalupe Church, and was a member of the Asociacion Catolica de Jovenes (Catholic Youth Association) where a priest taught local children how to box. Medrano often spoke of his memories of experiencing discrimination in Dallas. He recalled how metal rails were built around Pike Park to keep Mexican-American and African-American children from playing at the park, and his mother had been denied service at a restaurant due to her ethnicity.Gonzales Funeral Home (April 2002) Funeral Program for Francisco F. Medrano . The Deaton-Kennedy Co. He attended St. Anne's School during his childhood and later Crozier Tech High School for a short period of time, but dropped out when the principal pulled him from class for a dress code violation because his shoes had large holes in the soles. The principal connected Medrano to a job breaking rocks at a rock quarry near Bachman Lake, where Medrano could earn money to purchase acceptable clothing. His boss at the quarry helped him into a Works Progress Administration (WPA) school, and through his training he gained employment at a North American Aviation plant. There he was introduced to semi-professional boxing and union work. He began boxing during his 40-minute lunch breaks as a local light heavyweight, and eventually becoming the heavyweight champion at North American Aviation.  Labor activism  Medrano was introduced to union work when organizers distributed literature at the plant gates. He worked with organizers to create a union at the plant and lost his job for doing so. The Local 645 of the United Auto Workers-Congress of Industrial Organizations (UAW-CIO) was formed in 1943, and Medrano was reinstated at his job. He was later elected Sergeant at Arms for Local 645 (which became Local 848 in 1962), and in 1955 was elected as a trustee. Medrano left his job to become a full-time UAW official in 1963. Medrano campaign leaflets, Sergeant at Arms for UAW Local 645 In 1967, Medrano was assigned to work in Starr County to advance labor rights. He served as UAW representative at the picket lines in Starr County, and was present in the county as violence between the Texas Rangers and picketers escalated. Acts of violence occurred, included beatings of picketers by Texas Rangers during arrests. Medrano had been arrested during one of these conflicts while taking photos of Texas Rangers arresting union picketers. The camera was opened by a Texas Ranger who alleged that he was determining if the camera was a weapon. Medrano was punched in the face as he was being arrested. In 1968, Medrano filed a civil suit alleging that the Texas Rangers, Starr County officers and officials, and local farmers had conspired to break the unions working in Starr County, and that Texas laws that were enforced during labor disputes were unconstitutional. The plaintiffs of this suit, Medrano v. A Y Allee, were Medrano, the United Farm Workers Organizing Committee, the AFL-CIO, and picketers. Defendants were the Texas Rangers, State of Texas officers, and other public officials from Starr County, including Texas Ranger Captain A. Y. Allee. The Supreme Court of the United States ruled in favor of Medrano and his fellow plaintiffs, concluding that Articles 5154d, ¬ß 1 and 5154f of Vernon's Texas Civil Statutes and Articles 439, 474 and 482 of the Texas Penal Code were unconstitutional, thus rendering them null and void. The court also restrained the defendants from interfering with the plaintiff's civil rights and the civil rights of the class they represented. The case would be argued again at the Supreme Court in 1973-1974.  Civil rights and political activism  Until his retirement from the UAW, Medrano served as representative at several meetings with high-profile politicians and civic leaders. In 1977, he visited President Jimmy Carter at the White House as part of a 15-member UAW delegation. In October 1979, Medrano was called to attend a White House reception because of his work with the Medrano v. Allee lawsuit and his work with farm workers and undocumented migrants. He met Pope John Paul II at the reception and took a paper he had written for the Pope to read as well as religious artifacts from community members for the Pope to bless. Medrano called the meeting the chance of a lifetime, and possibly the most important pilgrimage in his life. Various sources also place Medrano at the Selma and Birmingham marches led by Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., protecting Lyndon B. Johnson during his visit to Dallas in 1960, and working with Cesar Chavez in Texas. Pancho Medrano and Cesar Chavez in Rio Grande City, Texas In 1954, prominent Dallas Mexican Americans, including Medrano and Joe Landin, founded a Dallas chapter of the American GI Forum. Medrano and activist Guadalupe Delesma requested that a school in the Dallas Independent School District be named after a Mexican American in 1970. = Trinity River Massacre Raid = Medrano rose in prominence in Dallas following the shooting of Mr. and Mrs. Thomas Rodriguez in 1971. Thomas Rodriguez and his wife were shot by Dallas policemen who raided their apartment while searching for a suspect in the murders of three other Dallas policemen on February 15, 1971, which became known as the Trinity River Massacre. Medrano paid Thomas Rodriguez's bond. At a vigil held for the family on March 6, Medrano explained that outside pressure discouraging people from attending the vigil, fear, and not knowing that people could take a stand for their rights resulted in fewer than 100 attendees at the vigil. According to Medrano, church groups and Mexican- American organizations had been urged to attend the vigil and to visit the Rodriguez family to no avail. Instead, the first visitors and supporters of the Rodriguez family were members of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference. Mexican-American Progressive Association member Frances Arredondo echoed his statements on the community being too afraid to take action. Later reports disputed Medrano's report that no church members or representatives visited the Rodriguez family. State Representative Paul Moreno of El Paso arrived in Dallas on March 11 to show his support for the Rodriguez family and hold a press conference with the community. In an article regarding his visit, Medrano was quoted as urging the community to vote against members of the Citizens Charter Association, an organization that worked closely with Dallas businesses and politicians. Medrano claimed that Dallas Sheriff Clarence Jones was not listening to the community and continued to ignore requests to discuss problems with the community. He reached out to the office of Senator Birch Bayh, who then became involved in addressing police violence against Mexican Americans in Texas. Bayh received allegations of shootings in Brownsville, Pharr, San Antonio, and Dallas, and stated that there was a need for a thorough and impartial investigation of the reported incidents by the Department of Justice. On March 21, Medrano directed a march during the Shrine Spring Parade in support of the Rodriguez family. Around 200 marchers participated. Throughout the ensuing actions taken after the shooting, Medrano worked to build interracial solidarity, and worked with Dallas leaders such as Al Lipscomb and Ed Polk. = Shooting of Santos Rodriguez = Following the police shooting of Santos Rodriguez in 1973, Medrano became active in community responses and protests in Santos' memory. Medrano directed crowds at the Reverchon Park rally held in honor of Santos in 1978. At the rally, he addressed the crowd as a representative of the UAW, applauding the community response to the rally and noting that Santos' name would live on. = Statewide activities = In January 1975, Medrano became a member of the executive committee of the newly-formed Tejano Political Action Committee (Tex-PAC). The Austin-based group was led by Leonel J. Castillo, Comptroller of the City of Houston. The purpose of the group was to promote equal- opportunity legislation and educate members of the Mexican-American community of the importance of political involvement.  Personal life  Medrano's father, Sabas Medrano, died sometime in his thirties in circumstances unknown to his family. Medrano recounted in an oral history interview that his father was allegedly arrested by Dallas police officers behind a fire station on Laws and McKinney Streets, near where Medrano was born. The family never saw Sabas again, and at the time of the interview, did not know where he was buried. Medrano's mother went on to marry a man named Pedro Centeno. Pancho Medrano married Esperanza Jimenez, and they had five children: Francisco Jr., Roberto, Ricardo, Rolando, and Pauline. Roberto served as a Dallas ISD trustee for 13 years until he lost an election in 1986. Ricardo was on the Dallas City Council from 1979 to 2003, and served as president of the Dallas Brown Berets for a time. Pauline was on the council from 2005 to 2013. She served as Dallas Mayor Pro Tem from 2011 to 2013, and is a graduate of University of Texas at Arlington. Rolando is also a graduate of UT Arlington, and earned his master's degree from Southern Methodist University. The children were often brought into political activities since their childhood, and political activities became family affairs. Francisco Jr.'s son, Adam Medrano, was elected to the Dallas City Council District 2 seat in 2013, and serves as Mayor Pro Tem. Several of Medrano's children and peers were interviewed by Texas Christian University for a project called Civil Rights in Black and Brown, and spoke of his story and legacy. Dallas ISD's Francisco \\"Pancho\\" Medrano Middle School is named after him. Medrano died on April 4, 2002. The funeral was at Gonz√°les Funeral Home, rosary at the Hall of State in Fair Park, and services at Cathedral Santuario de Guadalupe, 2215 Ross Ave. He was buried at Calvary Hill Cemetery and Mausoleum in Dallas.

It is named for the Hovander family, who immigrated from Sweden to the property in 1898 and designed the farmhouse, barn, and other buildings, some of which include distinctive architectural features.Hovander Family and Park Papers, Center for Pacific Northwest Studies, Heritage Resources, Western Washington University, Bellingham WA. The homestead was owned by the Hovander family until 1969 when the Whatcom County government purchased the land from Hokan Hovander's son, Otis, and it officially became a county park in 1971. The park has been preserved to show the lives of 20th- century pioneers in the Northwest, as well as to preserve the history of the Hovander family.Jacoby, Jill, Hovander Park Ranger, interview, March 2, 2019. Hovander Homestead Park was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1974. With Campbell et al., Environmental and Social Impact, 2. In 1978, the park received the National Trust for Historic Preservation award for the preservation of a significant and historic site. Hovander family Hokan (also spelled Hakan and Holan in various sources) Hovander, an immigrant from Sk√•ne, Sweden, moved to the Pacific Northwest with his wife Louisa Leontine Johansdatter Lof and several children in 1897.Cyr, Hovander Homestead Research Manual, 19‚Äì22, 27. Hovander, an architect and bricklayer, initially settled in Seattle but later moved to Ferndale with his family to farm the land.Cyr, 29. He arrived in Ferndale in 1898 and paid $4,000 ($ in 2018) for on the Nooksack River that was purchased from Betsey Nielson.Cyr, 31. The property included two log cabins, farm animals, and farm equipment.See note 29.  Farmhouse  Hovander Farmhouse In June 1899, Hovander finished his plan for the house and ordered 52,000 board feet of fir and cedar.Cyr, Hovander Homestead Research Manual, 36. All of this wood was soaked in linseed oil for two years to cure,Cyr, 41. which has led to the wood not needing treatment since. In spring 1901, the building of the house began, and the carpentry work was finished by Carl Lindgren, a Swede.Cyr, Hovander Homestead Research Manual, 39. Hovander Farmhouse Interior In the late 19th century, it was common in the Northwest for settlers to imitate the style of architecture from their previous homes. Many aspects of Scandinavian architecture are present within the house, including the egg and dart trim design, representing fertility, modified to fit a traditional geometric Scandinavian artistic design.Cyr, 29. Another example is the Star of David openwork design on the porch railings, a very popular design of that time period.Cyr, 40. Additional examples of Scandinavian influence include the linseed oil treatment, large and open rooms with windows and doorways that are in proportion to the size of the room, and high ceilings.Cyr, 40-41. There are no fireplaces in the farmhouse, and it is known to be one of the first houses in Whatcom County to utilize a central heating system. Hovander designed the house with doors between each room that can open and close in multiple directions to direct the flow of heat throughout the house.See note 40. The house was completed in 1903, and had with three bedrooms, a library, a dining room, and a kitchen.  The barn  Hovander Barn At the same time that Hovander was planning and designing the farmhouse, he was also planning the barn.Cyr, Hovander Homestead Research Manual, 48. While the farmhouse is representative of Swedish architecture, Hovander's design for the barn was influenced by the barn designs he saw in the United States.Cyr, 49. Hovander disliked the common Swedish barn design of the time, as they were typically small, and was instead fascinated with the size and loft design of barns that he had seen in the United States.See note 44. He designed the barn as a large space with a high ceiling, and hired men from Bellingham to build it.See note 44. Hokan painted the barn with a mixture of oil and iron rich soil which oxidized to a dull red, a practice that reportedly originated in Scandinavia.Cyr, 53. The Hovander Homestead is built on the Nooksack River's flood lands and Hokan had to account for the natural landscape by building the barn and the house on raised platforms.Hovander Barn Interior  Hovander homestead The Hovanders soon began farming the land after moving into the log cabins on the property.Cyr, Hovander Homestead Research Manual, 31. The family's first crop was oats, but later they also farmed sweet corn, hay, dried fruit, and pork.Cyr, 31.Cyr, 35. Two fruit orchards came with the property, and the apple orchard is present at the park today.Cyr, 31. The family members also made their own soap and candles.See note 53.Hovander Family and Park Papers, Western Washington University. Leontine was trained as a cook in Sweden and cooked for the family and the hired hands on the farm.Cyr, Hovander Homestead Research Manual, 35. It was tradition for Swedish women to take over and manage the farm whenever their husband was not at the farm, so Leontine was well-known and respected by the farm workers.Cyr, 35. The Hovander children attended school in Ferndale and they would walk along pioneer trails or row across the river to get into town.Cyr, 36. Not long after arriving in Ferndale, Hovander began building a Holstein dairy herd from the 12 cows that came with the homestead.See note 58. By 1919, the herd had grown to over 50 cows, but the entire herd contracted tuberculosis from an unknown source and had to be culled.Cyr, 63. The Hovanders then replaced the Holsteins with Guernseys.Cyr, 64. Due to his deteriorating health, Hokan Hovander died in 1915, but his family continued to run the farm.Cyr, 61. Eight years after the cows died, the two youngest Hovanders, Vera and Ada, both came down with tuberculosis.Cyr, 65. Ada recovered, but Vera died in 1929.See note 63. Leontine died, at 77 years old, a few years later in 1936.See note 63. After the death of their sister and mother, Otis, Charles, and Angelo operated the farm adding raspberries, sugar beets, and chickens to the farm products.Cyr, 66. Otis was the last Hovander to live on the farm and he continued the Hovander legacy until 1971.See note 66.  County park  In 1969, the Hovander homestead was purchased for $60,000 by Whatcom County Parks and Recreation.Cyr, 83. Otis lived in the house until 1971 when the park officially opened to the public, and he died in 1979.Campbell et al., Environmental and Social Impact, 2.Cyr, Hovander Homestead Research Manual, 83. Between 1969 and 1971, much effort was put into repairing and improving the house and the barn so that they could be transformed for public visitation.Cyr, 85. The farm tools and most of the items in the farmhouse on display were used by the family.Cyr, 89. Eventually, animals were moved in to help finish the homestead environment of the park.Cyr, 94. = The demonstration garden = Hovander Demonstration Garden In the following years, a demonstration garden was installed to show what the Hovander's garden may have looked like, and to provide landscaping for all the area directly surrounding the farmhouse. The demonstration garden is currently maintained through Whatcom County Parks and Recreation as well as the Washington State University Extension Service and the Master Gardener Foundation.See note 74. The garden is experimental and used for teaching.Cyr, Hovander Homestead Research Manual, 96. The produce that is grown is given to the local food bank.Cyr, 96.  Tennant Lake  The Tennant Lake section of the park includes an interpretive center, fragrance garden, wildlife viewing tower and boardwalk with viewing platforms that is built over the wetlands adjacent to the lake. A support organization, Friends of Tennant Lake and Hovander Homestead Park, notes that visitors may see bald eagles, coots, ospreys, swallows, ducks and great blue herons.

It formed a low barrier, separating the brackish tidal water found downstream from the fresh water found above it, and in doing so provided potable water for the young settlement. Pre-settlement history The Falls, called Yarra Yarra were important to the local Aboriginal tribes, the Woiwurrung and the Boonerwrung, who used it as a crossing point between their lands, in order to negotiate trade and marriages. The location was also used to meet the other three members of the Kulin Tribe, in order to settle disputes, trade and hold corroborees. European history In June 1835 John Batman arrived at Yarra Falls and immediately recognized it as the site of a new village, the only one of Australia's Capital Cities to have been identified as so before its founding. In 1839 a dam was built upon the falls using convict labour in order to secure the fresh water supply for the growing city, but did not last long, nor did its replacement. In 1845 a bridge was built at the site by a private company, but this was replaced by a government funded Prince's Bridge in 1850, which was to stand until the demolition of the Falls, despite an attempt by \\"some scoundrel\\" to sabotage it by sawing through several of its supporting columns. The only son of John Batman, Charles Batman, drowned in 1845 at the falls his father had discovered while fishing. Demolition In 1879 Sir John Coode declared that the Falls must be demolished in order to prevent a repeat of previous floods by allowing free discharge of upstream water during heavy rains. After a delay of almost four years, this process was begun by the Harbour Trust by removing the previously constructed dam, but the removal of the natural obstructions through the use of dynamite was delayed by another month due to the trust being unwilling to risk accidental damage to the Prince's Bridge without formal indemnification from the Department of Public Works. The plan was to clear the reef to a uniform depth of 15 feet 6 inches, at an estimate cost of ¬£20,000, with the existing depth being varied, with the highest points touching the surface of the water and the lowest reaching down to 15 feet, and the demolition was complete by 1883, having been funded by a combination of the Victorian Government and the Harbour Trust.

Work  Lepore's work has investigated the frictions created by the containment and cultural representation of nature. His early work explored people's relationships with animals, focusing his lens on people with their pets, and on animal surgeries and rehabilitation. An extended project called \\"Bird Shop\\" consisted of the portraits of passersby gazing into a bird shop window from a busy street in New York City. Beginning in 2007, Lepore photographed in the visitor centers of National Parks, creating images of displays that challenge the expectations of landscape photography. Describing his images made in these visitor centers, Sarah Lehrer-Graiwer wrote in Artforum that \\"Lepore homes in on places of rupture that break and undermine photographic illusion.\\" In more recent works, Lepore has further investigated the relationship of photography to illusionistic representation and invention. For a 2010 exhibition at the Los Angeles Central Library, Lepore created a scaled-down recreation of one of the library's glass cases. Embedded in the larger case, the sculpture's surface was mounted with photographs of the glass case, which had been filled with library books on the topic of the human body and propagation. \\"Lepore's installation casts the viewer deep into a surreal and uncanny scene by contrasting sculptural anthropomorphism with the odd precision of photographic representation.\\" Regarding Lepore's still lives, Joanna Szupinska-Myers wrote that \\"by echoing the effects of digital editing‚Äîconstructing what he refers to as an ‚Äúanalog illusion‚Äù‚ÄîLepore‚Äôs photograph speaks in a language that it simultaneously subverts.\\"  Exhibitions  *Performance Anxiety, Moskowitz Bayse, Los Angeles, 2019 *Seeing Each Other, with Michael Henry Hayden, Left Field Gallery, Los Osos, 2018 * The Green Curtain, with Michael Henry Hayden, Del Vaz Projects, Los Angeles, 2017 *Splash, Glow, Fullflex at the Bikini Factory, Public Fiction, Los Angeles, 2015 *Bikini Factory, Ghebaly Gallery, Los Angeles, 2015 *Sleepyhead, The Finley, Los Angeles, 2015 *Flash, California Museum of Photography, Riverside, 2014 *New Wilderness, Ghebaly Gallery, Los Angeles, 2011 *New Wilderness Part Two, M+B Gallery, Los Angeles, 2011 *Paper Surrogate, works sited, Los Angeles Central Library, 2010 *Restoration, Kemper Museum of Contemporary Art, Kansas City, 2008 *Bird Shop, Marvelli Gallery, New York, 2007 *I Would Make You My Own, Marvelli Gallery, New York, 2006 *  Permanent collections  * J.

The assessment tool was created by Crowell and Feldman for use in a study. The tool, which includes seven activities for the parent-child dyad to complete, is used for both preventive and clinical purposes. Crowell and Feldman's 1988 piece introducing the Crowell Method has been cited in over 500 studies. The assessment procedure has also been proven to be a reliable measure in discriminating between clinical and non-clinical dyads. The procedure is also known as the Crowell Parent-Child Interaction Procedure and the Crowell Problem Solving Procedure Rating Scale.  Creation  Originally, Crowell and Feldman modified a pre-existing problem-solving session made for 24- and 42- month old children in order to examine relationships between mothers' internal working models and their children's behavioral and developmental statuses. The research pair developed the task to include all of the children in the study, who ranged from 24-52 months. The goal of the procedure was to examine caregivers and their children to determine their enjoyment with one another in a play setting and their ability to work as a pair. The procedure also allows researchers to observe any preparation used for transitions and the child's subsequent reactions.  Procedure  The assessment consists of seven activities. Throughout the tasks, the parent and child are alone in a room together. They are observed either through a one-way mirror or using video recording. The focus of the observation is on the parent and child's interaction with one another. The procedure begins with the parent and child engaging in unstructured free play for ten minutes. Then they engage in a five-minute cleanup period. Following cleanup, two to four developmentally graded tasks are completed at the pair's pace. The tasks increase in difficulty so that the latter tasks cannot be completed without assistance from a caregiver. Lastly, a two-minute separation and reunion occurs.  Scoring  Parents' are rated on a 7-point scale titled \\"mother's help and support.\\" The scale was originally created by averaging two other measures recorded on a 7-point scale. The first was supportive presence, which was analyzed by examining whether a mother provides a secure base for the child to explore and return to and whether the mother values the child's experience more than the child's performance. The second measure was the quality of the assistance provided for the developmental tasks. The major criteria for assessing the quality of assistance were helping the child understand what they were to accomplish and providing only minimal support for the child to complete the task. The child's behavior is scored on 7-point scales for enthusiasm, persistence, self-reliance, affection, negativity, avoidance, controlling behavior, anxiety, and compliance. However, other texts describe only seven items for rating children's behavior: positive affect, withdrawn/depressed, irritability/anger, noncompliance, aggression toward parent, enthusiasm, and task persistence.Heller, S., Aoki, Y., & Sheffner, X. (1999). Revision of the Crowell parent-child relationship scale. New Orleans: Tulane University Medical Center. Moreover, recent works suggest that the multiple rating scales from the Crowell procedure can be condensed into two scales, one for the parent and one for the child. The caregiver is rated on overall responsiveness while the child is rated on their affective presentation. These scales are defined using the representative items that were originally measured on Crowell and Feldman's rating scales. An analysis of these scales indicated high internal consistency, providing support for their reliability. The researchers suggest that in future models the two scores could be combined in order to provide a picture of the pair's overall functioning.  Practical use  The assessment has been used for children as young as 12-months and as old as 7 years-old. However, the assessment was designed for children ages 24-52 months, or preschool aged. The assessment is used to diagnose attachment disorders in caregiver-child dyads. It is able to discriminate between clinical and non-clinical dyads and can identify differences between maltreated and healthy children. The assessment is used to identify pairs that need intervention or may need intervention in the future. It is also useful to assess the efficacy of intervention after its implementation.  Modifications  Over the years since its original development, the steps of the procedure have been altered for use in other clinical and experimental settings. One addition to the procedure is the inclusion of a bubble-blowing task after the clean-up period. In studies examining children with PTSD and in studies observing individuals who are survivors of incest, the separation/reunification phase has been excluded. The Crowell procedure has also been adapted for children under the age of one year old. Although they are not verbal and not proficiently mobile, a majority of the activities can still be replicated for use with infants. The focus of the modified activities is on social, face-to-face interactions. Different tasks are used for the teaching portions of the procedure, but the activity is still used to evaluate parental expectations and the abilities of the parent to guide their child's learning.

Its primary business is focused on exploring, developing, and producing oil, gas, and minerals products. Currently, it's a diversified holding company with interests in real estate, financial industry, mineral extraction, and infrastructure development.  History  One of the leading conglomerates in the Philippines, the Philodrill Corporation was established on June 26, 1969. It is considered one of the pioneers in the industry of oil exploration in the country, and its headquarter is located in Mandaluyong City, Philippines. In 1989, its petition to amend its primary business purpose to become a diversified holding company was approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The move was meant to cushion the risks associated with the petroleum industry. However, it again petitioned the SEC to make petroleum exploration and production as its primary purpose while retaining the holding company as secondary purpose, which was permitted on April 13, 2009. The SEC approved its application to renew its corporate term for the next 50 years on January 18, 2018, with the new term taking effect by June 25, 2019. In 2006, the company announced that it's divesting its interest in Penta Capital Investment Corporation, an investment house that provides money management services including underwriting services, in order to focus on the core business of oil exploration. The PSE and SEC approved its stock rights offering worth 38.37 billion stock rights, with the offer scheduled in 2009. When the government opened the Fourth Philippine Energy Contracting Round, the Philodrill Corporation formed consortium with Philex Mining Corporation, Philex Petroleum Corporation, and Pitkin Petroleum Plc of UK in 2012. to bid for new oil and gas blocks.

The Alakor Corpation, which is led by the Ramos family, owns 9.07% or 17.5 billion shares. As a public company, it is one of the 55 firms judged Shariah-compliant by the Philippine Stock Exchange.  Petroleum explorations  The company signed various contracts that cover production, exploration, and geophysical survey in the country with the Philippine government through the office of the Department of Energy (DOE). Its exploration activities are located in offshore Palawan and onshore Mindoro areas, which is under service contract SC 53. It has interests in 11 service contracts with the government, including SC14C1 located offshore in the northwestern waters of Palawan that also covered the Galoc oil field, the country's sole producer of oil of commercial scale. Moreover, the company is under DOE's service contracts SC 6A and SC 6B in Octon and Bonita, which are both located in northern Palawan, as well as SC 14A & B in Nido, Matinloc, and north Matinloc. The Nido block (producing 18.82 million barrels), Matinlo block (12.14 million barrels), and North Matinloc (2.22 million barrels) are all located in northwest Palawan. In addition, it conducts active petroleum exploration and production in offshore South Sulu Sea under the service contract SC 41 and the Swan Block, which is in the deepwater in northwest Palawan.  Business interests  As an investment holding company, the company has interests in investments in other industries aside from petroleum such as real estate, mining, venture capital and financial services. It owns a 40% stake at Penta Capital Investment Corporation. An investment institution, Penta Capital Investment Corporation is majority shareholder (98.75%) of the capital company Penta Capital Finance Corporation.

Early life  Feeney was born Jacqulyn-Joanne Barbara Feeney on 28 March 1974, to Robynne Andersen. Career Feeney began her radio career doing six weeks of work experience at Energy FM in New Plymouth at the age of 15. Over the next two years, she helped out with station promotions. At one point, she donated $50 to charity to go on air with Heemi Hill on Radio Taranaki for half an hour, and ended up staying on air for four hours. She left school at the end of sixth form and studied towards a certificate in Media Studies at Taranaki Polytechnic, while continuing to work at Energy FM; she had her first on-air break in February 1991, when the usual 1 am - 7 am weekend host didn't show up. She was later given the Monday-Friday midnight - 6 am shift, then a couple of weeks later, promoted to 7 pm - midnight. In 1994, she moved to The Breeze in Hamilton, where she hosted the drive show. She then left four months later, to host the drive show (2 pm - 7 pm) on eight-week-old station The Edge, where she started on air on 26 September 1994. In May 1995, she moved to host breakfast (6 am - 10 am) with Malcolm Paul, and drive (10 am - 2 pm) by herself.

It runs for almost along Gull Road between the northeast side of Kalamazoo and continues through rural areas on the way to Richland. The highway was created in January 2019 from a section of M-43 after that highway was rerouted in the aftermath of a series of jurisdictional transfers in downtown Kalamazoo. It had been a part of the state highway system for a century under its previous number until it was given its current designation. Route description M-343 starts where Gull Road intersects Riverview Drive east of the Kalamazoo River in Kalamazoo. From there, the highway follows Gull Road northeasterly past Riverside Cemetery and Borgess Medical Center on the northeast side of Kalamazoo. M-343 passes a number of commercial properties as it exits Kalamazoo and enters farmland. As the highway approaches Richland, there are additional businesses flanking the roadway. M-343 then turns due east along D Avenue for a short distance before terminating at an intersection with M-89 in the middle of Richland. One section of M-343 was listed on the National Highway System (NHS) when the highway was part of M-43. This section is between the highway's western terminus at Riverview Drive and Sprinkle Road in Comstock Township. The NHS is a network of a network of highways that are considered important to the country's economy, defense, and mobility. History M-343 in Richland, May 2019 Passage of the State Reward Trunk Line Highways Act on May 13, 1913, provided for of roadways in a state-financed system. No division of the original system included Gull Road between Kalamazoo and Richland, but it was included as a state reward road by the following year. In 1919, the state highway system was signposted for the first time, and Gull Road was first signed as a state highway that year as a part of M-43. The section closest to Kalamazoo was paved, while the remainder was a gravel roadway. By September 1924, it was shown as fully paved on state maps. In 2018, planners with the City of Kalamazoo negotiated with MDOT a transfer of the jurisdiction of several streets in the city's downtown. The goal was to give the city greater control, allowing Kalamazoo to convert one-way streets to two-way traffic, lower traffic speeds and giving the city flexibility on permitting and parking. On January 7, 2019, the City of Kalamazooo accepted jurisdiction over those streets from MDOT, ending their status as state trunklines. As a result, MDOT rerouted M-43 out of downtown Kalamazoo, running along US Highway 131 west of Kalamazoo north to Plainwell and then southeasterly along M-89 back to its previous alignment at Richland. The segment of highway retained by the state along Gull Road was renumbered M-343 afterwards. The number was given an odd initial digit to signify that the highway is a spur of M-43; M-143 was taken by a highway in East Lansing. Signage reflecting the change was erected in August 2019.

Fourteen of the people executed had been convicted in relation to their participation in the 2011‚Äì12 Saudi Arabian protests in Qatif, mostly on the basis of torture-induced confessions. The executions were carried out by beheading, and two of the bodies were left on public display. According to Saudi Arabia's Interior Ministry the convicts were all Saudi nationals. Thirty-two of those executed belonged to the country's Shia minority.  Background  Conflict between Saudi authorities and Qatif residents dates back to at least the 1979 Qatif Uprising. The conflict reemerged between Saudi authorities and political protestors during the 2011‚Äì12 Saudi Arabian protests and continued through to the 2017‚Äì19 Qatif unrest. The conflict involves peaceful protestors as well as armed confrontations between residents and Saudi authorities, siege barricades erected by the authorities in Awamiyah and attempted destruction of residential areas by the authorities. The \\"Qatif 24 case\\" was a Saudi legal case concerning 24 Qatif region protestors. Fourteen of the people executed on 23 April 2019 were among the \\"Qatif 24\\", including Mujtaba al-Sweikat and Munir al-Adam. Human Rights Watch stated that the most of convictions were based on confessions obtained under torture. Another eleven of the people executed had been convicted in the \\"Iran spy case\\". Both the 14 of the Qatif 24 case and 11 in the Iran spy case had been convicted by the Specialized Criminal Court, which conducts trials for alleged terrorists and human rights activists. The European Saudi Organisation for Human Rights (ESOHR) followed the cases of many of the detainees prior to their execution. Among these, none of the detainees were allowed access to lawyers during the arrest and investigation stages of their cases, and 21 of them had their confessions extracted under duress and torture. Both ESOHR and CNN obtained access to many of the court records. CNN stated that it had \\"hundreds of pages of documents from three 2016 trials involving 25\\" of the executees. CNN described the \\"Qatif 24 case\\" as involving charges related to the 2011‚Äì12 Saudi Arabian protests of the Arab Spring. It said that the fourteen executees among the \\"Qatif 24\\" were all charged with \\"joining a terror cell\\" and all denied the charge. Nader al-Sweikat, father of executee Mujtaba al-Sweikat of the \\"Qatif 24\\", stated that \\"only few of the 24 men committed real crimes\\". Both ESOHR and CNN concluded that the prosecution's cases were mostly based on false confessions.  Executions  On 23 April 2019, Saudi Arabia's Interior Ministry stated that Saudi men had been executed that day for the \\"terrorism related crimes\\" of \\"adopting terrorist and extremist thinking and [of] forming terrorist cells to corrupt and destabilize security\\". Thirty two of those executed belonged to the country's Shia minority. The executions, which were carried out by beheading, were conducted in the capital Riyadh, the Muslim holy cities of Mecca and Medina, the central province of Al-Qassim, Shia- populated Eastern Province and the southern province of Asir. The bodies of two of the executed men were publicly displayed on a pole for several hours as a warning to others. This was described by the Daily Times as \\"[sparking] controversy because of its grisly display\\". According to Amnesty International, many of the families of Shia Muslims executed in the mass execution had not been informed in advance and were shocked to learn of the news. Among the executions was that of a young man who was convicted of a crime that took place while he was under the age of 18, Abdulkareem al-Hawaj, a young Shi'a man who was arrested at the age of 16 and convicted of offences related to his involvement in anti-government protests. According to United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet, \\"at least three of those killed were minors at the time of their sentencing\\", in violation of international law that prohibits the use of the death penalty against anyone under the age of 18.  Executees  One of the executees, Hussein al-Humaidy, was severely pressured prior to his sentencing and execution. Al-Humaidy confirmed to the judge, as officially recorded, that \\"severe psychological and physical pressure\\" was used during interrogations. Nine among the executees who provided forced confessions and/or were tortured included the following: * Hussein al-Abboud was charged with giving information to Iranian authorities about the Qatif conflict, participating in the conflict, and meeting with Ali Khamenei. Al-Abboud stated that his confession was false and forced, and that he had been threatened with torture. * Munir al-Adam, a minor, lost his hearing in one ear as a result of torture. According to ESOHR, he was punished for exercising \\"fundamental human rights such as freedom of assembly\\". During the trial, al-Adam said that his confession was false, stating, \\"Those aren't my words. I didn't write a letter. This is defamation written by the interrogator with his own hand.\\" * Sheikh Mohammad Attiya was pressured to sign a confession against his will. * Abbas al-Hassan was accused of spying for Iran and physically tortured by beatings and sleep deprivation as well as psychologically tortured by threats to arrest his family. * Abdulkarim al- Hawaj, a minor, was tortured during his detainment, with methods including beatings, electric shocks and being kicked with heavy shoes. * Hussein Mohammed al-Musallam denied his confession during his trial, stating, \\"Nothing in these confessions is correct and I cannot prove that I was forced to do it. But there are medical reports from the prison hospital of Dammam and I ask your honor to summon them. They show the effects of torture on my body.\\" * Yusuf Abdullah al-Omri was pressured into signing a confession by being insulted and slapped. The presiding judge refused to refer to a videotape of the confession. * Salman Quraysh, a minor, was tortured by beatings, electric shocks and by being forced to take hallucinogenic pills, and was hospitalised four times as a result of the torture. * Mujtaba al-Sweikat was tortured and signed a false confession. Mujtaba al-Sweikat was a minor at the time of his arrest on 12 August 2012, while trying to fly to the United States to study at Western Michigan University. During his investigation, al-Sweikat was hung by his hands, beaten with wires and hoses, stubbed with cigarettes, slapped and beaten with shoes, and left with insufficient heating during the winter. He was given a choice between signing a false confession or returning to the investigation; he chose to sign the false confession to avoid further torture. According to al-Sweikat's father, who defended him in court, the case against Mujtaba was intended to \\"create the illusion of a terror cell\\", which in reality did not exist. Al-Sweikat's father said that his son participated in the Qatif demonstrations only twice, and for only five minutes each time.  Reactions  * Human Rights Watch quickly condemned the killings: \\"Today's mass execution of mostly Shia citizens is a day we have feared for several years,\\" said Adam Coogle, Middle East researcher at HRW. * Amnesty International condemned the executions, labeling them \\"a chilling demonstration of the authorities' disregard for human life.\\" Lynn Maalouf, Middle East Research Director at Amnesty International, described these executions as a political tool for suppressing Shi'a opponents in Saudi Arabia and said that \\"It is also yet another gruesome indication of how the death penalty is being used as a political tool to crush dissent from within the country‚Äôs Shia minority.\\" Amnesty International's Middle East and North Africa advocacy director, Philippe Nassif, stated that mass executions and human rights abuses increased during the leadership of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. He said that in the context of negative United States foreign policy towards Iran, Saudi Arabian authorities justify their local and international attacks on Shiite communities by claiming that they are opposing Iranian influence. * Iran's foreign minister Mohammad Javad Zarif criticised the administration of US President Donald Trump for making no comments on the mass execution. He referred to Trump's support for Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and said that \\"Membership in the #B_team ‚ÄîBolton, Bin Salman, Bin Zayed & 'Bibi‚Äî gives immunity for any crime.\\" See also * Capital punishment in Saudi Arabia * 2017‚Äì19 Saudi Arabian purge * 2016 Saudi Arabia mass execution * 2018‚Äì2019 Saudi crackdown on feminists References 21st-century executions by Saudi Arabia Prisoners sentenced to death by Saudi Arabia 2019 in Saudi Arabia Political and cultural purges People executed by Saudi Arabia Human rights abuses in Saudi Arabia History of Saudi Arabia Political repression in Saudi Arabia Massacres in Saudi Arabia ","title":"2019 Saudi Arabia mass execution"},{"id":"60575665","text":"Fontainea fugax is a shrub endemic to Queensland, in the family, Euphorbiaceae, growing up to 4 m. In 1997, F. fugax was considered \\"endangered\\" having been found in only in the central Burnett district and within an endangered community, threatened by weeds, repeated fires and clearing. Description Fontainea fugax is a dioecious shrub growing to 4 m. The stems have a clear exudate. New shoots have sparse, antrorse (upward pointing) trichomes. There are no stipules and the leaves have petioles. The upper surfaces of the leaves are dark-green and the lower surfaces, pale- green. This plant is very like Fontainea rostrata, but differs in that the base of the petiole is not swollen; the male flowers are shorter than those of F. rostrata (6-8 mm vs 11-13 mm); the number of stamens is 24 (versus 28-40); the beak of the endocarp is shorter (1-1.7 mm vs 2-3 mm) and the faces between the sutures of the endocarp are weakly corrugated (weakly rugose versus strongly rugose). Distribution and habitat Fontainea fugax is known only from an area between Gayndah and Mundubbera, in south-east Queensland, with plants growing as understorey shrubs in a semi-evergreen vine thicket dominated by Backhousia kingii. Taxonomy and naming The plant was first described by Paul Irwin Forster in \\"Three new species of Fontainea Heckel (Euphorbiaceae) from Australia and Papua New Guinea\\".

McQuaid (1920 ‚Äì 16 September 1991) was an Irish road racing cyclist and later cycling administrator, coach and team manager from Dungannon, County Tyrone, Northern Ireland, for most of his life based in Dublin, Ireland. From a family that became prominent in Irish cycling, he raced competitively, co- founded a cycle racing club. and served on the committee of the national cycling federation. Life McQuaid was born in 1920 in Dungannon, Co. Tyrone, with one elder brother, and a sister. A Roman Catholic, he married a Protestant, and due to the atmosphere at the time in Northern Ireland they decided to move to Dublin in 1948, as Jim's elder brother Paddy had done a year earlier. Jim set up a greengrocery, with a small bakery, in the small district of Ballygall, between Glasnevin and Finglas in the northwestern Dublin suburbs. Jim and Madge McQuaid continued to live in Dublin, and had seven sons and three daughters. =Cycling career= McQuaid and his brother Paddy had already been racing in Northern Ireland, in both track and road disciplines, and continued in their new home, both seeking national and international competition. In 1949, Paddy was a key driver in the foundation of Ireland's new internationally recognised cycling federation, CR√â, partly to ensure access to international competition, and Jim was also involved. Jim and Paddy McQuaid founded a cycle racing club, Emerald Cycling Club (sometimes Emerald Cycle Racing Club), in late 1949. They kept it small and selective, aiming for high race performance; the club survived until the late 1990s, racing nationally and internationally. National competition McQuaid raced competitively from the 1940s to the early 1960s. He participated in National Athletics and Cycling Association, Athletics Board and club races, initially racing for Harp Cycle Club, and later participated in events approved by the CR√â, and raced under Emerald club colours. He won a range of national titles, at distances from 440 yards to 200 kilometres, including the Grand Prix of Ireland six times between 1951 and 1961, and a number of annual club prizes, such as the Hercules Challenge Club of the Dublin Wheelers. International competition McQuaid competed in the World Championships in six countries, including each year from 1951 to 1954. He was also selected for the 1948 Olympic Games but internal disputes in Irish cycling and the position of the international governing body regarding these prevented his actually participating. McQuaid was also selected, for example, to a joint team from Ireland (CR√â) and Northern Ireland (NICF) in 1953, to compete in both road race and sprint competitions in Zurich. He retired from competitive cycling in 1963. Sport administration and team management In 1958 McQuaid also became involved in the national administration of cycling, securing election as an ordinary committee member of the internationally- recognised cycling federation, the CR√â. In 1959 and 1960 he was elected as Track Racing Secretary, and he later served again as a committee member. After a gap he ran for the post of International Secretary for 1974, serving for a year; running for 1974, he lost to the national executive's first female member, Elizabeth Corcoran, but he served one more term in that role, elected in November 1977. McQuaid also managed teams representing Ireland for international events, including the Olympic Games (in Mexico in 1968) and the Tour of Britain. =Commercial activities= McQuaid founded McQuaid Cycles in 1974, and over time it had shops at at least four locations across Dublin (the family also had a wholesale bike import business); the original shop, in Ballygall, between Glasnevin and Finglas, remains in business, as of 2019. Personal life The McQuaids' children all became involved in Irish cycling affairs, all seven boys cycling competitively, and the three girls becoming involved in race promotion and marketing. Six of the boys competed internationally, including at the Olympics, and the eldest, Pat, progressed to a short professional career, a longer career in coaching and national administration, and eventually headed the world governing body for cycling, the UCI, for two terms. Who is Pat McQuaid and why is he running our sport?, Cycling Weekly, 21 March 2012, Edward Pickering (and Lionel Birnie), visited Sept 14 2018 Having lived in Ballygall for many years, Jim and Madge McQuaid moved to Bettyglen, Raheny. Jim McQuaid died at home on 16 September 1991, survived by his wife, children, grandchildren, brother and sister. His funeral was held at Raheny's Church of Our Lady Mother of Divine Grace and he is buried in St Fintan's Cemetery, Sutton. Emerald Cycling Club promoted a Jim McQuaid Memorial road race in his memory, from at least 1996 to at least 2001.

A gene that produces a vital biological function may become dispensable for an individual organism if the community members around it performs that function in a \\"leaky\\" fashion. Therefore, the organism gains an advantage by conserving limited resources while still acquiring necessary products like metabolites.  Origin  The hypothesis was first proposed by Jeffrey Morris in his 2011 PhD dissertation and was refined and published in 2012 in collaboration with Richard Lenski and Erik Zinser in explaining why certain essential functions are rare in free-living microbial lineages. The \\"Black Queen\\" is seen as working in opposition to the \\"Red Queen\\" from another theory of coevolution, Red Queen Hypothesis, which indicates that a species constantly needs to evolve in order to survive. It derives its name from the \\"Queen of Spades\\" in the card game, Hearts, where the goal is to be the player with the fewest points at the end of the game. The Queen of Spades is worth as much as all the other cards combined, and thus all players want to avoid drawing the Queen of Spades. However, without the Queen of Spades card, the game cannot go on. Analogously, the BQH posits that some genes and/or biological functions are very costly to maintain, and thus dispensing of them provides an evolutionary advantage to the individual. However, these functions/genes are extremely important for the survival of the community (as a whole) causing it to be retained by certain members leading to commensalistic and/or mutualistic interactions. Compared to the Red Queen hypothesis, it is a fairly recent hypothesis; thus, it has not been thoroughly tested and the mechanisms driving it have not been fully elucidated. Although, currently BQH has been used only in the context of microbial communities, the hypothesis is gaining traction as more research continues to be conducted.  Shooting the Moon  In the game of Hearts, there is a risky strategy called \\"shooting the moon\\" which involves the player acquiring all point-scoring cards, including the Queen of Spades. Analogously, in BQH, shooting the moon refers to the strategy in which a helper for one function is more likely to become a helper for another unrelated function. As a result, such helper organism will retain all genes encoding leaky functions, carrying and maintaining a large genome which might seem maladaptive. However, during events leading to a population bottleneck, This strategy can lead to greater probability of survival of these leaky genes (essential functions) in the community.  Pan-genomes  Fullmer et. al., 2015 suggested that under BQH, when an organism loses all its leaky functions, it can grow faster (by virtue of a smaller genome and faster replication times). This would be considered cheating, as they now need to rely on other organisms with the leaky functions. Therefore, in a population bottleneck, organisms will need to cheat on each other for all required leaky functions leading to the evolution of mutual dependencies. They also proposed that such mutual dependencies can lead to a meta-organisms, whose genome is the pan-genome of the population. Empirical testing of this hypothesis is still lacking.  Evidence  The BQH explains the existence of connectedness in a community and how evolution favors dependencies within free-living microbial communities. It was initially proposed to explain the dependence of marine bacteria on helper organisms to protect themselves from hydrogen peroxide. Later, it was extended to explain nitrogen fixation, nutrient acquisition and biofilm production in microbes. Studies have also shown that local interactions within bacterial communities can promote the right amount of trade-off between resource production and resource limitation to stimulate mutual dependencies as proposed by BQH. This type of Black Queen dynamism has also been described in microbial and microbialite mats from Cuatro Ci√©negas Coahuila where the particular physicochemical properties of the site have caused the microbial communities to remain practically isolated for millions of years. It has been observed that the bacteria of the genus Bacilus have substantially reduced their genomes, as well as they have shown an interdependence between the bacteria of that site, which has led to the suggestion of the existence of a Pangenome or Holobionts.  Implication on evolutionary adaptations  Since its introduction in 2012, BQH have used to explain adaptive gene loss via genome streamlining, cooperative interactions and evolution of communities. Mas et. al., 2016, nicely summarized the possible mechanisms of adaptive gene loss proposed by the BQH (alternative to the commonly observed increased exemplification) that included genetic drift on alleles in absence of a purifying selection, genome streamlining with targeted loss of genes, specialization on common shared resources and the success of mutants based on the effect of the specific function loss on fitness.

From 1929 to 1933, she appeared in Berlin in the cabarets Die Katakombe and Tingel-Tangel-Theater. She emigrated with her first husband, Friedrich Hollaender, to California, where she turned to pottery. She founded a factory where ceramics based on her designs were produced from 1940 to 1958.  Life  Hedwig \\"Hedi\\" Schoop was born in Z√ºrich on 3 April 1906, the daughter of Friedrich Maximilian Schoop (1871‚Äì1924) and Emma Olga Schoop, n√©e B√∂ppli (1873‚Äì1959). Her grandfather Ulrich Schoop was a lecturer at the Kunstgewerbeschule in Z√ºrich. Her father was a journalist, including for the Z√ºrcher Post, and president of the Grand Hotel Dolder. The family lived at the Z√ºrichberg, where the hotel was also located. Schoop was the third of four children, the first being the painter , the second the dancer Trudi Schoop, and the youngest the composer . The parents nurtured the artistic interests of their children. Trudi and Hedi received drama instruction. Schoop studied sculpture, architecture, painting and fashion design at the Kunstgewerbeschule Wien and the Reimann School in Berlin. She probably learned dancing from her sister who opened a dance school in Z√ºrich in 1924. When Werner Finck and Hans Deppe founded the cabaret Die Katakombe in Berlin on 16 October 1929, the ensemble also included the actor Theo Lingen, the dancers Trudi and Hedi Schoop, and the artist Erich Ohser. Hedi Schoop appeared in parody pantomime, sometimes as a grotesque duo with her sister. When the cabaret dissolved in 1930, Schoop turned to Friedrich Hollaender's , which opened on 7 January 1931. A guest of their first program was Marlene Dietrich, who had become famous singing Hollaender's songs, including \\"Ich bin von Kopf bis Fu√ü auf Liebe eingestellt\\". The December 1931 show Allez-Hopp! was reviewed by Alfred Polgar in Die Weltb√ºhne, who wrote about her ability to present with a \\"trinity\\" of temperament, drollery and grace (\\"Dreieinigkeit von Temperament, Drolligkeit und Grazie\\"), lively physical humour (\\"lebhaftem k√∂rperlichem Witz\\") and biting parody (\\"saftig im Parodistischen\\"). In 1932, Hollaender and Schoop married. Hollaender left the cabaret in January 1933, due to the Nazi regime, which closed it in 1935. The couple emigrated via Paris to the United States, where Hollaender had a contract for three months with 20th Century Fox. They lived in Hollywood and later in Hollywood Hills. They tried to run a cabaret in English, Tingel-Tangel-Theater, beginning on 3 May 1934 with a program Allez-Hopp! based on the former show. It was initially well attended, but the attendance began to decline. When Hollaender received a contract with RKO to produce a Western and compose the film score for it, he closed the cabaret. = Hedi Schoop Art Creations = From 1935, Schoop turned to artistic work. She first modeled puppets and dressed them. When they were displayed by Barker Bros., she was advised to turn to more durable materials and began to produce ceramics. In 1940, she opened a production line,Anthony Verebes, 10 November 2015. Hedi Schoop Art Creations. Schoop created ceramics for practical use, such as flower pots and candle holders. Figures were often rural people in national costumes, in simple design which carried coloring. She also created bowls and lamps, among other items, sometimes in series aimed at collectors. Schoop hired people for the production but kept the designing for herself. In the late 1940s, the company had more than 50 employees and produced more than 30,000 pieces. She employed other foreigners, including the journalist , the actor Ern≈ë Verebes, the artist , the dancer Gitta Wallerstein, the actress Illa Rhoden and the cabaret artist Trude Berliner.

The test is used for diagnosis of cancer, sepsis and toxemia.  Principles  The test is based on the interaction of spin-labeled fatty acids with serum albumin by means of EPR spectroscopy. A sample of blood serum is subjected to a spin probe 16-doxyl stearate. Spin probe molecules bind specifically to albumin molecules where they occupy two main positions: * primary binding sites located in albumin domains, where their mobility is restricted * the relatively spacious hydrophobic area between the protein domains in the interior of the albumin globule. The spin probe molecules bound on albumin have restricted mobility that changes the EPR spectrum, which reflects characteristics of the protein site where the spin probe is located and allows estimating the conformation of the albumin globule. Some part of the spin probe remains in the serum in the unbound state. The ratio of the fractions of bound and unbound spin probes allows estimating the functional activity of albumin molecules. Analysis of the EPR spectrum allows assessment of the conformation and functional activity of albumin molecules. The test material is 100 ¬µl serum or plasma. The procedure includes mixing a serum sample with a spin probe reagent, incubating the mixture, measuring the EPR spectrum of a serum with a spin probe, and analyzing the EPR spectrum by calculating the conformation and functional indicators of albumin molecules.  Applications  = Cancer diagnosis = A specific change to the conformation of albumin molecules that is associated with the growth of a malignant tumor is caused by (or associated with) changes in the composition of metabolites carried by serum albumin during the growth of a malignant tumor (proliferating cancer cells uptake and release metabolites in abnormal quantities). Clinical studies of the EPR test of serum albumin showed diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of 90%. Clinical applications: * as a screening test to detect cancer-specific metabolic alterations in patients; * to determine whether the cancer growth has stopped or the disease is progressing; * to determine when cancer treatment is effective or needs to be changed. = Sepsis and toxemia = Reduced functional activity of serum albumin (reduced binding efficacy) is associated with toxemia (an increase in the concentration of toxic molecules in the blood) and is manifested before other clinical symptoms. Clinical applications: * prognosis and early diagnosis of sepsis (1 to 2 hours after surgery); * diagnosis of severe preeclampsia (gestosis) in women in the 2nd and 3rd trimesters of pregnancy; * diagnostics of the functional status of a kidney transplant * early diagnosis of congenital pneumonia in newborns.

Im Bong-haek was a smuggling merchant who followed bureaucrat to Qing every year, sold ginseng, bought silk and sold it in Joseon again. However, he couldn't succeed on his business, all his family ended up being slave under government. After, he worked as errand boy under a merchant Dobang, one day he had trust from him. When Im Sang-ok became age of 28, his father Im Bong-haek died, he had to solve all his father's debt. He started smuggling dealing with Chinese merchants, by using skills he learned from his dad.  Business Life  In 1809, Im Sang-ok went to meet the bureaucrat Park Jong-gyeong to get help from him for the business. After their meeting Im Sang-ok he got monopoly right for ginseng trade with other five merchants in Uiju. In 1810, when he went to Qing as assistant of an envoy, he sold ginseng with tens of times of normal price. Thanks to that he was recommended to be bureaucrat, but he refused. In 1812, he helped protecting the castle from rebellion of Hong Gyeong-nae. In his 30s, he became the leader of merchants based on Uiju. He accumulated much wealth, he helped poor people. In 1832, as an award of helping people, he became mayor of Gwaksan In 1834,When there was water flood, Im Sang-ok supplied foods and clothes for victims, also he donated money to government office, it helped them to make roads and ships to improve transport and convenience. So that he became high bureaucrat, but cause of objection of Border Defense Council, he retired soon. He lived his rest of life for helping poor people, writing poetry, and drinking alcohol. Before his death, he made his private land to land for palace, preventing to be sold, for his descendants. Later, this land becomes Bul-i farm by his descendant. Also he forgave all the debts the merchants owed to him, giving them gold instead. His two siblings and one of his sons died early.  Historical Background  Joseon had the worst environment for merchants to do the business. Many products were forbidden to trade, and most of trades between other countries were illegal. But ginseng from Joseon was popular in Qing, the Chinese willingly paid a lot for it. It was very appealing deal for merchants, so Im Sang-ok smuggled ginseng with Chinese. Since old times, Korean ginseng had been widely known for its excellent quality. Also Chinese people thought they have to eat ginseng in order to live longer. There's a story in Wi-Am-Mun-Go (ÏúÑÏïîÎ¨∏Í≥†, ÈüãÂ∫µÊñáÁ®ø) Sampo was created in Gaesong at the beginning, and it was called Songsam. At first, people just sold it as a row baeksam in Beijing, and it made the Chinese vomit. So people didn't eat it, believing it to be poisonous. Then one guy in Songdo found out how to make ginseng, from boiling baeksam. There were few affects making people sick, it was less likely to be rotten. It became popular, the profit was ten times of baeksam when it is sold. Basically, there was a limit that can be brought to Qing when u take ginseng and silver, Hence, you could hide as much as you can, and when you pass the gate to Qing you can lobby him a bit then you would easily pass. So every year lots of amount of ginseng and silver were taken out of Joseon, there were lack of them to use internally. So that the government decided to give ginseng trade right to Qing only to six merchants, including Hong deuk-ju and Im Sang-ok. At the time, there were silver 420,000 nyang which the government stored, and the amount of money for ginseng trade was silver 1,000,000 nyang. There were Naesang (ÎÇ¥ÏÉÅ,ËêäÂïÜ) based on Busan, Gyeongsang (Í≤ΩÏÉÅ,‰∫¨ÂïÜ) based on Seoul, Songsang (ÏÜ°ÏÉÅ,ÊùæÂïÜ) based on Gaeseong, Mansang (ÎßåÏÉÅ,ÁÅ£ÂïÜ). and Im Sang-ok became the leader of Mansang in his 30s. Mansang had special rights for ginseng trade, but they didn't stay just in ginseng, they had international trade freely.  Critics  He is considered as who overcame the limit of hierarchy, advanced to Jong 3 Pum (Ï¢Ö3Ìíà) He inspired business men later, because he focused on not only profit, but also people who he dealt with. Trust was more important than profit for him. He didn't show off his wealth, he disposed all his wealth and had only one farm for vegetables when he died. But when he started his ginseng business, he lobbied the bureaucrat and got the monopoly right, it is illegal indeed even that time. He tried to help poor people, did charities, but according to fact that he supported government forces when there was Hong Gyung-rae's Rebellion, he was conservative to revolution of corrupted tradition in Joseon.  Quotes  ‚ÄúOnce you are born, once you die indeed. Life and Death is equally given joy and punishment for everyone. Big business has certain way which merchants have to follow. Troubles you have, various good and bad varies by the way of commerce. If you lose the way, your business can‚Äôt ever be succeeded.‚Äù And then Im Sang-ok heard that Chusa Kim Jeong-hee visits Beijing, he went to talk with him. 'Baek chuk gan du jin il bo (Î∞±Ï≤ôÍ∞ÑÎëê ÏßÑÏùºÎ≥¥, ÁôæÂ∞∫Á´øÈ†≠ ÈÄ≤‰∏ÄÊ≠•)‚Äô, ‚ÄòBaek chuk gan du (Î∞±Ï≤ôÍ∞ÑÎëê, ÁôæÂ∞∫Á´øÈ†≠)‚Äô means very dangerous situation as you are standing on the end of a bamboo. ‚ÄòJin il bo (ÏßÑÏùºÎ≥¥, ÈÄ≤‰∏ÄÊ≠•)‚Äô means go one step ahead.

Story  After Im Sang-ok's father died, he had all the father's debt, so he worked as assistant under merchant Hong Deukju. In Uiju, there's tradition that they don't pay for employee, but after five, ten years, if they think the employee have a potential, they support him to have his own business. If he's not diligent it was common to be expelled getting nothing. Im Sang-ok could had business just after three years with getting support from Hong Deukuju. So he went to Beijing to have a business. And he saw prostitute quarter and bought one woman for a night. He didn't do anything to her and she got impressed and asked his name. Im Sang-ok spent all his money for that. And then later Im Sang-ok was criticized a lot, got expelled from merchant group. Ten years later, the woman became wife of high bureaucrat in Qing, and found Im Sang-ok, gave him ten times of money he spent for buying her. Using that money, Im Sang-ok could had success on his business. One man brought big ginseng and asked Im Sang-ok to valuate it. Im Sang-ok looked the ginseng with morning sunshine and answered correct that it was transplanted to somewhere else and grown. So people call Im Sang-ok Bak mul gun ja(Î∞ïÎ¨ºÍµ∞Ïûê, ÂçöÁâ©ÂêõÂ≠ê) (someone with deep knowledge in everything) and no one tried to cheat on him. Ater he got age 40, Im Sang-ok realized that the country is not enough to have his all wealth, he enjoyed his life writing poems. It was meaningless for him to have wealth or high status. Once, Do-jeong Hong Mi-San broke his precious coral cane during his journey. The cane wasn't his, he borrowed it from his friend for the journey. Moreover, it was something difficult to get in Qing, that it was almost impossible to get it in Joseon. By that time, someone told him that there is everything in Im Sang-ok's warehouse. So Hong Mi-San went to Im Sang-ok right away, Im Sang- ok was told about his story, he opened his warehouse and let Hong Mi-San take one of his many coral canes. Also, the other day, Ui-Ju Bu-Yoon's decoration jade got broke, he went to Im Sang-ok's warehouse, and there were hundreds of jades. There was a high bureaucrat Park Jonggyung, who is uncle of the king. And when his one of parents died, Im Sang-ok went to visit him even though they've never met before. Im Sang-ok lobbied him 5000 nyang, which is multiple times of amount others lobbied him. Park Jonggyung called Im Sang-ok to his house and asked him if he knows how many people come and go in a day, and Im Sang-ok said there are only two people, who can bring advantage to him or who can bring damage to him. Park Jonggyung liked his answer and thought he has potential. Later he supported him doing his business. When Im Sang-ok became rich in his late 30s, he built a house which has hundreds of rooms under mountain Sambong in Uiju. It took five years to build and he wanted to have all his relatives and underlings there. But no one could build a house which has over 99 rooms except the King, so Amhaengeosa (royal secret agent) had all his house destroyed and Im Sang-ok had to go to jail. It was hard being rich for who is in low position. When Im Sang-ok left the temple, monk Suk-Sung of Chuwolam gave him a glass for wine, which is called Gyeyoungbae, it make liquid leak to bottom when its filled over 80%of its volume. Im Sang-ok controlled his greed remembering that glass. One day, he saw one kite caught a chicken, and he realized that his death is soon to come. After that, he called merchants who owed on him and forgave all the debts they had, giving them golds, saying ‚ÄúWhen you try to possess a water, water loses its life and gets rotten. So is wealth. Wealth just stays for a while for you. So is person. There's no difference for people from the birth, how precious, how rich, how noble, how beautiful. The debt is as water. You can‚Äôt have him as who owed you, when you give your water to who is thirsty.\\" When Im Sang-ok went to Beijing to sell ginseng, there was one problem with ginseng trade, the price. Chinese merchant bought ginseng brought by merchants from Joseon, with cheap price. Chinese merchants knew its illegal for Joseon merchants and it's risky so that they must sell it before returning. And one day Chinese merchants became jealous of Im Sang-ok that he has monopoly right to sell ginseng, so they boycotted Im Sang-ok and make him lower the price more. Im Sang-ok had grievance about this situation. So Im Sang-ok burned his ginseng in his yard, called Chinese merchants. Frightened, they bought ginseng at a high price. So Im Sang-ok made lot of profit and became popular. So he could get ginseng trade monopoly right, later he could be recommended as bureaucrat. Im Sang-ok was planning to go to Beijing, so he called his staff. But the staff didn't seem to want to go to Beijing saying that he is sick. Im Sang-ok later noticed that he actually got robbed his all products and the money he lent from the rich. so Im Sang-ok scolded him that he have to go Beijing and earn money to compensate the money he lent, but he didn't want. So Im Sang-ok got annoyed and scolded him, and went to Beijing alone. When he saw the rich who his staff lent money from, he heard that his staff died and a rich wanted to give him more money to support him, so when Im Sang-ok went back to Joseon, he visited his staff. And his son said his father died, after he met Im Sang-ok he got shocked and got ill. He realized that he shouldn't say anything can cause bad happening. One day, Bureaucrat from Jeonju visited Im Sang-ok, and asked him to lend him money. They met first time, didn't know each other, but he asked him 50,000 nyang. But Im Sang-ok let him take his money. The bureaucrat got impressed and promised him to give it back later. And the reason why Im Sang- ok let his money to him was that he realized the bureaucrat seemed was about to kill him if he doesn't let him take his money. And then it was revealed that the bureaucrat was caught stealing money, so he could die if he don't return the money back and he actually had knife in his pocket. The rebel Hong Gyung-rae was planning to make rebellion, he was trying to have the riches as his team. So he went to work as scribe under Im Sang-ok. He didn't make first move, just worked. One day, some high bureaucrat and their company visited Im Sang-ok, they were 700 people. Every workers in Im Sang-ok's house were nervous to support lot of people, but only Hong Gyung-rae was calm. After the group left, Im Sang-ok called Hong Gyung-rae and told him to quit the job in his house. He thought his ability is too big to stay being as scribe under him. Then 1812, Hong Gyung-rae launched the rebellion against an oppressive tax regime enforced by the centrally appointed bureaucrats from Seoul, collecting more than the allotted amount of grain from the famine stricken region of Pyeongan province. But Im Sang-ok helped government forces, supporting money for armies and foods. The rebellion of Hong Gyung-rae was repressed, Im Sang-ok was recommended as high bureaucrat.

Yogi has an elder sister named Nilima Potnis and younger brother named Rahul Puranik.  Education  Yogi started his schooling from Kendriya Vidyalaya (Central School) Ambarnath. In the middle of 11th grade, his father was transferred to Pune, following which he joined Kendriya Vidyalaya Southern Command and later passed the high school from Kendriya Vidyalaya Dehu Road in 1994. He then joined the Sir Parashurambhau College under the Pune University to study an undergraduate program in science (Bachelor of Science) with specializations in physics and mathematics. He also joined the Foreign Languages Department (Ranade Institute) of Pune University to study Japanese and German and Datamatics Corporation, a private information technology school, to study computer science. Yogi finished his diploma in information technology in May 1996 and advanced diploma in Japanese language in May 1997. Yogi was awarded with the Study Tour award, a scholarship from The Japan Foundation under the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, to visit Japan for a month in September 1997. This was when Yogi was attracted towards Japan. He was again awarded a scholarship by The Japan Foundation to study in Japan for one academic year from September 1999. Yogi later left studying science and completed his bachelors and master's degrees in international and labor economics from Pune University. He finished an International Business Management program from Indian Institute of Management, Calcutta, with a focus on strategies for doing global business. Yogi attended Skema Business School (previously known as ESC Lille) in France to study strategic project management including qualitative and quantitative analysis methods and research techniques.  Work  In April 1996, Yogi started working for a small scale IT company in Pune called Sutra Systems. He was also associated with Geometric Software solutions, Mahindra British Telecom and Keihin FIE Private Limited before moving to Japan in 2001. In Japan, Yogi worked for the information technology companies Infosys Technologies Limited, Fujifilm and Polaris Software Lab Limited before moving to Mizuho Bank in 2010 as vice president of operations strategy. Since then, Yogi has been in the banking field. His last position was at Rakuten Bank as vice director of corporate planning where he managed departments for business planning, budget planning, business automation, fraud detection and legal affairs, before taking the position of city councilor.  Family  Yogi married Zhang Zhe, a professor of Japanese Language, in August 2001. They had a baby boy, Chinmay Puranik, on 7 June 2002. Due to geographical preferences, Yogi and Zhe decided to divorce in April 2007. Chinmay stays with Yogi in Japan. He has studied in the Indian international school, Japanese public school and a school in Reading, United Kingdom.  Social life  Yogi with mother Rekha Puranik and Director of Kojimacho community Niizuma san, at Kojimacho (Nishi Kasai) summer festival in August 2012. Yogi has always been active in his social network and ecosystem. Wherever he has lived, he became a part of the local organizations. He associated himself with local festivals, voluntary work and so on. He has been very active in Edogawa working and connecting with multiple spheres across festival organizations, women, PTA and sports organizations. Yogi started Indian Home Food Restaurant Reka in Tokyo in February 2013 as a social venture to spread the real Indian home food in Japan. His restaurant has been highly successful winning trust of thousands of Indian food maniacs from within and outside Japan. His restaurant received a mayor's award in 2016 and has been a continuous pick by the television channels and endless popular magazines in Japan. His mother, Rekha Puranik, being the main chef, has been the pillar of this success. Yogi opened his second restaurant at the end of 2016 and with this he established the Edogawa India Culture Center where he hosts around 50 live concerts every year mainly around Indian classical music and dances and collaborates with music and art from other countries. This center also hosts weekly classes for Yoga, music, Indian languages, Indian culture, Indian mythology and so on. Yogi created lot of literature on India, Indian culture, spices and Indian food.  Political career  In 2016, when there was a political move in Tokyo Edogawa to create a Little India, Yogi sensed that the model was not socially healthy and sustainable, and did not take into consideration the day-to-day needs of the society or community. The objectives of the project were influenced by a handful of people. As a social volunteer, Yogi tried to convince the local administration to take public opinion however it did not work. It was this time when Yogi thought of being on the other side. Yogi announced his candidature in the regional elections that took place in April 2019 in Japan. Yogi won with a large margin, with a logical and timely positioning of mandate and convincing the voters with powerful speeches. Yogi was supported by The Constitutional Democratic Party which the largest opposition party. Yogi plans to implement a methodological approach for analyzing the current status of services offered by the Edogawa administration. To do this, he is building a metrics based tool by keeping target audience (like individual, corporate, others) on the X axis and keeping their needs and issues on the Y axis and then mapping the currently offered services to each cross-section. This will help the administration gauge the white spots and focus to strengthen those areas. Yogi would like to recommend good practices from frameworks like Smart City and Sustainable Development Goals and try to educate the councillors and bureaucrats on these frameworks. This would lead to an all-round thinking and analysis across all departments of administration leading to balanced and well-thought actions for the development of the city in the right direction.  Philosophy  Yogi emphasizes a balance between body, mind and soul. He gives equal importance to physical health, knowledge and philosophy. In the case of education, Yogi places the same emphasis on academic as co-curricular education.

In the ensuing discussion, Rav Pappa limits the application of the rule to cases of different matter, but within a single topic he says the Torah's narrative must be chronological.Pesachim 6b Later commentators disagree over the definition of a \\"matter\\": Rashi defines it as a parashah, while Rabbeinu Hananel defines it as a single topic of discussion. The first Bible commentator to use the term was Rashi, who used it frequently, as did Ibn Ezra and the Torah Temimah. In contrast, Nachmanides argued that the Torah's order is generally chronological. Raavan argued that the principle only applies in the Torah, and not in the Nevi'im or Ketuvim. Examples The commandments in Leviticus 25 are stated as being given to Moses \\"on Mount Sinai\\",Leviticus 25:1 seemingly earlier in time than the ritual commandments of Leviticus chapters 1‚Äì24. Ibn Ezra explains that Leviticus 25 was indeed given before the ritual commandments, but was recorded later due to its thematic connection to the passages around it (Leviticus 18 and 26).Ibn Ezra to Leviticus 25:1 In contrast, Nachmanides asserts that the passage is in chronological order, as only at this point did Moses relay to the people the commands he had previously been given on Mount Sinai.Nachmanides to Leviticus 25:1 References Jewish theology ","title":"There is no chronological order in the Torah"},{"id":"60577038","text":"The 2003 East Northamptonshire District Council election took place on 1 May 2003 to elect members of East Northamptonshire District Council in Northamptonshire, England.

Life He was born in Leeds on 3 July 1924, the son of Norman Laing Wight (b.1898), an executive in a meat company, and his wife Margaret Nevines. His parents belonged to the Fulneck Moravian Church.Who's Who in Commerce and Industry vol 14 When his mother died in 1927, his father sent him to Australia to live with his grandmother. He was returned to England in the summer of 1939, just before the outbreak of the Second World War. He was educated (as a boarder) at the Fulneck Moravian School in Pudsey, Yorkshire. He spent school holidays at his aunt's farm in Buckden, North Yorkshire. In 1942, he began studies at the Royal (Dick) Veterinary College in Edinburgh. He graduated BSc in 1948 and began general practice as a vet in Stockton, but (preferring to work on large animals) assisted Mr Parkinson in Sedbergh in rural Yorkshire, working with farm animals. In 1952, he returned to the Dick Vet College to undertake a doctorate (DVSM). This specialised in veterinary pathology. In 1953, he began Colonial Service at Zomba in Nyasaland (now Malawi). After around a year, he moved to the Central Laboratories in Blantyre under D. Faulkner. Here he mainly worked on mainstream African animal diseases such as Heartwater and Rabies. As these involve the animal's nervous system he moved onto the field of neuropathology. In 1956, he returned to Britain to work at the Moredun Research Institute near Edinburgh at the invitation of Dr Zlotnik. Here he worked on sheep scrapie under John Stamp FRSE.

It is in the and is part of the Alexander Nevsky Lavra. The church was one of the earliest buildings in the monastery complex, begun in 1719 and completed by 1725. The building contained two churches, the upper floor was dedicated to Saint Alexander Nevsky and was built to hold his relics, installed when the church was consecrated in 1724. The church on the ground floor, originally planned to be the monastery refectory, was dedicated to the annunciation of the Virgin Mary and was consecrated in 1725. Both were richly decorated by prominent Russian artisans and received important donations of decorations and fixtures from the imperial family. From its early years it became an important burial ground for members of the imperial family, their associates, and the Russian nobility. The wealthy paid for elaborate monuments, and the several noble families established burial vaults in the church. The church was closed during the Soviet period, being divided up into office space, and used as a warehouse and storage area for other funerary monuments that were being removed from churches and cemeteries that were in the process of closure or demolition. The took over the building and used it as a display space for historically and artistically important examples of funerary monuments and sculpture. In addition to those monuments already in the church, other monuments, or parts of them, were gathered from different locations to add to the museum's collections. It opened to the public in 1950, and survived the fall of the Soviet Union. The Orthodox Church has requested the return of the church, and in 2013 the vice-governor of Saint Petersburg announced it would be handed back to the monastery authorities. The issue has been complicated however over the issue of the future ownership and display of the monuments. Design and construction Entrance of the Annunciation Church The church was designed by Domenico Trezzini, who had drawn up the plans for the monastery complex. Initially construction was overseen by , though he was succeeded by for the final stages. Construction began on 21 July 1717. It was initially planned that the ground floor would house the monastery's refectory, but this was altered to instead create a burial space for members of the royal family and prominent dignitaries. Construction was largely complete by 1719, though the finishing work took another three years. As completed the building contained two churches. =Upper church= The upper floor housed the Alexander Nevsky Church, with the relics of the saint. Peter the Great had ordered the relics of Saint Alexander Nevsky to be sent from the Church of the Nativity of the Virgin monastery in Vladimir. They were removed from Vladimir on 11 August 1723 and transported to Shlisselburg, arriving there on 20 September. There they were kept until 1724, when they were brought to Saint Petersburg and installed in the church on 30 August, the day of its consecration. The church was decorated with icons and paintings of biblical scenes by artists such as Ivan Adolsky, Ivan Nikitin, Dmitry Solovyov, Ivan Vishnyakov and Georg Gsell. The exterior walls were decorated with stucco and alabaster ornaments by Ivan and Ignatius Rossi, while the interior used blue marble. Empress Catherine donated a chandelier with crystal pendants to the church. In 1753 a for the relics, made with 90 pounds of silver, was donated by Empress Elizabeth of Russia. With the completion of the Holy Trinity Cathedral of the Alexander Nevsky Lavra in 1790, the shrine and relics were transferred there at its consecration on 30 August, one of the saint's feast days. =Lower church= The ground floor housed the Annunciation Church, consecrated on 25 March 1725 by Archbishop Theodosius. The alabaster details and iconostasis was by Ivan Adolsky, Ivan Nikitin and Dmitry Solovyov. Carvings were done by skilled workmen from the admiralty. Massive composite columns supported a flat ceiling with the plafond ‚ÄúName of God‚Äù by Adolsky and M. L. Negrubov. The interior was illuminated with a silver chandelier, donated by Prince Alexander Danilovich Menshikov. A crypt under the church was prepared in 1720, and a two-story staircase pavilion was added to the western facade of the church between 1764 and 1765, to the design of Mikhail Rastorguev. A further extension was built in 1783, along the south-eastern part of the church, which came to house the family monuments of several noble houses, including the Shuvalovs, Betskoys, Vyazemskys and Naryshkins. A small sacristy was attached to the eastern side of the church, which later housed the Yusupov family's monuments. Burials Gravemarkers of the Romanov family members In 1720 a crypt was excavated under the church to provide 21 burial spaces. The first interment was that of Tsarina Praskovia Saltykova, the wife of Tsar Ivan V, on 24 October 1723. On Peter's orders the remains of his sister, Natalya Alexeyevna, and his infant son Peter Petrovich, who had originally been buried in the monastery's Lazarevsky Church, were transferred to the burial vault. The lower church was consecrated on 25 March 1725. Several other members of the imperial family were later buried in the church, including those who had lost their positions through palace coups. Among them were Anna Leopoldovna, mother of Tsar Ivan VI and regent during her son's brief reign; and Emperor Peter III who was deposed and killed in a palace coup that brought his wife to the throne as Empress Catherine II. Peter III was quietly interred in the church in July 1762, thus denying him burial in the traditional resting place of the post-Peter the Great rulers, the Saints Peter and Paul Cathedral. Peter III's remains were later removed from the church and reburied in the Saints Peter and Paul Cathedral on the orders of his son when he ascended to the throne as Paul I. Other members of the imperial family buried in the church include Catherine Ivanovna, Peter the Great's niece; Natalia Alexeievna, Paul I's first wife; and several children who died in infancy, including two daughters of Emperor Alexander I and Elizabeth Alexeievna; Olga Pavlovna, daughter of Emperor Paul I and Maria Feodorovna. Those with close connections to the imperial court were also buried here. Among them were courtiers Yevdokiya Yusupova, Anastasiya Trubetskaya, and Anna Matyushkina; as well as Alexei Razumovsky, lover and rumoured husband of Empress Elizabeth; and Maria Rumyantseva, mistress of Peter the Great. Members of several important noble families were also buried here, including the Shuvalovs, Betskoys, Vyazemskys, Naryshkins, and Yusupovs. On 12 May 1800 the hero of the French Revolutionary Wars Generalissimo Alexander Suvorov was buried in the church, under a white marble slab with the simple inscription, chosen by the Generalissimo himself, \\"Here lies Suvorov\\". Late Imperial period Repairs were carried out between 1820 and 1821, at which time a stone gateway with ornate metal doors was erected over the passage from the . A more thorough reconstruction took place in 1838, which saw the iconostases in both churches replaced, and in the case of the lower church, a wooden one was installed. New paintings were produced by A. I. Grigoriev, and the churches were re-consecrated by Georgian Metropolitan Iona on 21 December 1838 and 29 August 1841. In the 1860s the lower church was re-painted by M. N. Troshchinsky, while the Yakunchikov family had a small crypt built in its north-western corner. In 1871 P. D. Sokhansky built a marble tomb for the Bobrinsky family under the staircase annex. Soviet period The upper church. Examples of different funerary monuments. The church was closed on 15 February 1933. The lower Annunciation Church was handed over to the forerunner of the , which had taken over the Lavra's Lazarevskoe and Tikhvin Cemeteries to run as museum necropolises. The upper church was divided up into smaller rooms to provide office space. It was used for a time by the geodesic survey department of . Little was done to protect the funerary monuments, despite a letter from Maxim Gorky to Andrei Zhdanov urging action. The church was used as a warehouse, and furnaces were installed. During this period some of the funerary monuments from the Lavra's Nikolo-Fyodorovskaya and Isidorovskaya churches, which had been closed in 1931, were moved to the lower Annunciation Church. In 1940 the entire building was transferred to the State Museum of Urban Sculpture. The memorials of Napoleonic military leaders Mikhail Miloradovich and Dmitry Senyavin were placed in the church after the closure of the Dukhovskaya Church, while those of Ivan Lazarev and Gerasim Lebedev were brought from other locations as part of a general clearing of cemeteries and the concentration of funerary monuments into centralised museum necropolises. In other instances parts of memorials, such as plaques and reliefs from the monuments of Alexei Turchaninov and Anna Vorontsova in the Lavra's Lazarevskoe Cemetery were installed in the church. In the case of sculptor Mikhail Kozlovsky, his monument was transferred from the Smolensky Cemetery to the Lazarevskoe in 1931, with some of the reliefs installed in the Annunciation Church. The lower church, the grave of Alexander Suvorov at left Some repair work was carried out during the Second World War, when a military hospital opened in the grounds of the monastery during the siege of Leningrad. Suvorov's grave became a source of patriotic inspiration, and in November 1942 the grave was repaired and decorated with panels and flags. Soldiers defending Leningrad would also visit to pay their respects. After repairs, the building opened on 15 May 1950 as a museum display of historic funerary monuments under the auspices of the State Museum of Urban Sculpture. Between 1988 and 1999 a complex restoration of the Annunciation Church took place. After the fall of the Soviet Union the church building remained in the ownership of the State Museum of Urban Sculpture, despite requests by the Orthodox Church for its return. On 7 April 2013, the 300th anniversary of the monastery, vice-governor of Saint Petersburg announced that the Annunciation Church would be returned to the Alexander Nevsky Lavra. The return of the church to the monastery authorities has however been complicated by questions around the ownership of the memorials.

It was inspired by the New York magazine article \\"The Uninhabitable Earth\\" (2017). General The book fleshes out Wallace-Wells' original magazine piece in more detail, dovetailing into discussions surrounding various possibilities for Earth's future across a spectrum of predicted future temperature ranges. It argues that even with active intervention, the effects of climate change will have catastrophic impacts across multiple spheres: rising sea levels, extreme heat events, extinctions, disease outbreaks, fires, droughts, and increased geopolitical conflict, among others. While such changes are presented as already in motion, Wallace-Wells suggests that the future can still be salvaged with proper political and scientific willpower over the coming years. Reception The book received praise for its scientific approach to describing the potential impacts of climate change. It has been both celebrated and criticized for its dramatic depictions of future life on Earth. The Economist stated, \\"Some readers will find Mr. Wallace-Wells‚Äôs outline of possible futures alarmist. He is indeed alarmed. You should be, too.\\" Television adaptation In January 2020, it was reported that The Uninhabitable Earth would be adapted into an anthology series on HBO Max. Each episode will be about the dangers of climate change. Adam McKay will serve as the executive producer.

Ethiopia remains a highly restrictive environment in which to express political dissent online. The government of Ethiopia has long filtered critical and oppositional political content. Anti-terrorism legislation is frequently used to target online speech, including in the recent conviction of a dozen individuals, many of whom were tried based on their online writings. OpenNet Initiative (ONI) testing conducted in Ethiopia in September 2012 found that online political and news content continues to be blocked, including the blogs and websites of a number of recently convicted individuals. Ethiopia has implemented a largely political filtering regime that blocks access to popular blogs and the Web sites of many news organizations, dissident political parties, and human rights groups. However, much of the media content that the government is attempting to censor can be found on sites that are not banned. The authors of the blocked blogs have in many cases continued to write for an international audience, apparently without sanction. However, Ethiopia is increasingly jailing journalists, and the government has shown a growing propensity toward repressive behavior both off- and online. Censorship is likely to become more extensive as Internet access expands across the country.

Sudan openly acknowledges filtering content that transgresses public morality and ethics or threatens order. The state's regulatory authority has established a special unit to monitor and implement filtration; this primarily targets pornography and, to a lesser extent, gay and lesbian content, dating sites, provocative attire, and many anonymizer and proxy Web sites.  Selective censorship or surveillance  = = * Rated \\"partly free\\" by Freedom House in Freedom on the Net in 2013 (score 34), 2014 (score 38), and 2015 (score 39). * Angola is not individually classified by ONI and does not appear on the RWB lists. There are no government restrictions on access to the Internet or credible reports that the government monitors e-mail or chat rooms without judicial oversight. And aside from child pornography and copyrighted material, the government does not block or filter Internet content and there are no restrictions on the type of information that can be exchanged. Social media and communications apps such as YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, and international blog-hosting services are all freely available. Censorship of traditional news and information sources is common, leading to worries that similar efforts to control online information will eventually emerge. Defamation, libel, and insulting the country or president in \\"public meetings or by disseminating words, images, writings, or sound\\" are crimes punishable by imprisonment. A proposed \\"Law to Combat Crime in the Area of Information Technologies and Communication\\" was introduced by the National Assembly in March 2011. Often referred to as the cybercrime bill, the law was ultimately withdrawn in May 2011 as a result of international pressure and vocal objections from civil society. However, the government publicly stated that similar clauses regarding cybercrimes will be incorporated into an ongoing revision of the penal code, leaving open the possibility of Internet- specific restrictions becoming law in the future. An April 2013 news report claimed that state security services were planning to implement electronic monitoring that could track email and other digital communications. In March 2014, corroborating information from military sources was found, affirming that a German company had assisted the Angolan military intelligence in installing a monitoring system at the BATOPE base around September 2013. There was also evidence of a major ISP hosting a spyware system. = = * Listed as Under Surveillance by RWB in 2008, 2009, and again from 2011 to the present. Eritrea has not set up a widespread automatic Internet filtering system, but it does not hesitate to order blocking of several diaspora websites critical of the regime. Access to these sites is blocked by two of the Internet service providers, Erson and Ewan, as are pornographic websites and YouTube. Self- censorship is said to be widespread. = = * Rated \\"not free\\" by Freedom House in Freedom on the Net in 2014 (score 65), 2015 (score 65), 2016 (score 67), 2017 (score 67), and \\"partly free\\" in 2018 (score 55). * Not individually classified by ONI, but classified as selective based on the limited descriptions in the ONI profile for the sub-Saharan Africa region. There are no government restrictions on access to the Internet or reports that the government monitors e-mail or Internet chat rooms without appropriate legal authority. Individuals and groups can generally engage in the peaceful expression of views via the Internet, including by e-mail. However, Internet users reported they could not access the Web sites of foreign online newspapers Freedom, The Gambia Echo, Hellogambia, and Jollofnews, which criticized the government. The constitution and law provide for freedom of speech and press; however, the government restricted these rights. According to the Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, \\"the environment for independent and opposition media remained hostile, with numerous obstacles to freedom of expression, including administrative hurdles, arbitrary arrest and detention, intimidation and judicial harassment against journalists, and the closure of media outlets, leading to self-censorship.\\" Individuals who publicly or privately criticized the government or the president risked government reprisal. In March 2011 President Jammeh warned independent journalists that he would \\"not compromise or sacrifice the peace, security, stability, dignity, and the well-being of Gambians for the sake of freedom of expression.\\" Accusing some journalists of being the \\"mouthpiece of opposition parties\\", he vowed to prosecute any journalist who offended him. The National Intelligence Agency (NIA) was involved in arbitrary closure of media outlets and the extrajudicial detention of journalists. In 2007 a Gambian journalist living in the US was convicted of sedition for an article published online; she was fined USD12,000; in 2006 the Gambian police ordered all subscribers to an online independent newspaper to report to the police or face arrest. The constitution and law prohibit arbitrary interference with privacy, family, home, or correspondence, but the government does not respect these prohibitions. Observers believe the government monitors citizens engaged in activities that it deems objectionable. = = * Rated as \\"partly free\\" in Freedom on the Net reports by Freedom House in the 2009 (score 34) and 2011 (score 32), as \\"free\\" in 2012 (score 29), 2013 (score 28), 2014 (score 28), 2015 (score 29), 2016 (score 29), and 2017 (score 29), and \\"partly free\\" in 2018 (score 32). * There is no ONI country profile for Kenya. The government does not employ technical filtering or any administrative censorship system to restrict access to political or other content. There are no government restrictions on access to the Internet, but Internet services are limited in rural areas due to lack of infrastructure. In 2008, approximately 8.6 percent of Kenyans used the Internet. The constitution protects freedom of expression and the \\"freedom to communicate ideas and information.\\" However, it also grants the government the authority to punish defamation, protect privileged information, and restrict state employees' \\"freedom of expression in the interest of defense, public safety, public order, public morality or public health.\\" In January 2009, the government passed a controversial Communications Amendment Act that established that any person who publishes, transmits, or causes to be published in electronic form obscene information commits an offense. The Act also outlines other forms of illegality associated with the use of information and communication technologies. In July 2009 the government announced that all cell phone users had to provide the government with their name and identification number. This regulation applies to citizens who access the Internet through cell phone-based services as well. = = * Rated \\"partly free\\" in Freedom on the Net by Freedom House in 2012 (score 43), 2013 (score 45), 2014 (score 48), and 2015 (score 54). * Listed as selective in the political area and as no evidence in social, conflict/security, and Internet tools by ONI in August 2009. * Identified by Freedom House as one of seven countries seen as particularly vulnerable to deterioration in their online freedoms during 2012 and 2013. The overthrow of the Gaddafi regime in August 2011 ended an era of censorship. The Constitutional Declaration under the interim governments provides for freedom of opinion, expression, and the press. There are no government restrictions on access to the Internet, but there are credible reports that the government monitors e-mail or Internet communication. Social media applications, such as YouTube, Facebook, and Twitter, were freely accessible. Internet content is not filtered, but service is often unreliable or nonexistent outside major cities. Before his removal and death, Col. Gaddafi had tried to impose a news blackout by cutting access to the Internet. Prior to this, Internet filtering under the Gaddafi regime had become more selective, focusing on a few political opposition Web sites. This relatively lenient filtering policy coincided with what was arguably a trend toward greater openness and increasing freedom of the press. However, the legal and political climate continued to encourage self-censorship in online media. In 2006 Reporters Without Borders removed Libya from their list of Internet enemies after a fact-finding visit found no evidence of Internet censorship. ONI's 2007‚Äì2008 technical test results contradicted that conclusion, however. And in 2012 RWB removed Libya from its list of countries under surveillance. = = * Rated \\"partly free\\" in the Freedom on the Net report from Freedom House in 2013 (score 42), 2014 (score 42), and 2015 (score 40). * Not individually classified by ONI, but is included in the regional overview for sub-Saharan Africa. Malawi prohibits the publication or transmission of anything \\"that could be useful to the enemy\\", as well as religiously offensive and obscene material. Malawi participates in regional efforts to combat cybercrime: the East African Community (consisting of Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda) and the South African Development Community (consisting of Malawi, Mozambique, South Africa, Zambia, and Zimbabwe) have both enacted plans to standardize cybercrime laws throughout their regions. = = There are no government restrictions on access to the Internet except for pornography or material deemed objectionable to Islamic values. There were no credible reports that the government monitored e-mail or Internet chat rooms without judicial oversight. Individuals and groups engage in the expression of views via the Internet, including by e‚Äëmail. The Ministry of Islamic Affairs continues to block Web sites considered anti-Islamic or pornographic. In November 2011 the Telecommunications Authority blocked and banned a local blog, Hilath.com, at the request of the Islamic Ministry because of its anti- Islamic content. The blog was known for promoting religious tolerance, as well as for discussing the blogger's homosexuality. NGO sources stated that in general the media practiced self-censorship on issues related to Islam due to fears of being labeled \\"anti-Islamic\\" and subsequently harassed. This self- censorship also applied to reporting on problems in and criticisms of the judiciary. = = * Classified by ONI as selective in the political and as no evidence in the social, security/conflict, and Internet tools areas in 2009. There is no individual ONI country profile for Mauritania, but it is included in the ONI regional overview for the Middle East and North Africa. There were no government restrictions on access to the Internet or reports that the government monitored email or Internet chat rooms in 2010. Individuals and groups could engage in the peaceful expression of views via the Internet, including by e-mail. There is a law prohibiting child pornography with penalties of two months to one year imprisonment and a 160,000 to 300,000 ouguiya ($550 to $1,034) fine. Between 16 March and 19 March 2009 and again on 25 June 2009 the news Web site Taqadoumy was blocked. On 26 February 2010, Hanevy Ould Dehah, director of Taqadoumy, received a presidential pardon after being detained since December 2009 despite having served his sentence for crimes against Islam and paying all imposed fines and legal fees. Dehah, who was originally arrested in June 2009 on charges of defamation of presidential candidate Ibrahima Sarr for publishing an article stating that Sarr bought a house with campaign money from General Aziz. Dehah, was sentenced in August 2009 to six months in prison and fined 30,000 ouguiya ($111) for committing acts contrary to Islam and decency. The sentencing judge accused Dehah of creating a space allowing individuals to express anti-Islamic and indecent views, based on a female reader's comments made on the Taqadoumy site calling for increased sexual freedom. = = * Rated \\"partly free\\" by Freedom House in Freedom on the Net in 2013 (score 42), 2014 (score 44), and 2015 (score 43). * Listed as selective in the social, conflict/security, and Internet tools areas and as no evidence in political by ONI in August 2009. Internet access in Morocco is, for the most part, open and unrestricted. Morocco's Internet filtration regime is relatively light and focuses on a few blog sites, a few highly visible anonymizers, and for a brief period in May 2007, the video sharing Web site YouTube. ONI testing revealed that Morocco no longer filters a majority of sites in favor of independence of the Western Sahara, which were previously blocked.

The Internet in these countries was described at the time as being a relatively open and unconstrained space for free expression, but the countries also typically featured a repressive environment for traditional media and had recently considered or introduced legislation that would negatively affect Internet freedom. The law does not provide for government restrictions on access to the Internet, but there are reports that the government blocks access to Web sites within the country that are critical of the government. In 2012 and 2013, some independent online news outlets and opposition blogs were intermittently inaccessible. Some opposition sites continue to be blocked on some ISPs in early 2013, including Umusingi and Inyenyeri News, which were first blocked in 2011. The constitution provides for freedom of speech and press \\"in conditions prescribed by the law.\\" The government at times restricts these rights. Laws prohibit promoting divisionism, genocide ideology, and genocide denial, \\"spreading rumors aimed at inciting the population to rise against the regime\\", expressing contempt for the Head of State, other high-level public officials, administrative authorities or other public servants, and slander of foreign and international officials and dignitaries. These acts or expression of these viewpoints sometimes results in arrest, harassment, or intimidation. Numerous journalists practice self-censorship. The constitution and law prohibit arbitrary interference with privacy, family, home, or correspondence; however, there are numerous reports the government monitors homes, telephone calls, e-mail, Internet chat rooms, other private communications, movements, and personal and institutional data.

Though Uganda has made great technological strides in the past five years, the country still faces a number of challenges in obtaining affordable, reliable Internet bandwidth. This, rather than a formal government-sponsored filtering regime, is the major obstacle to Internet access.

The Popular Front for the Liberation of Saguia el Hamra and Rio de Oro (Polisario), an organization that has sought independence for the former Spanish territory since 1973, disputes Morocco's claim to sovereignty over the territory. There is no indication that Internet access in the territory differs from that in internationally recognized Morocco. Morocco considers the part of the territory that it administers to be an integral component of the kingdom with the same laws and structures regarding civil liberties, political and economic rights. Moroccan law prohibits citizens from criticizing Islam or the institution of the monarchy or to oppose the government's official position regarding territorial integrity and Western Sahara.

There was significant international support for media law reform, and an intensive effort to undertake such changes was expected in early 2013. However, given the government's inability to impose its authority over much of Somalia, the practical implications of any new laws remains unclear. On 8 January 2014 the Islamist militia group al-Shabaab announced that it is banning the Internet in the areas of Somalia that it controls. Internet Service Providers were given 15 days to terminate their service and warned of sanctions for non-compliance. \\"Any company or individual that is found ignoring the call will be considered to be working with the enemy\\", the statement said.

In 2015, Rosneft Oil Company entered the project, taking a 50% share in the joint venture. In 2018, Rosneft withdrew from the joint project with ALLTECH. In 2018, ALLTECH Group merged its coal assets with Sibanthracite Group. Another ALLTECH project is real estate: the development of the ARTPLAY Design Center and several real estate projects in the Moscow region. = Sibanthracite Group = Sibanthracite Group p is the world's largest producer of anthracite UHG and is a leading Russian producer of metallurgical coal. The group was established in 2018, uniting the largest coal companies of the Novosibirsk region - Siberian Anthracite JSC and LLC Open-Pit Mine Vostochny LLC, as well as a large coal enterprise in the Kemerovo region - Open-Pit Mine Kiyzassky LLC. In April 2019, the Sibanthracite Group announced the financial and production results of its activities for RSBC for 2018: production - 24.1 million tons (four times more than in 2014). Revenue - 132.8 billion Rubles (an increase of 1.9 times year on year). The total amount of taxes assessed is 12.5 billion Rubles, the profit on tax amounted to 8.4 billion Rubles. Spending on social and charitable programs - 1.9 billion Rubles. By 2022, Sibanthracite plans to produce 58 million tons of coal and anthracite. As stated on the group‚Äôs website, one of the group‚Äôs priorities is to ensure industrial safety and social support for its employees. In 2018, 86 million Rubles and 111.4 million Rubles respectively were allocated for these purposes. One of the most promising projects of the Group is their participation in the construction of the Severomuisk tunnel. Dmitry Bosov announced his readiness to participate in this project in a letter to the President of the Russian Federation, Vladimir Putin, on March 11, 2018. According to media reports, Sibanthracite is negotiating the purchase of multifunctional loading and shipment complex \\"North\\". In 2018, RBC newspaper wrote that the owner of Neftegazholding, Eduard Hudaynatov, was interested in buying Sibanthracite. Sibanthracite denied plans to sell. Meanwhile, sharp criticism in the media for the negative impact on the environment is blamed on the open-pit mine Kiyzassky. After the incorporation of open-pit mine Kiyzassky into the SibanthraciteGroup, the former CEO of the mine, Nikolay Zarubin, was dismissed. According to sources, the main reason for the dismissal was a violation of environmental legislation. In interview with RBC, the head of Sibanthracite Barsky clarified that there are no threats to the company‚Äôs work. In April 2019, Sibanthracite announced that the construction time of the Severomuisky tunnel on the Baikal- Amur Magistrale would be 5 years. = VostokCoal MC = VostokCoal MC on a parity basis belongs to Dmitry Bosov and Alexander Isaev (chairman of the board). VostokCoal specializes in creating new coal and infrastructure projects. At the moment, the company, in partnership with Rostec, a state corporation, is building the Vera Port coal terminal (Primorsky Krai) and is preparing to start production at the Ogodginskoecoal field, the largest in the Russian Far East. The Arctic Mining Company (AGK), part of the VostokCoal MC structure, is implementing a project to begin developing coal deposits on the Taimyr Peninsula. Earlier, representatives of VostokCoal MC stated that by 2023 production at Taimyr would reach 30 million tons. However, as reported by the media, these plans were revised downwards due to the lack of a proven resource base. As the Telegram Nezygar reported on April 17, 2019, the UFSB for the Krasnoyarsk region opened a criminal case against the Arctic Mining Company (AGK) on April 8, 2019. According to Nezygar, company managers are suspected of illegal coal deals in the absence of a coal mining license. One of the grounds for initiating the case was the results of the inspection of the AGK by Rosprirodnadzor (Federal Service for Supervision of Natural Resource Usage) in 2017. In the same year, Rosprirodnadzor fined AGK 954 million Rubles, stating that it was conducting illegal coal mining. The Arctic Mining Company challenged the audit results in court.

She is best known for using cosmogenic nuclides to investigate landscape changes and dynamics. She has won multiple awards including the Antarctica Service Medal and the National Science Foundation CAREER Award. Willenbring has also been credited with bringing attention to the #MeToo movement in academia.  Early life and education  Willenbring was born on August 2, 1977, to Roys E. and Elaine K. Willenbring. She is the youngest of her two siblings, Jeb F. Willenbring and M. Colleen Willenbring. She grew up in Mandan, North Dakota, where she spent much of her childhood exploring the surrounding prairie. Here, she developed a curiosity about the landscape and began creating her own small experiments. Willenbring completed her Bachelor of Science in geosciences/soil science in 1999 at North Dakota State University, where she was McNair Scholar. Willenbring was a graduate student in earth science at Boston University, where she graduated in 2002. In 2006, Willenbring completed her Ph.D. in Earth Sciences at Dalhousie University in Nova Scotia, Canada. Her thesis investigated glacial erosion in the Arctic and Atlantic Canada using cosmogenic nuclides. Following her Ph.D. work, the National Center for Earth Surface Dynamics awarded Willenbring a Synthesis Postdoctoral Fellowship at the University of Minnesota. Two years later, in 2008, Willenbring was awarded an Alexander von Humboldt Postdoctoral Fellowship at Leibniz University Hannover and GFZ-Potsdam in Germany where she worked until 2010.  Career and research  Following her postdoctoral work in 2010, Willenbring joined the University of Pennsylvania's faculty as an assistant professor in the School of Arts and Sciences' Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences until 2016. Willenbring then became an associate professor at Scripps Institution of Oceanography at UC San Diego where she was also the director of the Scripps Cosmogenic Isotope Laboratory (SCI-Lab). In 2020, Willenbring became an associate professor at Stanford University. Willenbring's work focuses on how the earth's surface changes in response to a variety of forces including tectonics, climate, and living organisms. She utilizes high-resolution topographic data, field observations, landscape evolution models, ice sheet models, and geochemical techniques, specifically cosmogenic nuclides, to study the earth's surface. Willenbring is at the forefront of her field and has developed the use of beryllium-9 and cosmogenic beryllium-10 to trace erosion, weathering, and meltwater pulses in order to study and track the changes in Earth's surface. Willenbring has used some of her cosmogenic nuclide techniques in her research in Antarctica and Puerto Rico. She has dated meltwater pulses in Antarctica during warming periods using the ratio of beryllium-10 to beryllium-9. Willenbring is also a current investigator at the Luquillo Critical Zone Observatory in Puerto Rico where she and her colleagues use beryllium-10, as well as other cosmogenic nuclides, to investigate how Puerto Rico's landscape has affected its biodiversity. Their research has uncovered that nutrient-rich dust travels to Puerto Rico from the Sahara Desert which helps trees to grow in Puerto-Rico's nutrient- poor soil. In 2016, Willenbring received a National Science Foundation CAREER grant which she will use to study how beryllium isotopes can be used to track land-based sediment. Some of the funds will also be used to continue her citizen science project, \\"Soil Kitchen\\". In addition to Antarctica and Puerto Rico, Willenbring has also conducted research in Canada, and the South Fork Eel River in Northern California.

Public engagement  Willenbring has been credited with bringing the #MeToo and #TimesUp movement to science. In 2016, she filed a Title IX complaint of sexual harassment against her graduate school adviser. Her story received extensive media attention because the story was released the day after the New York Times story of Harvey Weinstein's alleged sexual assault and harassment that helped spark the viral #MeToo movement. The case led to the renaming of an Antarctic Glacier and to the firing of Boston University Professor, David Marchant. Her case also contributed to the creation of new policies within professional societies around fellowship and medal winner awarding procedures, and to new US National Science Foundation funding policies. She is featured prominently in the 2020 documentary Picture a Scientist, discussing her experiences and opinions on the matter. Willenbring continues to raise awareness about sexual harassment in academia. She has advocated for the National Science Foundation to promote safer working conditions at all of their funded research sites. She also brought the Growing Up Science lecture series to the Scripps Institution of Oceanography; The series is intended for scientists to share stories on the challenges they faced while throughout their career path. Willenbring was awarded the UC San Diego Equal Opportunity/Affirmative Action and Diversity Award in 2018 for her efforts. Willenbring also developed the citizen science project \\"Soil Kitchen\\". The program allows people to bring in their soils to be tested for heavy metal contamination and soil nutrients. The project is designed to educate the public and clean up urban contamination.

The book started as an assignment for a class of Mora's at the Rhode Island School of Design, where it was seen by an editor from Little, Brown. Thank You, Omu was well reviewed and a recipient of the 2019 Caldecott Honor for its illustrations. The book's mixed media drew praise for their detailed depictions of characters and locations.  Background and publication  The book, originally titled Omu's Stew, started as a student project for a class of Mora's at the Rhode Island School of Design: an assignment which required a character to have gained or lost something. While Omu is the Igbo word for queen, Mora's family had also used it to mean grandmother. In the book's backmatter, Mora credits her grandmother as one of her strong female role models. An editor for Little, Brown was present when the students' books were presented and signed Mora before she even had an agent. The book was published on October 2, 2018.  Plot  Omu makes a stew for dinner and its smell spreads throughout the neighborhood. One by one, starting with a boy, members of the community knock on her door to ask her for some of the stew, which Omu always gives. When Omu is ready for dinner, there is no more stew left. However, the community then brings her food to show their gratitude. They eat together and have a dance party.  Writing and illustrations  Mora chose a mixed media approach of cut paper, paint, and china markers for the book's illustrations. The use of collage gives, in the words of author Benjamin Anastas in The New York Times, \\"the book‚Äôs world a sense of depth and vibrancy.\\" Mora's use of collage allows her to create evocative and distinct characters and attractive backgrounds. The use of mixed-medium collage was compared to the way stew is assembled and the book's themes of diversity and inclusion by Calling Caldecott's Monique Harris. The illustration of the steam from the stew spreading through the neighborhood received particular attention and praise. The illustrations are bright and in a style that reflects Mora's Nigerian roots and her experience in the African- American community, ‚ÄúI really love that I could combine Nigerian and American traditions and create a book that exists in a third space like I myself do\\". Her illustrations drew comparisons to that of Ezra Jack Keats. The nature of the story resembled folklore according to some reviewers. Omu's kindness being repaid by the neighbors helps to reinforce the book's theme of food as a means to sharing, diversity, and inclusion. By sharing the food together at the end the individuals come together as a community. Through her sharing of her food, the main character becomes a grandmother to the entire community. The book's advanced vocabulary, repetition, and onomatopoeia help it to be a good book to be read aloud.  Reception and awards  The book received a starred review from Kirkus Reviews; Publishers Weekly, who also named it to their best books of 2018, praised the book as a \\"sweet story of inclusivity, gratitude, and delicious fellowship is also a feast for the eyes\\"; and School Library Journal, with reviewer Maria Salvadore writing, \\"Children will enjoy this fresh, engaging story of friendship and community building, perfect for any group gathering.\\" At the 2019 Youth Media Awards, the book was the recipient of a 2019 Caldecott Honor for its illustrations and the Coretta Scot King Steptoe Award for best new illustrator. Mora didn't answer the phone calling to tell her that she'd won the Caldecott Honor as she assumed it was a telemarketer only answering it when it called back a few minutes later. Upon hearing the news she cried say that, \\"Like most children‚Äôs book illustrators it has always been my dream to get Caldecott recognition one day. I simply cannot believe this has happened so early in my career but I am incredibly grateful.\\" The book also won a 2019 Ezra Jack Keats Book Award for its illustrations.

The story is about Little Star gradually eating the mooncake that her mother has baked. The book was a departure for Lin both thematically and in her use of illustrative style. The book was well reviewed and was awarded a Caldecott Honor. The illustrations feature heavy use of black and rely on both the pictures and words to convey the story and its themes.  Plot  As the book opens Little Star's mother has just finished making a \\"Big mooncake\\" and asks the young girl to not touch it. After awaking in the middle of the night, Little Star forgets what her mother had asked of her and takes a small bite and then runs back to bed. This is repeated each night with the mooncake getting smaller and smaller, until Little Star's mother discovers what's happened. The book ends with the two baking a new mooncake.  Background and publication  The book was written to celebrate Lin's \\"favorite Asian holiday\\", the Mid-Autumn Festival (what Lin calls the Autumn Moon Festival). She wanted a story for the festival to tell her three-year-old daughter after they had exhausted traditional tales, such as those about the Moon rabbit, and her daughter demanded more. The story was then inspired after her daughter ate all the mooncakes for the year and learned that there would be no more until next year. With the book, Lin was responding to her despair after the 2016 United States presidential election and an art exhibit about the Americana of Robert McCloskey she had taken her daughter to. In the exhibit Lin noticed that there was no Asian representation for her daughter to see and then further thought about Coles Phillips' illustrations where the characters blend into the background, which also lacked Asian characters. Little Star was inspired by Lin's daughter and also created to be an example of the Asian representation Lin had felt was missing. The book was published on August 28, 2018 by Little, Brown and Company.  Writing and illustrations  For Lin, this book represented a change in theme from examining her Asian heritage to claiming her American identity. A Big Mooncake for Little Star is about the phases of the moon and represented a new illustrative style for Lin who had previously illustrated her chapter books like Where the Mountain Meets the Moon with block print. In this book, Lin used gouache on watercolor paper. Black plays an important role in the book's illustrations, contributing to the nighttime sky theme. Author Samantha Hunt writing in The New York Times wrote of how \\"the rich darkness of the book‚Äôs pages is cut by the glorious gold of the stars\\". The food combines with the background to further space imagery with the crumbs of the mooncake become the stars while spilled milk resembles the Milky Way. This reinforces the book's space theme with Little Star's eating of the mooncakes representing the phases of the moon, though this is not directly stated. The heavy use of black also allows for more emphasis on where and how the book's text is placed and helps reinforce the space theme. Lin's writing and illustrations combined to produce a mysterious and slightly irreverent tone in this original fable. The book's mother-daughter relationship gives a reassuring feeling to the reader. Lin was particularly proud of the endpapers and their homage to McClosky's Blueberries for Sal. She also wanted to capture \\"the same mother-daughter bond, that timeless love of family, that passing along of traditions and skills. Those things that go beyond race and nationality.\\" The book was also compared to Maurice Sendak's In the Night Kitchen.  Reviews and awards  The book was generally well reviewed. It was given a starred review and was named a best book of 2018 by Kirkus Reviews and Publishers Weekly, while The Washington Post named it as a best book of the year. It also received starred reviews from Booklist, with author and editor Ilene Cooper praising the illustrations and Lin's \\"intriguing characters who come alive through facial expressions\\", The Horn Book Magazine, and the School Library Journal. The book was a recipient of a 2019 Caldecott Honor for its illustrations. Lin had tried to tune out the chatter around A Big Mooncake for Little Star being a possible Caldecott book. She had thought the odds of a win were unlikely, so she scheduled a massage when the awards were announced as a way to, \\"feel special when the dream ended.\\" When she hadn't heard anything by mid-morning she thought it wasn't going to happen and so she was surprised when a little while later her phone rang. The Caledcott had been a signal of quality for Lin who had studied illustration at the Rhode Island School of Design in part because of multiple Caldecott winner Chris Van Allsburg's association with the school. The Wall Street Journal noted that this book was part of a \\"cheerful\\" set of Caldecott Medal and Honor books.

Alma, whose full name is Alma Sofia Esperanza Jos√© Pura Candela, thinks she has too many names and so she asks her dad about them. He explains the various people she was named to honor. The book was spurred by Martinez-Neal's Peruvian immigrant experience and the birth of her children. The book was well reviewed and a recipient of a 2019 Caldecott Honor for its illustrations. The graphite and colored pencil illustrations feature only a few colors, including blue and pink. Martinez-Neal hoped to evoke the feel of a photo album, in keeping with the book's theme of family.  Background and publication  Juana Martinez-Neal moved to the United States in her 20s. As an immigrant, she grappled with her identity, before deciding that \\"my culture was part of my whole personal identity, and I wanted to pass my culture on to my children.\\" As part of this desire, it was around this time that she began to author and illustrate children's books. She based Alma on her own experiences growing up and hearing the stories of her relatives. Her agent, Stefanie Von Borstel, pitched the book, with sample illustrations, to a variety of publishers, with seven being selected for an auction. Candlewick Press was eventually selected as the publisher. The book was published in English and Spanish on April 10, 2018. This simultaneous publication was important to Martinez-Neal, and was part of the book's auction process.  Plot  When the book opens Alma Sofia Esperanza Jos√© Pura Candela feels that her name is too long. Her father, upon hearing Alma's complaint, offers to tell her the story of her name. For each name her father tells her about the relative she was named for and Alma is able to make a connection between herself and the relative. After hearing about her five other names Alma asks about her first name. Her father explains that there is no other Alma, just her. At the end of the book Alma feels her name fits and that she has \\"a story to tell.\\"  Writing and illustrations  The book was illustrated using graphite and colored pencils. They created, in the words of The Horn Book Magazine reviewer Megan Dowd Lambert, \\"a soft texture\\". It was Martinez-Neal's hope to create \\"the feel of an old family photo album.\\" It also, in the words of Horn Books Emily Prabhaker, \\"underscores Alma‚Äôs agency throughout the book. We see her as a writer through her own handwriting and as an artist in the depictions of her own graphite drawings.\\" Through her use of blues and pinks she hoped to help differentiate what was happening the present from the past. Alma herself is illustrated as the same cream color as the background. Family plays an important role in the story. Each family member's name was signed uniquely, reflecting Martinez-Neal's interest in typography and her hope that this signature would help to express the family member's personality. She also embedded references to Alma's Peruvian lineage through the illustrations. Through her father's stories Alma connects who she is to her namesake family members. This includes Alma making eye contact with her ancestors as she imagines the stories her father is telling her. However, the closing line also suggests the way that Alma's story will be unique as her father advises her, \\"You will make your own story\\", a question Martinez-Neal echoes in the author's note.  Reception and awards  The book was generally well reviewed. It received starred reviews from Publishers Weekly, which called the book \\"a winner\\" and School Library Journal, where reviewer Daryl Grabarek summarized the book as, \\"a beautifully illustrated, tender story to be shared with all children.\\" In a positive review, Julia Smith writing in Booklist praised the illustrations, \\"Martinez-Neal brings her gentle story to life through beautiful graphite- and colored-pencil artwork set against cream- colored backgrounds.\\" The book was a recipient of a 2019 Caldecott Honor for its illustrations, with the committee writing how \\"Martinez-Neal uses smudgy graphite and colored pencil to convey a soft palette that gently transports readers into Alma‚Äôs rich ancestral past.\\" Martinez-Neal expressed her pride as a Peruvian in winning the award and that the achievement of winning the Caldecott was a \\"recognition for all the years it took to get here, to develop the work, to find my voice ... including those years when I felt I didn‚Äôt know what I was doing.\\" References 2018 children's books American picture books Caldecott Honor-winning works ","title":"Alma and How She Got Her Name"},{"id":"60578253","text":"\\"Stay With You\\" is a single by Lemon Jelly.

M√•ns Ivar √Ökesson \\"M√•sse\\" Groundstroem [gr ändstr√∂m] (b. 23 April 1949) is a Finnish bass player, studio technician and music producer. He has recorded ca. 100 music albums and produced another 70 albums. Most of these albums were released by Love Records. Early life Groundstroem grew up in the T√∂√∂l√∂ neighbourhood in Helsinki, in an educated bourgeoisie family. Even before he went to school, he was sent to piano lessons, but he was not excited about classical piano music. \\"I had absolutely no touch for playing classical music. In fact, I used to hate that form of terror. At that time, that is.\\" However, his father bought him a guitar, and thus Groundstroem was able to \\"rebel with rock music, which at the time was turning young people wild\\". During these early years, Groundstroem played in bands called Typhoons, Pems and Roosters. Already in 1965 he was playing semiprofessionally, and the following year he made his recording debut on Jukka Kuoppam√§ki‚Äôs album Mit√§ kansa haluaa (‚ÄòWhat the people want‚Äô). Career Groundstroem played in three prominent Finnish rock bands in succession. These were Blues Section and the progressive rock bands Tasavallan Presidentti and Wigwam. Of these Blues Section was the first band to release a record through Love Records and Wigwam the last. In Wigwam, Groundstroem was the longest serving bass player (1974‚Äì2003). Since 1971, Groundstroem became known as a music producer and audio engineer. He produced albums for e.g. Jukka Tolonen, Jim Pembroke, Pekka Pohjola, Dave Lindholm, Juice Leskinen, Albert J√§rvinen, Muska, Maarit as well as for Hurriganes and Kaseva. ‚ÄúMost of the time I was given new artists to produce. If I was successful with them, a real professional was hired for the following album. [‚Ä¶] Being a producer was essentially a practical job ‚Äì it included planning, drawing up schedules and staying up late. Little by little I tried to assume a musical role, encouraging and motivating the musicians, and even that of an arbiter of taste.\\" When punk rock and new wave music emerged, he was no longer a hot item in the field of rhythm music, and he left the business and trained as a cook, in which job he worked for five years in the 1980s. In the early 1990s, Groundstroem had to give up his career as a cook, due to psoriasis. The disease cause the skin of his hands to flake. He then returned to music producing and bass playing, just in time for the re-emergence of Tasavallan Presidentti and Wigwam. He continued to play with these bands until 2004, when his psoriasis got worse and he had to go to disability pension. In 2007, Groundstroem was granted artist's pension. During the last few years Groundstroem has played with Wigwam Revisited, which consists of former Wigwam members. He has also worked as an engineer and producer for a few record releases.

She was charged with high treason but was then taken to Sachsenhausen concentration camp where she was shot dead, so that her case never came to trial. Biography Ella Beyer was born in Berlin where her mother worked as a washerwoman. She grew up in the city's Wedding quarter. She became a metal worker with the \\"Lewin\\" company and then a winder at the AEG plant in the adjacent quarter of Berlin-Gesundbrunnen. It was at AEG that her political engagement began when in 1922 she became a member of the Metal Workers' Union (\\"Deutscher Metallarbeiter-Verband\\" / DMV). Four years after that, in 1926, she joined the Communist Party. In 1929 she was elected to membership of the district council. Around this time Ella Beyer also married her partner, Paul Trebe. Towards the end of the 1920s, with nationalist populism on the rise, politics became increasingly polarised. Ella Trebe became an active supporter of the Revolutionary Trades Union Opposition (RGO) movement in 1929/30. In 1931 she was confirmed as \\"women's leader\\" on the ruling executive of the Einheitsverband der Metallarbeiter Berlins (literally, \\"Unity Association of the Berlin Metal Workers\\" which was an element within the RGO. She also sometimes acted as a \\"party instructor\\" for the Communist Party. The elections in 1932 left the moderate mainstream parties without enough seats in the Reichstag (parliament) to govern except with support from an extremist party. The largest party in the parliament was the National Socialist (\\"Nazi\\") Party, but even they had only 33% of the seats after November 1932, and there was in any case no appetite from either side for a coalition government involving the National Socialists. Through skillful gaming of the unprecedented parliamentary deadlock, in January 1933 the National Socialists took power and lost no time in transforming Germany into a one-party dictatorship. With (non- Nazi) political activism now illegal, Ella Trebe nevertheless joined the \\"Sicherheitsapparat Norden\\" (\\"Security Apparatus north\\") which was part of the (now \\"underground\\") Berlin region leadership team (\\"Bezirksleitung\\") of the Communist Party. She found a new job and between 1934 and 1936 worked at the \\"Teves GmbH\\" car parts factory in Berlin-Wittenau where she maintained links with party activists working illegally in the plant. During the later 1930s government security services increasingly grouped anti-Nazi resistance groups together as the Rote Kapelle (loosely, \\"Red Orchestra\\"), and by the time war broke out in 1939 Ella Trebe was clearly viewed as part of this resistance movement. She was politically involved with the journalist and resistance activist Wilhelm Guddorf and Erwin Reisler. She also undertook courier work, maintaining links with underground communist resistance groups operating elsewhere. During the first part of 1943 Trebe arranged accommodation and contacts for Ernst Beuthke, a communist hero of the Spanish Civil War. He had been parachuted back into Germany as a resistance organiser by the British, landing in a field in the countryside to the west of Berlin. His arrival coincided with the appearance of a number of other German-born resistance fighters, also arriving by parachute, from the Soviet Union. The authorities became aware of the arrival of these so-called \\"parachute agents\\" (\\"Fallschirmagenten\\") and took immediate steps to arrest them and their \\"helpers\\". There are strong indications that Beuthke had conducted himself \\"imprudently\\", for instance visiting the home of his parents (whom he had not seen since 1933) for a family reunion. Beuthke was denounced and arrested. All the individuals who had been associated with him were identified and arrested overnight on 9/10 June 1943. That included Ella Trebe and her family. They were accused of \\"spying for the enemy\\" (\\"Feindspionage\\"). They were taken to the Security Services headquarters \\"Reichssicherheitshauptamt\\" in the Prinz- Albrecht-Stra√üe and / or the Alexanderplatz penitentiary. It is not known whether they were tortured. Friends and relatives were permitted to bring clothes and food, but not to speak with them. The formal charge was the usual one, under these circumstances, of \\"High Treason\\", but the case never came to trial. Following express orders from Heinrich Himmler himself, on 11 August 1943 these \\"Berlin communist prisoners\\" were taken to Sachsenhausen concentration camp and killed by shooting. Those murdered on this occasion included Ella Trebe and Ernst Beuthke, along with Beuthke's parents and brothers.

Some merchants were doing business in distant countries such as Sweden or China. Merchants were highly valued for the government supporting them.

A bastard film is sometimes described as the ‚Äúterribly-behaved cousin of the orphan film‚Äù. The participants and attendees are usually archivists, scholars, librarians, academics, social historians, enthusiasts, film researchers and collectors in the world of film and video content. Over the weekend event, attendees will be introduced to films, view them, and a discussion will follow.\\" BFE has been described as \\"Equal parts endurance test, group therapy session, academic conference, and absurdist jamboree...\\"  Purpose  Film festivals are an important form of curation and typically focus on a particular genre, length or specific region. However, there are some films that are not easily categorized and possibly defy conventional tastes and opinions. The Bastard Film Encounter has allowed for a reevaluation of some of these ignored or hidden moving images. BFE's purpose is to question the \\"why\\" of these \\"bastard\\" films as well as the \\"what\\" to do with them in a learned and academic setting, enabling experts in the field to discuss the issues of both past and future historical context, ethics and consent, and distribution of time and attention in regards to these sometimes dismissed and often forgotten films. Archivists and scholars are pushed to question their responsibility as stewards of film, culture, and history by reexamining what items in a collection have benefited from scarce resources in the past, and whether there is room for the \\"bastard\\" film to also be preserved, catalogued, digitized, and publicized. BFE stimulates discussion regarding the purpose of media archives, how they should they be organized, whom should they serve, whose story they tell, and how they tell it. Bastard films also generate discussion about the daily intake of visual media and not just around academic topics. \\"We consume televisual content that‚Äôs hard to watch and rewires our understanding of humanity on a nearly daily basis, whether that be the social media livestreams from members of extremist groups, law enforcement body-cam footage, or news reports from the latest presidential rally. The challenge of how to handle the things we can‚Äôt unsee isn‚Äôt confined to history, it‚Äôs a fundamental component of being a 21st- century digital citizen.\\"  Creation and history  The event name comes from the word ‚Äòbastard‚Äô (something irregular or inferior) and the word ‚Äòencounter‚Äô (unexpectedly come across something). The inaugural Bastard Film Encounter was held in April 2013 in Raleigh, North Carolina. It was co-founded by Skip Elsheimer, founder at A/V Geeks LLC; Marsha Gordon, Professor of Film Studies, North Carolina State University; and Dwight Swanson, independent specialist in amateur film and regional film production. The founders were inspired to examine the \\"bastards\\" of orphan films. After an Orphan Film Symposium which celebrates things that need to be saved, Elsheimer, Gordon, and Swanson asked, \\"But what about the bastards?\\" Like other more traditional film festivals and academic conferences, there is a call for proposals and a carefully planned schedule of presentations. The Bastard Film Encounter took place biannually in Raleigh from 2013 through 2017, after which it was relocated to Baltimore, Maryland for the 2019 BFE. Stephanie Sapienza, project manager of the Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities, spearheaded the relocation in an organizational role. The BFE screenings and discussions typically take place in non-traditional meeting spaces, with a particular fondness for bars with performance space. The organizers aim to foster an intimate space where people can discuss the uncomfortable and events become part \\"endurance test, group therapy session, academic conference, and absurdist jamboree\\". Attendees are also allowed to discuss difficult topics such as materials in archives that the public will never see. The event provides a space to discuss these loaded subjects. The goal of the encounter is to encourage discussion over the cultural and historical worth of each film, both now as well as in the future. Participants debate whether there is room in the archival sphere for films which may appear to be of limited (or non-existent) artistic, scholarly, historic, or cultural value. The Bastard Film Encounter always hosts a keynote speaker. Keynote speakers have included Dino Everett, Archivist at USC Hugh M. Hefner Moving Image Archive; Andrew Lampert, filmmaker and director; and Brian L. Frye, Associate Professor of Law at University of Kentucky College of Law; Snowden Becker, MLIS Program Director at UCLA Department of Information Studies; and Liz Coffey, ex-film conservator at Harvard Film Archive. = Unusual characteristics = The Bastard Film Encounter eschews the typical culture of professional conferences and has created certain light-hearted traditions to provide balance and relief from the unusual material being viewed and ingested by the audience members and participants. Between films, talent breaks are implemented to provide relief and there is great pressure to participate. In 2013, as a respite from two days of viewing challenging and difficult material, film collector Greg Pierce spontaneously allowed artist/performer/nurse Joan Vorderbruggen to remove his stitches on stage with a musical \\"soundtrack\\" provided by archival producer and researcher Rich Remsberg and his banjo. The event was recorded, thus creating a \\"bastard film\\" during the Bastard Film Encounter and a tough to top \\"talent\\" entry. Opening night is Bastards Karaoke Night with participants performing with The Bastards Karaoke Band. Powerpoint presentations are not allowed during the conference presentations but an overhead projector can be provided for transparencies. Many of the presentations enforce a social media black-out for reasons of permissions, ethics, consent, and sensitivity. The old-fashioned hourglass timer's purpose is to keep presenters at the 5 minutes or less mark. Alcohol and dark humor are commonly indulged tonics during BFE.

Early life  At the age of 14, Fong Chung-Ray was obliged to leave his family and go into exile, due to the Chinese Civil War when he enlisted as a lieutenant in the navy. As the army moved to different locations and various political events occurred, he settled in Taiwan in 1949.  Artistic practice  Fong Chung-Ray's passion for art and inquiring mind led him to take an interest in Western abstract art, which he discovered through reading journals and books, available in the American Library in Taipei. In 1957, he founded the Four Seas Artists Association with his friend, Hu Chi-Chung. During this period, he experimented with abstraction and used new Western techniques, such as painting with oil on canvas. In 1961, he became a member of the Wuyue Group (Fifth Moon Group) and participated in many exhibitions. in 1963, on the advice of Liu Guosong, a painter and the Group‚Äôs theorist, he abandoned painting with oil on canvas and returned to the traditional Chinese technique of ink painting. Fong Chung-Ray then invented a brush made from palm tree fibres, which added a highly personal touch and a rougher quality to his sweeps of colour. The abstract ink works from this period, with their blend of subtle colouring, dynamic strokes, wet sweeps of colour, and poetry, were rooted directly in the tradition of the Chinese master landscape painters. In 1971, he was awarded a Rockefeller Foundation grant that enabled him to travel to Europe and the united States. When he settled in San Francisco in 1975, he began to work with acrylic paint. Initially, his work focused on abstract landscapes, but he gradually moved away from this movement when he turned to Buddhist spirituality. This fresh source of inspiration resulted in a more abstract approach, related to temporality, which he studied in the sacred texts. The effects of time on materials and an exploration of the technique of collages and imprints have become fundamental aspects of his artistic approach. By going beyond the formal representation of nature, Fong Chung-Ray has revived the spiritual essence that emanates from the paintings by the great old masters and invites the viewer to contemplate.

The business was founded in 1971 in Chinatown, Manhattan, as Chinese Native Products by Ming Yi Chen and a group of student activists from China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan. Chen has said that she and her colleagues \\"wanted to create a small window into the Chinese culture\\". Its products include braided straw slippers, paper lanterns, cheongsams, cotton Mary Janes, and copies of Mao's Little Red Book. Pearl River Mart has become a New York City institution. The business has an art gallery in its main location, and hosts in-store events and performances. History Pearl River Mart was founded in 1971 by Ming Yi Chen and a group of activists from China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan. Diplomatic relations between the United States and China were frozen at the time, and trade was banned due to the Cold War. The founders hoped that the store would improve cultural understanding of China. When trade relations were restored, Pearl River Mart was an early recipient of Chinese goods. The store has occupied various locations since its founding, including a location described as a \\"department store\\". In March 2016, Pearl River Mart closed due to increasing rent. It re-opened in November 2016 under the leadership of Joanne Kwong, the Chens' daughter-in-law. In November 2017, the store expanded with a second location in Chelsea Market; a third location opened at the Museum of Chinese in America in January 2019. Pearl River Mart has collaborated with several Asian-American designers and entrepreneurs. It also has an art gallery, which showcases the work of Asian and Asian-American artists; featured artists have included Corky Lee, Chinatown Art Brigade, and Yumi Sakugawa.

He was also a leader involved in passage of state laws that integrated the Indiana National Guard, ended racial discrimination in public accommodations and in Indiana University's student housing, and secured a fair employment practices law for public-works projects. In addition, Richardson won a landmark public housing discrimination case in 1953. Richardson, an outspoken critic of racial prejudice and discrimination, was an active leader in numerous civic organizations that included the National Urban League, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, the United Negro College Fund, the Indianapolis Urban League, the Indiana Board of Public Welfare, the local Federation of Associated Clubs, the Greater Indianapolis Progress Committee, and the Indianapolis Church Federation, among others. Early life and education Henry Johnson Richardson Jr. was born on June 21, 1902, in Huntsville, Alabama, to Henry J. and Louise M. (Johnson) Richardson. His father was a veteran of the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War and worked as an insurance agent. His mother worked at home. When Richardson was seventeen years old his parents sent him to Indianapolis, Indiana, in search of better educational opportunities. While attending Shortridge High School, Richardson lived at Indianapolis's Senate Avenue Young Men's Christian Association and waited tables to support himself. He graduated from Shortridge in 1921 and attended the University of Illinois on scholarship for two years. At Illinois he served as editor of a student newspaper, The College Dreamer. Richardson briefly returned to Huntsville due to his mother's death. He moved to Indianapolis in 1925 and earned a bachelor of laws degree (L.L.B.) from the Indiana Law School in 1928. (Indiana Law School later became a part of Indiana University School of Law.)Latham, \\"Henry J. Richardson Papers: Historical Sketch,\\" p. 2. Marriage and family Richardson married Roselyn Vivian Comer on September 18, 1938. Comer, a native of Georgia , was a graduate of Fort Valley Normal and Industrial School, attended Clark College in Atlanta, Georgia, from 1930 to 1934, and received a certificate from the Atlanta University School of Social Work in 1936. Prior to her marriage she worked for the American Friends Service Committee. Henry and Roselyn Richardson were the parents of two sons, Henry J. III and Rodney C. Richardson. Roselyn Richardson was active in Indianapolis civic and community affairs, especially efforts to desegregate Indianapolis Public Schools.\\"Biographical Sketch\\" in See also: Emma Lou Thornbrough, \\"The History of Black Women in Indiana\\" in Lawyer and politician =1930s= After completing law school in 1928, Richardson became interested in local and state politics. He was appointed as temporary judge in Marion County Superior Court in 1930 and elected to the Indiana House of Representatives on the Democratic Party ticket in 1932. Richardson and Robert Stanton (representing Gary) were the first African Americans in the twentieth century to be elected to the Indiana General Assembly. Richardson served two terms, winning reelection in 1934. While serving as a state representative, Richardson sponsored legislation in 1935 to amend the state constitution to allow the integration of the Indiana National Guard. He also helped end discrimination in Indiana University's dormitories. (IU previously prohibited African American students from living in campus housing.) In 1934 Richardson and six other legislators were co-sponsors of a bill that was passed to end racial discrimination in public accommodations. Richardson also sponsored a fair employment practices law that prohibited state or municipal corporations from discriminating in their contracts for public works projects. However, his two attempts to pass legislation to strengthen the state's 1885 Civil Rights Law were unsuccessful. Richardson's legislative actions earned him a reputation of a \\"political maverick\\" and the Democratic Party did not nominate him for a seat in the state legislature in 1936.Gugin and St. Clair, eds., p. 289. From 1933 to 1934 Richardson was an attorney for Home Owners Loan Corporation in Indiana, as well as remaining a civil rights activist. From 1932 to 1938 he was director of the Civil Liberties Division of the National Bar Association. In 1938 he was one of the founders of the Federation of Associated Clubs, a local group of African American organizations that worked on civil rights reform. In 1942 the federation became involved in ending segregation in Indianapolis theaters. =1940s= During the 1940s Richardson continued to support civil rights reform. He was appointed to Indiana Board of Public Welfare in 1940 and served on the board for four years. In 1947 Richardson chaired a committee that drafted, sponsored, and lobbied to secure passage of Indiana's \\"Anti-Hate\\" Law to eliminate racial segregation in the state. That same year he also secured a court injunction that barred Dixiecrat Party candidates, including Strom Thurmond, from the Indiana ballot. In 1948 Richardson was appointed a special judge for Marion County Criminal Court. The longtime civil rights lawyer is best known for his efforts in 1949 to secure passage of Indiana's school desegregation law. Richardson played a major role in the effort as a lobbyist and policy strategist. Indiana's governor signed the Hunter-Binder bill (House Bill 242) into law in March 1949. The law mandated integration of Indiana public schools by 1954 and prohibited discriminatory hiring practices. School districts that did not comply with the new law would face suspension of public funding.Gugin and St. Clair, eds., p. 290. Despite passage of the legislation, some of Indiana's school districts, including those in Indianapolis, Evansville, and Gary, were slow to integrate their schools, forcing subsequent legal action. In Indianapolis the legal challenges to the state law continued for more than two decades.Thornbrough and Ruegamer, Indiana Blacks in the Twentieth Century, pp. 145‚Äì50. Richardson was also considered for government positions outside Indiana. In 1939 he was nominated for federal judge and in 1949 as governor of U.S. Virgin Islands, but was not named to either post. =1950s and 1960s= Richardson continued to work on civil-rights issues serving as an organization leader and for some groups as a legal representative. In 1953, as the state's National Association for the Advancement of Colored People's legal representative (a position he had held since 1935), Richardson worked with Thurgood Marshall and Constance Baker Motley to win Jessie Woodbridge, et al. v. Housing Authority of Evansville, Indiana, a landmark public housing discrimination case. In 1958 Richardson became Indiana's first life member of the NAACP. From 1963 to 1967 Richardson served as a member Indiana State Real Estate Commission and from 1964 to 1968 as a member Federal Civil Rights Commission. He also helped found the Indianapolis Urban League in 1965 and later served for several years as the group's president. He also served on the board of the National Urban League from 1966 to 1970.Thornbrough and Ruegamer, Indiana Blacks in the Twentieth Century, p. 166. =Other community service= In addition to his leadership and civil rights activism in the Urban League, NAACP, and Federation of Associated Clubs, Richardson involved in numerous other civic, religious, and community service organizations in Indiana. He was active in the Witherspoon Presbyterian Church, a board member of the Indianapolis Church Federation, the Indiana Board of Public Welfare, and the Indiana State Real Estate Commission, and a supporter of Indianapolis's Senate Ave YMCA. He was also active in the United Negro College Fund, including service as local chairman and a member of the national board. In the final two decades of his life, Richardson was a member of the Mayor's Advisory Council and Greater Indianapolis Progress Committee. During the 1970s Richardson was among Indianapolis's African American community leaders who adamantly opposed UniGov, a plan to consolidate some municipal and county government departments; however, the UniGov bill passed the Indiana General Assembly and was implemented in Indianapolis and in Marion County.Thornbrough and Ruegamer, Indiana Blacks in the Twentieth Century, p. 178.

This approach is based on the identification of consumed species by characterization of DNA present in dietary samples, e.g. individual food remains, regurgitates, gut and fecal samples, homogenized body of the host organism, target of the diet study (for example with whole body of insects). The DNA sequencing approach to be adopted depends on the diet breadth of the target consumer. For organisms feeding on one or only few species, traditional Sanger sequencing techniques can be used. For polyphagous species with diet items more difficult to identify, it is conceivable to determine all consumed species using NGS methodology. The barcode markers utilized for amplification will differ depending on the diet of the target organism. For herbivore diets, the standard DNA barcode loci will differ significantly depending on the plant taxonomic level. Therefore, for identifying plant tissue at the taxonomic family or genus level, the markers rbcL and trn-L-intron are used, which differ from the loci ITS2, matK, trnH-psbA (noncoding intergenic spacer) used to identify diet items to genus and species level. For animal prey, the most broadly used DNA barcode markers to identify diets are the mitochondrial cytocrome C oxydase (COI) and cytochrome b (cytb). When the diet is broad and diverse, DNA metabarcoding is used to identify most of the consumed items.  Advantages  A major benefit of using DNA barcoding in diet assessment is the ability to provide high taxonomic resolution of consumed species. Indeed, when compared to traditional morphological analysis, DNA barcoding enables a more reliable separation of closely related taxa reducing the observed bias. Moreover, DNA barcoding enables to detect soft and highly digested items, not recognisable through morphological identification. For example, Arachnids feed on pre-digested bodies of insects or other small animals and their stomach content is too decomposed and morphologically unrecognizable using traditional methods such as microscopy. When investigating herbivores diet, DNA metabarcoding enables detection of highly digested plant items with a higher number of taxa identified compared to microhistology and macroscopic analysis. For instance, Nichols et al. (2016) highlighted the taxonomic precision of metabarcoding on rumen contents, with on average 90% of DNA-sequences being identified to genus or species level in comparison to 75% of plant fragments recognised with macroscopy. Morevoer, another empirically tested advantage of metabarcoding compared to traditional time-consuming methods, involves higher cost efficiency. Finally, with its fine resolution, DNA barcoding represents a crucial tool in wildlife management to identify the feeding habits of endangered species and animals that can cause feeding damages to the environment.  Challenges  With DNA barcoding it is not possible to retrieve information about sex or age of prey species, which can be crucial. This limitation can anyway be overcome with an additional step in the analysis by using microsatellite polymorphism and Y-chromosome amplification. Moreover, DNA provides detailed information of the most recent events (e.g. 24‚Äì48 hr) but it is not able to provide a longer dietary prospect unless a continuous sampling is conducted. Additionally, when using generic primers that amplify ‚Äòbarcode‚Äô regions from a broad range of food species, the amplifiable host DNA may largely outnumber the presence of prey DNA, complicating prey detection. However, a strategy to prevent the host DNA amplification can be the addition of a predator-specific blocking primer. Indeed, blocking primers for suppressing amplification of predator DNA allows the amplification of the other vertebrate groups and produces amplicon mixes that are predominately food DNA. Despite the improvement of diet assessment via DNA barcoding, secondary consumption (prey of the prey, parasites, etc.) still represents a confounding factor. In fact, some secondary prey may result in the analysis as primary prey items, introducing a bias. However, due to a much lower total biomass and to a higher level of degradation, DNA of secondary prey might represent only a minor part of sequences recovered compared to primary prey. The quantitative interpretation of DNA barcoding results is not straightforward. There have been attempts to use the number of sequences recovered to estimate the abundance of prey species in diet contents (e.g. gut, faeces). For example, if the wolf ate more moose than wild boar, there should be more moose DNA in their gut, and thus, more moose sequences are recovered. Despite the evidence for general correlations between the sequence number and the biomass, actual evaluations of this method have been unsuccessful. This can be explained by the fact that tissues originally contain different densities of DNA and can be digested differently.  Examples  = Mammals = Mammals diet is widely studied using DNA barcoding and metabarcoding. Some differences in the methodology can be observed depending on the feeding strategy of the target mammal species, i.e. whether it is herbivore, carnivore, or omnivore. For herbivore mammal species, DNA is usually extracted from faeces samples or rumen contents collected from road kills or animals killed during regular hunting. Within DNA barcoding, the trnL approach can be used to identify plant species by using a very short but informative fragment of chloroplast DNA (P6 loop of the chloroplast trnL (UAA) intron). Potentially, this application is applicable to all herbivorous species feeding on angiosperms and gymnosperms Alternatively to the trnL approach, the markers rbcL, ITS2, matK, trnH-psbA can be used to amplify plant species. When studying small herbivores with a cryptic life style, such as voles and lemmings, DNA barcoding of ingested plants can be a crucial tool giving an accurate picture of food utilization. Additionally, the fine resolution in plant identification obtained with DNA barcoding allows researchers to understand change in diet composition over time and variability among individuals, as observed in the alpine chamois (Rupicapra rupicapra). Between October and November, by analyzing the faeces composition via DNA barcoding, the alpine chamois showed a shift in diet preferences. Also, different diet categories were observed amongst individuals within each month. Faeces of wolf (Canis lupus) collected in Sweden For carnivores, the use of non-invasive approaches is crucial especially when dealing with elusive and endangered species. Diet assessment through DNA barcoding of faeces can have a greater efficiency in prey species detection compared to traditional diet analysis, which mostly rely upon the morphological identification of undigested hard remains in the faeces. Estimating the vertebrate diet diversity of the leopard cat (Prionailurus bengalensis) in Pakistan, Shehzad et al. (2012) identified a total of 18 prey taxa using DNA barcoding on faeces. Eight distinct bird taxa were reported, while previous studies based on conventional methods did not identify any bird species in the leopard cat diet. Another example is the use of DNA barcoding to identify soft remains of prey in the stomach contents of predators e.g. grey seals (Halichoerus grypus) and harbour porpoises (Phocoena phocoena). DNA metabarcoding is a game changer for the study of complex diets, such as for omnivores predators, feeding on many different species with both plants and animal origin. This methodology does not require knowledge about the food consumed by animals in the habitat they occupy. In a study on brown bear (Ursus arctos) diet, DNA metabarcoding allowed accurate reconstruction of a wide range of taxonomically different items present in faecal samples collected in the field. = Birds = = Fish = = Arthropods =  See also  * Fish DNA barcoding * Aquatic macroinvertebrates DNA barcoding * Microbial DNA barcoding * Algae DNA barcoding * Pollen DNA barcoding  Reference  Bioinformatics ","title":"DNA barcoding in diet assessment"},{"id":"60579578","text":"Dathapuram is a census town located in R.S Kondapuram Mandal, Kadapa district, Andhra Pradesh, India.

Hertha Feiner worked at various Jewish schools in Berlin. In 1941, she was forced to work for the Jewish community. There she had to help with the administrative preparations for the deportations. On 12 March 1943 she was deported to Auschwitz. She took her own life on the way there. In 1992, the Hertha Feiner-A√ümus-Stieg in Winterhude was named after her. = Julia Cohn = (* 14 October 1888 Hamburg; deported to Riga on 6 December 1941, ‚Ä† between December 1941 and 1944 in the Riga-Kaiserwald concentration camp) She was a teacher at the Humboldtstra√üe school (Barmbek) and at the school for language and trade courses for emigrants in Beneckestra√üe. On 1 April 1930, she moved to the newly built Meerweinstra√üe school. On 29 July 1933, she was dismissed from her teaching duties on the basis of the \\"Law on the Restoration of the Civil Service\\", according to which \\"non-Aryans\\" were not allowed to be civil servants. Only after long efforts and the influential participation of her husband in the First World War did she receive pension payments from October 1933. Her husband, Jacob Cohn, who had given up his cigar import business in 1927, worked as an accountant. The Cohn couple had a son (Paul Cohn) and lived in Klosterallee (Harvestehude) to enable their son to attend school at Grindel. On 9 November 1938, Jacob Cohn was taken to the Sachsenhausen or Dachau concentration camp. After four months of intensive efforts on the part of the family and due to the front-line deployment during the First World War, Jacob Cohn was released from the concentration camp with the instruction to emigrate as quickly as possible. The Cohn family tried to find a way to emigrate. But they had no foreign relations, and an entry permit was only granted against the guarantee of a guarantor. On 30 May 1939 the family received the emigration permit. The child Paul travelled to England on 21 May 1939 with a child transport. The couple did not know how to finance their own departure. When shortly afterwards the Second World War broke out, it was hardly possible for Jews to leave Germany. At the beginning of December 1941, the Cohn couple were asked to come to the Moorweide on 6 December in order to be transported from there to the East. Mr. Cohn believed that it was for a work assignment because the Nazis had asked the Cohn couple to take a spade with them. In 1985, the Julia-Cohn-Weg in Alsterdorf was named after her.

Nurse plants are trees that serve as protection to smaller plants. Xeric environments can experience extreme high temperatures and extreme low temperatures. In these environments, nurse plants provide shaded microhabitats for the survival of several other plant species. In the Sonoran Desert, nurse plants canopies provide reduced summer daytime temperatures, soil surface temperatures, and direct sunlight, higher soil fertility, protection from the wind and browsing animals, reduced evapotranspiration rates in the nursed species, elevated nighttime temperatures, and post-fire resprouting in some species... Nurse plants can help with seedling recruitment and protect plants from granivory. A saguaro‚Äôs root system is restricted to 15 cm of soil surface and the Palo Verde‚Äôs (Cercidium microphyllum) roots go deeper under the surface. Studies suggest that a saguaro‚Äôs network of roots intercept moisture before it can reach a Palo Verde‚Äôs roots. Nurse plants also have better soil under their canopies than what is out in the open. ‚ÄúSoil properties under nurse plants were always better than outside them, which are in concordance with the generalized existence of fertility islands in high mountains\\" Palo Verde (Cercidium spp.), mesquite (Prosopis spp.), and ironwood (Olneya tesota) trees all provide positive interactions among other plants species like facilitating seedling survival and germination.. The richness and abundance of many plant species is greater under the canopies of these trees than in surrounding areas The density of plant species that depend on nurse plants depends on the number of nurse plants in a community. For example, the density of the senita cactus (Pachycereus schottii) was higher when there was a higher density of nurse plants.. But the study by Holland et al, found that ‚Äúthere was not a significant main factor effect of nurse plants on the germination and seedling recruitment of senita cacti.‚Äù The positive effects of nurse plants with this plant species depended on rainfall Examples =Olneya tesota= Joshua Tewksbury‚Äôs study discusses the different interactions between nurse plants and those under their canopy. It showed that the presence of ironwood trees (O. tesota) did not explain the significant variation of plant community structure. A nurse plant‚Äôs importance is not only as a temperature buffer, but also as a water buffer. In terms of water stress, there was a difference in the facilitative effects between mesic and xeric sites. In xeric sites, the richness and abundance of perennial plants was higher, whereas, ephemerals saw no difference. In mesic sites, the abundance of perennial and ephemeral plants was no different, but the ephemeral richness was lower. The size of the canopies of ironwood trees was no different between xeric and mesic sites. But the canopy size did affect perennial plants more than ephemeral plants. With the perennial plants, there was a positive effect. The richness, abundance, and size of the plants was greater under the canopies. With ephemeral plants the richness was unaffected, and the abundance increased in xeric sites. Ironwood tree canopies have provided facilitative effects on plant species richness and abundance in xeric sites in the Sonoran Desert. Two factors, water stress and benefactor size, had effects on facilitation and are factors to consider when looking at the richness, abundance, and size of the plants under nurse plant canopies in xeric and mesic habitats. The ironwood was often the only tree growing in xeric areas and their canopies had the largest effect on plant community structure and richness even when water stress was high. These trees contribute to habitat heterogeneity that can‚Äôt be found in other desert microhabitats. =Palo verde (Cercidium microphyllum) and saguaro (Carnegiea gigantea)= An example of a nurse plant would be the Palo Verde tree (C. microphyllum), found in the Sonoran Desert, that may have saguaro cacti underneath its canopy. Other examples of nurses are grasses and cacti. Trees and shrubs are the more common nurse plants. Nurse plants provide the ideal microclimatic environment for species like the saguaros. They allow them to extend their ranges ‚Äúin otherwise inhospitably cold areas\\".. Some of the benefits described above can limit saguaros during establishment, but subfreezing temperatures is one variable the cactus is susceptible to. These temperatures in the northern part of Arizona are why saguaros haven‚Äôt established there. Nurse plants also have better soil under their canopies than what is out in the open. ‚ÄúSoil properties under nurse plants were always better than outside them, which are in concordance with the generalized existence of fertility islands in high mountains\\" Saguaros are established on the south side of a nurse plant‚Äôs canopy more than the north side. According to Drezner and Garrity, the south side of canopies have higher minimum temperatures and the north sides have colder temperatures. Saguaros establish under denser canopies than plants with a more open canopy because of better microclimatic conditions. It might have been unexpected that the saguaro established on the south side because of higher minimal temperature. Saguaros can handle higher temperatures but are susceptible to subfreezing temperatures. With the temperatures on the south side of the nurse, the risk of experiencing subfreezing temperatures is reduced in the winter. Ambrosia deltoidea and Cercidium microphyllum were the two main nurse plants observed. The study found that maximum temperatures under C. microphyllum were lower and the minimum temperatures were higher, showing that nurse plants provide a microclimate under their canopy and protects the saguaros from extreme cold or hot temperatures. The death of a nurse plant generally precedes the plant species it‚Äôs protecting. There is evidence of competitive interactions between saguaro cacti and paloverde trees. The saguaros under a paloverde‚Äôs canopy declined the vigor of the tree. Trees that didn‚Äôt have saguaros (Carnegiea gigantea) under them didn‚Äôt die as fast. One factor of this competitive interaction is root competition. The saguaro‚Äôs roots exist in shallow soil, whereas, a paloverde‚Äôs roots go deeper. The saguaro‚Äôs roots are like an umbrella and capture most of the moisture before it can reach the paloverde‚Äôs roots. Invasibility and nurse plants Badano et al used two hypotheses to look at the invasibility by alien species with nurse plants in the area. They used the biotic resistance hypothesis where a new species that arrives is more likely to find strong competitors that impede their success as the number of native species increases and local diversity acts as a barrier for biological invasions, and the biotic acceptance hypothesis, which is described as the main force that regulates native and alien species‚Äô performance and diversity and increased availability of resources and habitat heterogeneity associated with increased surface area. Neither of these hypotheses considered the variations of harsh environments. This harshness could reduce competition in plant communities and the overall performance of plants. The nurse plant in this study was the field chickweed, Cerastium arvense L. For natural assemblages, there was a positive relationship between C. arvense and the abundance and diversity of plant assemblages growing within cushion plants, or cushions. Cushion plants are plants that grow a few inches in height, three meters in diameter, and form a compact mat of closely spaced stems. It was found from this study that invasive species grew under nurse plant canopies and that they were providing protection for those species. According to Badano et al, ‚ÄúThis study indicated that the performance of the invasive plant C. arvense was positively affected by increasing diversity of native species within the habitat patches created by the cushion plant A. madreporica, while these relationships were negative or absent in the surrounding open areas.‚Äù Nurse plants and ants These nurse plants also help the composition of ant communities. They provide protection and food to the different ant communities in the Sonoran Desert. Four ant species (Camponotus atriceps, Pheidole sciophila, and Pheidole titanis) ‚Äúwere associated with tree habitats, whereas Pheidole sp. A was associated with open areas\\". In the Sonoran Desert, ant species are greater than in the Mojave Desert, Chihuahuan Desert, or Chihuahuan desert grassland, and that is due to greater precipitation. When rainfall increases, so does the ant diversity.

He is the executive producer of the movie Argo, winner of the Best Picture Oscar at the 85th Academy Awards. Klawans has been described in the press as a ‚Äòstory detective‚Äô and is known for developing obscure true stories into movies. Early life and education Klawans was born in Chicago. He was raised in Europe after his family moved to Belgium. He later returned to America and graduated from NYU‚Äôs Tisch School of the Arts, where he was mentored by film producer David Brown (Jaws, A Few Good Men). He started his career as a production coordinator for an LA-based Japanese television commercial company, and developed movie ideas in his spare time. In an interview with the Los Angeles Times, Klawans recalled how he was unable to afford a car, and rode to movie studios on a bicycle to pitch films based on ‚Äúoddball, overlooked true- life stories.‚Äù Career In 2002, Klawans discovered a true story about a Mexican priest who moonlighted as a Lucha Libre wrestler to raise money for his church orphanage. He developed the idea into the 2006 Jack Black comedy Nacho Libre, a film that grossed $99,255,460 worldwide. In 2003, he produced the independent documentary Togbe, the true story of an unemployed white Dutchman who was believed to be the reincarnated king of the West African nation of Ghana. It aired on PBS and was screened at the United Nations. Klawans has developed more than 25 feature projects at major studios, almost all based on true stories. The most notable example is Argo, a declassified true story Klawans discovered while scouring the quarterly CIA journal ‚ÄòStudies in Intelligence‚Äô in 1998. He then spent several years developing the project, which eventually became the 2012 Ben Affleck-directed movie, which grossed $230 million at the box office. In 2015 he produced the TV pilot The Legend of Master Legend for Amazon Studios based on a real-life ‚Äòsuperhero.‚Äô He also developed the true story of the McDonald‚Äôs Monopoly promotion fraud, which created one of the biggest bidding wars in Hollywood history for a single magazine article, according to the Hollywood Reporter.

The bill has been strongly criticized and, notably, many celebrities in Hollywood threatened to boycott the state of Georgia if it were passed.  Overview  = Provisions = The Georgia HB481 is a fetal heartbeat bill; except in certain situations, physicians practicing medicine in the state of Georgia would be prohibited from offering abortion services to pregnant women if a fetal heartbeat is present, which typically occurs in the 6th week of pregnancy. Exceptions are provided for women whose pregnancies are considered futile (e.g. anencephaly) or medical emergency and women pregnant by rape or incest but only if they are less than 20 weeks pregnant and only if they have filed a police report. = Supporters = The bill was sponsored by Rep. Ed Setzler, Rep. Jodi Lott, Rep. Darlene Taylor, Rep. Josh Bonner, Rep. Ginny Ehrhart, Rep. Micah Gravley, and Sen. Renee Unterman, all members of the Republican Party. Proponents of the bill compare the rights of fetuses to those of slaves liberated under the Fourteenth Amendment and LGBT people. = Similar bills = South Carolina introduced a similar fetal heartbeat bill in 2019, H.3020, which passed the South Carolina House of Representatives in a 71 to 30 vote. The Post and Courier reported that despite passing, it was unlikely the bill would be signed into law. Mississippi (Senate Bill 2116) and Kentucky had passed similar measures in 2019, both of which are being subjected to legal backlash.  Response  Brian Kemp, the current governor of Georgia, has voiced support for the bill, calling it \\"common sense\\". Meanwhile, Georgia state senator Jen Jordan has opposed it, objecting to the wording of the legislation: a woman would have only 1 to 2 weeks to realize she had missed a menstrual period and schedule an abortion, in order to stay within the time frame allotted by the bill. Kemp signed the bill on May 7. = Hollywood boycott = More than fifty high profile individuals in the U.S. entertainment industry, ranging from actors to screenwriters to directors, issued an official statement threatening to boycott the state of Georgia if the bill is passed. Additionally, Writers Guild of America West and Writers Guild of America East issued a joint statement saying their members would also boycott the state. Such a boycott could have a devastating effect on Georgia's economy, as the state, especially the capital city of Atlanta, serves as the filming location for many high budget films and television shows, including The Walking Dead, Stranger Things, The Real Housewives of Atlanta, Love & Hip Hop: Atlanta, and Cobra Kai. In 2018, it was estimated that film and television productions contributed US$9.5 billion to Georgia's economy. Legal challenge The American Civil Liberties Union, Planned Parenthood and the Center for Reproductive Rights sued the state in June 2019 and sought an injunction against enforcement of the ban before it would go into effect in January 2020. The case was heard in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia under Judge Steve C. Jones. Jones ruled in favor of the injunction to block enforcement in his decision in October 2019, stating \\"By banning pre-viability abortions, H.B. 481 violates the constitutional right to privacy, which, in turn, inflicts per se irreparable harm on Plaintiffs.\\"  References  United States abortion law 2019 in Georgia (U.S. state) Georgia (U.S. state) law ","title":"Georgia House Bill 481"},{"id":"60580000","text":"Rosario Fern√°ndez Guerrero (born about 1880 ‚Äì died 1960s) was a Spanish dancer and pantomimist with an international career.

It is found in the northeastern Atlantic Ocean and parts of the Mediterranean Sea. It is an infaunal species, occupying a burrow in the seabed, from which its anterior and posterior ends project. Description Leptopentacta elongata is a slender, greyish-brown sea cucumber with a U-shaped, or sometimes S-shaped body, reaching a maximum length of about . It dwells in a burrow in the sediment, with the two extremities projecting. The dorsal surface is covered with darker brown or grey, conical projections. In small specimens, the ventral surface bears five longitudinal rows of tube feet, and in larger specimens, it bears five double rows. The cuticle is leathery, stiffened by numerous smooth ossicles, small irregular perforated plates which form part of the body wall. The mouth, at the anterior end, is surrounded by a ring of tentacles, eight being large and much-branched, with the two on the ventral side being short and forked. The anus is at the posterior end of the body. Distribution and habitat This sea cucumber is native to the northeastern Atlantic Ocean, the North Sea and the Mediterranean Sea. Its range extends from Norway to Morocco, and it occurs on sandy and muddy seabeds at depths down to about . Ecology Leptopentacta elongata is a suspension feeder, consuming diatoms, single-cell algae and organic particles, as well as zooplankton, such as copepods, ostracods, protozoans, nematodes, jellyfish and larvae. It uses its eight feeding tentacles to gather particles, each shrinking and bending, in an apparently random order, to transfer the food to the mouth. The two ventral tentacles are used in coordination with the other tentacles, being folded around the feeding tentacles so that the forks scrape off the food fragments when the larger tentacles are withdrawn from the mouth; in some other sea cucumbers with similar feeding habits, such as Pawsonia saxicola, the forked tentacles seem to act entirely independently and do not coordinate their actions with the larger tentacles. This sea cucumber can hibernate in the winter. In preparation for this, and perhaps in preparation for reproduction, it accumulates and stores lipid droplets in the enterocytes in the lining of the gut.

He was the best two-year-old colt in Japan in 2014 when he won his last three races including the Asahi Hai Futurity Stakes and was the unanimous choice for the JRA Award for Best Two-Year-Old Colt. In the following year he finished third in a strong edition of the Spring Stakes and defeated older opponent in the Fuji Stakes. He remained in training for another three years but made only seven appearances and won only one more race, the Listed New Year Stakes in 2018. He was retired from racing to become a breeding stallion in South Africa. Background Danon Platina is a grey stallion bred in Japan by Chiyoda Farm Shizunai. During his track career he carried the colours of Danox Co Ltd the business software enterprise of his owner Masahiro Noda, and was trained by Mitsumasa Nakauchida. He was ridden in most of his races by Masayoshi Ebina. He was from the fifth crop of foals sired by Deep Impact, who was the Japanese Horse of the Year in 2005 and 2006, winning races including the Tokyo Yushun, Tenno Sho, Arima Kinen and Japan Cup. Deep Impact's other progeny include Gentildonna, Harp Star, Kizuna, A Shin Hikari, Marialite and Saxon Warrior. Danon Platina's dam Badeelah, from whom he inherited his grey colour, was an unraced, Kentucky-bred mare who was deported to Japan after being sold as a two-year-old for $32,000. Badeelah's dam Magical Allure won the La Brea Stakes and was closely related to the Kikuka Sho winner Narita Top Road.

He accelerated past his rivals, overtook the front-running outsider Active Minoru 200 metres from the finish and held off the late challenge of Arma Waioli to win by three quarters of a length. Ebina commented \\"He was relaxed and had enough left in him by the last corner for a strong final run. He definitely takes after his sire Deep Impact, his finishing speed speaks for itself\\". In January 2015 Danon Platina was named Best Two-Year-Old Colt at the JRA Awards for 2014, being the unanimous choice of the 285 voters. =2015: three-year-old season= On 22 March Danon Platina began his second campaign at Nakayama Racecourse in the Spring Stakes (a major trial for the Satsuki Sho) over 1800 metres and finished third, beaten a neck and half a length by Kitasan Black and Real Steel. In the Satsuki Sho over 2000 metres at the same track on 19 April he never looked likely to win and came home eleventh of the fifteen runners behind Duramente.
