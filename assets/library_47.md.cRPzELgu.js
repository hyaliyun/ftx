Career Born Jytte Stensgaard, she moved to the United Kingdom to improve her English in 1963. She worked as an au pair, studied stenography and became a model for a time. Stensgaard began her acting career in the film La Ragazza con la pistola (The Girl with the Pistol, 1968). She then played parts in diverse UK TV-series: The Saint (1968; episode: \\"The Desperate Diplomat\\"); Broaden Your Mind (1969); Doctor in the House (1969/70) - in which she played the recurring role of Helga, Dave Briddock's girlfriend; On the Buses (1970; episode: \\"The New Uniforms\\", as Ingrid, a Swedish tourist); Special Branch (1970; episode: \\"Miss International\\" as Nina Sareth); sci-fi comedy series The Adventures of Don Quick (1970; as Flosshilda); Jason King (1971; as Arlene in the episode \\"As Easy as A.B.C.\\"); The Persuaders! (1971; playing Bibi, a Judo instructress who assists Danny Wilde (Tony Curtis) in the episode \\"The Morning After\\"); The Marty Feldman Comedy Machine (1972), and anthology series Dead of Night (1972; as Gertrude Wickett in the episode \\"Bedtime\\"). Her film parts include the Bulldog Drummond film Some Girls Do (1969) as Robot One; she played small parts in If It's Tuesday, This Must Be Belgium (1969), Scream and Scream Again (1970) and Doctor In Trouble (1970). She also appeared in the low-budget sci-fi sex comedy Zeta One (1969). Stensgaard's most famous role is that of the vampire Carmilla/Mircalla in Hammer's Lust for a Vampire (1971). The film was the sequel to The Vampire Lovers (1970), which had starred Ingrid Pitt as Mircalla. The original film was an adaptation of Carmilla by Joseph Sheridan Le Fanu. However, Lust for a Vampire shared little with the novel; it only used the vampire characters, and was thus a completely new story. In the film, the bisexual Carmilla infiltrates an all-girl boarding school while falling in love with a novelist. Stensgaard auditioned for the part of the Doctor Who companion (Jo Grant), alongside third Doctor Jon Pertwee in 1970. Towards the end of her career she appeared in pantomime and the stage-farce Boeing-Boeing (1971). She also appeared on TV as a hostess on the popular game show The Golden Shot hosted by Bob Monkhouse. Personal life Stensgaard has married twice: first to art director Tony Curtis; second to John Kerwin. She left acting in 1972, went to live in the U.S. and had a son. She became a Christian and for years worked at a radio station selling air-time and refusing to discuss her acting career. She was tracked down by a Danish horror fan, Nicolas Barbano, and eventually agreed to an interview (which appeared in Video Watchdog). Soon after, she was guest of honour at a horror convention. Stensgaard's image continues to grace the covers of numerous book and magazine publications; for instance, Marcus Hearn's book Hammer Glamour (2009), which contains a chapter on her.

It became famous on April 9, 1937, as the first Japanese-built aircraft to fly from Japan to Europe. The flight from Tokyo to London took 51 hours, 17 minutes and 23 seconds and was piloted by Masaaki Iinuma (1912‚Äì1941), with Kenji Tsukagoshi (1900‚Äì1943) serving as navigator. Background In the 1930s, as the performance of aircraft was rapidly improving, air races and the setting of long distance flight records was very popular in Europe and North America, and were often used as publicity stunts by newspapers. A French newspaper offered a substantial monetary prize for the first aircraft to fly between Paris and Tokyo within 100 hours. Many aviators had failed in the attempt, including Andr√© Japy, the French aviator whose plane crashed into the mountains of Ky≈´sh≈´ on the last leg of his record attempt from Paris to Tokyo. In the 1930s, Japanese aircraft designers had made maximizing the range of their aircraft a high priority, in order to link the Japanese home islands with the Empire of Japan's overseas possessions in Taiwan, Korea, Manchuria and the South Seas Mandate. Long range capabilities also had implications for the development of military aircraft for future conflicts in China and over the Pacific Ocean - potential war theatres which offered few airfields for aircraft to refuel. The European record flight of the Kamikaze-go was sponsored by the Asahi Shimbun newspaper to celebrate the coronation of Great Britain's King George VI, and also as a goodwill flight to European countries. The record flight The Kamikaze-go took off from Tachikawa Airfield in Tokyo at 2:12:04 pm on April 6, 1937, with much fanfare. The aircraft flew from Tokyo via Taipei to Hanoi and Vientiane in French Indochina, then via Calcutta and Karachi in British India and Basra and Baghdad in Iraq, and then Athens, Rome and Paris in Western Europe. The aircraft landed at London's Croydon airport to a cheering crowd of spectators at 3:30 pm on April 9. The total elapsed time since departure was 94 hours, 17 minutes and 56 seconds, with actual flight time for the whole distance of 15,357 km of was 51 hours, 19 minutes and 23 seconds (average speed: 162,8 km/h or 101 MPH). The flight was the first F√©d√©ration A√©ronautique Internationale aviation record to have been won by the Japanese. This flight to Europe made the pilot, Masaaki Iinuma (then 26 years old), a national hero, and he was acclaimed as the ‚ÄúJapanese Lindbergh‚Äù. Both the pilot and navigator Kenji Tsukagoshi were awarded the L√©gion d'honneur by the French government. On April 12, only a few days after the record-breaking flight, the Kamikaze-go carried Prince Chichibu and Princess Chichibu, who were visiting England for the coronation, on a joy ride. A month later, on May 12, it was used to film the coronation ceremonies from the air. The Kamikaze-go was then flown back to Japan, duplicating its original route in the opposite direction, departing London May 14 and arriving in Osaka on May 20, and Haneda airport in Tokyo on May 21. Kamikaze 's pilot, Masaaki Iinuma, later served as chief test pilot for the Kayaba Ka-1 autogyro from May 1941. He was later killed in action in the Pacific War in December 1941 near Phnom Penh, Cambodia. He was 29 years old. In 1943, Kamikaze 's former navigator, Tsukagoshi, set off from Singapore for Germany in the prototype Tachikawa Ki-77, but disappeared over the Indian Ocean. After its return to Japan, the Kamikaze-go continued to work actively in a variety of capacities for the Asahi Shimbun. However, on a flight back from the south of China it encountered bad weather and had to be ditched in southern Taiwan. It was later recovered and put on display at a \\"Kamikaze Memorial Center\\" on Ikoma, Nara Prefecture. The facilities were destroyed in World War II. To commemorate the 1937 flight of the aircraft, Asahi Shimbun produced sake bottles and cups which were made available with the image of this aircraft on it. Classical Music The flight of the Kamikaze and its triumphant journey gave rise to a piece of classical music in 1937: Hisato Ohzawa's Piano Concerto No. 3 Kamikaze. This piece of music has become better known in recent times with the release of a new CD recording by the Naxos company in 2005.

He got his breakthrough with Superliga club Viborg FF in the 1999-00 Superliga season, and was soon called up for the Danish under-21 national team. He played 108 league games for Viborg, and was called up for the Danish national team in August 2003. In February 2004, during the 2003‚Äì04 winter transfer window, he was bought by league rivals Br√∏ndby IF. Br√∏ndby manager Michael Laudrup bought Sennels to replace Aurelijus Skarbalius on the left back position. Sennels made his Br√∏ndby debut in the 2004 UEFA Cup matches with FC Barcelona. He was called up for his second and last national team game in April 2004. His first time playin in the Br√∏ndby was less than perfect, and it did not help him that he was replacing the fan favourite Skarbalius.

Laudrup bought Joseph Elanga to challenge Sennels for the left back position, and he played 19 of 33 matches in the following season. When Laudrup was replaced by Rene Meulensteen as Br√∏ndby manager, Sennels was sent further down the pecking order by on-loan left back Adam Eckersley. When Meulensteen left Br√∏ndby halfway through the 2006‚Äì07 Superliga season, Sennels was told by replacement manager Tom K√∏hlert that he had no future at the club.

The age of eruption is currently unknown. Due to centuries of cultivation, little native bush remains except on the north-eastern cliffs, leaving the volcanic landforms easily visible. It exhibits the landforms from three styles of eruption. The island consists of one main scoria cone with a deep crater, a small remnant arc of the tuff ring forming the cliffs in the northeast, and the upper portions of lava flows. The area was dry land when the eruptions occurred, but much of the lava is now submerged beneath the sea. Browns Island crater. Browns Island from the west. History =Maori occupation= The history of Motukorea prior to European arrival is not well documented, and while many of the sources available speculate as to the origins of NgƒÅti TamaterƒÅ mana whenua and their right to sell the island in 1840, few dispute it. Phillips makes mention of the Tainui canoe stopping at the island after leaving Wakatiwai on the Firth of Thames, before proceeding to Rangitoto where she met up with the Arawa canoe. In the intervening years, the general area came to be controlled by NgƒÅti Paoa and the lands to the west were controlled by NgƒÅti WhƒÅtua, but the island remained under the control of NgƒÅti TamaterƒÅ. Opinion is divided as to why this may be, Phillips postulates that mana may have been vested in return for assistance in battle,Phillips 1989:3 whereas Monin regards the occupation and sale of Motukorea as evidence of more widespread penetration of the inner Gulf by numerous Hauraki iwi and hapu.Monin 1996:42 Motukorea's location at the mouth of the Tamaki River was certainly important as it effectively controlled access up the river, and as a result the Otahuhu and nearby Karetu portage through to the Manukau Harbour. The archaeological remains suggest Motukorea was intensively occupied in pre- European times, with people engaged in stone working industry, marine exploitation, gardening of the fertile volcanic soils, and establishing open and defended settlements. Three pƒÅ sites have been identified by Simmons. ‚ÄòArchaic‚Äô type artifacts found on the island include worked moa bone, and one- piece fishhooks. Exotic stone resources including chert, basalt, argillite and obsidian from both local gulf island sources and as far afield as Coromandel Peninsula and Great Barrier Island.Frederickson 1991 The name Motukorea means \\"oystercatcher island\\". =Brown & Campbell= Starting from 1820, early European visitors included Richard Cruise, Samuel Marsden and John Butler, who both traded with Maori for produce. Dumont D‚ÄôUrville visited the island in 1827 and reported it abandoned, probably on account of the musket wars.Cruise 1824:200-204Elder 1932:312-313Wright 1950:156-7 Being already abandoned by NgƒÅti TamaterƒÅ and located a considerable distance from where they were based in Coromandel, Te Kanini of NgƒÅti TamaterƒÅ and the sub-chiefs Katikati and Ngatai were willing to sell Motukorea when William Brown and Logan Campbell indicated a desire to buy the island on 22 May 1840. Brown and Campbell settled on the western side of the island from 13 August 1840, making it one of the earliest European settlements in the Auckland area.Campbell 1881:229-253 They built a raupo whare and ran pigs on the island, using it as a base from which they aspired to establish and supply the town of Auckland as soon as land was available on the isthmus.Campbell 1881:239ff Not long after Brown and Campbell had taken up residence on the island, NgƒÅti WhƒÅtua chief ƒÄpihai Te Kawau gifted it to Captain Hobson in order to entice him to select Auckland as the new capital for the colony.Campbell 1881:300ff A flagpole was to be erected on the summit and the island claimed for the Crown, but upon hearing what was transpiring, Brown and Campbell returned to their island and protested their right to occupy the island. The idea was abandoned, but Governor Hobson refused the application for a Crown grant made by Brown in August 1840. The official reason for the refusal was that Brown and Campbell's purchase was made after Sir George Gipps' 1840 proclamation forbidding direct land purchases from the Maori. It was not until Robert FitzRoy assumed the role of governor in 1843 that Brown and Campbell's fortunes changed. The grant was officially made on 22 October 1844.Monin 1996:42-3Deeds CT 364/284 Campbell left the island in December 1840 to set up a trading business in the newly established settlement of Auckland,Campbell 1881:330Stone 1982:88 while Brown remained on the island until February the following year to manage the pig farm, and likely to watch over their vested interest in the island. In 1856 both men left the colony for Great Britain, appointing a resident manager in charge of their affairs. Campbell eventually bought out Brown's share in their business, including Motukorea, in May 1873 for ¬£40,000 when Brown refused to return from Britain to resume control of their affairs. This transaction was carried out via William Baker who appears to have acted as an intermediary, receiving Brown's share for two days while the transaction was being carried out. In 1877 Campbell proposed to transplant olive trees to Motukorea and 5000 seedlings were grown in a nursery on One Tree Hill for this purpose, but were never transplanted.Stone 1987:117 Campbell eventually sold the island to the Featherstone family in 1879, who built a larger house on the north-eastern side of the island which burnt down in 1915.Rickard 1985:11 The derelict house was still on the island until the 1960s. Abandoned paddle steamers and picnickers at Brown's Island in a 1908 postcard. =Devonport Steam Ferry Company= In 1906 the island was sold to the Alison family who operated the Devonport Steam Ferry Company, and during their ownership the hulks of 4 coal powered low draught paddle steamers were abandoned on the low western end of the island.Maffey 1972Auckland.R Wolfe.p234. Random House.2002. Auckland. Browns Island is also significant in aviation history, with the Barnard brothers of Auckland carrying out what may have been New Zealand's first glider flights from the upper slopes of the cone in June 1909.Brassey 1996:3 In the 1920s the Devonport Steam Ferry Company regularly brought picnickers to the island landing them on a substantial wooden wharf about 120 ft long on the north side of the island.Auckland. p234. A 1922 survey plan shows a cottage in on the north western flat presumably built to replace the one that was lost in 1915. =Public ownership= The Auckland Metropolitan Drainage Board purchased the island in 1946 proposing to build a sewage treatment plant. Controversy surrounding the proposal forced the plan to be abandoned and the island was eventually purchased by Sir Ernest Davis, who presented it as a gift to the people of Auckland in July 1955.Bush 1980 Ernest Davis had been the chairperson of the Devonport Steam Ferry Company for 20 years which may further explain some of his affinity with Browns Island. The Auckland City Council administered the island until 1968 when it became part of the Hauraki Gulf Maritime Park.NZ Gazette 20/6/1968 No.38 p.1035 Management control was vested in the Department of Lands and Survey and in 1987 this was transferred to the Department of Conservation. After the demise of the Hauraki Gulf Maritime Park Board in July 1990, the Auckland City Council was again the designated administering body, and passed back the responsibility for management to the Department of Conservation. In November 2018 a woman became stranded on the island. She was rescued after a fire she lit to attract attention started burning out of control. Another view from the north. Features Browns Island is part of the Hauraki Gulf Maritime Park. There are three pa sites on the island, with the largest occupying the slopes of the main scoria cone. The island's highest point is above sea level. The mineral motukoreaite was discovered in 1977 on the island and named for it. Access The island is not served by ferries, so private boats and seaplanes are the only means of access. There is no wharf or easy access to the island for larger vessels. For small craft the best landing is on the more sheltered northern side of the island where there is a long beach, backed by a steep cliff. Navigation is difficult as there is a long rock reef parallel to the beach. The reef is marked by a beacon. Inside the reef there are small isolated rocks but there is sufficient water between them for a small (up to ) craft to move. A crew member should be placed in the bow to give instructions to the skipper. Access to the rest of the island is via a steep, unformed path up the small headland at the north end of the beach. The path is only suited to fit, agile walkers. The flatter areas to the west have very large part submerged mussel beds which extend out from the shore preventing easy landing. The closest mainland boat ramps are at Bucklands Beach or Half Moon Bay Marina.

Cromer Ridge seems to have been the front line of the ice sheet for some time at the last glaciation, which is shown by the large size of the feature. All the material that was dredged up from the North Sea was poured out of the glaciers to form a ridge. Located on the North Norfolk coast, Cromer Ridge is among the highest land of East Anglia reaching 335 feet (102 m), and is 8.7 miles (14 km) long. It is characterised by its irregular, undulating, intimate and well-wooded topography and by substantial areas of heather in the west. Small, enclosed arable fields, hedgebanks, sunken lanes and sparse settlement are also characteristic features of the ridge. The crumbling cliffs at the coast are of glacial sands and gravels with some chalk exposures. Cromer Ridge was formed during the Anglian glaciation around 450,000 years ago.

The typical merchant sells a wide variety of household and personal products, with many emphasizing jewelry. Unlike a self-serve retail store, most of the items are not displayed; customers select the products from printed catalogs in the store and fill out an order form. The order is brought to the sales counter, where a clerk retrieves the items from the warehouse area to a payment and checkout station.  Purpose  The catalog merchant has generally lower prices than other retailers and lower overhead expenses due to the smaller size of store and lack of large showroom space. There are a few key benefits to this approach. By operating as an in-store catalog sales center, it could be exempt from the \\"Resale price maintenance\\" policy of the manufacturers, which can force conventional retailers to charge a minimum sales price to prevent price-cutting competition; it also reduces the risk of merchandise theft, known in the industry as shrinkage. From the consumer's point of view, there are potential advantages and disadvantages. The catalog showroom approach allows customers to shop without having to carry their purchases throughout the store as they shop. Possible downsides include that customers may be required to give their contact information when an order is placed, take the time to fill out order forms, and wait a period of time for their order to be available for purchase. This wait may be days long, one of the chief vulnerabilities of the catalog showroom approach.  Countries  =Canada= Consumers Distributing operated over 400 stores in Canada and the United States, and closed in 1996. Competitors in the Montreal area included Cardinal Distributors (launched by Steinberg but sold to Consumers Distributing in 1979) and Unique (folded in the 1970s). Shop-Rite, which operated 65 stores in Ontario, closed its doors in 1982. Sears Canada Inc still issues over 15 printed catalogues every year. Included in these (15) printed catalogues are three (3) large catalogues - the Spring and Summer Catalogue, the Fall and Winter General Catalogue, and the popular Christmas WishBook catalogue. In fall 2012, Sears Canada catalogue issued its 60th anniversary WishBook edition. = United Kingdom = Argos in Huddersfield, West Yorkshire, Argos is the largest catalogue retailer in the United Kingdom. In the United Kingdom, the sole national general goods catalogue merchant left in the high street market is Argos. Former catalogue retailers include Littlewoods, which owned the 'Index' brand as a high street competitor to Argos and Kays, which unlike Argos and Littlewoods/Index had no shops and sold only by postal orders. Littlewoods, Kays and existing Grattan built their businesses around offering credit, however in the 21st century most High Street shops now offer store cards (a means of credit specific to the retailer) meaning these catalogues have lost some of their market niche. Littlewoods also ran a smaller catalogue that did not offer credit called Index. Unlike goods from the Littlewoods Catalogue, which were purchased via postal order, Index goods could be purchased at Index branches and some branches of the Littlewoods department stores. Unlike Littlewoods, Kays and Grattan, who focused mainly on Clothing, Argos (and formerly Index) focus primarily on furniture, electronics and white goods. In 2001, Argos started a clothing catalogue called Argos Additions, however they sold the brand to Shop Direct Group in 2004. = United States = Catalog merchants in the United States have declined since 1980, in favor of chain discounters, big box stores, and internet shopping. Prominent among catalog merchants during the 19th and 20th centuries were Belknap Hardware and Manufacturing Company and Sears, Roebuck & Company. The repeal of the resale price maintenance sanctioning law in 1980 meant that chain discounters such as Wal-Mart, KMart could set and change prices at will, in a more consumer-friendly environment where the customer can examine the goods and confirm availability before approaching sales staff. As a result, this retail sector went into decline in the 1980s. As big box stores and internet shopping became increasingly popular in the 1990s, the decline of the catalog merchant business accelerated. Many companies in recent years have moved away from relying solely on catalog sales, augmenting them with on-line sales or direct retail. The move toward on-line sales includes long-established department store chains such as Sears and JCPenney that relied heavily on catalog sales. However, many long- established catalog merchants have gone out of business in recent years including Best Products, Brendle's, Ellman's, Jafco, KeyMid, Montgomery Ward, Rink's, Aldens, H. J. Wilson Co., Service Merchandise, Sterling Jewelry & Distributing Company and Consumers Distributing. The Houston Jewelry & Distributing Company division of Sterling Jewelry & Distributing Company was successfully reconfigured as a full service fine jewelry and gift store in 1993 and has been in operation ever since. Houston Jewelry remains the only former catalog showroom to successfully return to a traditional jewelry format.

Introduction Iqbal's first book of poetry in Urdu, Bang-i-Dara (1924), was followed by Bal-i-Jibril in 1935 and Zarb-i-Kalim in 1936. Bal-i-Jibril is the peak of Iqbal's Urdu poetry. It consists of ghazals, poems, quatrains, epigrams and displays the vision and intellect necessary to foster sincerity and firm belief in the heart of the ummah and turn its members into true believers. Some of the verses had been written when Iqbal visited Britain, Italy, Egypt, Palestine, France, Spain and Afghanistan, including one of Iqbal's best known poems The Mosque of Cordoba. The work contains 15 ghazals addressed to God and 61 ghazals and 22 quatrains dealing the ego, faith, love, knowledge, the intellect and freedom. The poet recalls the past glory of Muslims as he deals with contemporary political problems.

This feature film was the debut production of Miguel Coyula and was the result of a two-year effort on a tiny budget of $2,000. Shot entirely using a portable digital camcorder and edited on a home computer, Red Cockroaches is an example of DIY cinema. In its review, Variety called it a \\"A triumph of technology in the hands of a visionary with know-how...\\" It is the first of a planned trilogy which continues with Corazon Azul (Blue Heart).  Plot  A young man meets a mysterious girl in the subway and gets romantically involved with her, only to later discover that she might be his long lost sister. Dark and atmospheric, the world the characters inhabit is an alternative New York City with bouts of Acid Rain and ruled by an omnipotent cloning company called DNA21. Cryptic in nature and merging several genres, mainly sci-fi and drama with sporadic dark humor and surrealist touches, Red Cockroaches‚Äô morally ambiguous incest story has gathered as many fans as detractors making it a modern underground cult movie. Visuals Based on carefully planned storyboards, every time there is a cut in the film, it is to a new camera setup that hasn't been used before as opposed to traditional film language where the editor cuts back to a same shot during a scene. In the case of Red Cockroaches the influence of comic book storytelling is obvious. Some reviewers have pointed that scene transitions and edits mimic the effect of a pop-up book. Rather than attempting to make DV look like film, the colors were digitally manipulated to the extreme with the purpose of enhancing the atmosphere. This along with multiple layer composites generated the movie‚Äôs distinctive, often saturated look.

He sings and plays keyboards as a solo artist and with The Hanslick Rebellion, Collider, and Skyscape.  Music career  = Skyscape and early solo work = As a high-school senior, keyboardist Davis formed the band Skyscape with singer Domenic Maltempi in 1991. Skyscape recorded a CD, Band Of The Week, two years later. After moving to the Albany area to attend the State University of New York at Albany, Davis performed in a solo capacity, self-releasing a demo tape titled Jed Has Too Much Free Time. The demo's 33 songs were recorded on a 4-track cassette recorder by Davis and guitarist Alex Dubovoy in one weekend marathon. Skyscape is still active, releasing the full-length albums Zetacarnosa in 2009 and Dr. Des Moines in 2016. = The Hanslick Rebellion = Davis formed a new band, The Hanslick Rebellion, in 1995 with Dubovoy and bassist Mike Keaney. Known for a live show matched in intensity only by the group's backstage in-fighting, the Rebellion self-released the live cassette the rebellion is here in 1996. The volatile band imploded and ended in early 1997, reuniting for a tenth anniversary performance at New York's CBGB on September 22, 2005. Davis resumed full-time duty with The Hanslick Rebellion following their 2005 reunion; to date they have released a remastered version of the rebellion is here on CD, a digital EP entitled The Deli Of Life, which spawned a successful online video for the song \\"You Are Boring The Shit Out Of Me\\", and a second digital EP, Let's Get To The Fucking, which explores a fusion of rock and reggaeton. In March 2017, The Hanslick Rebellion released a politically-charged single, \\"Who'll Apologize For This Disaster Of A Life\\", accompanied by an animated video created by Davis. = J-Bird Records = After graduation from UAlbany, Davis moved to Woodhaven, Queens, and began composing in earnest across the musical spectrum, releasing two solo albums, We're All Going to Jail! (1997) and Jed Davis Wastes 8 Years of His Life for Your Listening Pleasure (1999) on Connecticut-based independent label J-Bird Records. In 2001, J-Bird Records honored Davis with Everybody Wants to be Like Jed, a tribute album which featured cover art by Peter Bagge and performances of signature Davis tunes by an eclectic host of indie artists including Brian Dewan, Daniel Johnston, Anal Cunt, Wesley Willis, King Missile and members of Agnostic Front. = Collider and electroclash = As programmer for the electronica/punk fusion band Collider (formed 1997), Davis was a pioneer of New York City's electroclash movement. Collider's debut album, 1998's Blowing Shit Up, was a mash-up of samples, dance grooves, synthesizers, and rock guitars applied to traditional pop forms and themes. The band's second album, Physics (1999), while still performed entirely on electronic instruments (including the Roland VG-8 guitar modeling system), was a step in a more traditional pop/rock direction, with samples of acoustic instruments employed throughout. = Rise And Shine = Between 2000 and 2005, Davis composed the music and lyrics for a stage musical, Rise and Shine, with librettist Arturo Vega. An attempt to record the musical in album form was aborted after several years of work, despite a voice cast which included Dicky Barrett, C.J. Ramone, Matthew Koma, Brian Dewan and Jessy Moss. Following Vega's death in 2013, Davis resumed work on the recording in tribute to his friend, adding Heather Maloney, Miss Guy, and Shea Diamond to the cast. = WCYF and \\"The Bowery Electric\\" = Moving to lower Manhattan influenced Davis's transition from electroclash toward a rawer punk sound, and to that end he began collaborating with some of New York's original punk rockers. Collider's final release, WCYF (2003), was produced by Ramones drummer/producer Tommy Ramone. In addition, Davis's tribute song to Joey Ramone, \\"The Bowery Electric\\", brought Tommy, Marky and C.J. Ramone, as well as Ramones producer Daniel Rey, together for a historic recording session. \\"The Bowery Electric\\" was released as a single on Spanish label No Tomorrow (2002), and later on the Ramones compilation album The Family Tree (2008). = Post-Collider solo projects = After Collider disbanded in 2004, Davis released a single, \\"With Love From America\\", under the band name The Congregation Of Vapors. In July 2008, Davis recorded 14 songs for a solo album at Chicago's Electrical Audio with engineer Steve Albini. As is customary for Albini recordings, the entire album was captured live to tape as performed by Davis and drummer Joe Abbatantuono. This recording was released on 8-track tape in July, 2011, under the title Shoot The Piano Player. Davis is enamored of archaic media formats. He released the single \\"Yuppie Exodus From Dumbo\\" on cylinder record in June 2010. The limited edition of 50 copies was signed and numbered by Davis and Michael Doret, who designed the packaging. A number of Davis' finished but unreleased recordings from the Collider era, executive- produced by Dave Fridmann and mixed by Tony Doogan, were compiled and released in 2010 as The Cutting Room Floor. Psychedelic artist Victor Moscoso provided vibrating color cover art. In July, 2012, Davis released the full-length album Small Sacrifices Must Be Made! on Eschatone Records. Davis' band for the album consists of guitarist Reeves Gabrels, drummer Anton Fig and bassist Graham Maby. Davis and several of his longtime collaborators unveiled the collective The Congregation Of Vapors in April 2016, making a significant catalogue of their music available by subscription through a website, tcov.net, with new material added regularly. The back catalogue includes Davis solo material, plus music by Skyscape, The Hanslick Rebellion, Sevendys, Space Toilets, and Jeebus. = Jeebus = Davis began working with a new band, Jeebus, in 2009. Jeebus includes members of both Collider and the Hanslick Rebellion, plus Reeves Gabrels. The band toured through the American South and Midwest in the summer of 2009, and recorded a 10-song album, Jesus Christ's Supercar, which has yet to be released. = Session work = As a session keyboardist, Davis has performed and recorded with musical acts of all genres, including Jessica Simpson, Hand Habits, The Deuce Project, and Matthew Koma's Bandcamp.  Eschatone Records  Davis is co-founder of the independent folk-punk record label Eschatone Records, which is home to Brian Dewan, Michael Bassett, The Visitors and wax.on wax.off, and has also released material by Hand Habits, Jobriath, Peg, The Valley Arena, and some of Davis' projects. In his role at Eschatone, Davis signed Daddy Long Legs (musician Brian Hurd, who debuted with The Visitors on Eschatone in 2007) and Hand Habits to their first record contracts, and oversaw the compilation of previously-unreleased Jobriath material into the full-length album As The River Flows (2014).

The school opened in 1975, and is named after the former CFBISD superintendent Newman Smith. Smith High School serves sections of Carrollton and Dallas. In 2015, the school was rated \\"Met Standard\\" by the Texas Education Agency. History In the 1970s, enrollment at R.L. Turner High School had passed 3,000 students, so a site near Josey Lane and Jackson Road was acquired for a second campus. The new facility opened in the fall of 1975, housing eighth and ninth grade students living north of Belt Line Road. During the second year, the school housed ninth and tenth grade students. The third year the school housed eighth through eleventh grade. And the fourth year, the school housed eighth through twelfth grade students. The first graduating class was 1979, with students attending four years, and the class of 1980 had attended five years. In 1981 the eighth grade classes were moved to the newly completed North Carrollton Junior High School (now Dan F. Long Middle School) and an auditorium and second cafeteria were added. Newman Smith's student population grew rapidly in the 1980s and 1990s as new housing developments were built in north area of Carrollton. To relieve the overcrowding, Smith's boundaries were adjusted in 1988, moving approximately five-hundred students who lived south of Jackson and Keller Springs roads back to R.L. Turner, which had excess capacity at the time. By the mid-1990s enrollment at Newman Smith was nearing 3,000 students and construction began on Creekview High School, the district's third. It was opened in the fall of 1998 and Smith's southern attendance boundary was moved back to Belt Line Road. The northern boundary was set along the newly opened President George Bush Turnpike. Today, Newman Smith High School serves all students from Ted Polk Middle School, as well as some students from DeWitt Perry and Dan F. Long Middle Schools. Newman Smith also admits any students within the district if they would like to join the International Business Academy. Achievements In 1998, Newman Smith High School was selected as a United States Department of Education New American High School and Blue Ribbon School of Excellence. The school received a Special Award For Art Education from the National Endowment For The Arts in 1998. In 2002‚Äì03, NSHS was selected to become a member of the Texas Pathfinder Collaborative (Texas Mentor School Program). In 2003, the Trojans received a three-star rating for academic excellence from Texas Monthly magazine. Newman Smith High School was selected as one of \\"America's Best High Schools\\" by The Washington Post and Newsweek magazine in 2003‚Äì04, 2004‚Äì05, and 2005‚Äì06. Newman Smith High was ranked No. 549 out of the top 1,000 US schools in 2005‚Äì2006.

The 2000 Trojan Band was a state alternate in 5A competition. In 2009, the band won 1st in the 4A UIL Area B competition to qualify for State, then made finals at State with a record 3rd-place finish in prelims. They were named the 6th best 4A band in Texas after the final round, the only top ten finish for the Trojan Band to date. In 2011 the band was named the 14th best 4A band in the state after finishing 4th in Area B. In 2013, the band finished 2nd at Area B in an upset finish to qualify for UIL State, and only missed finals by one place, becoming the 11th best 4A band in Texas. Sports Newman Smith switched from class 5A to 4A in 2008 due to a school population decrease. In 2013, the classification system was changed and Smith became class 5A again.

From the late 1970s he was a nightclub host and promoter. He became famous as the leader of the New Wave Synth-pop group Visage, best known for their single \\"Fade to Grey\\", and was one of the most influential figures behind the New Romantic movement of the early 1980s. Early life Harrington was born in Newbridge, Caerphilly, Wales. His grandfather moved with his family to Aldershot, Hampshire, where his father was serving in the British Army as a paratrooper. The family moved back to Wales and lived in Rhyl, Denbighshire, on the north coast, where his parents bought a large guest house and opened sea front cafes. They then divorced and he moved back to Newbridge in South Wales with his mother, where he attended Newbridge Grammar School. It merged with a secondary school to form Newbridge Comprehensive School a year after he arrived there and he subsequently lost interest in all subjects but art. Career =Punk era= After attending a Sex Pistols concert at the Castle Cinema in Caerphilly in 1976, Harrington befriended the bass player Glen Matlock. He then arranged gigs for punk bands in his home town and befriended Jean-Jacques Burnel of The Stranglers before leaving for London where he worked for Malcolm McLaren and formed a punk band called The Moors Murderers with Soo Catwoman. Additional members included future Pretenders frontwoman Chrissie Hynde, future Clash drummer Topper Headon, future Psychedelic Furs drummer Vince Ely and The Kid (who was formerly in Adam and the Ants, as Mark Ryan). They recorded a song called \\"Free Hindley\\". After several gigs, the band split up around early 1978. Later in 1978, Harrington briefly joined the punk/new wave band The Photons (originally from Liverpool) as vocalist and co-songwriter at the behest of David Littler (ex The Spitfire Boys). The band were managed by punk impresario Andy Czezowski. =Visage= Shortly after leaving the Photons, and using the alias Steve Strange, Harrington joined Visage, with Rusty Egan and Midge Ure from Rich Kids, Billy Currie from Ultravox, and Barry Adamson, John McGeoch and Dave Formula from Magazine. Intended as a studio-based side project, they signed to the small label Radar Records and released their first single \\"Tar\\" in 1979. The single was not a success, but the following year, Strange appeared in the video for David Bowie's no.1 hit \\"Ashes to Ashes\\", a song which helped to propel the burgeoning New Romantic fashion movement into the mainstream (Bowie was associated with it as it had borrowed clothes and looks from him.) Later that year, Visage signed a new record deal with the major label Polydor and released their second single, \\"Fade to Grey\\". The single became a top 10 hit in the UK and several other European countries, reaching number one in Germany and Switzerland. As the public face of the band, Strange shot to stardom in Britain and other parts of Europe. Visage enjoyed a string of hit singles and two hit albums before later commercial disappointments led to their break-up in 1985. After the dissolution of Visage, Strange formed the short-lived band Strange Cruise with Wendy Wu (formerly of The Photos). The group signed with EMI Records and released two singles and an album in 1986, though failed to gain any chart success. =Club host= In 1978, before their success with Visage, Strange and Visage partner Rusty Egan began to make a name for themselves as a nightclub host and DJ respectively. They began organising \\"Bowie nights\\" on Tuesdays at Billy's club in Soho, before taking over Tuesdays at the Blitz wine bar in London's Covent Garden in 1979. Adhering to Strange's strict door policy of admitting only \\"the weird and wonderful\\", the club took off and became an essential location in the rise of what would become the New Romantic movement. Strange's door policy was so strict that he famously once refused admittance to Mick Jagger, though Strange would later claim this was because the club was filled to capacity on the night in question and they had already been warned about breaching fire regulations. Following the Blitz, Strange and Egan then fronted the \\"Club for Heroes\\" in London's Baker Street on Tuesdays and Thursdays in 1981, before moving to the Camden Palace nightclub in 1982 for two years, which became one of the most famous venues of the era, attracting major celebrities on a regular basis. Their next club venture, \\"The Playground\\" in 1984, was less successful. Later in the 1980s, Strange went to Ibiza, Spain, and became an integral part of the budding trance club movement and hosting parties for celebrities such as Sylvester Stallone. In the early 1990s he was the host at the \\"Double Bass\\" club in Ibiza. Tallulah's Circus Circus club, London, in 1983 (Tallulah (left) Steve Strange (right) =Visage Mk II= In 2002, Strange took part in the Here and Now Tour, which featured a revival of various 80s pop acts. In 2004, he then formed a new version of Visage, dubbed Visage Mk II, with various musicians from modern electronic bands. None of the other original members were involved in the project. With a plan to re-record some of the older, classic Visage tracks as well as produce some new material, the project never seemed to fully get off the ground despite some television appearances. The first Visage Mk II song was called \\"Diary of A Madman\\", which was made available for download in 2007 in return for a donation to the Children In Need appeal. However, after this, no further material from this version of the band surfaced. In 2006, Strange collaborated with electronic music duo Punx Soundcheck for their album When Machines Rules The World, co- writing and performing on the track \\"In The Dark\\". =The Detroit Starrzz and Visage (Mk III)= In February 2012, Strange was a guest on the ITV chat show Loose Women. He said he was still working on a new Visage album and that nine tracks had been completed.Loose Women (2 February 2012). ITV Studios. Dir: Jo Johns. Prod: Natasha Neeson. (2012) In early 2013, Strange announced another new version of Visage featuring himself and former member Steve Barnacle, along with former Ultravox guitarist Robin Simon and vocalist Lauren Duvall. A new album, Hearts and Knives, was released in May 2013 (the first new Visage album in 29 years). In support of the album, the band made several live appearances in the UK and Europe in 2013. Parallel to recording new Visage material, Strange was also involved in another music project, the Detroit Starrzz. The group, which consisted of Strange and various DJ/remixers, released their first single, \\"Halo\\", in 2011. While appearing on the chat show Loose Women in February 2012, Strange stated he had recorded a full album with the group, with another single, \\"Aiming For Gold\\", to be released later in 2012. The group played at the Citrus Club in Edinburgh on 3 February 2012. Later years Strange was portrayed in Boy George's 2002 stage musical Taboo which reflected on the London club scene of the mid-1980s. During the mid-1990s, Strange promoted nights at the Emporium nightclub in Soho, London. In 2005 Strange appeared in a Channel 4 documentary called Whatever Happened to the Gender Benders?, which reflected on the advent of the New Romantic movement of the early 1980s and the prominent roles that Strange, Boy George and Marilyn each played within it. In November 2006 Strange took part in, and went on to win, the BBC reality series for Children in Need Celebrity Scissorhands. He returned to the show in 2007 and 2008 as Assistant Manager/Image Consultant. In that role, he was in charge of the catwalk, showing all of the best haircuts of the series and also people dressed in 80s style clothing and make-up. In 2008 Strange (and Visage II keyboardist Sandrine Gouriou) made an appearance in the BBC drama series Ashes to Ashes which is set in 1981. In it, they performed the song \\"Fade to Grey\\" in a scene set in the \\"Blitz\\" nightclub. In 2009, Strange and Rusty Egan appeared in Living TV's Pop Goes the Band, a series in which pop stars from the 1980s are given a complete makeover in return for a one-off performance. The Visage episode aired on 16 March 2009, and was the first time that the two men had spoken in over 20 years. The episode focused (like others in the series) more on getting them fit in the gym than on the current state of their relationship, though they appeared to get on well enough. At the culmination of the episode, they performed \\"Fade to Grey\\". In 2010 Strange was portrayed by actor Marc Warren in the BBC programme Worried About the Boy, a dramatisation of Boy George's rise to fame. Although the programme was set in the early 1980s, when Strange was in his early 20s, Warren was 43 at the time of production. In January 2011 Strange and Rusty Egan reopened the \\"Blitz\\" Club for one night, with performances from Roman Kemp's band Paradise Point and electro punk artist Quilla Constance plus DJ sets from Egan himself. In January 2013 Strange appeared on the Channel 4 News discussing the forthcoming release of David Bowie's album The Next Day. In his final years he lived with his family in the South Wales seaside town of Porthcawl. Personal life He revealed he was bisexual as he had relationships with both men and women. For many years, Strange was addicted to heroin. In later years he suffered a nervous breakdown, and in November 1999 he was arrested for shoplifting‚Äîhe was caught stealing a Teletubbies doll for his nephew. In court, he was found guilty and given a three-month suspended sentence. The British media publicised the case of a pop star who had fallen on hard times. In 2002, Strange published his autobiography, Blitzed!, in which he spoke openly about his career, his heroin addiction, his nervous breakdown, his sexuality and his attempts to get his life back together. Death On 12 February 2015 Strange suffered a heart attack, at the age of 55, whilst in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt; he died later that day in hospital. Spandau Ballet (who also started their musical career in the Blitz Club founded by Strange) dedicated their performance at the Sanremo Music Festival later that night to Strange. The family held a high-profile funeral in Porthcawl which was attended by many prominent figures from the entertainment industry. His coffin was carried by Boy George and Spandau Ballet brothers Martin and Gary Kemp; the funeral concluded with a burial at Jubilee Gardens Cemetery. A heart-shaped gravestone, which the Steve Strange Collective paid for, was unveiled in December 2015.

It is played in a group of 6 to 40 players who are equally divided into two teams. The teams separate on opposite sides of an area such a gymnasium, parking lot, or field. The game is unstructured in terms of what constitutes or if there will be outs and the length of play nor time-outs. There are many rules and the game is structured most similarly to Ultimate Frisbee. One notable exception is that any shot on goal results in the ball going out of bounds which results in an automatic change of possession. This rule should mitigate wild shots hoping for statistical points. Flickerball was first played at Davidson College in 1951, when it evolved as an alternative to touch football. The name \\"flickerball\\" was developed in the mid-1950s and the game is still a traditional game at Davidson College. A newer form of Flickerball commonly called Thunderdome originated in Berwyn, Illinois, at Morton West High School. This Delachian style of Flickerball (named for its creator Jim Delach) incorporates many of the same structures of the original game but alters the rules for play. Many US summer camps (including Camp Waupaca) adapted the game using a dodge ball. The basic setup is as follows: Each team's board (which has a large hole in the middle that look much like a backboard with the box cut out and around six feet off the ground) is positioned at opposite ends of the field. A boundary line is then placed in play approximately 12 ft. from the board and lies parallel to the board. Rules are that all players can hold the ball for only five seconds and can take a maximum of three steps forward (players may go in any other direction any number of steps within 5 seconds) and can either pass or shoot to end the possession. The field length is not standard but the width is usually 1/3 to 1/2 the size of the length and length is about 50 yards for standard size teams. The game begins with players split on each side as is the custom. Players meet at midfield where a jump ball begins the game. Whenever the ball hits the ground the team to touch it last loses possession. The team that gains control must first make a pass laterally or backward (unless the ball went into their Defensive endzone in which case the ball is played as if off a score). Fouls may be called by a referee or by player agreement if a referee is not present. A foul shot is only given if the player is shooting and if the player misses the attempted shot. shots with fouls that result in a score off the initial shot are not called. A made shot is worth one point if it hits the board and two if it goes through the middle. A missed shot is automatically out of bounds and the other team is given possession unless the shot was tipped by the other team. Normal game times will run about 40 minutes and may or may not have a break at the 20 minute mark. An alternate version of the game, which is commonly played in Wisconsin, follows a different set of rules. After a coin toss and sides are chosen the defending team must send the ball, a throw off of sorts, down to the opposite end of the playing field in which the other team receives. The ball is then passed between team mates with an allotted 3 steps. If the ball crosses into the end zone the offensive team receives one point and the defending team must walk down to the other side. The ball is then thrown off again and again until the game is over. If the ball is dropped at any point in the game, the defending team gains possession. A typical game lasts 30 minutes and consists with teams of 8. This version of the game is a favorite of the Sheboygan North Cross Country team and the Sheboygan Community as a whole.

Courtenay Place is known for its entertainment, nightlife and ill-designed footpaths. Many restaurants are open late and most of the bars stay open until dawn. It contains offices, accommodation, tourist shopping, entertainment, food, art and buskers offering many genres of free performance. Pedestrian traffic is substantial around the clock. The arts Every two years Courtenay Place is home to many of the New Zealand International Arts Festival events. Bats Theatre is a venue for the development of new theatre practitioners and plays. Downstage Theatre, founded in 1964, is New Zealand's first professional theatre. The red carpet for the world premiere Gandalf and The Embassy Embassy Theatre The Lord of the Rings movie The Return of the King had its world premiere at the Embassy Theatre at the head of Courtenay Place. The movies The Two Towers and The Fellowship of the Ring both had their Australasian premiere at the Embassy (Event Slide Shows). Both events were broadcast live to the world for many hours, involving the movement of record amounts of data by CityLink. The theatre is on the Wellington City Council's heritage list in the District Plan. Heritage New Zealand has recognised its heritage values with Category One registration, indicating a place of 'special or outstanding historical or cultural heritage significance or value'. It was originally known as the 'De Luxe' and was built in 1924. Designed by Llewellyn Williams and constructed of reinforced concrete, it included classical external and internal architectural details. The name changed to the Embassy in 1945. A long list of theatre identities has been associated with the theatre, including William Kemball, who formed the De Luxe Theatre Company in 1923, and Sir Robert Kerridge. Kerry Robins, leaseholder of the Paramount Theatre in Wellington, took over the lease of the Embassy in 1996. It was purchased by the Embassy Theatre Trust in 1997 with financial underwriting of the refurbishment programme by Wellington City Council. Ownership was transferred to the WCC under the terms of the agreement. Embassy Theatre Trust subsidiary Company Financial report: Audit report In October 2005 Wellington film exhibitor Kerry Robins sold the operational management of the Embassy to Village SkyCity Cinemas. Paramount Theatre (no longer operational) was until 2017 the oldest surviving cinema in Wellington, still with its original name. Originally a part of Te Aro beach, in August 1916 the location of the Paramount was purchased by John James Williamson. He arranged for architect James Bennie to design a picture house. The cinema closed down in 2017, following its sale to developers. Reading Courtenay Central Complex contains shops, restaurants and a ten-screen multiplex cinema. The 8,000 m¬≤ development links Courtenay Place with the waterfront and was designed to complement the existing character of the strip. This project won the 2003 Property Council NZ Entertainment Excellence Award.http://www.ignite-direct.com The site was originally bulldozed in the mid-1980s by Chase Corporation for the proposed Wakefield Centre, but after the company fell victim to the 1987 sharemarket crash, the site remained derelict for years until it was purchased by Reading Cinemas. The complex was temporarily shut down for safety reasons, after the 2016 Kaikoura earthquake damaged an adjacent parking building beyond repair. After reopening following the demolition of the parking building, the cinema section shut down again in 2019 due to further unseen structural issues. NgƒÅ Taonga Sound & Vision (aka NZ Film Archive) was located on the corner of Ghuznee St and Taranaki St, a block from Courtenay Place.

Formerly His Majesty's (and more recently the Westpac St James Theatre), the St. James was designed for John Fuller and Sons Ltd by Mr Henry Eli White Architect, structural engineer and contractor. It was the first steel-framed concrete-coated proscenium-arched theatre in the Southern Hemisphere. The steel frame allowed for an unsupported 80 ft (25 m) span roof structure and also provided good resistance to earthquake damage. In July 2011, Positively Wellington Venues, an integration between the Wellington Convention Centre and the St James Theatre Trust, began managing this theatre as well as The Opera House, Wellington.

Rail's passenger traffic took to the trams when they were electrified in 1904 and the station closed during the first world war. The rails were torn up soon after.  Early development  The north-eastern side of Courtenay Place was beach until the 1855 earthquake when it became swamp drained by the stream from the Basin Reserve between Kent and Cambridge Terraces.Joseph Ward. ‚Äò‚ÄôEarly Wellington‚Äô‚Äô page 216 accessed 9 June 2020 The short-lived Te Aro Pa was at the higher end west of Taranaki Street and a remnant of a structure can be seen in situ at 39-43 Taranaki Street.Heritage New Zealand accessed 9 June 2020 By 1870 the Pa site which once covered as much as 80 acres had been sold and subdivided. The triangle at that end was designated a Market Reserve. The inland Taranaki Street corner became Rouse Black and Hurrell‚Äôs carriage manufactory in 1859 (Hope Gibbons Ford lineal descendant) and the beachfront corner became Greenfield‚Äôs timber mill (Reading Cinemas) in 1862. The Wellington Gas Company put up its coal to gas and coke plant and gasometers on 3¬Ω acres of reclaimed land in 1871 and their head office building beside it on the corner of Tory Street and Courtenay Place in 1898. The Gas Company building is currently labelled KFC. The view east down Courtenay Place, around 1900 showing the United Methodist Free Church on the right, opened July 1879.

Saunders, and published by DAW Books in 1981. It may have been one of the first forays into the sword and sorcery genre by a black author. Saunders wrote and had published two more books in the series, The Quest for Cush in 1984 and The Trail of Bohu in 1985. In 2009, Saunders released The Naama War, the fourth and latest Imaro novel through Lulu.[https://www.blackgate.com/2009/12/30/imaro-the-naama-war-by-charles- saunders/ Imaro: The Naama War by Charles Saunders}}  Background  The novel is a collection of six short stories (\\"Mawanzo\\", \\"Turkhana Knives\\", \\"The Place of Stones\\", \\"Slaves of the Giant Kings\\", \\"Horror in the Black Hills\\", and \\"The City of Madness\\") which were originally published in Dark Fantasy, a fanzine published by Canadian comic book artist Gene Day during the 1970s. Imaro was the first book in a proposed series of novels about the eponymous hero set in the fantasy world of Nyumbani (a continent based on Africa), but a lawsuit by the Edgar Rice Burroughs estate over a poorly chosen cover quote (The Epic Novel of a Black Tarzan) caused a one-month delay in shipping as the books had to be reprinted, which led to poor sales. In 2006, publishers Night Shade Books released an updated edition of Imaro. This new edition excludes \\"The Slaves of the Giant-Kings\\", which Saunders felt held too many parallels to the present-day Rwandan genocide. It was replaced by \\"The Afua\\", a new story. Synopsis Growing up among the Ilyassai, a fierce tribe of warrior- herdsmen who despise his origin, the young Imaro struggles for acceptance after the breaking of a taboo forces his mother to leave him behind. The boy becomes a man unlike any other the Ilyassai has ever seen. His quest for acceptance and identity continues. Yet he learns he has powerful enemies, human and inhuman. Prevailing over foes who desire nothing more than to see him dead, Imaro finds that in victory, there can be loss. Departing from the Ilyassai, Imaro roams afar, wandering across the vast continent of Nyumbani, pitting his prodigious strength and courage against men, beasts and demons. Hunted by relentless foes, Imaro becomes the hunter. Eventually, he finds friendship and love among people who are like him, exiles and outlaws. Yet forces beyond Imaro‚Äôs comprehension are aligned against him. As he rises to prominence, events preordained before Imaro‚Äôs birth begin to unfold. Powers are stirring in Nyumbani, the Africa of a world that is beyond the one we know. And Imaro learns that some of the powers are aligned against him. As he struggles to hold on to his hard won acceptance, the warrior seeks the answer to the question that has haunted him all his life: Who am I?

He was the brother of general Constantine Maleinos and uncle of Nikephoros Phokas, who was greatly influenced by Michael and became Byzantine emperor several years after Michael's death. His feast day is July 12. Life He was born Manuel Maleinos (ŒúŒ±ŒΩŒøœÖŒÆŒª ŒúŒ±ŒªŒµŒêŒΩŒøœÇ) about 894, into a wealthy land-owning family of Cappadocia. Both of his grandfathers had been high military officers and had risen to the rank of patrikios.. His father Eudokimos was likewise a patrikios, while his mother Anastaso was a relative of the emperor Romanos I Lekapenos. He had at least one brother, Constantine Maleinos, and one sister whose name is not known. She married the general Bardas Phokas the Elder, thus linking the Maleinoi with the powerful military family of the Phokades. He spent his youth at the court of Emperor Leo the Wise, who was his relative. At the age of 18 he denounced worldly pleasures and withdrew to Bithynia, where he founded a highly reputable lavra under the guidance of elder John Heladites, and took the name Michael.\\"The Monk Michael Maleinos\\", St. Luke Orthodox church After a time Michael was ordained to the priesthood.\\"The Monk Michael Maleinos\\" Holy Trinity Orthodox Church He was said to have been compassionate and kindly towards people. The elder John, gave Michael permission to live a solitary life in a cave. Five days of the week he spent at prayerful concentration and only on Saturday and Sunday did he come to the monastery for participation in Divine-services and communion. His example attracted others, and in a desolate place called Dry Lake, the Monk Michael founded a monastery and gave it a strict ustav (monastic-rule). When the monastery was secure, the Monk Michael went to a still more remote place and built there a new monastery. Over time, by the efforts of the holy abba, all the Kumineia mountain was covered over by monastic communities. Maleinos had great influence on his nephew, the general and later emperor Nikephoros II Phokas (), as well as on Athanasius the Athonite.. Athanasius, who started his monastic life at Michael's monastery about the year 953, later modeled the Great Lavra, Mount Athos upon Michael's establishment.\\"Venerable Michael of Maleinus\\", Orthodox Church in America Michael Maleinos died at Mount Kyminas on 12 July 961.

It can specifically be used to set up encryption keys for multimedia sessions that are secured using SRTP, the security protocol commonly used for securing real-time communications such as VoIP. MIKEY was first defined in RFC 3830. Additional MIKEY modes have been defined in RFC 4650, RFC 4738, RFC 6043, RFC 6267 and RFC 6509.  Purpose of MIKEY  As described in RFC 3830, the MIKEY protocol is intended to provide end-to-end security between users to support a communication. To do this, it shares a session key, known as the Traffic Encryption Key (TEK), between the participants of a communication session. The MIKEY protocol may also authenticate the participants of the communication. MIKEY provides many methods to share the session key and authenticate participants.  Using MIKEY in practice  MIKEY is used to perform key management for securing a multimedia communication protocol. As such, MIKEY exchanges generally occur within the signalling protocol which supports the communication. A common setup is for MIKEY to support Secure VoIP by providing the key management mechanism for the VoIP protocol (SRTP). Key management is performed by including MIKEY messages within the SDP content of SIP signalling messages.http://research.ijcaonline.org/volume34/number7/pxc3875930.pdf = Use cases = MIKEY considers how to secure the following use cases: * One-to- one communications * Conference communications * Group Broadcast * Call Divert * Call Forking * Delayed delivery (Voicemail) Not all MIKEY methods support each use case. Each MIKEY method also has its own advantages and disadvantages in terms of feature support, computational complexity and latency of communication setup.  Key transport and exchange methods  MIKEY supports eight different methods to set up a common secret (to be used as e.g. a session key or a session KEK): * Pre-Shared Key (MIKEY-PSK): This is the most efficient way to handle the transport of the Common Secret, since only symmetric encryption is used and only a small amount of data has to be exchanged. However, an individual key has to be shared with every single peer, which leads to scalability problems for larger user groups. * Public-Key (MIKEY-PK): The Common Secret is exchanged with the help of public key encryption. In larger systems, this requires a PKI to handle the secure distribution of public keys. * Diffie‚ÄìHellman (MIKEY-DH): A Diffie‚ÄìHellman key exchange is used to set up the Common Secret. This method has a higher resource consumption (both computation time and bandwidth) than the previous ones, but has the advantage of providing perfect forward secrecy. Also, it can be used without any PKI. * DH-HMAC (MIKEY-DHHMAC) (HMAC-Authenticated Diffie‚ÄìHellman): This is a light-weight version of Diffie‚ÄìHellman MIKEY: instead of certificates and RSA signatures it uses HMAC to authenticate the two parts to one another. DH-HMAC is defined in RFC 4650. * RSA-R (MIKEY- RSA-R) (Reverse RSA): The Common Secret is exchanged with the help of public key encryption in a way that doesn't require any PKI: the initiator sends its public RSA key to the responder, which responds by selecting the Common Secret and then send it back to the initiator encrypted with the initiator's public key. RSA-R is defined in RFC 4738. * TICKET (MIKEY-TICKET): Ticket-Based Modes of Key Distribution in Multimedia Internet KEYing (MIKEY). MIKEY-TICKET is defined in RFC 6043. * IBAKE (MIKEY-IBAKE): Identity-Based Authenticated Key Exchange (IBAKE) Mode of Key Distribution in Multimedia Internet KEYing (MIKEY). MIKEY-IBAKE is defined in RFC 6267. * SAKKE (MIKEY-SAKKE): Sakai- Kasahara Key Encryption in Multimedia Internet KEYing (MIKEY). This is an Identity-Based Authenticated Key Exchange method. MIKEY-SAKKE is defined in RFC 6509.  MIKEY messages  The majority of MIKEY methods requires the initiator to send a message to participants (the I_MESSAGE), and the receivers to respond with another message (the R_MESSAGE). Once this exchange has completed, the session key can be generated by the participants. MIKEY-SAKKE does not require an R_MESSAGE. = MIKEY message content = MIKEY messages are made up of a number of payloads. Each payload describes the next payload in the MIKEY message. In this way the MIKEY protocol has shown it is flexible to being extended and adapted. The first payload is always the Common Header (HDR). This identifies the version of the MIKEY protocol, the method used (data type), whether a response is required and it identifies the cryptographic session that will be established via the exchange. Further payloads are defined by the MIKEY method in use. Frequently these will include information payloads such as: * A timestamp payload (T) - this contains the time and hence helps protect against replay attacks. * Identity Payloads (ID) - this identifies the participants. This payload type can also contain certificates (CERT). This was extended in RFC 6043 to include the 'role' of the user as part of the ID (IDR). * A RAND payload (RAND) - this is random data used to salt the post-exchange key derivation. * Security Policies (SP) - this contains a limited set of security policies to support the communication. * Certificate Hash (CHASH) - a hash indicating a certificate used for public- key encryption. In addition to this, the MIKEY message will contain at least one payload which encapsulates key material. These include: * Key data transport (KEMAC) - this encapsulating the key by encrypting it using a pre- shared secret. This is extended by RFC 4650 to support authenticated Diffie‚ÄìHellman (DHHMAC). * Diffie‚ÄìHellman (DH) - this contains cryptographic information supporting the Diffie‚ÄìHellman protocol. * Envelope Data (PKE) - this encapsulates the key using public key encryption. This is extended by RFC 4738 and RFC 6267. * Sakai-Kasahara (SAKKE) - this encapsulates the key using the identity-based Sakai-Kasahara protocol. This is defined by RFC 6509. * Ticket (TICKET) - provides a cryptographic token to request key material from an external server (KMS). This is defined by RFC 6043. Finally, the MIKEY message may contain an authentication payload. These include: * Signature (SIGN) - a signature on the MIKEY message. * Verification (V) - a MAC sent by the receiver to verify receipt.

The show formerly was ABC's marquee pregame show leading into the NBA Finals; however, that slot was taken over by the Rachel Nichols led The Jump starting in the 2019‚Äì20 season. NBA Countdown typically airs thirty minutes prior to games on ABC and ESPN. In 2006, the first and so far only one-hour edition of the pregame show aired, prior to Game 1 of the 2006 NBA Finals. Overview Former logo. Unlike NBC's NBA studio show, which was known as NBA Showtime for the first ten years of its existence, ABC's studio has been without much consistency. It has gone through five names in five seasons, and several analysts in each season. For the 2006-2007 season, the pregame show will be known as NBA Sunday Countdown. Each season, the show has been sponsored by GMC, with exception of the Finals, where it is sponsored by Chevrolet. Mike Tirico hosted the pregame shows from ABC's first season with the NBA to the middle of the network's fourth with the league. On March 19, 2006, Tirico was replaced by ESPN's Dan Patrick, and was moved to the number two play-by-play team. Other hosts of the pregame show include regular substitute John Saunders. =NBA Shootaround= (December 25, 2002 - June 15, 2003) Initially, ABC's NBA pregame show was known as NBA Shootaround, and shared virtually the same graphics and music as the ESPN pregame show of the same name. The program was hosted by Mike Tirico, with analysts Bill Walton and Tom Tolbert. Unlike most network pregame shows, Shootaround did not take place in a studio, and instead traveled to a different site each week (much like ESPN's College Gameday). Starting with Game 1 of the 2003 Eastern Conference Finals, Walton was replaced in the pregame show by Sean Elliott. Tolbert was dropped from the pregame show starting with Game 1 of the NBA Finals. Tirico and Elliott were joined by a guest analyst for each game of the Finals. =NBA Hangtime= (December 25, 2003 - December 25, 2004) After bad ratings in the 2002-2003 season, ABC retooled much of its NBA coverage. This included its pregame show, which was rebranded NBA Hangtime, and moved into the network's Times Square studios. The pregame show was given new music and graphics, to differentiate itself from its ESPN counterpart, and was still hosted by Mike Tirico. Tom Tolbert was brought back as an analyst, but ABC dropped Bill Walton from pregame show duties. He was replaced by George Karl. After criticism from the media on Karl's lack of opinion during the program, ABC replaced him on February 22, 2004 with former New Jersey Nets coach Byron Scott. NBA Hangtime lasted through the 2003-2004 season, and continued on Christmas Day 2004, prior to the much-hyped Los Angeles Lakers-Miami Heat game. This telecast was the only NBA Hangtime to involve analysts Steve Jones and Bill Walton. =NBA Game Time= (January 8, 2005 - June 23, 2005) For most of the 2004-2005 season, ABC's pregame show was known as NBA Game Time. Like Hangtime, it originated from the network's Times Square studios, and was once more hosted by Mike Tirico. Tirico was re-joined by Bill Walton in the studio, and Walton's old broadcast partner from NBC, Steve \\"Snapper\\" Jones. Tom Tolbert was dropped, while Byron Scott and George Karl both returned to the NBA coaching ranks. Game Time, unlike its predecessors, included guest analysts, such as Baron Davis, Jalen Rose, Rick Fox, and Bill Russell. During the 2005 Western Conference Finals, Steve Jones fell ill with appendicitis, and was later replaced for the NBA Finals by ESPN analyst Greg Anthony. =NBA Nation= (December 25, 2005 -June 22, 2006) Starting on Christmas Day 2005, ABC's NBA pregame show underwent yet another transformation. It adopted the former name of the ESPN2 Tuesday night NBA studio show, and became known as NBA Nation. For most of the season, Mike Tirico hosted the program. He was joined by Scottie Pippen, as Steve Jones and Bill Walton both returned to the broadcast booth. In the first edition of NBA Nation, Pippen was only seen in the final segment of the show. The first three segments involved special-interest stories and a panel of celebrities and sportswriters discussing issues concerning the NBA. This panel of guests was the first of only two. Though it was originally planned for Tirico to be joined by an in-studio panel of guests each week, the plan was evidently scrapped after January 22. Following that, a panel of guests, all of which directly connected to the NBA or basketball in general, joined Tirico via satellite occasionally (with the exception of March 5, when both Mike Krzyzewski and Jerry Colangelo joined Tirico in-studio). Until January 29, the program also featured an NBA-related segment from ESPN's Pardon the Interruption. On March 3, 2006, the New York Post reported that ABC would replace Tirico with ESPN's Dan Patrick starting on March 19.ABC CALLS PATRICK'S NUMBER Tirico moved to the number two play-by-play team, behind Mike Breen, and Patrick hosted ABC's coverage every week, including the NBA Finals. This move ended the most consistent role The NBA on ABC had, which was of Mike Tirico has studio host. In the suddenly revamped edition of NBA Nation, Patrick was joined by Scottie Pippen, who continued his role as pregame analyst, as well as former ESPN commentator and NBA player Mark Jackson and Washington Post and Pardon the Interruption co-host Mike Wilbon on a weekly basis. On May 12, 2006, the New York Post reported that Pippen had been let go from his duties as studio analyst for ABC, but would remain an analyst for ESPN.SCOTTIE SENT TO BENCH ABC went with the team of Dan Patrick, Mark Jackson and Michael Wilbon the rest of the way, representing a complete change from the beginning of the season.

Now known as NBA Sunday Countdown, the show would continue featuring Dan Patrick as host, with analysts Mark Jackson and Michael Wilbon. The show would not originate from Times Square, but instead originate from the site of that week's game (ala the original ABC pregame show, NBA Shootaround).ESPN GETS A RE-PHIL After only two broadcasts, Mark Jackson moved to game coverage exclusively, and was replaced by Jon Barry. =NBA Countdown= In 2008, the show was renamed NBA Countdown, and Patrick, who left ESPN, was replaced by Stuart Scott, joining Bill Walton, Michael Wilbon, and Barry as a contributor/fill-in. For the 2008‚Äì2009 season (beginning with the Christmas Day doubleheader), Barry replaced Walton full-time, Avery Johnson became the fourth member of the studio team, and Magic Johnson joined the show doing feature interviews and occasionally joining the studio crew as a panelist. For the 2010‚Äì2011 season, Hannah Storm joined Scott as they alternated as host. For the 2011‚Äì2012 season, Wilbon was promoted to the host position, with analysis from Barry and Johnson, and Chris Broussard joined as the show as the NBA insider. The show also moved from ESPN HQ in Bristol, Connecticut to their studios in Los Angeles. For the 2012‚Äì2013 season, Jalen Rose and Bill Simmons replaced Barry and Broussard respectively. Barry became a color commentator and Broussard a sideline reporter during games.http://www.broadcastingcable.com//article/489961-ESPN_Adds_Jalen_Rose_Bill_Simmons_to_NBA_Countdown_.php For the 2013‚Äì2014 season, Magic Johnson announced his departure. Doug Collins and Doris Burke will both be new additions to the program. Also, ESPN announced that Sage Steele will be replacing Michael Wilbon as host, ending Wilbon's 8-year run on Countdown.http://www.sportsmediawatch.com/2013/10/espn- gives-up-on-no-host-format-steele-to-anchor-nba-countdown/ Magic Johnson and Michael Wilbon were slated to return to the program in January 2017 to join Sage Steele for pregame coverage for the NBA Saturday Primetime on ABC series.

In April the show once again relocated to a new studio at Pier 17 in New York as Michelle Beadle is the host of ESPN's new morning show Get Up! which debuted on April 2, 2018. Over the 2019 off-season, reports began to emerge that ESPN was planning to retool the program. In August 2019, Richard Deitsch reported that Beadle was being dropped from the program, and that her assignment would be split between Rachel Nichols and Maria Taylor. In September 2019, the New York Post reported that ESPN was preparing to replace NBA Countdown as its pre-game show for ABC's Saturday Primetime broadcasts in favor of on-site editions of Nichols' studio show The Jump.

It was produced by DynaMicro for the TRS-80 Color Computer in 1982. This game is a significant plot point in the novel Ready Player One, but does not appear in its film adaptation. Gameplay Dungeons of Daggorath was one of the first games that attempted to portray three- dimensional space in a real-time environment, using angled lines to give the illusion of depth. It followed the 1974 games Maze War and Spasim, written for research computers, and the first 3D maze game for home computers, 3D Monster Maze, released in 1981. The game Phantom Slayer, which like Daggorath was released in 1982 for the Color Computer, also featured monsters lurking in a maze. While Daggorath was visually similar to these games, it added several elements of strategy, such as different kinds of monsters, complex mazes, different levels of visibility, and the use of different objects and weapons. Exploring the dungeons and battling creatures by typing commands into the text area at the bottom. The white bar shows a leather shield in the left hand and a wooden sword in the right hand, and indicates the player's heartbeat. Note the sword on the floor, which can be picked up by the player or other creatures. The player moves around a dungeon, issuing commands by means of typing ‚Äì for example, typing \\"GET LEFT SHIELD\\" or \\"USE RIGHT TORCH\\" (or abbreviations such as \\"G L SH\\" and \\"U R T\\"), gathering strength and ever more powerful weapons as the game progresses. Various creatures appear, and can often be heard when they are nearby, even when not visible. The object of the game is to defeat the second of two wizards, who is on the fifth and last level of the dungeon. A unique feature of the game is a heartbeat which rises as the player moves, takes actions or takes damage within the virtual environment. The heartbeat is a direct predecessor of the \\"health\\" indicator in later games; the higher the heart rate, the more vulnerable the player is to attack. The player can faint from overexertion, in which case there is the risk of being attacked while defenseless. This heartbeat system was used instead of numerical statistics such as hit points or vitality, and was inspired by arcade games, specifically 1978's Space Invaders where a heartbeat-like sound gradually increases pace as enemies advance towards the player. Development The game was developed by Douglas J. Morgan and Keith S. Kiyohara, with sounds by Phil Landmeier, in 1980‚Äì81 for the Tandy (RadioShack) TRS-80 Color Computer. Produced by DynaMicro, it was released in 1982 as an eight kilobyte ROMpak cartridge for the Color Computer, which took several months of recoding to achieve. Despite this, the game features a multi-level maze and has what for the time were advanced sound effects that provide important clues to the locations of monsters. Legacy Around 2001, Douglas J. Morgan noticed that the exclusive copyright had fallen back to him since for years there was no production and selling by the publisher RadioShack. He released the game under a freeware-like license to the public, also offering the source code for a small fee.Grant of license to reproduce Dungeons of Daggorath by Douglas J. Morgan \\"I hereby grant a non-exclusive permanent world-wide license to any and all Color Computer site administrators, emulator developers, programmers or any other person or persons who wish to develop, produce, duplicate, emulate, or distribute the game on the sole condition that they exercise every effort to preserve the game insofar as possible in its original and unaltered form. ... Anyone willing to pay for the copying of the listing (at Kinko's) and shipment to them, who intends to use it to enhance or improve the emulator versions of the game is welcome to it.\\" It has been ported by fans to Microsoft Windows, Linux, RISC OS and PSP via the SDL library. A free, open-source version has also been ported to the Web =Sequel= After Dungeons of Daggorath became one of the most popular Color Computer games, Tandy produced a sequel, Castle of Tharoggad,Castle of Tharoggad, Color Computer Documentation Website which was made without the participation of the Daggorath team. It was poorly received. =In popular culture= Dungeons of Daggorath was featured in the book Ready Player One, where the protagonist has to solve the game, emulated within a simulated universe.

Life McLachlan was born in London on 10 April 1837, one of five children of Hugh McLachlan and Hannah (Thompson) McLachlan. His father was a successful manufacturer of ship chronometers. He lived his early life in Ongar, Essex, and was educated in Ilford at a private school where he developed a good knowledge of English, French and German.DNB, 2004 Due to a sizable inheritance, McLachlan was a man of independent means and devoted himself entirely to the study of entomology and other aspects of natural history.Nature, 1904 An initial interest in botany was prompted by a desire to understand the relationship between butterflies and their food plants.Entomologist's Monthly Magazine, 1904 In 1855, after a broken engagement, McLachlan traveled to New South Wales, Australia and Shanghai, China to study and collect botanical materials. On his return to England he enlisted the help of Robert Brown at the British Museum to identify the plants in his collection. An acquaintance with John Van Voorst influenced his focus on entomology and the work of Hermann August Hagen prompted him to study Neuroptera. He wrote his first paper on this order in 1861, including a description of a new British species. Other papers on lacewings followed, culminating with his Catalogue of British Neuroptera in 1870.DNB, 2004 He next turned his attention to the collection and study of caddisflies (Trichoptera) becoming an acknowledged authority on this order. His greatest work was considered to be the Monographic Revision and Synopsis of the Trichoptera of the European Fauna (1874‚Äì84). Originally published in nine parts, it was illustrated by nearly 2000 of his own detailed drawings, made with a camera lucida.DNB, 2004 McLachlan had extensive connections with a worldwide community of entomologists and was able to build a collection of Neuroptera that was one of the largest in the world. He also had an extensive collection of butterflies, many of which were once common in Britain but had become rare or extinct.Royal Society, 1905 McLachlan was the first editor of the review Entomologist's Monthly Magazine. He became a member of the Entomological Society of London in 1858, and served variously as secretary, treasurer and president. He was a member of the Linnean Society of London from 1862, and was elected to the Royal Society in 1877. He was also a member of the Zoological Society of London, the Royal Horticultural Society, a member of the council of the Ray Society and a member of various other British and foreign learned societies. He died on 23 May 1904 in Lewisham, close to London. He is buried in Tower Hamlets Cemetery.DNB, 2004 Works Among his publications are *Monograph of the British species of caddis-flies (1865). *Monograph of the British Neuroptera-Planipennia (1868). *Monograph British Psocidae (1866-1867). *Catalogue of British Neuroptera (1870). *Monographic revision and synopsis of the Trichoptera of the European fauna (two volumes, 1874 & 1880).

The airport is situated northwest of P√§rnu. The airport is closed until June 2021 for building works.http://www.parnu-airport.ee/eng/news/?newsID=4774 Overview In October 1937, the P√§rnu town council designated an area of for the building of an airport. Operations at the new airport began in 1939. During the Soviet occupation, the airfield was operated by the Soviet Air Force. It was an interceptor aircraft base, operated by 366 IAP (366th Interceptor Aviation Regiment) and possibly the 655 IAP (655th Interceptor Aviation Regiment), which flew Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-23 aircraft from the 1970s until the 1990s. Aeroflot used to operate Tartu-Viljandi-P√§rnu-Kingissepa (now Kuressaare) services using Antonov An-2 biplanes. In the summer of 1992, the re- constituted Estonian defence ministry took over the military airport, which had drawn down its operations. On 15 October the same year it was decided to build a civil airport at the site of the old military airport. The old runway was closed on 1 July 1997, and regular flights started to use the runway that had belonged to the Soviet air force. The airport is often visited by private aircraft from Scandinavia and other European countries. 5,148 people travelled via P√§rnu Airport in 2010. At present, the condition of the runway makes it unsuitable for larger aircraft flying international flights, and in 2016, there were proposals to overhaul and refit the airport, alongside (possibly) a brand-new terminal for handling of larger jets.http://news.err.ee/v/business/c8ed7915-3e33-46fe-aa74-e05319e80f21/parnu- airport-may-get-money-originally-destined-for-railway-construction Airlines and destinations Flights are suspended until June 2021.http://www.parnu- airport.ee/eng/news/?newsID=4774 The small airline Air Livonia flew from P√§rnu to Kuressaare, Kihnu and Ruhnu until 2006.

It is a member of the Graduate Theological Union (GTU) and is affiliated with the University of California, Berkeley. The seminary was formed in 1904 to educate leaders for the growing number of progressive religious communities in the western part of the country. An emphasis on the practical skills of religious leadership and personalized study characterized the school's transformation-based educational philosophy from the beginning. Today, it educates Unitarian Universalist ministers, religious educators, and spiritual activists, as well as progressive religious leaders from a variety of traditions, including Christianity, Islam, Judaism, Buddhism, earth- centered traditions, and others. History Starr King School for the Ministry opened in 1904 as the Pacific Unitarian School for the Ministry. With most Unitarian ministers being educated at Harvard Divinity School in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and Meadville Theological School in Meadville, Pennsylvania, the new seminary would meet the need to train religious leaders serving the progressive churches west of the Rocky Mountains. The school held its first classes at the First Unitarian Church of Oakland, moving just a few years later to the City of Berkeley to be closer to other \\"Holy Hill\\" seminaries and the University of California, Berkeley. The first president was Earl Morse Wilbur. In addition to his service to the school for 30 years, he is remembered for writing the first comprehensive histories of European Unitarianism. In 1941, the school changed its name to honor the Rev. Thomas Starr King, minister of the First Unitarian Church of San Francisco. During the Civil War, the popular lecturer and activist spoke zealously in favor of the Union and was credited by Abraham Lincoln with preventing California from becoming a separate republic. In addition, he organized the Pacific Branch of the United States Sanitary Commission, which cared for wounded soldiers and was the predecessor to the American Red Cross. King's prominence also contributed greatly to the spread of Unitarianism on the West Coast. In 1962, the \\"Holy Hill\\" seminaries officially formed the Graduate Theological Union (GTU), a diverse consortium of what now numbers nine theological seminaries, several research centers, affiliates and institutes. It is the largest theological consortium in the U.S. and its library consolidates the numerous resources of the member schools. Starr King joined the GTU in 1964. From this time up through the mid-1980s the seminary was known as the Starr King School for Religious Leadership.Robert Charles Kimball, Open Letter to Board of Trustees, Unitarian Universalist Association: Concerning January 26, 1974 Progress Report of the Ministerial Education Commission 1974David Robinson, The Unitarians and the Universalists 1985 p335 When Rev.

Its approach to the study of theology is inspired by UU's liberal religious values. It is dedicated to providing student-centered, multi-religious, counter-oppressive graduate education that cultivates multi-religious life and learning, and creates just and sustainable communities. The school offers three Master's degrees: Master of Divinity (M.Div.), Master of Arts in for Social Change (M.A.S.C.), and Master of Arts (M.A.) in collaboration with the Graduate Theological Union. It also offers two certificates in Unitarian Universalist Studies and Multi-Religious Studies. The school is accredited by the Association of Theological Schools (ATS). SKSM is also one of the three GTU member schools offering online classes and it co-sponsors the online courses offered by the Institute for Buddhist Studies, another GTU member school. It is also the only GTU school offering a low-residence Master of Divinity, a program allowing 2/3 of the degree to be earned at a distance through online courses. Residential course requirements may be met through courses at SKSM or other GTU schools, domestic and international immersion courses, or Winter/January or Summer/August intensive courses.

Previously, in the Israelite religion including the time of the kingdoms of Israel and Judah, other terms were used to designate the leading priests; however, as long as a king was in place, the supreme ecclesiastical authority lay with him. The official introduction of the term \\"high priest\\" went hand in hand with a greatly enhanced ritual and political significance bestowed upon the chief priest in the post-Exilic period, certainly from 411 BCE onward, after the religious transformations brought about by the Babylonian captivity and due to the lack of a Jewish king and kingdom. The high priests belonged to the Jewish priestly families that trace their paternal line back to Aaron, the first high priest of Israel in the Hebrew Bible and elder brother of Moses, through Zadok, a leading priest at the time of David and Solomon. This tradition came to an end in the 2nd century BCE during the rule of the Hasmoneans, when the position was occupied by other priestly families unrelated to Zadok. Predecessors of Aaron Even though Aaron was the first high priest mentioned in the Book of Exodus, Louis Ginzberg in Legends of the Jews noted that in legends the first man that assumed the title of high priest of God is Enoch, who was succeeded by Methuselah, Lamech, Noah, Shem, Melchizedek, Abraham, Isaac and Levi.Ginzberg, Louis (1909). The Legends of the Jews Volume I - II (Translated by Henrietta Szold) Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society. Biblical narrative Jewish high priest and Levite in ancient Judah (the depictions of the Menorah, Table of Showbread and trumpets are inspired by the Arch of Titus). Aaron, though he is but rarely called \\"the great priest\\", being generally simply designated as \\"ha-kohen\\" (the priest), was the first incumbent of the office, to which he was appointed by God (Book of Exodus ; ). Succession The succession was to be through one of his sons, and was to remain in his own family ().See Josephus, Ant. xx. 10, ¬ß 1. If he had no son, the office devolved upon the brother next of age: such appears to have been the practise in the Hasmonean period. In the time of Eli, however (), the office passed to the collateral branch of Ithamar (see Eleazar). But King Solomon is reported to have deposed the high priest Abiathar, and to have appointed Zadok, a descendant of Eleazar, in his stead (; ). After the Exile, the succession seems to have been, at first, in a direct line from father to son; but later the civil authorities arrogated to themselves the right of appointment. Antiochus IV Epiphanes for instance, deposed Onias III in favor of Jason, who was followed by Menelaus.Josephus, Ant. xii. 5, ¬ß 1; II Maccabees iii. 4, iv. 23. Herod the Great nominated no less than six high priests; Archelaus, two. The Roman legate Quirinius and his successors exercised the right of appointment, as did Agrippa I, Herod of Chalcis, and Agrippa II. Even the people occasionally elected candidates to the office. The high priests before the Exile were, it seems, appointed for life;cf. ; . in fact, from Aaron to the Captivity the number of the high priests was not greater than during the sixty years preceding the fall of the Second Temple. Age and qualifications The age of eligibility for the office is not fixed in the Law; but according to rabbinical tradition it was twenty.Maimonides, \\"Yad\\", Kele ha-Mikdash, v. 15; ·∏§ul. 24b; 'Ar. 13b. Aristobulus, however, was only seventeen when appointed by Herod;\\"Ant.\\" xv. 3, ¬ß 3. but the son of Onias III was too young (ŒΩŒ∑œÄŒπŒøœÇ) to succeed his father.ib. xii. 5, ¬ß 1. The age a Levite entered the priesthood was 30 years of age (Numbers ). Legitimacy of birth was essential; hence the care in the keeping of the genealogical recordsJosephus, Contra Apion i., ¬ß 7. and the distrust of one whose mother had been captured in war.\\"Ant.\\" xiii. 10, ¬ß 5; Adolf Jellinek, \\"B. H.\\" i. 133-137; ·∏≤id. 66a; John see Hyrcanus. The high priest had to abstain from ritual defilement. He may marry only an Israelite virgin (). In this restriction is extended to all kohanim (priests), an exception being made in favor of the widow of a priest (see Levirate marriage). According to he was not permitted to come in contact with the bodies of the dead, not even for his parents (regular priests could become unclean for the death of an immediate relative) ; and he was not permitted, as a sign of mourning, to leave his hair disheveled, to expose it, or to rend his garments ( et seq.). According to Josephus,Josephus. Ant. xv. 3, ¬ß 1. birth on foreign soil was not a disqualification; but the disqualifications of et seq. applied to the high priest as well as to other priests. High Priest in the Holy Place. Vestments The Torah provides for specific vestments to be worn by the priests when they are ministering in the Tabernacle: \\"And you shall make holy garments for Aaron your brother, for dignity and for beauty\\" (). These garments are described in detail in , and . The high priest wore eight holy garments (bigdei kodesh). Of these, four were of the same type worn by all priests and four were unique to the Kohen Gadol. Those vestments which were common to all priests, were: * Priestly undergarments (Hebrew michnasayim) (breeches): linen pants reaching from the waist to the knees \\"to cover their nakedness\\" () * Priestly tunic (Hebrew ketonet) (tunic): made of pure linen, covering the entire body from the neck to the feet, with sleeves reaching to the wrists. That of the high priest was embroidered (); those of the priests were plain (). * Priestly sash (Hebrew avnet) (sash): that of the high priest was of fine linen with \\"embroidered work\\" in blue and purple and scarlet (, ); those worn by the priests were of white, twined linen. * Priestly turban (Hebrew mitznefet): that of the high priest was much larger than that of the priests and wound so that it formed a broad, flat-topped turban; that for priests was wound so that it formed a cone-shaped turban, called a migbahat. The vestments that were unique to the high priest were: * Priestly robe (me'il) (\\"robe of the ephod\\"): a sleeveless, blue robe, the lower hem of which was fringed with small golden bells alternating with pomegranate-shaped tassels in blue, purple, and scarlet‚Äîtekhelet, argaman, tolaat shani. * Ephod: a richly embroidered vest or apron with two onyx engraved gemstones on the shoulders, on which were engraved the names of the tribes of Israel * Priestly breastplate (Hebrew hoshen): with twelve gems, each engraved with the name of one of the tribes; a pouch in which he probably carried the Urim and Thummim. It was fastened to the Ephod * On the front of the turban was a golden plate inscribed with the words: \\"Holiness unto YHWH\\" attached to the mitznefet. The high priest, like all priests, would minister barefoot when he was serving in the Temple. Like all of the priests, he had to immerse himself in the ritual bath before vesting and wash his hands and his feet before performing any sacred act. The Talmud teaches that neither the kohanim nor the Kohen Gadol were fit to minister unless they wore their priestly vestments: \\"While they are clothed in the priestly garments, they are clothed in the priesthood; but when they are not wearing the garments, the priesthood is not upon them\\" (B.Zevachim 17:B). It is further taught that just as the sacrifices facilitate an atonement for sin, so do the priestly garments (B.Zevachim 88b). The high priest had two sets of holy garments: the \\"golden garments\\" detailed above, and a set of white \\"linen garments\\" (bigdei ha-bad) which he wore only on the Day of Atonement (Yom Kippur) (). On that day, he would change his holy garments four times, beginning in the golden garments but changing into the Linen Garments for the two moments when he would enter the Holy of Holies (the first time to offer the blood of atonement and the incense, and the second time to retrieve the censer), and then change back again into the golden garments after each time. He would immerse in the ritual bath before each change of garments, washing his hands and his feet after removing the garments and again before putting the other set on. The linen garments were only four in number, those corresponding to the garments worn by all priests (undergarments, tunic, sash and turban), but made only of white linen, with no embroidery. They could be worn only once, new sets being made each year. Consecration The ceremonial of consecration, extending through an entire week (-; ), included certain rites which all priests were required to undergo: purification; the sacrifices; the \\"filling\\" of the hands; the smearing with blood. But Aaron the high priest was anointed with sacred oil, hence the title of the \\"anointed priest\\"; other passages have it that all priests were anointed (, ; , ; ). The first consecration was performed by Moses; the Torah does not state who consecrated subsequent high priests. states emphatically that every new high priest shall be anointed; and et seq. commands that the official garments worn by his predecessor shall be worn by the new incumbent while he is anointed and during the seven days of his consecration (comp. ; Psalm 133:2). Sanctity and functions The distinguished rank of the high priest is apparent from the fact that his sins are regarded as belonging also to the people (Lev. iv. 3, 22). He was entrusted with the stewardship of the Urim and Thummim (Num. xxvii. 20 et seq.). On Yom Kippur he alone entered the Holy of Holies, to make atonement for his house and for the people (). He alone could offer the sacrifices for the sins of the priests, or of the people, or of himself (); and only he could officiate at the sacrifices following his own or another priest's consecration (). He also offered a meal-offering every morning and evening for himself and the whole body of the priesthood (, though the wording of the law is not altogether definite). Other information concerning his functions is not given. Though other priests would serve only when it was their week on rotation and on feast days (and even then their function was decided by lot), he was privileged to take part at his own pleasure in any of the priestly rites at any time. Josephus contends that the high priest almost invariably participated in the ceremonies on Shabbat, the New Moon, and the festivals.Flavius Josephus, Wars of the Jews v. 5, ¬ß 7 This may also be inferred from the glowing description given in the Wisdom of Sirach i. of the high priest's appearance at the altar. In rabbinical literature The high priest is the chief of all the priests; he should be anointed and invested with the pontifical garments; but if the sacred oil were not obtainable,see Hor. 13a; \\"Semag\\", 173, end investiture with the additional garments (see Biblical Data, above) is regarded as sufficient.Maimonides, \\"Yad\\", Kele ha- Mi·∏≥dash, iv. 12 A high priest so invested is known as merubbeh begadim. This investiture consists of arraying him in the eight pieces of dress and in removing them again on eight successive days, though (the anointing and) the investiture on the first day suffices to qualify him for the functions of the office.ib. iv. 13 The only distinction between the \\"anointed\\" and the \\"invested\\" high priest is that the former offers the bull for an unintentional transgression.Hor. 11b Powers The Great Sanhedrin alone had the right to appoint, or confirm the appointment of, the high priest. His consecration might take place only in the day-time. Two high priests must not be appointed together. Every high priest had a \\"mishneh\\" (a second) called the Segan, or \\"memunneh\\", to stand at his right; another assistant was the \\"Catholicos\\" (\\"Yad\\", l.c. 16‚Äì17). The right of succession was in the direct, or, the direct failing, the collateral, line, provided the conditions concerning physical fitness were fulfilled (ib. 20; Ket. 103b; Sifra, ·∏≤edoshim). For offenses which entailed flagellation, the high priest could be sentenced by a court of three; after submitting to the penalty he could resume his office (\\"Yad\\", l.c. 22). The high priest was expected to be superior to all other priests in physique, in wisdom, in dignity, and in material wealth; if he was poor his brother priests contributed to make him rich (Yoma 18a; \\"Yad\\", l.c. v. 1); but none of these conditions was indispensable. The high priest was required to be mindful of his honor. He might not mingle with the common people, nor permit himself to be seen disrobed, or in a public bath, etc.; but he might invite others to bathe with him (Tosef., Sanh. iv.; \\"Yad\\", l.c. v. 3). He might not participate in a public banquet, but he might pay a visit of consolation to mourners, though even then his dignity was guarded by prescribed etiquette (Sanh. 18‚Äì19; \\"Yad\\", l.c. v. 4). Restrictions The high priest might not follow the bier of one in his own family who had died, nor leave the Temple or his house during the time of mourning. The people visited him to offer consolation; in receiving them, the Segan was at his right, the next in rank and the people at his left. The people said: \\"We are thy atonement.\\" He answered: \\"Be ye blessed from heaven\\" (\\"Yad\\", l.c. v. 5; and Mishneh Kesef, ad loc.). During the offering of consolation he sat on a stool, the people on the floor; he rent his garments, not from above, but from below, near the feet, the penalty for rending them from above being flagellation (Semag, Lawin, 61-62). He could not permit his hair to be disheveled, nor could he cut it (\\"Yad\\", l.c. v. 6). He had one house attached to the Temple (Mid. 71b), and another in the city of Jerusalem. His honor required that he should spend most of his time in the Sanctuary (\\"Yad\\", l.c. v. 7). The high priest was subject to the jurisdiction of the courts, but if accused of a crime entailing capital punishment he was tried by the Great Sanhedrin; he could, however, refuse to give testimony (Sanh. 18). The high priest must be married, and \\"should only marry a virgin\\"; to guard against contingencies it was proposed to hold a second wife in readiness immediately before the Day of Atonement (Yoma i. 1); but polygamy on his part was not encouraged ( = \\"one wife\\"; Yoma 13a; \\"Yad\\", l.c. v. 10). He could give the \\"halizah\\", and it could be given to his widow, as she also was subject to the Levirate; his divorced wife could marry again (l.c.; Sanh. 18). When entering the Temple (\\"Hekal\\") he was supported to the curtain by three men (Tamid 67a; this may perhaps have reference to his entering the Holy of Holies; but see \\"Yad\\", l.c. v. 11, and the Mishneh Kesef ad loc.). He could take part in the service whenever he desired (\\"Yad\\", l.c. v. 12; Yoma i. 2; Tamid 67b; see Rashi ad loc.). On the Day of Atonement only he wore white garments, while on other occasions he wore his golden vestments (Yoma 60a; comp. 68b, ). The seven days preceding the Day of Atonement were devoted to preparing for his high function, precautions being taken to prevent any accident that might render him Levitically impure (Yoma i. 1 et seq.). The ceremonial for that day is described in detail in Mishnah Yoma (see also Haneberg, \\"Die Religi√∂sen Alterth√ºmer der Bibel\\", pp. 659‚Äì671, Munich, 1869). For other regulations concerning the high priest see \\"Yad\\", Biat ha-Mi·∏≥dash, ii. 1, 8; for details in regard to the vestments see \\"Yad\\", Kele ha-Mi·∏≥dash, viii. 2-4, 5 (in reference to soiled vestments: the white could be worn only once); l.c. vii. 1 (\\"·∫ìi·∫ì\\"), vii. 3 (\\"me'il\\"), vii. 6 (\\"·∏•oshen\\"), vii. 9 (ephod), ix. Josephus enumerates only fifty-two pontificates under the Second Temple, omitting the second appointments of Hyrcanus II, Hananeel, and Joazar. Post-Exilic conditions A traditional list of the Jewish high priests. After the Babylonian Exile, Joshua appears vested with the prominence that the Priestly source (P) ascribes to the high priest (Zech. iii.; Hag. vi. 13). The post-exilic high priests traced their pedigree back to Zadok, appointed as chief priest at Jerusalem by Solomon (I Kings ii. 35), and Zadok was held to be a descendant of Eleazar, the son of Aaron (II Chron. v. 34). Immediately after the return from the Captivity, as is clearly to be inferred from Zechariah and Haggai, political authority was not vested in the high priest. Political (Messianic) sovereignty was represented by, or attributed to, a member of the royal house, while religious affairs were reserved to the high- priesthood, represented in the Book of Zechariah by Joshua. But in the course of time, as the Messianic hope, or even the hope of autonomy under foreign (Persian, Greek, Egyptian, or Syrian) suzerainty became weaker, the high priest also became a political chief of the congregation, as much, perhaps, through the consideration shown him by the suzerain powers and their viceroys as through the effect of the increasingly thorough acceptance of the Levitical code by pious Judeans. The rigorists received Alcimus, the high priest, with confidence because he was \\"a priest of the seed of Aaron.\\" (I Macc. vii. 14) Political aspects The assumption of the princely authority by the Maccabean high priests (the Hasmoneans) was merely the final link in this development, which, beginning with the death of Zerubbabel, was to combine the two ideals, the politico-Messianic and the religio-Levitical, in one office. But after the brief heyday of national independence had come to an inglorious close, the high-priesthood changed again in character, insofar as it ceased to be a hereditary and a life office. High priests were appointed and removed with great frequency (see above). This may account for the otherwise strange use of the title in the plural (·ºÄœÅœáŒπŒµœÅŒµ·øñœÇ) in the New Testament and in Josephus (\\"Vita\\", ¬ß 38; \\"B. J.\\" ii. 12, ¬ß 6; iv. 3, ¬ß¬ß 7, 9; iv. 4, ¬ß 3). The deposed high priests seem to have retained the title, and to have continued to exercise certain functions; the ministration on the Day of Atonement, however, may have been reserved for the actual incumbent. This, however, is not clear; Hor. iii. 1‚Äì4 mentions as distinctive the exclusive sacrifice of a bull by the high priest on the Day of Atonement and the tenth of the ephah (that is, the twelve \\"·∏•allot\\"; comp. Meg. i. 9; Macc. ii. 6). But even in the latest periods the office was restricted to a few families of great distinction (probably the bene kohanim gedolim, \\"[members of] high-priestly families\\"; Ket. xiii. 1-2; Oh. xvii. 5; comp. Josephus, \\"B. J.\\" vi. 2, ¬ß 2; see Sch√ºrer, \\"Gesch.\\" 3d ed., ii. 222). 001 Connection with Sanhedrin The high priest was the presiding officer of the Sanhedrin. This view conflicts with the later Jewish tradition according to which the Pharisee tannaim (the Zugot) at the head of the yeshivot presided over the great Sanhedrin also (·∏§ag. ii. 2). However, a careful reading of the sources (\\"Ant.\\" xx. 10; \\"Contra Ap.\\" ii., ¬ß 22; comp. \\"Ant.\\" iv. 8, ¬ß 14; xiv. 9, ¬ß¬ß 3‚Äì5 [Hyrcanus II. as president]; xx. 9, ¬ß 1 [Ananus]), as well as the fact that in the post-Maccabean period the high priest was looked upon as exercising in all things, political, legal, and sacerdotal, the supreme authority, shows it to be almost certain that the presidency of the Sanhedrin was vested in the high priest (see Isidore Loeb in \\"R. E. J.\\" 1889, xix. 188‚Äì201; Jelski, \\"Die Innere Einrichtung des Grossen Synhedrions\\", pp. 22‚Äì28, according to whom the Nasi was the high priest, while the Av Beth Din was a Pharisaic tanna). In Christianity In Christian tradition, Jesus is symbolically consecrated as eternal high priest \\"after the order of Melchizedek\\" () in light of his eternal intercession with God. The position of high priest of Israel was abolished with the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 CE, so attribution of the title of high priest to Jesus served as a symbolic continuation of the priesthood. Melchizedek is never identified explicitly as a \\"high priest\\" (◊õ◊î◊ü ◊í◊ì◊ï◊ú) in the Hebrew Bible, but a \\"priest of the most high God\\" (◊õ◊î◊ü ◊ú◊ê◊ú ◊¢◊ú◊ô◊ï◊ü, ); the Aaronic high priesthood had not yet been established (Aaron is also never explicitly identified as \\"high priest\\"). Jesus is nevertheless identified in Hebrews as a \\"high priest (·ºÄœÅœáŒπŒµœÅŒµœçœÇ) after the order of Melchizedek.\\" The use of Melchizedek as a type of Christ is significant because Melchizedek was ordained a priest despite not being related to Aaron. As Jesus was not a descendant of Aaron, he would not normally have been eligible to serve as high priest; the \\"order of Melchizedek\\" emphasizes the precedent for his claim to priesthood.

It opened in 1859 as Karachi Parsi Balak Shalla, by the Zoroastrian residents of Karachi. History * The Zoroastrian residents of Karachi, feeling the need for imparting religious education and knowledge of Gujarati, opened on 23 May 1859, ‚ÄúThe Parsi Balakshala,‚Äù or children's school. * In June 1862, Seth Shapurji Hormusji Soparivala was appointed the secretary of the school. In May 1870, Seth Shahpurji Hormusji Soparivala, in memory of his late wife, Bai Virbaiji Soparivala, donated his personal two story house on Frere Street (valued Rs. 10,000/-), to be used as a coeducation vernacular school. Thereafter, the school was named the Parsi Virbaiji School. The opening ceremony was performed on 24 September 1870, by the Commissioner in Sindh, Sir William Merewether. * On 1 April 1918, the girls' section of the school was separated and commenced to function on the first floor of the building. In June 1919, the girls‚Äô school shifted to its present location of Mama School. * Through the efforts of the managing committee and principal, technical classes were organized in the school, and in June 1946, a technical workshop building began. * In 1947, after the partition of India, on the personal request to the elders of the Parsi community by the Quaid-I-Azam, Mr. Mohammad Ali Jinnah, the school opened its doors to all Muslim and other non Parsi children of the new nation. * On 23 May 1958, the school began Centenary celebrations and the entire Parsi community participated in the functions that were organized. Architect Bai Virbaiji Soparivala Parsi School In 1875, Parsi Virbaiji Soparivala School became Bai Virbaiji Soparivala Parsi High School and H. E.

In 1877, Seth Shahpurji was awarded the \\"Certificate of Loyalty\\" by Queen Victoria for his services in the field of education and social sector. In 1904, the construction of the present building started, and, in 1906, BVS shifted to the new building at Victoria Road (now Abdullah Haroon Road).

In differential geometry, the notion of torsion is a manner of characterizing a twist or screw of a moving frame around a curve. The torsion of a curve, as it appears in the Frenet‚ÄìSerret formulas, for instance, quantifies the twist of a curve about its tangent vector as the curve evolves (or rather the rotation of the Frenet‚ÄìSerret frame about the tangent vector). In the geometry of surfaces, the geodesic torsion describes how a surface twists about a curve on the surface. The companion notion of curvature measures how moving frames \\"roll\\" along a curve \\"without twisting\\". More generally, on a differentiable manifold equipped with an affine connection (that is, a connection in the tangent bundle), torsion and curvature form the two fundamental invariants of the connection. In this context, torsion gives an intrinsic characterization of how tangent spaces twist about a curve when they are parallel transported; whereas curvature describes how the tangent spaces roll along the curve. Torsion may be described concretely as a tensor, or as a vector-valued 2-form on the manifold. If ‚àá is an affine connection on a differential manifold, then the torsion tensor is defined, in terms of vector fields X and Y, by :T(X,Y) = abla_XY- abla_YX - [X,Y] where [X,Y] is the Lie bracket of vector fields. Torsion is particularly useful in the study of the geometry of geodesics. Given a system of parametrized geodesics, one can specify a class of affine connections having those geodesics, but differing by their torsions. There is a unique connection which absorbs the torsion, generalizing the Levi-Civita connection to other, possibly non-metric situations (such as Finsler geometry). The difference between a connection with torsion, and a corresponding connection without torsion is a tensor, called the contorsion tensor. Absorption of torsion also plays a fundamental role in the study of G-structures and Cartan's equivalence method. Torsion is also useful in the study of unparametrized families of geodesics, via the associated projective connection. In relativity theory, such ideas have been implemented in the form of Einstein‚ÄìCartan theory. The torsion tensor Let M be a manifold with an affine connection on the tangent bundle (aka covariant derivative) ‚àá. The torsion tensor (sometimes called the Cartan (torsion) tensor) of ‚àá is the vector-valued 2-form defined on vector fields X and Y by :T(X, Y) := abla_X Y - abla_Y X - [X,Y] where is the Lie bracket of two vector fields. By the Leibniz rule, T(fX, Y) = T(X, fY) = fT(X, Y) for any smooth function f. So T is tensorial, despite being defined in terms of the connection which is a first order differential operator: it gives a 2-form on tangent vectors, while the covariant derivative is only defined for vector fields. =Components of the torsion tensor= The components of the torsion tensor T^c{}_{ab} in terms of a local basis of sections of the tangent bundle can be derived by setting , and by introducing the commutator coefficients . The components of the torsion are then : T^k{}_{ij} := Gamma^k{}_{ij} - Gamma^k{}_{ji}-gamma^k{}_{ij},quad i,j,k=1,2,ldots,n. Here {Gamma^k}_{ij} are the Christoffel symbols defining the connection. If the basis is holonomic then the Lie brackets vanish, gamma^k{}_{ij}=0. So T^k{}_{ij}=2Gamma^k{}_{[ij]}. In particular (see below), while the geodesic equations determine the symmetric part of the connection, the torsion tensor determines the antisymmetric part. =The torsion form= The torsion form, an alternative characterization of torsion, applies to the frame bundle FM of the manifold M. This principal bundle is equipped with a connection form œâ, a gl(n)-valued one-form which maps vertical vectors to the generators of the right action in gl(n) and equivariantly intertwines the right action of GL(n) on the tangent bundle of FM with the adjoint representation on gl(n). The frame bundle also carries a canonical one-form Œ∏, with values in Rn, defined at a frame (regarded as a linear function ) by :theta(X) = u^{-1}(pi_{*}(X)) where is the projection mapping for the principal bundle and is its push- forward. The torsion form is then :Theta = dtheta + omegawedgetheta. Equivalently, Œò = DŒ∏, where D is the exterior covariant derivative determined by the connection. The torsion form is a (horizontal) tensorial form with values in Rn, meaning that under the right action of it transforms equivariantly: :R_g^*Theta = g^{-1}cdotTheta where g acts on the right-hand side through its adjoint representation on Rn. Torsion form in a frame The torsion form may be expressed in terms of a connection form on the base manifold M, written in a particular frame of the tangent bundle . The connection form expresses the exterior covariant derivative of these basic sections: :Dmathbf{e}_i = mathbf{e}_j {omega^j}_i . The solder form for the tangent bundle (relative to this frame) is the dual basis of the ei, so that (the Kronecker delta). Then the torsion 2-form has components :Theta^k = dtheta^k + {omega^k}_j wedge theta^j = {T^k}_{ij} theta^i wedge theta^j. In the rightmost expression, :{T^k}_{ij} = theta^kleft( abla_{mathbf{e}_i}mathbf{e}_j - abla_{mathbf{e}_j}mathbf{e}_i - left[mathbf{e}_i, mathbf{e}_jright]right) are the frame-components of the torsion tensor, as given in the previous definition. It can be easily shown that Œòi transforms tensorially in the sense that if a different frame :tilde{mathbf{e}}_i = mathbf{e}_j {g^j}_i for some invertible matrix-valued function (gji), then :tilde{Theta}^i = {left(g^{-1}right)^i}_jTheta^j. In other terms, Œò is a tensor of type (carrying one contravariant and two covariant indices). Alternatively, the solder form can be characterized in a frame-independent fashion as the TM-valued one-form Œ∏ on M corresponding to the identity endomorphism of the tangent bundle under the duality isomorphism . Then the torsion 2-form is a section :Thetaintext{Hom}left({textstylebigwedge}^2 {rm T}M, {rm T}Mright) given by :Theta = Dtheta , where D is the exterior covariant derivative. (See connection form for further details.) =Irreducible decomposition= The torsion tensor can be decomposed into two irreducible parts: a trace-free part and another part which contains the trace terms. Using the index notation, the trace of T is given by :a_i = T^k{}_{ik} , and the trace-free part is :B^i{}_{jk} = T^i{}_{jk} + frac{1}{n-1}delta^i{}_ja_k-frac{1}{n-1}delta^i{}_ka_j , where Œ¥ij is the Kronecker delta. Intrinsically, one has :Tin operatorname{Hom}left({textstylebigwedge}^2 {rm T}M, {rm T}Mright). The trace of T, tr T, is an element of T‚àóM defined as follows. For each vector fixed , T defines an element T(X) of via :T(X) : Y mapsto T(X wedge Y). Then (tr T)(X) is defined as the trace of this endomorphism. That is, :(operatorname{tr}, T)(X) stackrel{text{def}}{=}operatorname{tr} (T(X)). The trace-free part of T is then :T_0 = T - frac{1}{n-1}iota(operatorname{tr} ,T) , where Œπ denotes the interior product. Curvature and the Bianchi identities The curvature tensor of ‚àá is a mapping defined on vector fields X, Y, and Z by :R(X, Y)Z = abla_X abla_YZ - abla_Y abla_XZ - abla_{[X, Y]}Z. For vectors at a point, this definition is independent of how the vectors are extended to vector fields away from the point (thus it defines a tensor, much like the torsion). The Bianchi identities relate the curvature and torsion as follows. Let mathfrak{S} denote the cyclic sum over X, Y, and Z. For instance, :mathfrak{S}left(Rleft(X, Yright)Zright) := R(X, Y)Z + R(Y, Z)X + R(Z, X)Y. Then the following identities hold # Bianchi's first identity: #: mathfrak{S}left(Rleft(X, Yright)Zright) = mathfrak{S}left(Tleft(T(X, Y), Zright) + left( abla_XTright)left(Y, Zright)right) # Bianchi's second identity: #: mathfrak{S}left(left( abla_XRright)left(Y, Zright) + Rleft(Tleft(X, Yright), Zright)right) = 0 =The curvature form and Bianchi identities= The curvature form is the gl(n)-valued 2-form :Omega = Domega = domega + omega wedge omega where, again, D denotes the exterior covariant derivative. In terms of the curvature form and torsion form, the corresponding Bianchi identities are # DTheta = Omega wedge theta # DOmega = 0. Moreover, one can recover the curvature and torsion tensors from the curvature and torsion forms as follows. At a point u of FxM, one has :begin{align} R(X, Y)Z &= uleft(2Omegaleft(pi^{-1}(X), pi^{-1}(Y)right)right)left(u^{-1}(Z)right),  T(X, Y) &= uleft(2Thetaleft(pi^{-1}(X), pi^{-1}(Y)right)right), end{align} where again is the function specifying the frame in the fibre, and the choice of lift of the vectors via œÄ‚àí1 is irrelevant since the curvature and torsion forms are horizontal (they vanish on the ambiguous vertical vectors). Characterizations and interpretations Throughout this section, M is assumed to be a differentiable manifold, and ‚àá a covariant derivative on the tangent bundle of M unless otherwise noted. =Twisting of reference frames= In the classical differential geometry of curves, the Frenet-Serret formulas describe how a particular moving frame (the Frenet-Serret frame) twists along a curve. In physical terms, the torsion corresponds to the angular momentum of an idealized top pointing along the tangent of the curve. The case of a manifold with a (metric) connection admits an analogous interpretation. Suppose that an observer is moving along a geodesic for the connection. Such an observer is ordinarily thought of as inertial since they experience no acceleration. Suppose that in addition the observer carries with themselves a system of rigid straight measuring rods (a coordinate system). Each rod is a straight segment; a geodesic. Assume that each rod is parallel transported along the trajectory. The fact that these rods are physically carried along the trajectory means that they are Lie-dragged, or propagated so that the Lie derivative of each rod along the tangent vanishes. They may, however, experience torque (or torsional forces) analogous to the torque felt by the top in the Frenet-Serret frame. This force is measured by the torsion. More precisely, suppose that the observer moves along a geodesic path Œ≥(t) and carries a measuring rod along it. The rod sweeps out a surface as the observer travels along the path. There are natural coordinates along this surface, where t is the parameter time taken by the observer, and x is the position along the measuring rod. The condition that the tangent of the rod should be parallel translated along the curve is :left. abla_frac{partial}{partial t}frac{partial}{partial x}right_{x=0} = 0. Consequently, the torsion is given by :left.Tleft(frac{partial}{partial x},frac{partial}{partial t}right)right_{x=0} = left. abla_{frac{partial}{partial x}}frac{partial}{partial t}right_{x=0}. If this is not zero, then the marked points on the rod (the curves) will trace out helices instead of geodesics. They will tend to rotate around the observer. Note that for this argument it was not essential that gamma(t) is a geodesic. Any curve would work. This interpretation of torsion plays a role in the theory of teleparallelism, also known as Einstein‚ÄìCartan theory, an alternative formulation of relativity theory. =The torsion of a filament= In materials science, and especially elasticity theory, ideas of torsion also play an important role. One problem models the growth of vines, focusing on the question of how vines manage to twist around objects. The vine itself is modeled as a pair of elastic filaments twisted around one another. In its energy-minimizing state, the vine naturally grows in the shape of a helix. But the vine may also be stretched out to maximize its extent (or length). In this case, the torsion of the vine is related to the torsion of the pair of filaments (or equivalently the surface torsion of the ribbon connecting the filaments), and it reflects the difference between the length-maximizing (geodesic) configuration of the vine and its energy-minimizing configuration. =Torsion and vorticity= In fluid dynamics, torsion is naturally associated to vortex lines. Geodesics and the absorption of torsion Suppose that Œ≥(t) is a curve on M. Then Œ≥ is an affinely parametrized geodesic provided that : abla_{dot{gamma}(t)}dot{gamma}(t) = 0 for all time t in the domain of Œ≥. (Here the dot denotes differentiation with respect to t, which associates with Œ≥ the tangent vector pointing along it.) Each geodesic is uniquely determined by its initial tangent vector at time , dot{gamma}(0). One application of the torsion of a connection involves the geodesic spray of the connection: roughly the family of all affinely parametrized geodesics. Torsion is the ambiguity of classifying connections in terms of their geodesic sprays: * Two connections ‚àá and ‚àá‚Ä≤ which have the same affinely parametrized geodesics (i.e., the same geodesic spray) differ only by torsion.See Spivak (1999) Volume II, Addendum 1 to Chapter 6. See also Bishop and Goldberg (1980), section 5.10. More precisely, if X and Y are a pair of tangent vectors at , then let :Delta(X,Y)= abla_Xtilde{Y}- abla'_Xtilde{Y} be the difference of the two connections, calculated in terms of arbitrary extensions of X and Y away from p. By the Leibniz product rule, one sees that Œî does not actually depend on how X and Y are extended (so it defines a tensor on M). Let S and A be the symmetric and alternating parts of Œî: :S(X,Y)=tfrac12left(Delta(X,Y)+Delta(Y,X)right) :A(X,Y)=tfrac12left(Delta(X,Y)-Delta(Y,X)right) Then * A(X,Y) = tfrac12left(T(X,Y) - T'(X,Y)right) is the difference of the torsion tensors. * ‚àá and ‚àá‚Ä≤ define the same families of affinely parametrized geodesics if and only if . In other words, the symmetric part of the difference of two connections determines whether they have the same parametrized geodesics, whereas the skew part of the difference is determined by the relative torsions of the two connections. Another consequence is: * Given any affine connection ‚àá, there is a unique torsion-free connection ‚àá‚Ä≤ with the same family of affinely parametrized geodesics. The difference between these two connections is in fact a tensor, the contorsion tensor. This is a generalization of the fundamental theorem of Riemannian geometry to general affine (possibly non-metric) connections. Picking out the unique torsion-free connection subordinate to a family of parametrized geodesics is known as absorption of torsion, and it is one of the stages of Cartan's equivalence method.

History The Dennis Dragon was named \\"Dragon\\" because they were designed for Kowloon Motor Bus. In Chinese, Kowloon means \\"nine dragons\\" and it is an area in Hong Kong, so the name \\"Condor\\" was adopted for China Motor Bus' \\"Dragons\\" to avoid \\"naming for an opponent company\\". All were built for the overseas market, although some were later repatriated.Dennis Dragon Bus Fleet Lists on the Web Dennis had registered the Condor name in the 1950s for a lightweight haulage chassis. Design Dennis Dragon 9.9m (also known as the Baby Dragon) in Kwun Tong in October 2006 The Dennis Dragon/Condor chassis was developed from 2-axle Dennis Dominator, with two separate wheels fitted in front of the rear axle (auxiliary axle was fitted since 1986). It was fitted with both Gardner or Cummins engines coupled to a Voith or ZF gearbox. The Cummins engine was initially available as an option, but it gradually replaced the Gardner engine as standard All Dennis Dragons/Condors, except four out of five prototypes, were fitted with Duple Metsec bodywork. In Hong Kong, this made Dennis Dragon/Condor easy to differentiate because most of the other bus models at the same period (such as Leyland Olympian, Volvo Olympian, Scania N113, etc.) were bodied with Alexander bodywork. Hong Kong =Kowloon Motor Bus= In 1982, Kowloon Motor Bus (KMB) purchased three 12 m non air- conditioned Dennis Dragons with Alexander bodywork for evaluation. KMB purchased 188 Duple Metsec bodied 12 metre Dennis Dragons. These had three doors (one for boarding and two for alighting). Between 1986 and 1994, KMB purchased the first of 370 11-metre non air-conditioned Dennis Dragons for the bus services of New Territories. Fifty had a closed back, which was originally reserved for installation of air-conditioning, but this was never fitted. All the non air-conditioned Dennis Dragons were withdrawn in 2012. In 1990, KMB purchased an 11-metre air-conditioned Dennis Dragon for testing. In following years up to 1999, KMB introduced totally 765 air-conditioned Dennis Dragons, including 235 9.9 metre buses, 360 11 metre buses and 170 12 metre buses.\\"Hong Kong Buses Part 3: Kowloon Motor Bus\\" Fleetline issue 249 page July 1997 page 116 All the air-conditioned Dennis Dragons were withdrawn by July 2017, after that all KMB buses were of low-floor specification. =China Motor Bus= New World First Bus Duple Metsec bodied Condor in August 2008 In 1982, China Motor Bus received two 12 metre non air-conditioned Dennis Condors for evaluation, one of them was fitted with Duple Metsec bodywork, and the other one with Alexander bodywork. Because of the opening of MTR's Island Line in the 1980s, CMB didn't buy many Dennis Condors. Between 1989 and 1997, CMB bought only 46 12m non air-conditioned Condors, 28 11 metre non air-conditioned Condors and 92 11 metre air-conditioned Condors. It is rumoured that CMB's last ten air- conditioned Condors were bought due to unpredictable delivery time of the Dennis Trident 3s ordered. All the CMB's Dennis Condors were sold to New World First Bus when CMB lost its franchise in 1998, three of the 12 m Condors were subsequently converted to training buses. In 1999, NWFB converted one 11 metre Dennis Condor to an open-top bus (DM6), it was superseded by an air- conditioned Dennis Condor on 25 January 2008 and was withdrawn again on 29 September 2014 (DA66). The DLs were retired earlier by October 2000 and was sold out. DL1 & DL2 were sold to private preservationists in Hong Kong. Some of them were shipped back to the UK and converted to an open-top bus in 2002 for the Big Bus Company.The Big Bus Company Open Bus Tours The DMs were retired by August 2002 and sold out, with an 11 m non air-conditioned Dennis Condor (fleet number DM28) regarded by NWFB as its last \\"hot dog\\" (\\"hot dog\\" is a nickname non air-conditioned buses in Hong Kong). DM18 and DM22 has been under New World First Travel (as open-top buses, later sold to Citybus and were withdrawn on 11 February 2014). DM9, DM12 and DM25 has been sold to Citybus as training buses, while DM17 was sold to 3 preservationists in the UK. The DAs were also retired beginning January 2004 for the 22 buses, followed by 38 buses until 2012. All the remaining buses have been retired at 2 September 2015. =Citybus= Citybus's Dragon assembled Duple Metsec body but adopted Alexander R-Type front design Citybus started to order air- conditioned Dennis Dragon in 1993. The Duple Metsec bodywork for Citybus's Dragons, which were assembled by Salvador Caetano in Portugal, were different from those supplied to KMB/CMB in that the frontal design resembled with those used on Alexander R-type body and a wider front door was used. Between 1994 and 1998, Citybus introduced 80 12m Dennis Dragons and 40 10.3m Dennis Dragons.\\"Hong Kong Buses Part 2: Citybus Limited\\" Fleetline issue 248 May 1997 page 94 In 2000, Citybus rebuilt a 10.3 m Dragon (fleet number 701) as the world's first 3-axle double-decker air-conditioned trolleybus. One of Citybus's 10.3 m Dennis Dragon (fleet number 713) had been prematurely withdrawn in 2002 due to fire damage. All of the Citybus Dennis Dragons were withdrawn in 2015. =HACTL= In early 1996, Hong Kong Air Cargo Terminals Limited (HACTL) received four Dennis Dragons for use as staff buses. They were similar with Citybus's 12-metre Dragon in appearance but with no route indicators and narrower seats were fitted so as to increase the seating capacity. All these buses were acquired by New World First Bus after HACTL ceased to operate its staff bus routes in September 1999. They re-entered service in 2000. Africa Magic Bus Duple Metsec bodied Dragon in Manchester in March 2008 In 1992, Stagecoach introduced ten Dennis Dragons in Malawi. The company also introduced twenty Dennis Dragons in Kenya between 1995 and 1996. Later, all the Dennis Dragons in Kenya were shipped back to England and allocated to Stagecoach Manchester's Magic Bus fleet. They re-entered service between 1998 and 2000 where they would stay in service with the company until 2010.

He started his career with AGF, before moving to Br√∏ndby, and afterwards abroad to play for Italian club Ancona and Norwegian side Stab√¶k. He earned one cap for the Danish national team.Interview with Bold He is the younger brother of former Danish national team player Martin J√∏rgensen. Career Born in Ryomg√•rd, J√∏rgensen started his career at local club AGF in the top-flight Danish Superliga championship. He was selected for the Danish under-19 national team in September 1996, and signed a three-year contract with AGF in September 1997. He made his senior debut for AGF in March 1998 and made almost 100 league appearances for the club. When his contract ran out in the summer 2001, he left AGF on a free transfer. With his older brother Martin J√∏rgensen playing for Italian club Udinese, Mads J√∏rgensen was reportedly on his way to a number of Italian clubs, and he was dubbed \\"J√∏rgensen Jr.\\" by the Italian sports press. Mads J√∏rgensen decided to stay in Denmark, moving to league rivals Br√∏ndby IF. Despite his status as a free agent, he demanded that Br√∏ndby pay AGF DKK 1 million in compensation, before signing a two-year contract in June 2001. His first time at Br√∏ndby was a success, as he scored 10 goals in his first season and helped the club win the 2001‚Äì02 Danish Superliga. Having played 15 matches and scored one goal for the Danish under-21 national team since December 1998, he made his debut for the senior Danish national team against Iceland in October 2001. Scoring the last goal of the 2003 Danish Cup final, he helped Br√∏ndby win 3‚Äì0 against FC Midtjylland and secure the Danish Cup trophy. In the summer f 2003, J√∏rgensen's contract with Br√∏ndby expired, making him a free agent. In July 2003, J√∏rgensen moved to Ancona in the Italian Serie A, but his stay was short. Br√∏ndby manager Per Bjerregaard initially refused to let J√∏rgensen play until Ancona paid a DKK 1 million compensation. When cleared to play, injuries ruined his stay at the club. J√∏rgensen never made any appearances for Ancona, before moving to Stab√¶k Fotball in the Norwegian Premier League in the spring of 2004. At Stab√¶k, J√∏rgensen looked to replace Norwegian international midfielder Martin Andresen, and he scored two goals in his debut match; a 3‚Äì1 win against Sogndal. As Stab√¶k suffered relegation to Adeccoligaen at the end of the season, J√∏rgensen looked to leave the club. He returned to Br√∏ndby IF in March 2005. Playing the last half of the 2004‚Äì05 season, he helped the club complete the Double in 2005, winning both Superliga and Danish Cup titles that year. J√∏rgensen suffered a string of injuries from the start of the 2005‚Äì06 season, leaving him with little playing time. He moved back to childhood club AGF in 2007. In June 2008, he ended his professional career due to persistent injuries. Mads J√∏rgensen has a cult following with fans of the football management series Championship Manager, particularly 99/00 edition, in which he has particularly outstanding attributes and is one of the games best bargains.

In numerical analysis, given a square grid in one or two dimensions, the five-point stencil of a point in the grid is a stencil made up of the point itself together with its four \\"neighbors\\". It is used to write finite difference approximations to derivatives at grid points. It is an example for numerical differentiation.  In one dimension  In one dimension, if the spacing between points in the grid is h, then the five-point stencil of a point x in the grid is : {x-2h, x-h, x, x+h, x+2h}. = 1D first derivative= The first derivative of a function ∆í of a real variable at a point x can be approximated using a five-point stencil as: :f'(x) approx frac{-f(x+2 h)+8 f(x+h)-8 f(x-h)+f(x-2h)}{12 h} Notice that the center point ∆í(x) itself is not involved, only the four neighboring points.  Derivation  This formula can be obtained by writing out the four Taylor series of ∆í(x ¬± h) and ∆í(x ¬± 2h) up to terms of h 3 (or up to terms of h 5 to get an error estimation as well) and solving this system of four equations to get ∆í ‚Ä≤(x). Actually, we have at points x + h and x ‚àí h: :f(x pm h) = f(x) pm h f'(x) + frac{h^2}{2}f(x) pm frac{h^3}{6} f^{(3)}(x) + O_{1pm}(h^4). qquad (E_{1pm}). Evaluating (E_{1+})-(E_{1-}) gives us :f(x+h) - f(x-h) = 2hf'(x) + frac{h^3}{3}f^{(3)}(x) + O_1(h^4). qquad (E_1). Note that the residual term O1(h 4) should be of the order of h 5 instead of h 4 because if the terms of h 4 had been written out in (E 1+) and (E 1‚àí), it can be seen that they would have canceled each other out by ∆í(x + h) ‚àí ∆í(x ‚àí h). But for this calculation, it is left like that since the order of error estimation is not treated here (cf below). Similarly, we have :f(x pm 2h) = f(x) pm 2h f'(x) + frac{4h^2}{2!} f(x) pm frac{8h^3}{3!} f^{(3)}(x) + O_{2pm}(h^4). qquad (E_{2pm}) and (E_{2+})-(E_{2-}) gives us :f(x+2h) - f(x-2h) = 4hf'(x) + frac{8h^3}{3}f^{(3)}(x) + O_2(h^4). qquad (E_2). In order to eliminate the terms of ∆í (3)(x), calculate 8 √ó (E1) ‚àí (E2) :8f(x+h) - 8f(x-h) - f(x+2h) + f(x-2h) = 12h f'(x) + O(h^4) , thus giving the formula as above. Note: the coefficients of f in this formula, (8, -8,-1,1), represent a specific example of the more general Savitzky-Golay filter.  Error estimate  The error in this approximation is of order h 4. That can be seen from the expansion : frac{-f(x+2 h)+8 f(x+h)-8 f(x-h)+f(x-2h)}{12 h}=f'(x)-frac{1}{30} f^{(5)}(x) h^4+O(h^5) Abramowitz & Stegun, Table 25.2 which can be obtained by expanding the left-hand side in a Taylor series. Alternatively, apply Richardson extrapolation to the central difference approximation to f'(x) on grids with spacing 2h and h. = 1D higher-order derivatives = The centered difference formulas for five-point stencils approximating second, third, and fourth derivatives are : f(x) approx frac{-f(x+2 h)+16 f(x+h)-30 f(x) + 16 f(x-h) - f(x-2h)}{12 h^2} : f^{(3)}(x) approx frac{f(x+2 h)-2 f(x+h) + 2 f(x-h) - f(x-2h)}{2 h^3} : f^{(4)}(x) approx frac{f(x+2 h)-4 f(x+h)+6 f(x) - 4 f(x-h) + f(x-2h)}{h^4} The errors in these approximations are O(h 4), O(h 2) and O(h 2) respectively. = Relationship to Lagrange interpolating polynomials = As an alternative to deriving the finite difference weights from the Taylor series, they may be obtained by differentiating the Lagrange polynomials :ell_j(xi) = prod_{i=0,, i eq j}^{k} frac{xi-x_i}{x_j-x_i}, where the interpolation points are : x_0=x-2h,quad x_1=x-h,quad x_2=x,quad x_3=x+h,quad x_4=x+2h. Then, the quartic polynomial p_4(x) interpolating ∆í(x) at these five points is : p_4(x) = sumlimits_{j=0}^4 f(x_j) ell_j(x) and its derivative is : p_4'(x) = sumlimits_{j=0}^4 f(x_j) ell'_j(x). So, the finite difference approximation of ∆í ‚Ä≤(x) at the middle point x = x2 is : f'(x_2) = ell_0'(x_2) f(x_0) + ell_1'(x_2) f(x_1) + ell_2'(x_2) f(x_2) + ell_3'(x_2) f(x_3) + ell_4'(x_2) f(x_4) + O(h^4) Evaluating the derivatives of the five Lagrange polynomials at x=x2 gives the same weights as above. This method can be more flexible as the extension to a non-uniform grid is quite straightforward.  In two dimensions  In two dimensions, if for example the size of the squares in the grid is h by h, the five point stencil of a point (x, y) in the grid is :{(x-h, y), (x, y), (x+h, y), (x, y-h), (x, y+h)}, , forming a pattern that is also called a quincunx. This stencil is often used to approximate the Laplacian of a function of two variables: : abla^2 f(x,y) approx frac{f(x-h,y) + f(x+h,y) + f(x,y-h) + f(x,y+h) - 4f(x,y)}{h^2}. The error in this approximation is O(h 2),Abramowitz & Stegun, 25.3.30 which may be explained as follows: From the 3 point stencils for the second derivative of a function with respect to x and y: begin{array} {l} frac{partial ^2 f}{partial x^2}= frac{fleft(x + Delta x,yright) + fleft(x - Delta x,yright) - 2f(x,y)}{Delta x^2} - 2frac{f^{(4)}(x,y)}{4!}Delta x^2 + cdots end{array} begin{array} {l} frac{partial ^2 f}{partial y^2}= frac{fleft(x, y + Delta yright) + fleft(x, y - Delta yright) - 2f(x,y)}{Delta y^2} - 2frac{f^{(4)}(x,y)}{4!}Delta y^2 + cdots end{array} If we assume Delta x=Delta y=h: begin{array} {ll} abla^2 f &= frac{partial ^2 f}{partial x^2}+frac{partial ^2 f}{partial y^2} &= frac{fleft(x + h,yright) + fleft(x - h,yright) + fleft(x, y + hright) + fleft(x, y - hright) - 4f(x,y)}{h^2} - 4frac{f^{(4)}(x,y)}{4!}h^2 + cdots &= frac{fleft(x + h,yright) + fleft(x - h,yright) + fleft(x, y + hright) + fleft(x, y - hright) - 4f(x,y)}{h^2} + Oleft(h^2right) end{array} See also * Stencil jumping * Finite difference coefficients  References  * .

A small infantry patrol, led by Captain Jean Danjou and Lieutenants Cl√©ment Maudet and Jean Vilain, numbering just 65 men was attacked and besieged by a force that may have eventually reached 3,000 Mexican infantry and cavalry, and was forced to make a defensive stand at the nearby Hacienda Camar√≥n, in Camar√≥n de Tejeda, Veracruz, Mexico. The conduct of the Legion, who refused to surrender, led to a certain mystique, and the battle of Camar√≥n became synonymous with bravery and a fight-to-the-death attitude. Background As part of the Second French intervention in Mexico, a French army commanded by the General Forey was besieging the Mexican city of Puebla.Ryan, James W., 1996, Camerone, The French Foreign Legion's Greatest Battle, Westport: Praeger Publishers, The Legion's 1st and 2nd Battalions, under the command of Col. Pierre Jeanningros, had arrived in Veracruz on 26 March. The 2nd Battalion, under the command of Maj. Munier, was assigned to protect the road from Tejeria to Soledad, while the 1st Battalion protected the road onwards to Chiquihuite. In support of the siege, the French sent a convoy, under the command of Capt. Jacques Cabossel, with 3 million francs in gold bullion, siege guns, and sixty wagons of ammunition. Two companies of fusiliers were to escort the convoy from La Soledad to Chiquihuite. However, Jeanningros sent the 3rd company of the 1st Battalion to reinforce the convoy guard when Indian spies told him the Mexicans would ambush the convoy. As the company had no officers, Captain Jean Danjou, adjutant major of the 1st Battalion, volunteered to command. Sous- Lieutenants (2nd Lts.) Napoleon Vilain and Clement Maudet soon volunteered to join him. Six miles northeast of Camar√≥n, was La Joya, headquarters of Col. Francisco de Paula Mil√°n's Center Brigade, consisting of National Guard troops from Cordoba, Xalapa, Coscomatepec de Bravo and Veracruz, plus dragoons and lancers. The battle On 30 April, at 01:00, the 3rd company of 62 Legionnaires and three Legion officers was en route from Chiquihuite for Palo Verde, 6 hours and 22 miles away. At 05:45, they reached Camerone and the La Trinidad Hacienda, its 50 meter long walls forming a square, enclosing a two- story ranch house on the north and an open stable on the south, long ago abandoned. They reached Palo Verde as planned by 07:00, and proceeded to prepare their morning coffee. Coffee was interrupted by the sighting around 08:00 of Mexican cavalry, Capt. Tomas Algonzanas' Cotaxtla Squadron of 250 rancheros, to the north heading to the southeast, but they continued southward, passing the road a half mile away. Seeking a more defensible position, Danjou moved his men back west, along the forest north of the road, to the hacienda's ten foot walls. Mil√°n, meanwhile, decided that he must eliminate Danjou's men before they could discover the size of Mil√°n's forces and their planned ambush of the convoy. Mil√°n sent his dragoon squadron and four infantry battalions to join Algonzana's lancers. Danjou's plan was to draw the Mexican forces away from the convoy. The Legionnaires reached the hacienda by 09:00. Danjou decided to proceed west on the road towards Paseo del Macho but had proceeded only a short distance before discovering Algonzana's cavalrymen north of the road, and Danjou ordered his men to form a hollow square. Charging in two columns, the Mexicans \\"were stopped short\\" by salvos and then withdrew, allowing the 3rd to withdraw to the cactus-filled ditch on the south side of the road and make their way back to the hacienda. However, on the way, sixteen of Danjou's men were captured, and Danjou faced another Mexican cavalry charge sweeping around the south side of the hacienda. The second charge was again met by rifle fire from Danjou's square, forcing the Mexicans to ride away. Upon reaching the hacienda, the Legionnaires were surprised to discover Mexicans occupying the ranch house. Mil√°n arrived with the dragoons at about the same time the bullion convoy headed back to La Soledad, after being warned of the 3rd's difficulties. Seeing that he was totally surrounded, Capt. Danjou \\"urged his men to take an oath to fight to the death rather than surrender... he made them swear their fealty on his wooden hand. Danjou then shared his bottle of wine and encouraged his men with \\"those noble words that warm one's heart and makes the final sacrifice less difficult to face.\\" Captain Danjou's prosthetic hand is now the Legion's most venerated relic Mil√°n sent Capt. Ramon Laine to negotiate a surrender, who explained to Danjou, \\"you will be needlessly slaughtered.\\" Danjou replied that he \\"had plenty of ammunition and shall continue to fight.\\" At about 11:00, the Mexicans charged the gateways on the west end of the hacienda, and the breach on the south. Though the attack was held off, Danjou was hit in the chest and soon died. Lieutenant Vilain assumed command. Casualties mounted on both sides, but amongst the Legionnaires, \\"water and food, the two most required necessities, were not to be found. Thirst, heat exhaustion, and sunstroke had replaced them.\\" Their mules had run off after the first encounter with the Mexican cavalry, and then Col. Mil√°n's Center Brigade infantry, 1200-1400 men, arrived at the hacienda. When Capt. Laine offered the legionnaires a second chance to surrender, Sergeant Vincent Morzycki responded in the spirit of Pierre Cambronne, with \\"Merde.\\" After four hours of fighting, thirty-two Legionnaires remained fighting. By 14:00, only twenty could still fight. At 14:30, Lt. Vilain was struck dead and Lieutenant Maudet took command. By 17:00, the roof of the ranch house had been burned away, the Legionnaires were down to twelve men, and Col. Milan ordered his men out of the hacienda, and offered the Legionnaires a third chance to surrender. In the next onslaught, Corporals Everiste Burg, Karl Magnin and Heinrich Pinzinger, plus fusiliers Leon Gorski and Hippolyte Kunnasseg were captured. By 17:30, only Lt. Maudet's men remained in the stable. By 18:00, with ammunition exhausted, the last of Danjou's men, numbering only five, including Lt. Maudet, desperately mounted a bayonet charge. Two men fell outright, and the rest were surrounded. One of them, Victor Catteau, had leapt in front of Maudet in an effort to protect him, and died in the Mexican barrage. Major Campos ordered the Legionnaires to surrender to which Corporal Phillipe Maine answered, \\"We will surrender if you leave us our weapons and our equipment. You also have to promise to take care of our wounded lieutenant.\\" When Campos brought the trio to Mil√°n, he asked, \\"Is this all of them? Is this all of the men who are left?\\" Then, in amazement, he exclaimed, \\"These are not men! They are demons!\\" Aftermath Each year, the French Foreign Legion commemorates and celebrates Camar√≥n in its headquarters in Aubagne and Bastille Day military parade in Paris; featuring the Pionniers leading and opening the way. As promised, Lt. Maudet was treated on the battlefield by Dr. Francisco Talavera, also the major commanding the Cordoba unit, before succumbing to his wounds on 8 May. Drummer Lai was left for dead, but found by Jeanningros on 1 May. Seventeen legionnaires were taken prisoner to La Joya. Most were freed in a prisoner exchange on 14 July 1863. Legacy When the Legion moved to France, Capitain Danjou's wooden hand was taken to Aubagne, where it remains in the Legion Museum of Memory. The hand is the most cherished artifact in Legion history and the prestige and honor granted to a Legionnaire to carry it on parade in its protective case is among the greatest bestowed on a Legionnaire. 30 April is celebrated as \\"Camerone Day,\\" an important day for the Legionnaires, when the wooden prosthetic hand of Capitaine Danjou is brought out for display. In 1892, a monument commemorating the battle was erected on the battlefield containing a plaque with the following inscription in French: > Ils furent ici moins de soixante > Oppos√©s a toute une arm√©e > Sa masse les √©crasa > La vie plut√¥t que le courage > Abandonna ces soldats Fran√ßais > Le 30 Avril 1863 > A leur m√©moire la patrie √©leva ce monument > (English: \\"Here there were less than sixty opposed to a whole army. Its > numbers crushed them. Life rather than courage abandoned these French > soldiers on April 30, 1863. In their memory, the fatherland has erected this > monument\\") The railing from the Legion grave at Camarone can now be found at the village of Puyloubier near Aix-en-Provence. The site of the battle can be visited at the village of Camar√≥n de Tejeda, in the state of Veracruz, Mexico. This village was formerly known as El Camar√≥n, and later as Adalberto Tejeda, Villa Tejeda or Camar√≥n de Tejeda. In the village is a monument erected by the Mexican government in 1964, honoring the Mexican soldiers who fought in the battle. There is also a memorial site and parade ground on the outskirts of the village. The memorial has a raised platform, which covers the resting place of the remains of French and Mexican soldiers disinterred in the 1960s. The surface of the platform has a plaque in Latin. Diligent search of the area has failed to locate the plaque with the oft-quoted 1892 French-language inscription referred to above. Every year, on 30 April, the Mexican government holds annual ceremonies at the memorial site, with political speakers and a parade of various Mexican military units. The village holds a fiesta on the same day. The ceremonies are sometimes attended by representatives of the French military, and the site is also visited by retired veterans of the French Foreign Legion. It is also tradition that any Mexican soldiers passing by the area turn towards the monument and offer a salute. The village of Adalberto Tejeda (also known as Villa Tejeda, Camar√≥n de Tejeda, or simply El Camar√≥n) is located on secondary roads about 25 to 30 km west of the town of Soledad de Doblado, Veracruz, and about 64 km. west of the city of Veracruz. The 1964 monument is in the center of town. The memorial and parade ground, known as El Mausoleo (the Mausoleum), is a few blocks away on the edge of the village, near the town cemetery. The co-ordinates of the village of Adalberto Tejeda are lat. 19.0216, long. -96.6154. \\"To this day, the battle of Camerone is hailed as an exemplary example of 'Fidelity to the Mission', which came to form the central myth of the Legion.\\" The 1st Foreign Regiment has the Mexican eagle on its unit badge, and the \\"Camerone\\" battle streamer sits on top of their standard. The names of Danjou, Vilain and Maudet are on a plaque on the second-floor wall in the Court of Honor at Les Invalides. The battle is the centre-piece of Ian Colquhoun's 2014 English-language historical novel Le Boudin - The Demons of Camerone.

They were excellent steamers and proved successful and seaworthy over a quarter century of service. All three achieved on trials and could easily maintain in service. Twenty-year-old Duguay-Trouin could still maintain at her post-war displacement of 10,900 tons.le Masson, pp. 89‚Äì90 They were fast and economical, although with a limited range.Whitley, pp. 27‚Äì29 The fate of these three ships after the French surrender illustrates the dichotomy within the French armed forces at the time: one ship was interned, then joined the Free French, another twice resisted Allied bombardment and was destroyed, and the third was disarmed at a French colonial port and subsequently sunk. Design The design of this class was the result of a protracted process that had started in mid-1919, with the Italians as likely adversaries. A detailed design (Project 171) had been completed by the end of 1919, but there were significant reservations within the Navy and the Chief of the General Staff withdrew them in February 1920. While discussion continued, there were opportunities to compare with newly commissioned cruisers of other navies. The foreign designs were indeed superior, particularly armament. At the end of 1920, after having examined copies of the plans for the U.S. , four designs had been drafted. All four used hulls based on the Omahas, with eight newly designed and four anti- aircraft guns and twelve torpedo tubes. The differences lay in the combinations of power and protection. Design C was selected and detailed work started. The new class would achieve , using oil firing and single-reduction geared turbines. The main armament would be a new breech-loading M1920 gun of 155 mm calibre with a range of . The calibre was selected to use the same 155 mm shells manufactured for the Army. In action, this weapon proved to be slow to operate. The 75 mm anti-aircraft battery was of the M1922 type. The ships were lightly armored with barely splinter-proof gun shields, but extensive watertight subdivision included sixteen transverse bulkheads, with a double hull around the engineering spaces. Orders were placed during 1922 on this basis, despite determined efforts to \\"improve\\" the design. After completion, single catapults were installed on the quarter-decks of each ship, initially with two Gourdou-Leseurre GL-812 HY flying-boats, later the GL-832. Duguay- Trouin and Primauguet were subsequently equipped with a single Loire 130 in the 1930s. Ships in class =Duguay-Trouin= was completed 2 November 1926 and served briefly in French Indochina in 1931. She patrolled the Atlantic for German shipping and commerce raiders following declaration of World War II hostilities. She patrolled the Mediterranean Sea from May 1940, and was at Alexandria with Force X when France surrendered. The ship was demilitarized at Alexandria for three years until refitted beginning in August 1943 by removal of torpedo tubes and augmentation of anti-aircraft armament by fifteen Oerlikon 20 mm cannon and six 13.2 mm Hotchkiss machine guns. Anti- aircraft armament was modified in 1944 to twenty 20 mm and six Bofors 40 mm guns, when radar was also added. Duguay-Trouin returned to the Mediterranean to support Operation Dragoon and Flank Force bombardment of German positions in Italy.Auphan & Mordal, pp. 332, 347 She returned to French Indochina for post-war operations against the Viet Minh until scrapped 29 March 1952. =Lamotte-Picquet= was completed 5 March 1927 and deployed to French Indochina in 1935.

Culture  St. Wolfgang's tourist attractions include the Schafbergbahn (a rack railway that runs up the Schafberg), the Hotel Wei√ües R√∂ssl (the setting of the operetta White Horse Inn) and a pilgrimage church with a late Gothic altarpiece by Michael Pacher. The railway and the church are among the many St. Wolfgang locations featured in Christmas with Flicka, a 1987 American- Austrian television film starring the operatic mezzo-soprano Frederica von Stade, which was shot entirely in the town and its environs.

Buildings in the town centre History Saint Wolfgang erected the first church at the shore of the Wolfgangsee after he withdrew to the nearby Mondsee Abbey in 976. According to legend he threw an axe down the mountain to find the site and even persuaded the Devil to contribute to the building by promising him the soul of the first living being ever to enter the church. However Satan was disappointed as the first creature over the doorstep was a wolf. After Wolfgang's canonization in 1052, the church became a major pilgrimage site, as it was first mentioned in an 1183 deed by Pope Lucius III. In 1481 it was furnished with the famous Pacher polyptych. There had been several places for lodging around the church since medieval times, while the Wei√ües R√∂ssl hotel was not built until 1878.

These septs in turn are descendants of the O'Regan noble family. It is in these counties that the majority of descendants can still be found. Hundreds of years ago, the Gaelic name used by the Dunn family in Ireland was √ì Duinn or √ì Doinn. Both Gaelic names are derived from the Gaelic word donn, which means \\"brown\\". √ì Doinn is the genitive case of donn. First found in county Meath, where they held a family seat from very ancient times. Variations: Dunn, Dunne, Dun, Duen, O'Dunne, O'Doyne, Doine, Doin, O'Dunn. Dunne Castles The Dunnes formerly owned a number of castles in the midlands of Ireland. Today little remains of most of these castles, many were destroyed during the Cromwellian Invasion of Ireland. =Tinnahinch Castle= The principal seat of the Dunne family was Tinnahinch Castle. Originally known as \\"Baun Riaganach\\", the castle was built by Tadhg MacLaighnigh Ui Duinn in 1475 and was the residence of the chief of the Dunne's. Tinnahinch Castle was located at the Barrow River, one mile south of Tinnahinch bridge. The name Tinnahinch originally means \\"house of the island\\", a tributary stream of the Barrow river surrounding the castle gives it the appearance of an island. Tinnahinch Castle was destroyed by during the Cromwellian Invasion by forces led by Colonel John Hewson in 1653. At the time it was strongly defended by Charles Dunne and it required a full park of artillery from the invading forces to level the castle. After the destruction of Tinnahinch Castle the principal seat of the Dunne family moved to Brittas Castle. Unfortunately there remains nothing of the original castle apart from a wall which may have been part of the original building. =Brittas Castle= After the destruction of Tinnahinch Castle the Dunne Chief built a new home at Brittas, near Clonaslee, County Laois. Originally there was a thatched lodge located there and the O'Duinns built a mansion at his location. In 1869, Major-General Francis Plunkett Dunne built a neo-gothic mansion at this location. The house had extensive gardens and also lake which was originally created as a reservoir. In 1942 the building was burned down in a fire. =Ballinakill Castle= It was a coursed rubble and limestone building built between the River Clodiagh and River Gorragh by the Dunnes on the location of an earlier castle which was destroyed by Cromwellian invasion forces. It was built by Colonel Terence O'Dunne in 1680 who was killed at the Battle of Aughrim and is buried at the graveyard in Killeigh. =Coolnamoney Castle= Teige O'Doyne built the Dunne castle Coolnamoney Lower near the Glenlahan River. Not much is left of the castle today, but some of the original features can be seen in the ruins. =Castlebrack Castle= Castlebrack Castle was built by Tadhg MacLaighnigh Ui Duinn in 1475. It was built to be occupied by the Tanist, which was the name of the position held by the clan's deputy chief. This castle was second in size and importance to Tinnahinch Castle, which was the principal residence of the Dunnes. Terence O'Dunne completed a major refurbishment of the castle in 1688, however by 1838, all that was left of the castle was ruins. =Clarahill Castle= Clarahill Castle was built by a junior/younger branch of the Dunne family. It was built in 1600, and in 1900 it was destroyed for road material. =Ballinahemmy Castle= The Dunnes also built Ballinahemmy Castle near the town of Corrigeen, in County Laois, and its location is marked on the Ordnance Survey map. =Raskeen Castle= Raskeen Castle was built by Donal O'Dunne in 1584 and destroyed in 1691.

It was the official anthem of the First Empire. The song was nicknamed \\"the brother of the Marseillaise\\" by Republican soldiers. The song was first performed on 14 July 1794. 18,000 copies of the music sheets were immediately printed and distributed to the army. Its original title was \\"Anthem to Liberty\\"; it was changed to its present title by Robespierre. The song is a musical tableau: each of the seven stanzas is sung by a different character or group of characters: * The first stanza is the discourse of a deputy cheering his soldiers and encouraging them for the fight for the Republic. * The second stanza is the song of a mother offering the life of her son to the fatherland. * The fourth stanza is sung by children exalting Joseph Agricol Viala and Joseph Bara, children aged 12 and 13, respectively, who had died for France. Surrounded by Vendeans, Bara was ordered to shout \\"Long live Louis XVII\\"; he shouted \\"Long live the Republic\\" instead and was executed on the spot. Viala was killed by a bullet as he was trying to sabotage an enemy bridge. His last words were \\"I die, but I die for the Republic.\\" The song is still in the repertoire of the French Army. It was sung during World War I. Val√©ry Giscard d'Estaing used it as his campaign song for the presidential election of 1974; as a president, he often had it played by troops along with the \\"Marseillaise\\".

A mother of a family Do not fear that our motherly eyes shall weep From us begone, cowardly grief! We shall triumph when you take up arms It is kings who should shed a tear We gave you life Warriors, it is no longer yours All your days belong to the Motherland She is your mother more than we are (Chorus) Two old men May their fathers' blade be placed in the hands of the brave, Remember us on the Field of Mars (on the battlefield) Baptise in the blood of kings and slaves The blade thus blessed by your elders And by bringing back home Both wounds and virtues Return to shut our eyes When tyrants are no more (Chorus) A child The fates of Barra and Viala fill us with envy They died, but they prevailed Cowards crushed by the weight of years never truly knew life He who dies for the People has lived You are brave, so are we Lead us against Tyrants Republicans are men Slaves are children (Chorus) A wife Leave, valiant husbands! Battles are your feasts Leave, models for warriors We shall pick flowers to crown your heads Our hands shall braid laurels And if the temple of memory (death) Should open for your victorious manes Our voices shall sing your glory Our wombs shall bear your avengers (Chorus) A young girl And we, sisters of the heroes, we who of Hymenaios' sweet bonds are still ignorant; If someday to join his fate to ours, The citizens should express the wish, Let them come back within our walls Embellished with glory and liberty, And let their blood, in battle, Have spilled for equality. (Chorus) Three warriors On the iron, before God, we swear to our fathers to our wives, to our sisters to our representatives, to our sons, to our mothers that we shall annihilate oppressors Everywhere, into the deep night by sinking the infamous royalty the French shall give to the world peace and liberty (Chorus) References External links  French anthems Historical national anthems Songs of the French Revolution Compositions by √âtienne M√©hul French patriotic songs 1794 compositions French military marches ","title":"Chant du d√©part"},{"id":"4342732","text":"Francine Tacker (born September 15, 1946) is an American actress known for appearing as Jenna Wade in 2 episodes of the soap opera Dallas in 1980.

Britten (along with co-writer Graham Lyle) won the Grammy Award for Song of the Year in 1985 for \\"What's Love Got to Do with It\\". Career A native of Manchester, Britten began writing for the Adelaide, Australia band The Twilights, a popular 1960s band for which he played lead guitar. At times he co-wrote with Glenn Shorrock and Peter Brideoake. He also recorded a single under his own name, \\"2000 Weeks\\" / \\"Bargain Day\\" (1969). Britten was a band member of Quartet with Kevin Peek, Alan Tarney and Trevor Spencer who recorded one album with Decca Records in the UK, which remains unreleased. One single was issued in 1969 on Decca in the UK and Australia and London in the US: \\"Now\\" / \\"Will My Lady Come\\" (Decca UK-F12974, Aust Y-8977) and a second single in the UK only in 1970 \\"Joseph\\" / \\"Mama Where Did You Fail\\" (Decca F13072, US London LON-1031). After the Twilights broke up, he returned to England and moved to London, where he did session work. Britten's multi-layered guitars featured on Alvin Stardust's 1973 hit \\"My Coo Ca Choo\\". In 1973 he was part of Cliff Richard's Eurovision Song Contest 1973 entry and, along with John Farrar, Alan Tarney and Trevor Spencer, submitted six songs; of which \\"Power to All Our Friends\\" was chosen and came third. After a lean charting period for Cliff Richard, Britten gave him \\"Devil Woman\\" and, in 1976, it became Richard's first top 10 in the UK for three years (and his first top 10 hit in the US). He was a guitarist in Richard's band for many years and was the co- producer and main songwriter for Richard's 1979 album Rock 'n' Roll Juvenile, which reached No. 3 in the UK Album Chart. He wrote and co-wrote with B. A. Robertson 10 of the 12 songs, of which \\"Carrie\\" reached No. 4 in the UK Singles Chart. In the early 1980s, Britten's psychedelic rock song, \\"9.50\\", originally a hit for The Twilights, was revived by Australia's Divinyls as a b-side to their 1984 single, \\"Good Die Young\\". With Graham Lyle, Britten also wrote \\"What's Love Got to Do with It\\",which became Tina Turner's million- selling hit. \\"What's Love Got to Do with It\\" (1984), reached No. 3 in the UK Singles Chart and No. 1 in the US Billboard Hot 100, and won Britten and Lyle the Grammy Award for Song of the Year in 1985. It also won the Grammy Award for Record of the Year which went to Tina Turner. Later that year, they co- wrote \\"We Don't Need Another Hero\\" for the film Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome. Also sung by Tina Turner, the song reached No. 2 in the US and No. 3 in the UK. Britten and Lyle received a Golden Globe Award nomination for Best Original Song in 1986. It also earned Turner a 1986 Grammy nomination for best female pop vocal performance. He also acted as a record producer for Turner. Britten co-wrote \\"Just Good Friends\\" for Michael Jackson's Bad album. Britten has also penned songs for Olivia Newton-John, including \\"Love Make Me Strong\\" (1981) and \\"Toughen Up\\" with Graham Lyle (1985). He has also written for Meat Loaf, Melissa Manchester, Bonnie Raitt, and Hank Marvin. Britten continues to compose from his home base in rural England, but has returned to Australia on occasion, including the Twilights' reunion for the Long Way to the Top concert tour. In 2002, the song \\"Rain, Tax (It's Inevitable)\\", co-written by Britten and Charlie Dore, appeared on Celine Dion's album A New Day Has Come. Britten currently has a home in Richmond, London, and a home recording studio called \\"State of the Ark\\".

Earliest Generations The earliest progenitor of this family was a Martin only known from the charter of his son, Robert, to the monks at Montacute, around 1121, which names his parents, Martin and Geva. Geva is known to have been the daughter and heiress of Serlo de Burci, bringing the lands of her father to her marriage, which included Low Ham, Pylle, and Hornblotton. By her second marriage to William de Falaise, which had occurred by 1086, she was to pass to her son and heir, Robert, additional land in Devonshire. This Robert fitz Martin (\\"son of Martin\\") is the first well-documented member of the family, and from his patronymic subsequent family members used 'fitz Martin' as a surname, independent of the names of their fathers, until in the mid-13th century it became simply Martin. Robert Fitz Martin succeeded to the lands which Serlo de Burci had held in 1086, and also to land held by his stepfather. He was a benefactor to various monasteries, giving land at Compton to Goldcilffe, the church of Blagdon to Stanley in Wiltshire, and the manor of Teignton to Montacute Priory in Somerset. He founded the abbey of St. Dogmael c. 1118. Not later than 1120, Robert Fitz Martin and Maud Peverel, his wife, granted to the abbey of Savigny land at Vengeons (la Manche) which had belonged to William Peverel. In 1134, he joined with other Norman lords in South Wales in resisting the sons of Gruffydd, and witnessed several charters of the Empress Maud, to whom he was adhered. In 1155, Henry II confirmed to him the lands of his grandfather, Serlo de Burci, with all their liberties. Maud predeceased him, and he then married Alice de Nonant, daughter of Roger de Nonant, who survived him and remarried in or before 1175. William Fitz Martin (I) William Fitz Martin, son and heir of Robert and Alice, granted a messuage (dwelling house) and land in the manor of Blagdon to the canons of St. Augustine's in Bristol sometime between 1170 and 1183, and also confirmed to the church of St. Michael a grant of land in Uphill. In 1198 he made an exchange of lands in Combe Martin, Devon, with Warin de Morcells, who had married his sister, Sibyl. He married Angharad, daughter of Rhys ap Gruffydd, Prince of South Wales, who nonetheless expelled William from his castle of Nevern, which Rhys then gave to his own son. He died in either 1208 or 1209, his widow surviving him. William Fitz Martin (II) William Fitz Martin, son of William and Angharad, in 1209 had letters of protection while staying in Wales. In 1212 he held Blagdon, Dartington, and other manors. He died while still a relatively young man before 15 Feb 1215/6, when the custody of his lands and his heir was granted to Fulk de Breaute. His wife, Avice de Toriton was likely a sister of Fulk. Avice remarried to Nicholas de Bolewill and was apparently still living in 1246. Nicholas Fitz Martin (I) Nicholas Fitz Martin, was son of William and Avice and a minor at his father's death. In 1222, while still under age, the King granted him licence to have a fair at his manor of Combe Martin in Devon, every year until he should come of age, which occurred before September 1231. In 1245 he was ordered to take action against the King's enemies in Gloucestershire, and in 1253 he had orders to attend \\"diligently\\" to the King's affairs while he was abroad. In 1257 he had custody of the castles of Cardigan and Kilgarran, but in that year was taken prisoner by the Welsh, and his tenants were used by the King to contribute to his ransom. The following year he was constable of Carmarthen. In 1268, being a justice in Surrey, he was allowed 50 marks out of the fines of that county for his expenses. In 1271, the King's son, Edmund, gave him custody of the castles and counties of Carmarthen and Cardigan, and in 1278 he was one of the justices appointed to hear and determine complaints concerning the Bishop of St. David's in Wales. He died 1282, having married twice: the name of his first wife is not known but he remarried to Isabel in 1259 or 1260. Nicholas Fitz Martin (II) Nicholas Fitz Martin, was heir to his father's feudal baron of Blagdon, Somerset, but died in his father's lifetime.Sanders, 1960, p.15, Blagdon, note 5 His widow, Maud, whom he married before 1257, was heiress of the feudal barony of Barnstaple, Devon, as the daughter of Guy de Brian and Eve de Tracy. Maud then married Geoffrey de Camville (died 1308), of Clifton Campville, Staffordshire, who had summons to attend the king at Portsmouth, with horse and arms, to embark in the expedition then proceeding to Gascony. He was subsequently summoned to parliament as Baron Camville, of Clifton, in the county of Stafford, from 23 Jun 1295 to 22 February 1307. Camville survived her by about 29 years during which time he retained possession of the barony under the courtesy of England. William, Lord Martin (I) The barony of Barnstaple was recovered on Geoffrey's death by Maud's son William I Fitz Martin, who was aged 25 when he received livery of his inheritance 1 April 1282. He had married before January 1281/82 to Eleanor Fitz Piers, daughter of Sir Reginald Fitz Piers and Joan de Vivonia. About this time he was charged to have no dealings with the Welsh rebels, and in this and subsequent years was frequently summoned to service against the Welsh and was ordered to continually dwell in the Welsh marches. In November 1290 he came to an agreement with William de Valence, Earl of Pembroke, as to the disputed rights in Kemeys. He was summoned to Parliament from 24 June 1295 to 24 September 1324, whereby he is held to have become Lord Martin. He served in Gascony between 1295-1297, and in September 1297, while staying at Ghent on the King's service, he made an agreement with John de Hastings, Lord of Abergavenny, by which William, son and heir of said John de Hastings was to marry Eleanor, elder daughter of William Martin, and Edmund, son and heir of William Martin should marry Joan, elder daughter of John de Hastings. This was confirmed by the King 3 November 1297, and on 10 April 1298, he was granted custodies and marriages, in recompense for his losses in a storm at sea while coming with the King from Flanders. In either 1300 or 1301, and later years, he was commissioner of over and terminer in Devon, and in 1304 he was one of a commission to treat with the Scots. In December 1307 he was one of the keepers of the peace in Devon during the King's absence. In September 1308, after the death of Geoffrey, Lord Canville, he succeeded to the inheritance of his mother. In 1309 he joined in the Barons' letter to the Pope and in 1310 he was chosen as one of the fifteen ordainers to draw up ordinances for the reform of the kingdom. He was conservator of the peace for Devon in 1314, and in February 1314 or 1315 he was appointed justice of the West and South Wales and keeper of the castle of Carmarthen and other of the King's castles there. In 1318, he was a member of the standing royal council and in November of that year he was in the King's service in the marches of Scotland. In November 1321, he and Hugh de Courtenay were ordered to attack any who might rise against the King in Cornwall and Devon, and he was also ordered to abstain from the meeting of the \\"good peers\\" convened by Thomas, Earl of Lancaster. The following February he was ordered to Coventry to resist the Earl of Lancaster. He died before 8 October 1324, when the writ to the escheator was issued. William, Lord Martin (II) William Martin (II), son and heir of William and Eleanor, died without an heir before 4 April 1326, when by modern usage the Barony of Martin is held to have fallen into abeyance between: his surviving sister, Eleanor (who would herself die without progeny in 1342), wife of Philip de Columbers and widow of William de Hastings; and James, Lord Audley, son of his younger sister Joan (died 1322), who had first married Henry de Lacy, and secondly, Nicholas de Audley, 1st Baron Audley of Heleigh Castle, Staffordshire. End of the Line The last of the senior line of the family, Eleanor, died in 1342. By this stage, junior branches of the family were already established in Waterston, Dorset (later of Athelhampton); St. David's, Wales; and by 1365 Thomas Martyn had settled in the town of Galway, Ireland. The Martyn family in Devon continued in several branches, at Oxton, Lindridge, Tonacombe, Hempston, Plymouth, etc.Vivian, Lt.Col. J.L., (Ed.)

Saunders, father of Black 'sword and soul',\\" on CBC News, posted September 16, 2020; accessed September 21, 2020. During his long career, he wrote novels, non-fiction, screenplays and radio plays.  Life and work  Saunders was born in Elizabeth, Pennsylvania, a small town outside Pittsburgh.Saunders, Charles R. \\"Autobiography\\" Saunders' official website accessed June 27, 2011. He later lived in Norristown before going to Lincoln University, from which he graduated in 1968 with a degree in psychology. Drafted to fight in Vietnam in 1969, he instead moved to Canada, living in Toronto and Hamilton, Ontario before a sojourn in Ottawa of fourteen or fifteen years. In 1985 he moved to Nova Scotia, where he lived for the remainder of his life. Nova Scotia's black community is largely descended from African Americans who went over to the British side during the American Revolutionary War and the War of 1812; they were given freedom and land in Nova Scotia after those wars ended, and created communities such as Africville. Saunders worked as a civil servant and teacher until 1989, when he began a career in journalism. Poet George Elliott Clarke, who had written a column on Black issues for the Halifax Daily News before moving to Ontario, recommended him to editor Doug MacKay, who after meeting Saunders took a chance and hired him. Saunders worked the night shift as a copy editor as well as writing his own weekly column on African-Nova Scotian life, for which he wrote his thoughts out in longhand during the day. He often wrote the papers unsigned editorials. He also wrote four non-fiction books about the Nova Scotia black community, including a collection of his columns, and contributed to The Spirit of Africville (1992), \\"a landmark book on the destroyed community.\\" When the Daily News shut down in 2008, Saunders retired. Afterwards he became increasingly isolated. In his last years he lived with little money in a modest apartment on Primrose Street in Dartmouth, N.S., lacking a landline, mobile phone or internet connection. He communicated weekly with friends and colleagues in the wider world weekly using the computers in his local library. In failing health during his last year or so, he confided about to few of his condition. He died in May 2020, but his death was only made public that September. Daily News colleagues praising Saunders's journalism include Doug MacKay and Bill Turpin. Authors remembering him as an inspiration or mentor include Troy Wiggins, publisher of FIYAH, Milton Davis, operator of MVmedia and co-editor with Saunders of Griots: A Sword and Soul Anthology, Taaq Kirksey, developer of a television project based on Imaro.  Literary career  According to Saunders he read his first work of science fiction in 1958, a misremembered novel by Andre Norton; this he states was what got him into the genre. (The mutated Siamese he recalls in an interview with Amy Harlib was most likely Lura, the giant Siamese cat and companion to the hero Fors in Norton's 1952 novel Star Man's Son [later reprinted as Daybreak 2250 A.D. and Star Man's Son ‚Äì 2250 A.D.].) Inspired in Africa, he created the fictional continent Nyumbani (which means \\"home\\" in Swahili), where the stories of Imaro, his sword and sorcery series, take place.Stories from a S&S; Griot: Nyumbani Tales by Charles R. Saunders In 1974, Saunders wrote a series of short stories for Gene Day's science fiction fanzine Dark Fantasy. The issue of Dark Fantasy with the first Imaro story found its way to Lin Carter, who included it in his first Year's Best Fantasy Stories collection, published by DAW Books in 1975. This publication brought Saunder's work to the attention of Daw publisher Donald A. Wollheim, who eventually suggested that Saunders turn his Imaro stories into a novel. Six of the novellas originally published by Gene Day in Dark Fantasy (\\"Mawanzo\\", \\"Turkhana Knives\\", \\"The Place of Stones\\", \\"Slaves of the Giant Kings\\", \\"Horror in the Black Hills\\", and \\"The City of Madness\\") would later be used in his first novel, Imaro, which was published by Daw in 1981.May 2001 Sci-Fi Dimensions interview with Amy Harlib But a lawsuit by the Edgar Rice Burroughs estate over a poorly chosen cover quote, The Epic Novel of a Black Tarzan, caused a one-month delay in shipping as the books had to be reprinted, which led to poor sales. Saunders wrote and sold two more books in the series, The Quest for Cush (1984) and The Trail of Bohu (1985). In 2006, small press Night Shade Books made a deal with Saunders to publish an updated edition of Imaro. This new edition excludes the novella \\"Slaves of the Giant-Kings\\", which Saunders felt held too many parallels to the present day Rwandan genocide. In 2008 the second novel in the updated Imaro trilogy The Quest for Cush was published by Night Shade Books, and the company has decided not to publish any other Imaro novels at this time. In 2008 Saunders released the related work Dossouye through Sword & Soul Media and the online publisher Lulu, Dousouye is a fix-up novel created from the short stories \\"Agbewe's Sword\\", \\"Gimmile's Songs\\", \\"Shiminege‚Äôs Mask\\", \\"Marwe‚Äôs Forest\\", and \\"Obenga‚Äôs Drum\\", the last previously unpublished. Dossouye herself is a woman warrior inspired by the real-life female warriors of the West African Kingdom of Dahomey. Her first stories appeared in Jessica Amanda Salmonson's Amazons! and Marion Zimmer Bradley's Sword and Sorceress,Looking Back on the first Sword and Sorceress two anthologies designed to increase the number and recognition of female heroes in sword and sorcery fiction. \\"Agbewe's Sword\\" was adapted by Saunders himself in the screenplay of the film Amazons (1986).Mistaken Indetidy In 2009 he released The Trail of Bohu, the third title in the now ongoing Imaro series, through the Sword & Soul Media storefront. In 2009 he released The Naama War the fourth and latest Imaro novel through Lulu.Imaro: The Naama War by Charles Saunders In 2012, he released Dossouye: The Dancers of Mulukau, the second novel of Dossouye.Dossouye: The Dancers of Mulukau In 2017 Saunders released \\"Nyumbani Tales\\", a collection of Nyumbani stories that have not yet been republished, among them \\"Katisa,\\" about Imaro's mother. In 2018, he published a story of Imaro in the anthology The Mighty Warriors, edited by Robert M. Price.

Stanner, was an Australian anthropologist who worked extensively with Indigenous Australians. Stanner had a varied career that also included journalism in the 1930s, military service in World War II, and political advice on colonial policy in Africa and the South Pacific in the post-war period. He was the Commanding Officer of the 2/1st North Australia Observer Unit (NAOU) during World War II, also known as the \\"Nackeroos\\" and \\"Curtin's Cowboys\\". The NAOU was the military predecessor to the modern NORFORCE. Formed in March 1942 and disbanded March 1945, they patrolled northern Australia for signs of enemy activity. Stanner was an influential figure prior to the successful 1967 referendum on Aboriginal affairs which removed provisions in the Australian Constitution which discriminated against Indigenous Australians. In 1967, the Prime Minister Harold Holt invited Stanner to join H. C. Coombs and Barrie Dexter to form the Commonwealth Council for Aboriginal Affairs and advise on national policy. He subsequently played an important role in establishing the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies. Stanner is known for coining and popularising the term the Great Australian Silence in his 1968 Boyer Lectures entitled After the Dreaming, which reflected on the silence on Indigenous Australians in Australian history after European settlement. Stanner profoundly changed the way Australians thought about themselves, their country and Aboriginal culture. Biography A number of biographical references exist, the most detailed being by Diane Barwick, Jeremy Beckett and Marie Reay which was largely completed before his death in 1981. Early career Stanner was born at Watson's Bay, Sydney on 24 November 1905, the second son of Andrew Edwin Stanner and Mary Catherine Stanner (n√©e Hanley). He was 3 years old when his father died. He was educated at state schools and won a bursary to Parramatta High School (1919‚Äì21), but was unable to stay on after the Intermediate Certificate for financial reasons. Stanner worked for two years in a bank and matriculated by private study. He worked as a journalist while studying at the University of Sydney, initially for the Cumberland Argus. In 1927 Stanner obtained full-time work as a reporter for the Sydney Daily Guardian for Frank Packer, the first of a number of posts in journalism which financed his studies in Australia and England. At University, Stanner had an interest in athletics, football and was the secretary of the University's League of Nations Society. He stated afterward that his selection of anthropology as a profession was influenced by the famous anthropologist Alfred Radcliffe-Brown. Stanner worked as a journalist until 1932 by which time he was chief sub-editor of the Sunday Sun including several years in the Parliamentary Gallery. Stanner won the Frank Albert Prize in anthropology in two successive years and graduated with a BA (Honours) (Anthropology and Economics) in 1932. In September 1933, as Lecturer in Anthropology at University of Sydney, in the midst of the Caledon Bay crisis, Stanner wrote a piece in The Sun in praise of the Minister for the Interior's decision not to send a punitive expedition to punish the murderer of Constable Albert McColl in the Northern Territory. In 1933 Stanner took up a temporary position on the personal staff of Bertram Stevens, the Premier of NSW, for whom he drafted parliamentary and public speeches and prepared reports. At that time he met H.C. Coombs and formed an enduring friendship with W.C. Wentworth with whom he worked in later life. He earned an MA (Class 1 Honours) in Anthropology in 1934 from Sydney University, for which he did extensive field research in the Daly River region of Northern Australia. A. P. Elkin judged Stanner's 1934 thesis on culture-contact at the Daly River as \\"a work of outstanding quality\\". Stanner criticised the popular assumption that the main function of the anthropologist was \\"the naive search for uncontaminated aboriginal cultures\\". He presented an exposition of a method for studying contact and cultural change, insisting that this was \\"an important and neglected problem\\". Barwick, Beckett and Reay wrote in 1985 that already his lifelong concern with the practical value of anthropology to Aboriginal welfare was apparent. Stanner lectured part-time at Sydney University and was the news editor at the World under Sydney newspaperman G. W. 'George' Warnecke. In 1935, on his second field work, Stanner accompanied the Catholic priest Father Richard Docherty to Port Keats, now known as Wadeye on the south-western coast of the Northern Territory, halfway between the mouths of the Daly River and Fitzmaurice River. Docherty was commissioned to establish a mission in the region and Stanner helped him choose the site. Over the next thirty years, the people of the two river valleys came into the mission and eventually became permanent residents. On his appointment to the Australian National University, Stanner renewed his interest in the Port Keats Wadeye area, renewing old friendships. Much of his work as an anthropologist was based on his field work with Indigenous Australians in the Port Keats Wadeye area. Stanner moved to London in 1936, completing his PhD at the London School of Economics in 1938 studying under Bronis≈Çaw Malinowski. Compatriots included Phyllis Kaberry and Piddington. Jomo Kenyatta, the first Prime Minister (1963‚Äì1964) of Kenya and subsequently President (1964‚Äì1978) was a fellow student. Stanner's doctoral dissertation was an analysis of economic and ceremonial transactions in the Daly River communities. In London, Stanner also worked as a sub-editor in the Foreign Room at The Times. Early academic appointments and field research included: * 1932‚Äì36 Department of Anthropology, University of Sydney. * 1932, 1934‚Äì35 Field research in north and central Australia (for the Australian National Research Council). * 1936‚Äì38 Research Assistant, London School of Economics. * 1937 Personal staff of Commonwealth Treasurer, The Right Honourable The Lord Casey at the Imperial Conference in London. * 1938‚Äì39 University of Oxford Expedition to Kenya (Oxford Social Sciences Research Committee). Under the auspices of Oxford University he did field research in Kenya in 1938‚Äì39 as part of the Oxford Expedition to Kenya and East Africa for the Oxford Social Studies Research Committee. This field research was discontinued at the outbreak of World War II when Stanner returned to Australia. He obtained employment at the Department of Information and subsequently acted as adviser to successive Ministers for the Army, Percy Spender and Frank Forde who subsequently became Prime Minister. WW2 Military service Studio portrait of VX89030 Major (Maj) William Edward Hanley Stanner, 2/1st North Australia Observer Unit (NAOU), of Watsons Bay, NSW. In March 1942, his pre-war experience in northern Australia led to him being directed to \\"raise and command\\" to what became the 2/1st North Australia Observer Unit (NAOU), otherwise known as \\"Stanner's Bush Commandos\\". At this time he enlisted in the 2nd AIF (1942‚Äì1946). Known colloquially as \\"Nackeroos\\", the men were deployed in small groups throughout the rugged north of Australia, where they observed and reported on signs of enemy activity, often patrolling on horseback. As the unit's Commander, Major Stanner made contact with many local Aboriginal groups, and employed some to assist his troops as guides and labourers. Nackeroo operations were scaled down as the threat of Japanese invasion passed, and the unit was eventually disbanded in March 1945. The history of the unit was documented in detail by Dr. Amoury Vane. Promoted to the rank of Lieutenant Colonel (Lt Col) in 1943, on being appointed as assistant director of DORCA.Gray, G. (2012) \\"W.E.H. Stanner: Wasted war years\\" in 'Scholars at War' (ed. G.Gray, D.Munro, C.Winter), ANU, Canberra, pp. 95‚Äì116 A developer of post-war colonial policy for DORCA, Stanner presented papers to numerous wartime authorities, and finally was appointed Senior Civil Affairs Officer for the British Borneo Civil Affairs Unit (BBCAU) until the conclusion of the war. Career post WW2 He continued his anthropological work after the war, becoming a prominent writer, lecturer and public advocate of the study and appreciation of Aboriginal society and its place in Australia. Stanner's notable career postings post-World War II included: * 1946 Department of External Affairs. This was a temporary appointment working with Sir Frederick Eggleston on a proposed South Seas Commission. * 1946‚Äì47 Researcher: Papua-New Guinea, Fiji, West Samoa (Institute of Pacific Relations). This led to the delayed publication in 1953 of his first book South Seas in Transition. * 1947‚Äì49 Foundation Director of the East African Institute of Social Research, Makerere Uganda. * 1949‚Äì64 Reader in Social Anthropology, Australian National University. Resumed field work in Daly River and Port Keats in the Northern Territory. * 1953‚Äì56 Australian Commissioner, South Pacific Commission. * 1961 Convenor and chairman, Commonwealth Conference on Aboriginal Studies. * 1961‚Äì62 First Executive Officer, Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies. * 1964‚Äì70 Professor of Anthropology and Sociology, Australian National University. * 1967‚Äì77 Appointed to Commonwealth Council for Aboriginal Affairs. * 1971 Emeritus Professor and Honorary Fellow, Department of Anthropology and Sociology, Australian National University. * 1972‚Äì74 Visiting Fellow, Research School of Pacific Studies. * 1974‚Äì75 Special Adviser to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs. * 1975‚Äì79 Department of Pre-history and Anthropology, Australian National University. * 1977‚Äì79 Consultant to Northern Territory Land Commission. * 1971‚Äì1981 Honorary Fellow, Research School of Pacific and Asian Studies (RSPAS), Australian National University Stanner also held a number of key leadership positions at the Australian National University including: * 1954 Chairman of the Governing Body, University House, Australian National University. * 1954‚Äì55 Bursar, University House, Australian National University. * 1960‚Äì1981 Honorary Member, University House, Australian National University. Referendum in 1967 Stanner was an influential figure prior to the successful 1967 referendum on Aboriginal affairs which removed provisions in the Australian Constitution which discriminated against Indigenous Australians. Council for Aboriginal Affairs In 1967, the Prime Minister Harold Holt invited Stanner to join H. C. Coombs and Barrie Dexter to form the Council for Aboriginal Affairs and advise on national policy. Stanner held that position through successive political regimes, including the Whitlam Government, which began to implement much of the program Stanner, Coombs and Dexter endorsed: land rights, the movement to outstations, increased social welfare and community-based economies.Altman 2008, pp 274‚Äì8 Stanner brought to this policy package an anthropologist's sensitivity to the importance of ceremony and ritual. In particular, at the handover of the first native title grant to the Gurindji people at Wattie Creek in the Northern Territory in 1975, Stanner recommended Prime Minister Gough Whitlam should perform the memorable symbolic act of pouring earth through the hands of Gurindji leader, Vincent Lingiari.Dexter 2008, pp 83 Boyer Lectures in 1968 In 1968 Stanner presented the Boyer Lectures, which he titled \\"After the Dreaming\\". The Boyer Lectures, an annual series of lectures delivered by prominent Australians on the Australian Broadcasting Commission's Radio National since 1959, have stimulated thought, discussion and debate in Australia on a wide range of subjects. Stanner's lectures, in which he most notably coined the phrase \\"the great Australian silence\\" (referring to the erasure from history of the violent colonial encounters with Aboriginal Australians, and Indigenous history in general), have since been reprinted a number of times. The 2019 Boyer Lectures, delivered by filmmaker Rachel Perkins, were entitled \\"The End of Silence\\", a direct reference to Stanner's phrase and lectures, 60 years later. The Great Australian Silence Stanner was most famous for coining the term \\"the Great Australian Silence\\" in his 1968 Boyer Lecture. Stanner stated that there was a \\"cult of disremembering\\" which had reduced Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people to little more than a \\"melancholy footnote\\" in Australia‚Äôs history. He frequently spoke and wrote about the erasure from history of the violent colonial encounters \\"invasion, massacres, ethnic cleansing and resistance\\" between European settlers and the Indigenous population meant that there was \\"a cult of forgetfulness practised on a national scale\\". Stanner‚Äôs Boyer Lectures in 1968 called historians to ensure this pervasive forgetfulness of the Indigenous population ceased, a process that Beasley notes was already under way to a small degree when the lectures were delivered. Beasley has stated that \\"Ultimately Indigenous Australians moved from being a ‚Äòmelancholy footnote‚Äô in Australian history, to occupying a central place in the historiography.\\" Family Stanner married Patricia Williams (1 March 1931 ‚Äì 17 May 2019), a diplomat who resigned on marriage due to the 'marriage bar', in 1962. The couple had two sons: Andrew Stanner and John Stanner. ANU Conference in 2005 In 2005, the Australian National University commemorated the centenary of the birth of W. E. H. (Bill) Stanner, one of its late professors of anthropology, with a conference discussing his lifetime achievements.

History  Systemic therapy has its roots in family therapy, or more precisely family systems therapy as it later came to be known. In particular, systemic therapy traces its roots to the Milan school of Mara Selvini Palazzoli,DiNicola, Vincenzo F. Road map to Schizo‚Äëland: Mara Selvini Palazzoli and the Milan model of systemic family therapy. Journal of Strategic & Systemic Therapies, 1984, 3(2): 50‚Äë62. DiNicola, Vincenzo F.

Syst√®mes Humains, 1986, 2(1): 129‚Äë135. but also derives from the work of Salvador Minuchin, Murray Bowen, Ivan Boszormenyi-Nagy, as well as Virginia Satir and Jay Haley from MRI in Palo Alto. These early schools of family therapy represented therapeutic adaptations of the larger interdisciplinary field of systems theory which originated in the fields of biology and physiology. Early forms of systemic therapy were based on cybernetics. In the 1970s this understanding of systems theory was central to the structural (Minuchin) and strategic (Haley, Selvini Palazzoli) schools of family therapy which would later develop into systemic therapy. In the light of postmodern critique, the notion that one could control systems or say objectively \\"what is\\" came increasingly into question. Based largely on the work of anthropologists Gregory Bateson and Margaret Mead, this resulted in a shift towards what is known as \\"second order cybernetics\\" which acknowledges the influence of the subjective observer in any study, essentially applying the principles of cybernetics to cybernetics ‚Äì examining the examination. As a result, the focus of systemic therapy (ca. 1980 and forward) has moved away from a modernist model of linear causality and understanding of reality as objective, to a postmodern understanding of reality as socially and linguistically constructed.  Praxis  This has a direct impact on the praxis of systemic therapy which approaches problems practically rather than analytically, i.e. it does not attempt to determine past causes, as does the psychoanalytic approach, nor does it assign diagnosis, \\"Who is sick, who is a victim\\". Rather, systemic therapy seeks to identify stagnant patterns of behavior in groups of people such as a family, and address those patterns directly, irrespective of analysis of cause. A key point here of this postmodern perspective then is not a denial of absolutes but the humble recognition by the therapist that they do not hold the capacity to change people or systems; the systemic therapist's role is rather to help systems to change themselves by introducing creative \\"nudges\\": \\"Systemic therapy neither attempts a 'treatment of causes' nor of symptoms; rather it gives living systems nudges that help them to develop new patterns together, taking on a new organizational structure that allows growth.\\"Arist von Schlippe and Jochen Schweitzer, Lehrbuch der Systemischen Therapie und Beratung (G√∂ttingen: Vandenhoeck & Ruprecht) 1998, p 93. Thus systemic therapy differs from analytic forms of therapy, including psychoanalytic or psychodynamic forms of family therapy (for example the work of Horst Eberhard Richter), in its focus on practically addressing current relationship patterns rather than analyzing causes, such as subconscious impulses or childhood trauma. Systemic therapy also differs from family systems therapy in that it addresses other living systems (i.e. groups of people) in addition to the family, for example businesses. In addition to families and business, the systemic approach is increasingly being implemented in the fields of education, politics, psychiatry, social work, and family medicine.Arist von Schlippe and Jochen Schweitzer, Lehrbuch der Systemischen Therapie und Beratung (G√∂ttingen: Vandenhoeck & Ruprecht) 1998, pp 245-261.

Gen. HH Maharaja Sawai Shri Sir Man Singh II GCSI GCIE (b. Sawai Mor Mukut Singh; 21 August 1912 ‚Äì 24 June 1970) was the last ruling Maharaja of Jaipur State. He ruled the princely state between 1922 and 1949, when the state acceded unto the Dominion of India. Thereafter, he held office as Rajpramukh of Rajasthan between 1949 and 1956. In later life, he served as Ambassador of India to Spain. He was also a notable sportsman and celebrated polo player. Early life Sawai Man Singh II, was born Mor Mukut Singh, the second son of Thakur Sawai Singh of Isarda by his wife Sugan Kunwar, a lady from Kotla village in Uttar Pradesh. His father was a nobleman belonging to the Kachwaha clan of Rajputs. Mor Mukut grew up in the dusty, walled township of Isarda, a chief Thikana of the Rajawat sub-clan which lies between the towns of Sawai Madhopur and Jaipur in present-day Rajasthan. His family was connected to the ruling house of Jaipur and Kotah (where his father's sister was married). The then-Maharaja of Jaipur, Sawai Madho Singh II, had been born the son of a former Thakur of Isarda and had been adopted into the ruling family of Jaipur. After giving him up for adoption, Madho Singh's actual father had in turn lacked for an heir. He adopted the son of a distant kinsman and was succeeded by that lad as Thakur of Isarda. That lad was Sawai Singh, father of Mor Mukut Singh. In this manner, Mor Mukut could be reckoned near kin to Maharaja Madho Singh II of Jaipur. After being adopted to become Maharaja of Jaipur, Madho Singh II had numerous (no less than 65) children by various concubines, but the highly superstitious Maharaja was warned by a sage against having legitimate heirs and thus took great care not to impregnate his five wives. On 24 March 1921, Madho Singh II adopted Mor Mukut to be his son and heir. The boy was given the name \\"Man Singh\\" upon his adoption. Madho Singh II died on 7 September 1922 and was succeeded by Man Singh as Maharaja of Jaipur and head of the Kachwaha clan of Rajputs. The new Maharaja was ten years old. Maharaja of Jaipur Upon obtaining his ruling powers, Man Singh embarked on a programme of modernisation, creating infrastructure and founding numerous public institutions that would later result in Jaipur being selected the capital of Rajasthan. At the time of the Independence of British India in 1947, the maharaja delayed acceding Jaipur to the Dominion of India. He finally signed an Instrument of Accession in April 1949, when his princely state became part of the Rajasthan States Union, initially retaining his powers of internal government. The Maharaja became Rajpramukh of the States Union, but the office was abolished when the Indian states were further re- organised in 1956. Although the Indian princes had by then relinquished their ruling powers, they remained entitled to their titles, privy purses, and other privileges until the adoption of the 26th amendment to the Constitution of India on 28 December 1971. Accordingly, Sir Man Singh II remained Maharaja of Jaipur until his death.Careers Digest, Vol. 7 (1970), p. 488: Swai Man Singh : The Maharaja of Jaipur State who died in London recently at the age-of 59, was the 39th ruler of the Jaipur State. A progressive statesman, he was the last Indian Maharaja to sign the Instrument of Accession. He was the Rajpramukh of Rajasthan from April 7, 1949 to October 1956.\\" In 1958, Sir Man Singh was one of several rulers who realised the potential of tourism in Rajasthan, turning Rambagh Palace into a luxury hotel. Under his rule various laws of land reform were first introduced in his state, such as the Jaipur Tenancy Act. Later in 1956, the Jagidari (feudal) form of political administration were abolished during the government of the Congress Party in India. In 1962 he was elected to Council of States, the Rajya Sabha the Upper House of Indian Parliament with term till 1968, however in 1965, the Indian government appointed Sawai Man Singh, Indian Ambassador to Spain. Utilising his various contacts in Europe, he spent much of his time in Europe to ensue new military technology and arms-deal for the Indian army (Crewe). He was especially noted as an enthusiastic (10-Goal) polo player, winning among other trophies the World Cup in 1933. During the 1950s, Man Singh owned Saint Hill Manor in East Grinstead, West Sussex, which was sold to L. Ron Hubbard, founder of Scientology in 1959. Personal life Jacqueline Kennedy with the Maharaja and Maharani of Jaipur. Man Singh II and Maharani Gayatri Devi. =Marriages= Man Singh II was married three times, and his three wives lived in the same household together, in accordance with Rajput custom. His first two marriages were to suitable brides chosen from the royal family of Jodhpur, whose Rajput heritage and social ranking were similar to his own. The senior Maharani, known within the palace as 'First her Highness,' was Marudhar Kunwar, sister of Sumer Singh, Maharaja of Jodhpur. She was about twelve years older than he and bore him two children: first a daughter, Prem Kumari, and then his eldest son and heir, Bhawani Singh. His second wife was Maharani Kishore Kanwar, niece of his first wife and daughter of Maharaja Sumer Singh of Jodhpur. She was five years younger than he and bore him two sons. He was briefly involved with English socialite Lady Ursula Manners. In 1940, Man Singh II married for the third and last time. His bride was the legendary beauty Gayatri Devi of Cooch Behar, daughter of Maharaja Jitendra Narayan of Cooch Behar and Maharani Indira Devi, a princess of Baroda. She stands out among the Maharanis of Jaipur for having become a public figure and a celebrity of sorts, initially for being a fashion-conscious beauty and later for becoming a politician and parliamentarian. She bore him one son and survived him by thirty-nine years, dying in 2009. =Children= Man Singh was the father of four sons and a daughter, borne to him by his three wives. They were: ;By his first wife, Maharani Marudhar Kunwar, one son and one daughter * Prem Kumari (1929 ‚Äì 1970). In 1948, she was given in marriage to the Maharawal of Baria.

They had been living separately from each other by the time she died in 2009, a few months before her aunt. Gayatri Devi tended to support her step-son and deprecate her niece in the matter of their marital differences, and Prithviraj Singh remained close to his step-mother all his life. Prithviraj and Devika had one son together: ** Vijit Singh, who in 1991 married Minakshi Devi, daughter of the Maharaja of Lunawada, and has three children; two sons named Vedant Singh (b. 1992) and Siddhant Singh (b. 1996), and a daughter Mokshita (b. 1993). ;By his third wife, Gayatri Devi (1919 - 2009) * Prince Jagat Singh, (1949 - 1997) received the title Raja of Isarda was married in 1978 (divorced 1987) to a Thai princess.

Set in an unspecified mining area in Northern England, the book follows Billy Casper, a young working-class boy troubled at home and at school, who finds and trains a kestrel whom he names \\"Kes\\". The book received a wider audience when it was adapted into the film Kes in 1969; Hines wrote the screenplay with director Ken Loach (credited as Kenneth Loach) and producer Tony Garnett. The film adaptation has since become regarded as one of the greatest of British films. Today, the novel is often used in Key Stage 4 assessment in the United Kingdom, as part of GCSE English courses. The novel‚Äôs title is taken from a poem found in the Book of Saint Albans.\\"An Eagle for an Emperor, a Gyrfalcon for a King; a Peregrine for a Prince, and a Saker for a Knight; a Merlin for a lady, a Goshawk for a Yeoman, a Sparrowhawk for a Priest, and a Kestrel for a Knave\\" ‚Äì Boke of St Albans 1486 In medieval England, the only bird a knave was legally allowed to keep was a kestrel. Plot In the opening pages of the book, we see Billy and his half-brother Jud sleeping in the same bed in a troubled household. Billy tries to encourage Jud to get up to go to work, but Jud only responds by punching him. Soon afterward Billy attempts to leave for his paper round, only to discover that Jud has stolen his bicycle. As a result, Billy is late and has to deliver the newspapers on foot. There is a flashback to several months before when Billy returns home to find a man whom he does not recognize leaving his house. He asks his mother and finds out he is a man she had come home with the night before. It becomes obvious that Billy's father is absent. His mother then tells him to go to the shop to get some cigarettes, but he instead steals a book from the local bookshop and returns home to read it. Jud comes back drunk from a night out. Still in flashback, the next scene takes place at a farm. Billy sees a kestrel's nest and approaches it. Billy is then approached by the farmer and his daughter. At first, the farmer tells Billy to \\"bugger off\\" but when he realizes that Billy was looking for a kestrel, he soon takes an interest. The flashback ends. Later on in the day, Billy is at school, where Mr Crossley is taking the register. After the name Fisher, Billy shouts out 'German Bight', inadvertently causing the teacher to make a mistake. The class then proceeds to the hall for an assembly run by the strict head teacher, Mr Gryce. During the Lord's Prayer, Billy starts to daydream, and after the prayer has finished, Billy remains standing after the rest of the people in the hall have sat down. Billy is told to report to Gryce's room after assembly. Billy goes to Gryce and gets caned. He then goes to a class with Mr Farthing, who is discussing 'Fact and Fiction'. One of the pupils, Anderson, tells a story about tadpoles. Then Billy is told to tell a story, and tells a story about his kestrel. Mr Farthing takes an interest. The class then has to write a tall story, and Billy writes about a day when his father comes back home and Jud leaves to join the army. After the lesson, Billy gets into a fight with a boy called MacDowall, which is eventually broken up and warned by Mr. Farthing. After the break, Billy goes to physical education (PE) with Mr. Sugden. Billy doesn't have PE kit because his mother refuses to pay for it, so he is forced to wear clothes that do not fit for him instead. He goes onto the football pitch and is told to play in goal. After a very long lesson, which involves Billy performing acrobatics on the goalpost, the class goes back inside and each has a shower. After Billy intentionally lets in the winning goal to end the lesson, he is humiliated by Mr. Sugden who forces him to take a cold shower. After this, Billy goes straight home to feed Kes. He takes her out and flies her, and is approached by Mr. Farthing, who is apparently impressed by Billy's skill. Mr. Farthing then leaves, and Billy goes out to place Jud's bet. However, he finds out that the horse that Jud intends to bet on is unlikely to win, and instead uses Jud's money to buy a portion of fish and chips, and some meat for his kestrel. Billy returns to school, and whilst sitting in a maths lesson sees Jud walking towards the school. The lesson finishes, and Billy leaves hurriedly. He tries to hide from Jud and falls asleep before he bumps into Gryce, who reminds him that he is supposed to be in a Youth Employment Meeting. Billy goes along to his Youth Employment Meeting, and the Youth Employment Officer finds it very difficult to recommend anything, as Billy claims that he has no hobbies. After the Youth Employment Meeting, Billy goes straight home and finds that Kes has disappeared. He frantically searches for her and returns home. Jud is there, and he tells Billy that the horse he was supposed to place a bet on won and that he has killed Kes. Billy then calls Jud a \\"fuckin' bastard\\" and has a fight with him. His mother criticizes Billy's language, and Billy runs away. Another flashback takes place in which Billy visits the cinema with his father. When they return home, Billy's father finds that his wife has been having an affair with Billy's 'Uncle Mick'. Billy's father punches Mick and leaves the house. After the flashback has ended, Billy returns home, buries the kestrel and goes to bed. The story is set in only one day, apart from the flashback passages. However, the film version, directed by Kenneth Loach from Barry Hines's screenplay, dispenses with the flashbacks and portrays the events in a linear fashion.  Background  Barry Hines had published his debut novel, The Blinder, in 1966, while still working full-time as a P.E. teacher. Hines wanted to write a novel about the education system and took inspiration from his younger brother Richard, who had tamed a hawk called Kes. He wrote a first draft while teaching, but received a bursary from the BBC as a result of his successful radio play Billy‚Äôs Last Stand, which he used to take a sabbatical on the Isle of Elba and complete the novel. Meanwhile, film and television producer Tony Garnett approached Hines about the prospect of contributing an episode to The Wednesday Play series. Hines turned down the offer due to the novel he was currently working on, but Garnett was intrigued and asked Hines to send him a manuscript of the finished project. Impressed by the manuscript, Garnett and Loach bought the rights to the film for their new production company, Kestrel Films, before the novel had been published. Disney later attempted to buy the rights on the condition that the ending be changed from the novel so that the kestrel survives, a condition refused by Hines.  Reception and legacy  A Kestrel for a Knave received positive critical reviews upon its original publication. Penelope Maslin noted Hines's \\"extraordinary visual sense .... subtlety and economy, added to an imagination quite out of the ordinary, which make A Kestrel for a Knave a book to remember.\\" In 2009, The Observer listed it as one of the \\"1000 novels everyone must read\\", describing it as a \\"compelling and haunting portrait of British working-class youth\\". In a 2010 retrospective review, Imogen Carter acclaimed \\"the novel's dazzling natural imagery, reminiscent of Seamus Heaney's 1966 poetry collection, Death of a Naturalist\\". Upon Hines's death in 2016, Barnsley-based poet Ian McMillan praised the novel for its \\"celebratory\\" presentation of the local dialect and culture, writing that \\"here in the former South Yorkshire coalfield A Kestrel for a Knave is our Moby-Dick, our Things Fall Apart, our Great Gatsby.\\" The book has been published around the world and translated into Chinese, Japanese and Russian. It was republished as a Penguin Modern Classic in 1999. Alongside the film adaptation, it has seen adaptations for the stage and radio. A ballet adaptation was performed at Sheffield‚Äôs Crucible Theatre in 2014 to critical acclaim.

He worked in the American Wrestling Association (AWA) in the mid-1980s as part of a tag team with \\"Playboy\\" Buddy Rose, managed by Sherri Martel, and twice held the AWA World Tag Team Championship. Early life Douglas Duane Somerson, born September 22, 1951 in the heart of South Minneapolis, Minnesota, was the youngest of seven children of Carl and Dorothy Somerson. He had four brothers Jack, Russ, Dennis, and Gene and two sisters Barbara and Shirley. He was also uncle to author Julie Somerson (Via Gene). Professional wrestling career In Minneapolis in 1986 as part of Verne Gagne's American Wrestling Association (AWA) Somers teamed up with \\"Playboy\\" Buddy Rose and manager Sherri Martel. The duo captured the AWA World Tag Team Championship by defeating Curt Hennig and Scott Hall via countout on May 17, 1986. They went on to feud with The Midnight Rockers (Shawn Michaels and Marty Jannetty) over the belts for the remainder of 1986, culminating with Michaels and Jannetty winning the title on January 17, 1987. Somers would continue to wrestle for the AWA as both a singles wrestler and tag team wrestler (with both Buddy Wolfe and Kevin Kelly) throughout 1987. He would also be a last minute replacement for Boris Zukhov (who jumped to the World Wrestling Federation) as Soldat Ustinov's tag team partner in a title defense against Jerry Lawler and Bill Dundee. Somers resurfaced in the AWA in 1989, managed by Johnny Valiant. Somers went on to wrestle on the independent circuit and for the Global Wrestling Federation in 1991, taking part in their TV title tournament. He has also wrestled for Georgia independent company Folkstyle Championship Wrestling, in a feud with Frankie Valentine. At WCW Halloween Havoc 1991, Somers lost to Van Hammer in the first PPV match of his career.

Safe-haven laws (also known in some states as \\"Baby Moses laws\\", in reference to the religious scripture) are statutes in the United States that decriminalize the leaving of unharmed infants with statutorily designated private persons so that the child becomes a ward of the state. Description \\"Safe-haven\\" laws typically let parents remain nameless to the court, often using a numbered bracelet system as the only means of linking the baby to the parent. Some states treat safe-haven surrenders as child dependency or abandonment, with a complaint being filed for such in juvenile court. The parent either defaults or answers the complaint. Others treat safe-haven surrenders as adoption surrenders, hence a waiver of parental rights (see parental responsibility). Police stations, hospitals, and fire stations are all typical locations to which the safe-haven law applies. History Texas was the first state to enact a \\"Baby Moses Law\\" in 1999, although the Safe Place originates in Mobile, Alabama after a string of infanticides. The Texan legislation was sponsored by a newcomer Republican member of the Texas House of Representatives, Geanie Morrison of Victoria, who is still serving in the chamber. Controversy Supporters of safe-haven laws argue that the laws save lives by encouraging parents to surrender infants safely, providing an alternative to abortion, infanticide, or child abandonment. Detractors argue that, because safe-haven laws do not require parents to be under stress, one parent will use the law largely to avoid notice to the non-surrendering parent. The laws have also been criticized due to the fact that in some states, safe-haven laws favor mothers.Owens, Lisa Lucile, Coerced Parenthood as Family Policy: Feminism, the Moral Agency of Women, and Men's 'Right to Choose' (May 20, 2014). Alabama Civil Rights & Civil Liberties Law Review, Vol. 5, p. 1, 2013. Available at SSRN: http://ssrn.com/abstract=2439294 Critics also argue that safe-haven laws undercut temporary-surrender laws, which were enacted specifically for parents who are unsure about whether to keep or relinquish their children. Supporters counter by arguing that anonymity is the only way to convince certain parents not to harm their infants, and that the benefit outweighs any claimed detriment. Various father's rights groups have also criticized how safe-haven laws can shut fathers out of the child's life without their knowledge or consent. Controversy arose out of the safe-haven law enacted in Nebraska in July 2008: the Nebraska law in force at the time was interpreted to define a child as anyone under 18, and resulted in the desertion of children older than infants, some as old as teenage years. Under the prior version of the law, at least 35 children were dropped off in Nebraska hospitals in a four-month span, at least 5 of them from other US states. The law was changed in November 2008, allowing only infants up to 30 days old to be surrendered. Constitutionality As of January 8, 2006, only one case had challenged the constitutionality of a safe- haven law. Unable to allege personal harm, the plaintiff argued that the public had to know in advance that the State would not help parents hide children from each other. Also, because anonymity thwarted a non-surrendering parent from the outset, and could be used by any parent arbitrarily, the law threatened the public generally. The court dismissed the case, finding that the alleged harm did not rise to the level needed to justify a public action. Thus, the plaintiff's claim that the safe-haven law violated the separation of powers doctrine by circumventing the Supreme Court's rule-making authority remained unaddressed. But in 2007, an Ohio Court of Common Pleas ruled that the entire Ohio Deserted Child Act was void for violating the Supreme Court's rule-making authority. In re Baby Boy Doe, 145 Ohio Misc.2d 1, 2007-Ohio-7244. There, the parent had left the child at the hospital, expressing an intent to leave the child and to have the child adopted. The parent never contacted the hospital or the state agency afterward. The non-surrendering parent's identity and location were not fully known. After being granted temporary custody, the state agency moved for permanent custody, as needed for adoption. The attorney and the guardian ad litem for the child argued that certain statutes of the safe haven act violated the separation of powers doctrine under Art IV, Sec. 5(B) of the Ohio Constitution. The court agreed, finding that the safe-haven laws' notice and anonymity statutes conflicted with the notice provisions of Juvenile Rule 15 and the due diligence requirements of other court rules. Juv.R. 15 required issuing summons to the parties ordering them to appear before the court. Because the main purpose of the safe-haven law was to keep parents anonymous and immune from prosecution, Juvenile Rule 15 undermined the safe-haven laws' purpose. But the anonymity and notice statutes being procedural, the court rules governed. Because the notice and anonymity statutes could not be reconciled with the remaining safe-haven statutes, the whole safe-haven act was void. The original safe-haven complaint and permanent custody motion were dismissed. The case was not appealed. Current status By 2008, all 50 states had a form of safe-haven law.

Entirely within Gaston County, it connects the towns of Lowell, McAdenville, and Belmont with the city of Gastonia. Route description =Gastonia, Ranlo, and Lowell= NC 7's western terminus is at U.S. Route 321 (US 321), just north of downtown Gastonia. US 321 at this point is divided onto two roads: North Chester Street and North York Street. NC 7 is also known as Ozark Avenue in the city of Gastonia. Traveling in a northeasterly direction, NC 7 crosses Interstate 85 (I-85) for the first time and shortly after, intersects with NC 279. After crossing Spencer Mountain Road into the town of Ranlo, NC 7 becomes the aptly named Lowell Road since the next town NC 7 enters is Lowell. Once inside the Lowell town limits, NC 7 is also known as West First Street. In downtown Lowell, NC 7 turns left onto Main Street and quickly turns right onto Third Street, where NC 7 makes its second crossing of Interstate 85 (exit 23). =McAdenville and ChristmasTown USA= Immediately after crossing I-85, NC 7 enters one of North Carolina's most famous cities: McAdenville. Every Christmas season, McAdenville residents deck nearly every square foot of the town with decorations; the event is known as ChristmasTown USA. During this time, NC 7 can become a traffic nightmare as tourists flock to McAdenville. Through this segment, NC 7 is known as Main Street. Immediately after crossing the South Fork Catawba River and leaving downtown McAdenville, NC 7 makes another turn, onto Riverside Drive, which is renamed McAdenville Road a half-mile down the road. =Cramerton and Belmont= After skirting the outskirts of Cramerton, NC 7 once again changes road. This time NC 7 moves right onto Old NC 273 in Belmont; exit ramps to another interchange with Interstate 85 (exit 26) are found near this intersection. NC 7 crosses US 29/US 74 and then loops around downtown Belmont, before going back to US 29/74, where it ends. Through town, NC 7 is known as Main Street, and then as Catawba Street. NC 7 and NC 273 do intersect in the center of downtown Belmont. Three quarters of a mile after this intersection, NC 7 comes to its eastern terminus. History Established in 1932 as a renumbering of NC 29; which itself was created two years prior when US 74/NC 20 was realigned between Lowell, McAdenville, and Belmont. In 1935, NC 7 was extended west, on new road, to Kings Mountain; however, in 1938, it was reverted to its original western terminus when US 29/US 74 was realigned onto the new road, dropping the route through Bessemer City. The route has changed little since its inception. =North Carolina Highway 29= North Carolina Highway 29 (NC 29) was established 1930 when US 74/NC 20 was realigned onto new road; this was its second form. In 1932, it was renumbered as NC 7. The first NC 29 was an original state highway from the South Carolina state line, near Tuxedo, to English, located in Walnut Mountains. In 1928, NC 29 was replaced by NC 69, between the South Carolina state line to Mars Hill; with NC 31 in Mars Hill and NC 311 north to the Tennessee state line. Major intersections West NC 7/West NC 7 Truck at Wilkinson Boulevard and Catawba Avenue Special routes =Belmont truck route= NC 7 Truck is a short route that overlaps entirely with US 29 and US 74 through Belmont. The truck route was established to keep trucks from traveling through downtown Belmont. The eastern terminus is also the end point of NC 7.

This is analogous to a curve generalizing a straight line. There are many more precise definitions, depending on the context and the mathematical tools that are used to analyze the surface. The mathematical concept of a surface is an idealization of what is meant by surface in science, computer graphics, and common language. Definitions Often, a surface is defined by equations that are satisfied by the coordinates of its points. This is the case of the graph of a continuous function of two variables. The set of the zeros of a function of three variables is a surface, which is called an implicit surface.Here \\"implicit\\" does not refer to a property of the surface, which may be defined by other means, but instead to how it is defined. Thus this term is an abbreviation of \\"surface defined by an implicit equation\\". If the defining three-variate function is a polynomial, the surface is an algebraic surface. For example, the unit sphere is an algebraic surface, as it may be defined by the implicit equation :x^2+y^2+z^2 -1= 0. A surface may also be defined as the image, in some space of dimension at least 3, of a continuous function of two variables (some further conditions are required to insure that the image is not a curve). In this case, one says that one has a parametric surface, which is parametrized by these two variables, called parameters. For example, the unit sphere may be parametrized by the Euler angles, also called longitude and latitude by :begin{align} x&= cos(u)cos(v) y&=sin(u)cos(v) z&=sin(v),. end{align} Parametric equations of surfaces are often irregular at some points. For example, all but two points of the unit sphere, are the image, by the above parametrization, of exactly one pair of Euler angles (modulo ). For the remaining two points (the north and south poles), one has , and the longitude may take any values. Also, there are surfaces for which there cannot exist a single parametrization that covers the whole surface. Therefore, one often considers surfaces which are parametrized by several parametric equations, whose images cover the surface. This is formalized by the concept of manifold: in the context of manifolds, typically in topology and differential geometry, a surface is a manifold of dimension two; this means that a surface is a topological space such that every point has a neighborhood which is homeomorphic to an open subset of the Euclidean plane (see Surface (topology) and Surface (differential geometry)). This allows defining surfaces in spaces of dimension higher than three, and even abstract surfaces, which are not contained in any other space. On the other hand, this excludes surfaces that have singularities, such as the vertex of a conical surface or points where a surface crosses itself. In classical geometry, a surface is generally defined as a locus of a point or a line. For example, a sphere is the locus of a point which is at a given distance of a fixed point, called the center; a conical surface is the locus of a line passing through a fixed point and crossing a curve; a surface of revolution is the locus of a curve rotating around a line. A ruled surface is the locus of a moving line satisfying some constraints; in modern terminology, a ruled surface is a surface, which is a union of lines. Terminology In this article, several kinds of surfaces are considered and compared. An unambiguous terminology is thus necessary to distinguish them. Therefore, we call topological surfaces the surfaces that are manifolds of dimension two (the surfaces considered in Surface (topology)). We call differentiable surfaces the surfaces that are differentiable manifolds (the surfaces considered in Surface (differential geometry)). Every differentiable surface is a topological surface, but the converse is false. For simplicity, unless otherwise stated, \\"surface\\" will mean a surface in the Euclidean space of dimension 3 or in . A surface that is not supposed to be included in another space is called an abstract surface. Examples * The graph of a continuous function of two variables, defined over a connected open subset of is a topological surface. If the function is differentiable, the graph is a differentiable surface. * A plane is both an algebraic surface and a differentiable surface. It is also a ruled surface and a surface of revolution. * A circular cylinder (that is, the locus of a line crossing a circle and parallel to a given direction) is an algebraic surface and a differentiable surface. * A circular cone (locus of a line crossing a circle, and passing through a fixed point, the apex, which is outside the plane of the circle) is an algebraic surface which is not a differentiable surface. If one removes the apex, the remainder of the cone is the union of two differentiable surfaces. * The surface of a polyhedron is a topological surface, which is neither a differentiable surface nor an algebraic surface. * A hyperbolic paraboloid (the graph of the function ) is a differentiable surface and an algebraic surface. It is also a ruled surface, and, for this reason, is often used in architecture. * A two-sheet hyperboloid is an algebraic surface and the union of two non-intersecting differentiable surfaces. Parametric surface A parametric surface is the image of an open subset of the Euclidean plane (typically mathbb R^2) by a continuous function, in a topological space, generally a Euclidean space of dimension at least three. Usually the function is supposed to be continuously differentiable, and this will be always the case in this article. Specifically, a parametric surface in mathbb R^3 is given by three functions of two variables and , called parameters :begin{align} x&=f_1(u,v) y&=f_2(u,v) z&=f_3(u,v),. end{align} As the image of such a function may be a curve (for example, if the three functions are constant with respect to ), a further condition is required, generally that, for almost all values of the parameters, the Jacobian matrix : begin{bmatrix} dfrac{partial f_1}{partial u} & dfrac{partial f_1}{partial v} dfrac{partial f_2}{partial u} & dfrac{partial f_2}{partial v} dfrac{partial f_3}{partial u} & dfrac{partial f_3}{partial v} end{bmatrix} has rank two. Here \\"almost all\\" means that the values of the parameters where the rank is two contain a dense open subset of the range of the parametrization. For surfaces in a space of higher dimension, the condition is the same, except for the number of columns of the Jacobian matrix. =Tangent plane and normal vector= A point where the above Jacobian matrix has rank two is called regular, or, more properly, the parametrization is called regular at . The tangent plane at a regular point is the unique plane passing through and having a direction parallel to the two row vectors of the Jacobian matrix. The tangent plane is an affine concept, because its definition is independent of the choice of a metric. In other words, any affine transformation maps the tangent plane to the surface at a point to the tangent plane to the image of the surface at the image of the point. The normal line, or simply normal at a point of a surface is the unique line passing through the point and perpendicular to the tangent plane. A normal vector is a vector which is parallel to the normal. For other differential invariants of surfaces, in the neighborhood of a point, see Differential geometry of surfaces. =Irregular point and singular point= A point of a parametric surface which is not regular is irregular. There are several kinds of irregular points. It may occur that an irregular point becomes regular, if one changes the parametrization. This is the case of the poles in the parametrization of the unit sphere by Euler angles: it suffices to permute the role of the different coordinate axes for changing the poles. On the other hand, consider the circular cone of parametric equation :begin{align} x&= tcos(u) y&=tsin(u) z&=t,. end{align} The apex of the cone is the origin , and is obtained for . It is an irregular point that remains irregular, whichever parametrization is chosen (otherwise, there would exist a unique tangent plane). Such an irregular point, where the tangent plane is undefined, is said singular. There is another kind of singular points. There are the self- crossing points, that is the points where the surface crosses itself. In other words, these are the points which are obtained for (at least) two different values of the parameters. =Graph of a bivariate function= Let be a function of two real variables. This is a parametric surface, parametrized as :begin{align} x&= t y&=u z&=f(t,u),. end{align} Every point of this surface is regular, as the two first columns of the Jacobian matrix form the identity matrix of rank two. =Rational surface= A rational surface is a surface that may be parametrized by rational functions of two variables. That is, if are, for , polynomials in two indeterminates, then the parametric surface, defined by :begin{align} x&= frac{f_1(t,u)}{f_0(t,u)} y&=frac{f_2(t,u)}{f_0(t,u)} z&=frac{f_3(t,u)}{f_0(t,u)},, end{align} is a rational surface. A rational surface is an algebraic surface, but most algebraic surfaces are not rational. Implicit surface An implicit surface in a Euclidean space (or, more generally, in an affine space) of dimension 3 is the set of the common zeros of a differentiable function of three variables :f(x, y, z)=0. Implicit means that the equation defines implicitly one of the variables as a function of the other variables. This is made more exact by the implicit function theorem: if , and the partial derivative in of is not zero at , then there exists a differentiable function such that :f(x,y,varphi(x,y))=0 in a neighbourhood of . In other words, the implicit surface is the graph of a function near a point of the surface where the partial derivative in is nonzero. An implicit surface has thus, locally, a parametric representation, except at the points of the surface where the three partial derivatives are zero. =Regular points and tangent plane= A point of the surface where at least one partial derivative of is nonzero is called regular. At such a point (x_0, y_0, z_0), the tangent plane and the direction of the normal are well defined, and may be deduced, with the implicit function theorem from the definition given above, in . The direction of the normal is the gradient, that is the vector :left[frac{partial f}{partial x}(x_0, y_0, z_0), frac{partial f}{partial y}(x_0, y_0, z_0), frac{partial f}{partial z}(x_0, y_0, z_0)right]. The tangent plane is defined by its implicit equation :frac{partial f}{partial x}(x_0, y_0, z_0)(x-x_0) + frac{partial f}{partial y}(x_0, y_0, z_0) (y-y_0)+ frac{partial f}{partial z}(x_0, y_0, z_0)(z-z_0) = 0. =Singular point= A singular point of an implicit surface (in mathbb R^3) is a point of the surface where the implicit equation holds and the three partial derivatives of its defining function are all zero. Therefore, the singular points are the solutions of a system of four equations in three indeterminates. As most such systems have no solution, many surfaces do not have any singular point. A surface with no singular point is called regular or non-singular. The study of surfaces near their singular points and the classification of the singular points is singularity theory. A singular point is isolated if there is no other singular point in a neighborhood of it. Otherwise, the singular points may form a curve. This is in particular the case for self-crossing surfaces. Algebraic surface Originally, an algebraic surface was a surface which may be defined by an implicit equation :f(x,y,z)=0, where is a polynomial in three indeterminates, with real coefficients. The concept has been extended in several directions, by defining surfaces over arbitrary fields, and by considering surfaces in spaces of arbitrary dimension or in projective spaces. Abstract algebraic surfaces, which are not explicitly embedded in another space, are also considered. =Surfaces over arbitrary fields= Polynomials with coefficients in any field are accepted for defining an algebraic surface. However, the field of coefficients of a polynomial is not well defined, as, for example, a polynomial with rational coefficients may also be considered as a polynomial with real or complex coefficients. Therefore, the concept of point of the surface has been generalized in the following way: Given a polynomial , let be the smallest field containing the coefficients, and be an algebraically closed extension of , of infinite transcendence degree.The infinite degree of transcendence is a technical condition, which allows an accurate definition of the concept of generic point. Then a point of the surface is an element of which is a solution of the equation :f(x,y,z)=0. If the polynomial has real coefficients, the field is the complex field, and a point of the surface that belongs to mathbb{R}^3 (a usual point) is called a real point. A point that belongs to is called rational over , or simply a rational point, if is the field of rational numbers. =Projective surface= A projective surface in a projective space of dimension three is the set of points whose homogeneous coordinates are zeros of a single homogeneous polynomial in four variables. More generally, a projective surface is a subset of a projective space, which is a projective variety of dimension two. Projective surfaces are strongly related to affine surfaces (that is, ordinary algebraic surfaces). One passes from a projective surface to the corresponding affine surface by setting to one some coordinate or indeterminate of the defining polynomials (usually the last one). Conversely, one passes from an affine surface to its associated projective surface (called projective completion) by homogenizing the defining polynomial (in case of surfaces in a space of dimension three), or by homogenizing all polynomials of the defining ideal (for surfaces in a space of higher dimension). =In higher dimensional spaces= One cannot define the concept of an algebraic surface in a space of dimension higher than three without a general definition of an algebraic variety and of the dimension of an algebraic variety. In fact, an algebraic surface is an algebraic variety of dimension two. More precisely, an algebraic surface in a space of dimension is the set of the common zeros of at least polynomials, but these polynomials must satisfy further conditions that may be not immediate to verify. Firstly, the polynomials must not define a variety or an algebraic set of higher dimension, which is typically the case if one of the polynomials is in the ideal generated by the others. Generally, polynomials define an algebraic set of dimension two or higher. If the dimension is two, the algebraic set may have several irreducible components. If there is only one component the polynomials define a surface, which is a complete intersection. If there are several components, then one needs further polynomials for selecting a specific component. Most authors consider as an algebraic surface only algebraic varieties of dimension two, but some also consider as surfaces all algebraic sets whose irreducible components have the dimension two. In the case of surfaces in a space of dimension three, every surface is a complete intersection, and a surface is defined by a single polynomial, which is irreducible or not, depending on whether non-irreducible algebraic sets of dimension two are considered as surfaces or not. =Abstract algebraic surface= =Rational surfaces are algebraic surfaces= Topological surface In topology, a surface is generally defined as a manifold of dimension two. This means that a topological surface is a topological space such that every point has a neighborhood that is homeomorphic to an open subset of a Euclidean plane. Every topological surface is homeomorphic to a polyhedral surface such that all facets are triangles. The combinatorial study of such arrangements of triangles (or, more generally, of higher-dimensional simplexes) is the starting object of algebraic topology. This allows the characterization of the properties of surfaces in terms of purely algebraic invariants, such as the genus and homology groups. The homeomorphism classes of surfaces have been completely described (see Surface (topology)).

At the end of the 19th century students at the Camborne School of Mines spent much of their time doing practical mining and tin dressing work in the local tin mines. The industry was almost in terminal decline and the surviving mines were falling behind technically. This was hardly ideal from the instruction point of view. The only real solution was for Camborne School of Mines to have its own underground mine. South Condurrow Mine In 1897, Camborne School of Mines took over the abandoned eastern part of the South Condurrow Mine around the engine shaft of the same name. This offered the opportunity to work both William's Lode and the Great Flat Lode down to 400 feet from surface. No pumping was necessary as all water in the mine drained into the then working Grenville mine to the south. Between 1897 and 1906 the mine was almost totally re-equipped based on what was then the best of Cornish mining and milling practice. Engine Shaft and William's Shafts were re-equipped, the underground workings cleared and a number of surface building erected including a complete modern full-scale tin dressing plant, survey office, workshops, and lecture rooms. The original Count House (i.e. offices) and changehouse facilities were retained. The mine was operated semi-commercially and produced tin on a regular basis, employing some 10‚Äì20 men in addition to the college teaching staff. Much of the production work was carried out by students. In 1901, it was renamed King Edward Mine. Cornish mines, due to conservatism and a lack of cash, were slow to adopt the mechanised dressing equipment and methods which were developed at the end of the 19th century. Most dressing plants of that period merely allowed the pulp coming from the Cornish stamps to settle in long launders from where it was dug out for final treatment in buddles and kieves ‚Äì a labour-intensive and inefficient process. Dolcoath Mine was probably the most progressive mine in the county and the first Californian stamps were erected there around 1892 to be followed by the first vanners and shaking tables about 1898. The mill at King Edward Mine was one of the first Cornish dressing plants to be designed from new to use this new equipment. Great Condurrow Mine Engine House Great Condurrow (also known as Pendarves United) stopped working in July 1881. The post-war slump in 1921 saw the closure of Wheal Grenville which resulted in the flooding of King Edward Mine. Mining operations were transferred, albeit on a far smaller scale, to the adjacent Great Condurrow Mine, to the north, a small portion of which was above the natural drainage level. This underground facility is still used by the Camborne School of Mines. Over the years as mining education became more technical, the tin dressing machinery was replaced with pilot scale equipment. In 1974 the pilot plant was transferred to the new School of Mines Trevenson Campus at Pool and the 'mill complex' part of the site which included the mill, stamps, mill engine house, boiler house and the calciner had been largely stripped of their equipment and were no longer required for educational purposes. Museum In 1987 a group was formed with a view to turning the mill complex into a museum. The objectives of the group can be summarised as follows: #To preserve the buildings and the site, which is of significant historical importance. #To re- equip the mill to working condition using, where possible, rescued and preserved equipment which itself is of historical interest. #To establish a small museum telling the story of King Edward Mine, the local \\"Flat Lode\\" mining area, tin dressing etc. #To rescue and to preserve industrial plant and equipment relevant to Cornish industry. Holmans Rock Drill from 1955 (from vol. 55 of CSM Magazine) Supported by the School of Mines a team of volunteers, mainly drawn from the Carn Brea Mining Society, have spent in excess of 10,000 hours on the project. Much material and equipment has been loaned or donated and the mill has been largely returned to a working condition, substantially as it would have been in the early years of the 20th century. King Edward Mine is the oldest complete mining site left in Cornwall. Whilst designed for education purposes it demonstrates, on a small scale, all that would have been found on the best Cornish mine at the turn of the century. This has been recognised by English Heritage who have listed the whole site Grade II*. Trevithick Trust In mid-2000 the Trevithick Trust leased the \\"museum/mill\\" part of the site from the Camborne School of Mines. After major building repairs, funded by a European grant as part of the Mineral Tramways Project, the site was officially opened to the public on 28 April 2002. Today the visitor can see the newly re-collared Engine shaft and a small museum in what was the mill engine room which tells the story of the site, mining techniques and tin dressing, as well as providing an introduction to the human side of the site. The mine was intensively photographed by the Cornish photographer J.C. Burrow throughout its construction and development period and is certainly the most photographed mine of its size in Cornwall. Many of these photographs are used in the museum displays. A guided tour of the mill is also available. Here can be seen the Californian stamps (erected in 1901) which are the only full size set in existence in the UK and probably in Europe. They are complete and in original condition. Much of the machinery in the mill is demonstrated working. Buildings Elsewhere on the site, but not currently open to the public are: * The mine office ‚Äì the only 'Count House' in Cornwall still used for the purpose for which it was built in the 1860s. * The timber framed and panelled Survey Office ‚Äì a classic structure of which no other examples remain in Cornwall. * The carpenters' shop, blacksmith's shop, vanning room and the original miners 'dry'. * The cobbled 'spalling' floor, which probably dates from about 1865 when the mine was predominantly a copper producer, which is one of the better examples remaining in Cornwall. Open days The mine holds an annual open day as a celebration of mining in Cornwall, the day after Camborne's Trevithick day. In 2009 it is held on 26 April and features local brass bands and dancers as well as demonstrations of vanning, vintage tractors, cars and stationary engines, a model railway exhibition and mine models.King Edward Mine open day References External links *King Edward Mine. *Camborne School of Mines at the University of Exeter, Cornwall Campus.

It is the only surviving maker of custom car mascots from the art deco era of the 1920s and 1930s when many new cars were fitted with a mascot.  History  The company was founded in London in 1910 as AE Lejeune (AEL), by a French silversmith Emil Lejeune and his wife Augustine (known as \\"Mimi\\"), who had arrived in England from Paris in 1904. The company initially made small ornamental bronze sculptures and architectural fittings. It later found a market for car mascots, the first of these was probably the \\"Speed Nymph\\", the design for which was registered in 1917. Lejeune went on to commission mascots from sculptors such as Frederic Bazin and Charles Paillet. In 1926, they moved premises from Hallam Street to Great Portland Street. By 1929, AEL was being described as \\"the world's largest motor car mascot manufacturer\\". They were commissioned by leading British motor manufacturers to produce their official mascots; these included the Star, Crossley, Alvis, Rolls-Royce and Bentley. Upon Lejeune's death in 1933, his 25-year-old son, his son took over and renamed the company, although \\"Mimi\\" was appointed chairman and managing director. In 1940, Louis Lejeune was in France during the Battle of France and did not return to England until 1945, when he replaced his mother as managing director. Louis Lejeune's died in 1978, and the company passed to his English widow, Eloise. In 1978 the business was bought by the export executive and amateur sculptor Sir David Hughes. The Great Portland Street office and workshop had been reduced to a state of \\"Dickensian decrepitude\\" and Hughes moved the operation to Wilburton in Cambridgeshire where he set up a small investment casting foundry and workshop.

The film shows performers dressed in elaborate drag for several disconnected scenes, including a lipstick commercial, an orgy, and an earthquake. It premiered April 29, 1963 at the Bleecker Street Cinema in New York City. Because of its graphic depiction of sexuality, some venues refused to show Flaming Creatures, and in March 1964, police interrupted a screening and seized a print of the film. Jonas Mekas, Ken Jacobs, and Florence Karpf were charged, and the film was ruled to be in violation of New York's obscenity laws. Mekas and Susan Sontag mounted a critical defense of Flaming Creatures, and it became a cause c√©l√®bre for the underground film movement. Description Most of the film's characters are sexually ambiguous, including transvestites, intersex, and drag performers. Flaming Creatures is largely non-narrative, and its action is often interrupted by cutaways to close-ups of body parts.Siegel 1997, p. 95. The film opens with credit sequence set to the soundtrack of Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves AllMovie and the announcement that \\"Ali Baba comes today!\\". Two creatures laze in a garden and dance. In what Smith called the \\"smirching sequence\\", characters apply lipstick while a mock advertisement poses the question, \\"Is there lipstick that doesn't come off when you suck cocks?\\" Two creatures chase each other, and one throws the other to the ground.Hoberman 2008, pp. 11‚Äì7. Several creatures gather around her in a rape scene, which grows into a large orgy. The earth begins to quake, and the creatures collapse.Sitney 2002, pp. 335‚Äì6. A vampire resembling Marilyn Monroe climbs out of a coffin and drains some of the lifeless creatures. This reignites the action, and the creatures rise again to dance with one another. Production Smith shared an apartment with artist Marian Zazeela for a period in the early 1960s.Joseph 2008, p. 231. He published The Beautiful Book, a series of photographs with Zazeela that began to develop the aesthetic of Flaming Creatures. Smith conceived the film as a vehicle for Zazeela. However, she began working with composer La Monte Young and was unable to participate in Smith's project.Leffingwell, Kismaric & Heiferman 1997, p. 159. After she moved out, he became roommates with Tony Conrad and replaced Zazeela with Sheila Bick.Hoberman 2008, p. 24. He filmed Flaming Creatures in mid to late 1962. He held shoots during weekends on the roof of the Windsor Theatre, at 412 Grand Street in the Bronx. Dick Preston offered his loft above the theatre for use as a prop department and dressing room.Hoberman 2008, pp. 25‚Äì6. Smith had observed the effects of using out-of- date film working on Ken Jacobs' Star Spangled to Death and decided to use the technique after seeing Ron Rice's The Flower Thief.Sitney 2002, p. 335. He used stolen Army surplus Kodak Plus-X reversal film. The reels were out-of- date, giving parts of the film a foggy or high-contrast texture.Joseph 2008, p. 229. The film's working title was Pasty Thighs and Moldy Midriffs; Smith also considered using Flaking Moldy Almond Petals, Moldy Rapture, or Horora Femina.Hoberman 2008, p. 29. Smith made Flaming Creatures as a way to film \\"all the funniest stuff he could think of\\" and depict \\"different ideas of glamour.\\" He produced the film on a very low budget of $300. Smith shared an apartment with Tony Conrad, who produced the film's soundtrack. The two lived in a building on the Lower East Side, where Angus MacLise lived and Ren√© Rivera (later known as Mario Montez) moved. They held informal group sessions during the evening which Conrad recorded. The soundtrack incorporates \\"Siboney\\" by Ernesto Lecuona, \\"Amapola\\" by Joseph Lacalle, and various pasodobles. Smith began screening unfinished versions of Flaming Creatures to friends. Piero Heliczer held a benefit for the film at painter Jerry Joffen's loft. Mekas discussed a private screening of the film through his column in The Village Voice, and Conrad produced a second version of the soundtrack for the film's theatrical premiere.Leffingwell, Kismaric & Heiferman 1997, p. 161. Release history =Early screenings= Flaming Creatures premiered April 29, 1963 as part of a double feature with Blonde Cobra at the Bleecker Street Cinema in Manhattan, New York. Later screenings were held at the Gramercy Theatre. Because the film had not been submitted for licensing, the shows were free and audiences were asked to donate to the \\"Love and Kisses for Censors Film Society\\". Film Culture voted in December 1963 to award Smith its Independent Film Award for the film. It rented the Tivoli Theatre, known for showing sexploitation films, and planned a screening of Flaming Creatures, excerpts from Smith's Normal Love, and Andy Warhol's Newsreel. The theatre canceled the event due to the obscene content in Flaming Creatures. Several hundred people gathered at the theatre, and Smith was given his award in an impromptu ceremony. A crowd of several hundred people led by Barbara Rubin occupied the Tivoli until police could clear the building.Leffingwell, Kismaric & Heiferman 1997, pp. 161‚Äì2. At the third Knokke Experimental Film Festival, the selection committee rejected Flaming Creatures out of concern that it fell afoul of Belgium's obscenity laws. In protest, Mekas resigned from the festival jury, and several American filmmakers threatened to withdraw their films. Mekas smuggled in the film in a canister for Stan Brakhage's Dog Star Man and held continuous private screenings out of his hotel. On New Year's Eve, Mekas, Rubin, and P. Adams Sitney forced their way into a projection booth and screened a portion of the film.Siegel 1997, p. 91. =Obscenity trial and censorship= Jonas Mekas was among those arrested and prosecuted for screening the film. In February 1964, the Film-Makers' Cinematheque successfully showed the films from the Tivoli program at the New Bowery Theater, as a program titled \\"Our Infamous Surprise Program\\". During the program's third showing on March 3, police stopped the event while Flaming Creatures was being screened. They arrested Mekas, Ken Jacobs, Florence Karpf, and Jerry Sims and seized the film reels and projection equipment. The police department did not return the only print of Warhol's film, about the making of Normal Love, and it is now considered lost. Mekas held a benefit screening of Un chant d'amour to raise money for a legal defense fund but was arrested again.Hoberman and Rosenbaum 1983, p. 60. Civil rights lawyer Emile Zola Berman accepted the case, believing it would potentially reach the U.S. Supreme Court.Hoberman 2008, p. 44. Sims, who had been taking tickets, managed to avoid prosecution by claiming he had not seen what was on the screen.MacDonald 1998, p. 375. People of the State of New York v. Kenneth Jacobs, Florence Karpf and Jonas Mekas was heard on June 12, 1964.Hoberman 2008, pp. 44‚Äì6. As part of the defense, expert testimony came from filmmaker Shirley Clarke, poet Allen Ginsberg, writer Susan Sontag, filmmaker Willard Van Dyke and film historian Herman G. Weinberger.Pierson 2011, p. 8. The defendants were convicted but given suspended sentences. They appealed on the grounds that the trial had excluded the expert testimony provided. The New York Supreme Court heard the appeal and reversed the convictions. It stated in its opinion that \\"whatever view this Court might hold as to the obscenity of 'Flaming Creatures,' it is manifest that the appellants herein believe in good faith that the film is not obscene.\\"Pierson 2011, p. 20. Fifty years later, the prosecutor for the case issued an apology to Mekas, writing, \\"Although my appreciation of free expression and aversion to censorship developed more fully as I matured, I should have sooner acted more courageously.\\" In April 1965, an off-campus screening by students of the University of New Mexico was raided by police, who seized the print. In November 1966, a screening by the UT Austin chapter of Students for a Democratic Society was broken up.Hoberman 2008, p. 46. A January 1967 screening at the University of Michigan resulted in the confiscation of the film and the arrest of four students, triggering protests and a sit-in by students.Leffingwell, Kismaric & Heiferman 1997, pp. 162‚Äì3. A screening at the University of Notre Dame at its Pornography and Censorship Conference in 1969 was canceled. When students attempted to screen prohibited films, police interrupted the event, leading to the school's first known violent conflict between police and students.Su√°rez 1996, p. 183. =Later history= Smith and Mekas fell out, with Smith accusing Mekas of stealing the original Flaming Creatures print on behalf of Anthology Film Archives.Leffingwell, Kismaric & Heiferman 1997, p. 81. Smith was opposed to giving his works a fixed form, preferring to continue re-editing his films. The print was lost until 1978, when Jerry Tartaglia found it in a discarded pile of scrap and returned it to Smith.Leffingwell, Kismaric & Heiferman 1997, p. 208. It was not until after Smith's death in 1989 that larger institutions started to screen Flaming Creatures. Critic J. Hoberman and performer Penny Arcade saved Smith's belongings and had a restoration of the film made, a project which took five years. The New York Film Festival showed the film in 1991, and the Museum of the Moving Image included it in a 1997 retrospective of Smith's work. Senate use and effect on Fortas' Supreme Court nomination In 1968, Abe Fortas was nominated to be Chief Justice of the United States. Fortas had supported reversing the original convictions for screening Flaming Creatures, so Senator James Eastland, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, requested that the print seized at the University of Michigan be sent to Washington. James Clancy, representing Citizens for Decent Literature, showed the film among other material, inviting senators to view what Fortas had held in several decisions did not constitute obscenity.Silverstein 2007. Nixon adviser Pat Buchanan credited the effort with ruining Fortas' nomination. Reception Ken Kelman described Flaming Creatures as a Miltonian \\"ancient ritual chant‚Ä¶not for the Paradise Lost, but for the Hell Satan gained.\\" Arthur Knight called the film a \\"faggoty stag-reel ... defiling at once both sex and cinema.\\" Pete Hamill described it as \\"a sophomoric exercise in the kind of sex that Henry Miller dealt with 30 years ago.\\" Following the seizure of the film, the director of the Homosexual League of New York called Flaming Creatures \\"long, disturbing and psychologically unpleasant\\".Leffingwell, Kismaric & Heiferman 1997, p. 74. Amos Vogel likened it to a film noir that \\"despite flashes of brilliance and moments of perverse, tortured beauty\\" was full of \\"limp genitalia and limp art.\\" Susan Sontag praised the film in a 1966 essay as a \\"rare modern work of art: it is about joy and innocence.\\"Sontag 2001, p. 229. P. Adams Sitney described Flaming Creatures as \\"a myth of recovered innocence\\" in which Smith \\"utterly transforms his sources and uncovers a mythic center from which they had been closed off.\\"Sitney 2002, pp. 335‚Äì7. Jonathan Rosenbaum called the film \\"one of the greatest and most pleasurable avant-garde movies ever made\\". According to The Village Voice Film Guide, Gregory Markopoulos \\"was only slightly exaggerating when he commented that ... early audiences were astounded when their secret Hollywood fantasies burst upon the screen\\".Hoberman 2010, p. 115. It is listed in the film reference book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, which says \\"The film's distinctive beauty is due largely to Smith's nimble use of the handheld camera. His unexpected framings yield dense images of fabrics, body parts, and heavily made-up faces.\\" Having never seen the original film, video artist Bec Stupak created a \\"remake\\" of Flaming Creatures in 2006 based only on descriptions of the film. Todd Haynes alludes to the film with a fictional band named the Flaming Creatures in his 1998 feature Velvet Goldmine.Morrison 2007, p. 66.

Career and research Day was a pioneer of materials chemistry, seeking unusual physical properties in inorganic and metal‚Äìorganic compounds and models to explain them. He played a major role in the development of mixed-valence chemistry, and has carried out important and elegant experimental and theoretical work on the spectra, magnetic properties and conductivity of solid, inorganic complexes. One or more of the preceding sentences incorporates text from the royalsociety.org website where: As a young researcher, he gave the first theoretically consistent description of the visible‚Äìultraviolet spectra of vitamin B12 and its derivatives. Later, he put the assignment of inorganic charge-transfer spectra on a more rigorous basis; he correlated structures and physical properties of metal chain compounds and identified the first optically transparent ferromagnetic compounds by combined optical and neutron scattering methods. He also measured and systematised the optical properties of metamagnets. Peter Day's graduate work initiated the study of mixed-valence compounds and led to the Robin-Day Classification of such species.Robin, Melvin B. and Day, Peter., \\"Mixed Valence Chemistry\\", Advances in Inorganic Chemistry and Radiochemistry, 1967, volume 10, pages 247‚Äì422.

Early life France was born in Sheffield, and emigrated to Australia in March 1972. He studied at the National Academy of Rudimentary Drummers of Australia until 1974, under tutor Harry Lebler. At the age of fifteen, he began to teach at the Australian Academy of Music (1974‚Äì1975). Career While living and travelling in Australia, France formed the jazz-fusion group, Carnival, performed at the Oz Jazz Festival, and supported John McLaughlin. He worked with Stevie Wright of the Easybeats, Marty Rhone, Tim Gaze, and other major Australian artists. He amassed over 1,000 television, radio, and advertising credits, including eight documentaries and four film scores, including Band on the Run, one of the most successful surfing films ever made. France left Australia in 1982 to return to England, where he joined Diamond Head the following year. Part of the NWOBHM movement, they performed at Castle Donington Monsters of Rock, then went on to record their third album, Canterbury. He played on the hit single \\"Making Music\\". Despite the bitter end of Diamond Head, France had nothing but good memories of band members Sean Harris and Brian Tatler. France stated, \\"I was a green, rather naive kid from Brisbane who was suddenly on stage in front of 90,000 people baying for metal... they got us', referring to the new sound of DH reflected in the recordings of Canterbury. Poorly managed and seemingly drifting between genres of the music of the time, Diamond Head imploded and split.\\" It was at this point where France was noticed as an extraordinary player. He performed at the first triple headliner drum clinic with Simon Phillips & Steve White, worked with Motown UK's C.E.O., 'Ivan Chandler's All Star Quintet' alongside Andy Hamilton. Also in the quintet were Spike Edney, and Mike Ashley. Playing at various venues around London, including Nick Rhodes' wedding party. In 1984 France toured with UFO, replacing Andy Parker. Leaving UFO in 1985, he formed One Nation with Kipper (now Sting's producer). France stated, 'Kipper is a true genius. That's such an overused clich√© in our business, but with Kip it's clear he knew he was special and eventually he proved to everybody he was right. I loved him then... and I still do.' They worked together at Tony Visconti's studio in Soho, London on a fabulous array of recordings. One Nation were being managed by Bill Lawrie, a well-known figure in the music trade. But the crunch came when France's wife, Annette, was asked to leave One Nation and he felt compelled to leave with her. By now France was also teaching in drum clinics, usually on behalf of the Avedis Zildjian cymbal company. He set up a teaching studio in Kingston upon Thames, where he worked with Gary O'Toole, Hugo Degenhardt, Gary Wallis, Mike + The Mechanics, Power Station, 10cc, Jean Michel Jarre, The Style Council, Gary Ferguson, Mark Price, Tim Burgess, touring through Europe & the UK as support act with Ellis, Beggs & Howard. France had started writing for magazines in Australia, at the age of fifteen. During 1987, he began a monthly column for the British drummer's magazine Rhythm. In 1987, France joined Ellis, Beggs, & Howard (E.B.H.), whose first single, \\"Big Bubbles No Troubles\\", won the Diamond Award for best new group. It was around this time that France was asked to fill in for drummer Frank Tontoh with jazz saxophonist Jean Toussaint. Meeting up to open a venue called The Soho Jazz Shack, Jean asked France to play with him on a more permanent basis, as he (Toussaint) had a regular slot at the Dingwalls club in Camden Town on Sunday afternoons. After E.B.H., in 1990 France joined Wishbone Ash, with whom he toured and commenced the recording of the album Strange Affair. However, friction occurred between France and Wishbone Ash bassist Martin Turner, resulting in France's dismissal from the band. He was replaced by Ray Weston, who was one of his students. He then joined Anxious Records' band, Pleasure, touring as support act to the Eurythmics. By this time, however, France felt too drained to commit to any more touring or recording work. In 1991, after working with Simon Ellis (East 17, D:Ream, S Club 7) and others, on the set pieces for his popular drum clinics, France returned to Australia to form a solo jazz project, The Gab. Based loosely as a tribute to the jazz greats Elvin Jones and John Coltrane, their first album was recorded at EMI Studio 301 in July 1993. In 1994, he returned to London, ostensibly to promote the solo project where he became a founder member of Skunk Anansie and recorded and co-produced their debut album Paranoid & Sunburnt. He co-wrote the hit track \\"Weak\\", which has since been covered by Rod Stewart. He also recorded the B-side, \\"Army of Me\\", with Bj√∂rk. France left Skunk Anansie in 1995, joining the German group Alphaville the next day. He toured and recorded with Alphaville until an accident in which he severed his Achilles tendon. He lived in Poland for over two years, hosting his own radio programme, and appearing on various television shows. In 1998, he moved to Mazarr√≥n, Spain, to concentrate on writing his first novel. He was running Pulpo Negro Records, Pulpo Negro Publishing, Pulpo Negro Studios, GCBC Productions, with his partner, Tim Oldfield up until 2004. He produced the award-winning Spanish bands Second, Renochild, and Blue Aliens Temple, as well as Screw Coco. He also produced, wrote, and arranged for London-based artist Keke. France broadcast for a number of different radio stations in Spain over the last decade including Costa Calida International and TKO Gold. His most recent preoccupation was a return to radio broadcasting for both Real Radio 95.6 FM in Torrevieja on the Costa Blanca and One Radio Spain on the Costa Calida, providing simulcasts between the two Costas. France's first novel, Six Degrees South was published on 7 December 2011. Death France died on 14 January 2012 in Spain after reportedly suffering a ruptured aorta. He was 52.

He was also a former Academy Coach at Football League Championship side Derby County. As a player, he was a striker from 1993 to 2010, notably playing in the Premier League for Leeds United, Coventry City, and Middlesbrough. He also played in the Scottish Premier League with Aberdeen, Livingston, and Dunfermline Athletic, and in the Football League for Crystal Palace, Millwall, Derby County, Boston United, and Darlington. He also had spell in Non-league football with Harrogate Town and was capped twice by England U21, scoring once. Playing career =Leeds United= Born in Leeds, Whelan started off with his professional career at home town team Leeds United. Whelan revealed he had held out for Leeds to sign him (the club he supports) after having trials at Arsenal, Manchester United, and Everton F.C., coming through the Leeds youth team with a number of other talented youngsters who beat a Manchester United team boasting David Beckham, Paul Scholes, Nicky Butt, Keith Gillespie, Phil Neville and Gary Neville both home and away in the F.A. Youth Cup Final. Turning professional in March 1993, he made his debut in the first season of the FA Premier League, in a 1‚Äì1 draw at Sheffield Wednesday on 4 May 1993. The following season, he made 16 league appearance but failed to score. He had a promising 1994‚Äì95 season, finishing among the club's highest scorers where he scored seven goals in 23 league games, but lost his place to new signing Tony Yeboah halfway through the season. During his time at Leeds, he was capped twice by the England U-21 side in 1994, scoring once. =Coventry City= On 16 December 1995, after making eight goalless appearances in the league 1995‚Äì96 season, Whelan was signed by Coventry City manager Ron Atkinson for ¬£2million. Atkinson's assistant Gordon Strachan, who had joined Coventry from Leeds the previous season, played a big role in securing the signing. Whelan made his debut in midfield in a 4‚Äì1 local derby defeat against Aston Villa at Villa Park. In his second game, against Everton at Coventry's Highfield Road stadium, Whelan played as a striker alongside Dion Dublin, and scored the winning goal with a cool finish, which would become his trademark for the rest of the season. Further goals came in the away win at Burnden Park against Bolton Wanderers, and in the New Year's Day home draw with Southampton. The latter was a \\"Goal of the Month\\" contender on the BBC's Match of the Day. It saw Whelan dribble the ball from just inside the Southampton half, and beat several players before shooting past the keeper. By the end of that season, he had managed eight goals from 21 league games for the Sky Blues, who secured Premier League safety by finishing 16th. Whelan played regularly for the Sky Blues throughout the 1996‚Äì97 season without providing the spark of the previous season, as the club again struggled to avoid relegation, with Ron Atkinson becoming director of football and Gordon Strachan being promoted to the manager's seat in November. His reputation as the bright young thing was usurped by his new strike partner Darren Huckerby. Whelan still managed six goals from 35 league games that season. The Sky Blues' form improved markedly in the 1997‚Äì98 season as they rose to mid-table respectability in the Premiership under manager Gordon Strachan, with Noel Whelan playing a key role in midfield. With Dublin and Huckerby scoring regularly upfront, Whelan played in a wide left midfield role, scoring the opener in a notable home win over Manchester United, and the home draw with Arsenal. Whelan started the 1998‚Äì99 season in midfield, but moved back upfront following the departure of Dion Dublin to Aston Villa. Back in an attacking position, Whelan struck up a good partnership with Darren Huckerby, bringing his best goal return (10 in 31 Premier League games) in the process, and prompting some Coventry City fans to demand his inclusion in the England national team squad. Coventry fans were expecting a great deal of the Whelan-Huckerby partnership in the 1999‚Äì2000 season but were to be disappointed as first Whelan sustained a bad injury in pre-season and Huckerby was sold to Leeds United. Whelan would miss most of the first half of the season as Gordon Strachan built an exciting new team featuring Robbie Keane, and the Moroccan duo Moustapha Hadji and Youssef Chippo. Whelan did manage to get back into the team near the end of the season but it was clear he was no longer first choice, with Keane and Cedric Roussel establishing themselves as first choice strikers. Whelan made a total of 124 league appearances for Coventry in nearly five years there, scoring 31 goals. =Middlesbrough= On 4 August 2000, Whelan was sold to Bryan Robson's Middlesbrough for ¬£2.2million. His debut was at Highfield Road as a substitute in Boro's 3‚Äì1 victory on the opening day of the 2000‚Äì01 season. The three-year spell with Boro would be the last time Whelan would feature prominently for a club for more than one season. He did, however, enjoy a brilliant run of form, possibly the best of his career, which includes a goal against Manchester United in the FA Cup fourth round in Middlesbrough's 2‚Äì0 victory, after which he celebrated by simply giving the \\"Leeds Salute\\", because of his love of the West Yorkshire club and their bitter rivalry with his opponents that day. He also scored an own goal against his former club Coventry on his 26th Birthday. The match ended up in a 1‚Äì1 draw. He had limited chances in the league, though, appearing in just 19 out of Middlesbrough's 38 Premier League matches in the 2001‚Äì02 season, scoring four times. He would appear 15 times for Middlesbrough in the 2002‚Äì03 league campaign, scoring once. =Later career= Following a short loan spell with Crystal Palace, where he netted three times in eight appearances, Whelan left Middlesbrough to join Millwall, managing four goals in fifteen appearances. Whelan left Millwall and signed for his fourth club that season, joining Derby County. The goalless spell at Derby saw Whelan sign for Scottish club Aberdeen at the start of the 2004‚Äì05 season and he would score five times in twenty appearances for the Pittodrie side. His one-year contract passed without renewal and Whelan moved back to England to start the 2005‚Äì06 season at Football League Two club Boston United, where he scored four goals in fifteen games. Following his admission to the Sporting Chance alcoholism treatment clinic in early January 2006, Whelan left Boston and spend the last two months of the season in the Scottish Premier League with Livingston, where he couldn't prevent the side from being relegated into the Scottish First Division. He scored once during his spell at Livingston in a 2‚Äì1 defeat at Motherwell. Whelan stayed in the Scottish Premier League, as he signed a one-year contract with Dunfermline Athletic in July 2006, making his first competitive start on 29 July against Heart of Midlothian in a 2‚Äì1 defeat. Unfortunately, he had to leave the field injured after just three minutes. After six months out injured Dunfermline terminated their contract with Whelan by mutual consent on 4 January 2007. The following day's papers linked him with a move to First Division leaders Gretna to spearhead them in their charge for Scottish Premier League football. Since then Whelan has assisted in coaching at Dunfermline, whilst studying for coaching badges; he is said to be interested in a career in management. He joined Conference North side Harrogate Town on 11 December 2008. In October 2009, Whelan joined League Two's bottom-placed side Darlington on non-contract basis, to become new manager Steve Staunton's first signing. He made his debut for Darlington against third-placed Dagenham & Redbridge on 10 October but he was substituted by Curtis Main before half-time because of a muscle strain injury, in a game which Darlington lost 2‚Äì0. He did not play again for Darlington until 26 January, more than three months after his debut, when he came on as a second- half substitute against Northampton Town. However, his comeback lasted only two minutes, before he himself was substituted because of a hamstring injury. Coaching career Whelan holds a UEFA B coaching Licence. Whelan first started his coaching career as a player coach at Dunfermline Athletic. After his playing career came to an end Whelan worked as a youth team coach at one of his former clubs Derby County, but after more than 12 months as a coach at Derby, Whelan decided that his commute from Harrogate was too much of a strain. Since leaving his role at Derby Whelan has been involved in the hospitality circuit at another of his former clubs Coventry City. On 17 November 2010, Whelan revealed he has put his name forward for a role working within Leeds United's academy. Leeds are the club who Whelan supports and also who gave him the chance to become a professional footballer. After playing and captaining Leeds United in the Yorkshire Masters Tournament, which Leeds won. Whelan revealed he was going to help coach at Derby County's academy after turning down a coaching role at Nottingham Forest. In April 2019, Whelan joined EFL Championship side Leeds United as a coach for Leeds United Development Hub for elite player development scholarship. Radio career/TV Career Whelan competed in an episode of Celebrity MasterChef broadcast in 2008, but was eliminated in the first round. From the 2013/14 football season, he became the co-commentator alongside Commentator Adam Pope and Katherine Hannah for BBC Radio Leeds coverage of all Leeds United games, with Whelan becoming synonymous for a catchphrase of 'Get in' every time Leeds scored. During the 2017/18 season, Whelan as well as working for BBC, Whelan also sporadically features on Sky Sports News as an in-studio summariser for football matches. On 31 January 2018, Whelan also featured in a two part documentary exclusive to Leeds United's TV channel LUTV called 'I Wore The Shirt'.

Traveling north-south through Western North Carolina, it connects the cities and towns of Grover, Shelby, Marion, Spruce Pine and Bakersville. It also a scenic byway in the South Mountains area and connects with the summer colony of Little Switzerland, via NC 226A.  Route description  NC 226 in downtown Grover NC 226 begins at US 29, in Grover, approximately from the South Carolina state line. Through downtown Grover, it goes northwesterly, through Patterson Springs, to Shelby. In concurrency with US 74, it stays south of the downtown area, then splits with US 74 continuing north to Metcalf, where it becomes the South Mountain Scenery scenic byway. The byway, which stretches along NC 226 to Marion, is designated for its extensive views of the South Mountains. Traversing through this rural area of farmlands and forest, NC 226 goes the through Campcall and Polkville before leaving Cleveland County, uneventful through Rutherford County, and crosses over US 64 before reaching the Dysartsville community in McDowell County. Soon after crossing under I-40 (exit 86), NC 226 begins its concurrency with US 221 bypassing west of downtown Marion. At the US 70 intersection, travelers can follow highway signs to Mount Mitchell, the highest peak east of the Mississippi River. In Woodlawn, NC 226 splits from US 221, which continues towards Linville. A from the intersection, in Turkey Cove, NC 226 breaks-off the first of two alternate routes; NC 226A travels the historic Etchoe Pass Road, as it climbs, with several hairpin turns, up Grassy Mountain to Little Switzerland. The routing NC 226 takes, along Cox Creek, is shorter and less curvy than the alternate route, but it has a steep grade which require trucks to stay slow when they descend; one runaway truck ramp and several turn-offs are along this stretch. At Gillespie Gap, the alternate route rejoins NC 226. As it crosses under the Blue Ridge Parkway, it also crosses the Eastern Continental Divide and the county line into Mitchell. North from the Gillespie Gap, NC 226 goes through the Grassy Creek community before entering Spruce Pine. After a short concurrency with US 19E, it continues northwesterly towards Bakersville, passing by and through the communities of Minpro, Penland, Normanville and Ledger. Near Bakersville, the second alternate route breaks-off; NC 226A, along Mine Creek Road, provides a bypass route instead of going through downtown area, reconnecting at Loafers Glory. In Bakersville, NC 226 connects with NC 261, which continues to Roan Mountain. West of Bakersville, NC 226 connects with NC 197, in Red Hill, then goes north to Honeycutt. Following along Big Rock Creek to Buladean, it then goes northwesterly alongside Spring Creek before ascending Iron Mountain. At Iron Mountain Gap (), NC 226 crosses the Appalachian Trail as it enters Tennessee and continues as SR 107 towards Erwin.  History  Established in 1961 as a renumbering of NC 26. In 1966, NC 226 was removed from downtown Shelby, rerouted from Earl Street onto US 74 Bypass to Polkville Road. In 1994, NC 226 was moved with US 221 onto a new bypass west of Marion, leaving US 221 Business. In 2000, NC 226 was realigned onto new road west of downtown Spruce Pine. = North Carolina Highway 26 = The first NC 26 was established as an original state highway in 1921. It traversed from the South Carolina stat line, near Pineville, north along Park Road into downtown Charlotte. Leaving the downtown area via Statesville Avenue, it continued north through Huntersville, Davidson, Mooresville, Statesville, Elkin, Sparta, and finally Twin Oaks, before finally reaching the Virginia state line. In both border states, the highway continued with the number 26. In 1927, US 21 was assigned in concurrency with all of NC 26, except for a few miles south of Pineville. In 1933, US 521 was assigned to the remaining piece of NC 26. In 1934, the first NC 26 was decommissioned, and the route remained US 21 and US 521. The second NC 26 was quickly reestablished in late 1934, replacing NC 19 from US 221 in Woodlawn, north through Little Switzerland, Spruce Pine, Bakersville, Red Hill, and then finally west to US 19W/US 23 in Sioux. In 1940, NC 26 was rerouted north from Red Hill to the Tennessee state line. Also in 1940, NC 26 was extended south, overlapping with US 221 to Marion; it then replaced NC 190 through Polkville and Shelby, ending at US 29 in Grover. Around 1947, NC 26 was moved onto new road bypassing Little Switzerland; the old route became NC 26A. In 1956, NC 26 was moved onto new road near Dysartville, removing a concurrency with US 64 and establishing one of the earliest grade-separated intersections in the state.

The policy lasted for fifteen years (833‚Äì848 CE) as it continued through the reigns of al-Ma'mun's immediate successors, al-Mu'tasim and al- Wathiq, and two years of al-Mutawakkil who reversed it in 848 (or possibly 851) . The abolition of Mihna is significant both as the end of the Abbasid Caliph's pretension to decide matters of religious orthodoxy, and as one of the few instances of specifically religious persecution in Medieval Islam. Under al-Ma'mun Map of the Mihna and events associated with it In 827 CE, the caliph al-Ma‚Äômun issued the proclamation of the doctrine of the createdness of the Qur'an. The proclamation was followed by the institution of the Mihna six years later, approximately four months before his sudden death in 833 CE. The Mihna continued under his successors, al-Mu‚Äôtasim and al- Wathiq, before al-Mutawakkil abolished it between 848 and 851 CE. This particular doctrine was well known to be embraced by the Mu'tazilite school during this period. Mu øtazilites believed that good and evil were not always determined by revealed scripture or interpretation of scripture, but they were rational categories that could be established through unaided reason. Traditional scholarship viewed the proclamation of doctrine and the Mihna where al-Ma‚Äômun tested the beliefs of his subordinates as linked events, whereby the caliph exercised his religious authority in defining orthodoxy, and enforced his views upon others through his coercive powers as ruler. Al- Ma‚Äômun's motivations for imposing his beliefs upon the members of his government (such as his judges, for the scope of the Mihna was not extended to examining the beliefs of the commoners in the manner of the European Inquisitions) were attributed to his Mu'tazilite intellectual tendencies, his sympathies towards Shi‚Äôism, or a shrewd decision to consolidate his religious authority during a time where the 'ulama were starting to be seen as the true guardians of religious knowledge and the Prophet's traditions. Events and Explanations Explanation 1: Al-Ma‚Äômun and Mu‚Äôtazilism Scholars who ascribe the Mihna to al-Ma'mun‚Äôs Mu'tazilite persuasion point to his close association with leading Mu‚Äôtazilites of the era. Among the Mu‚Äôtazilites al-Ma‚Äômun appointed to high positions within his administration include Ahmed ibn Abi Du‚Äôad, a prominent Mu‚Äôtazilite who became Chief Qadi during his rule. Due to Ibn Abi Du‚Äôad's background as a Kalam scholar and his rigorous advocacy of the Mihna under the subsequent two caliphs, some scholars have concluded that his influence led to al-Ma‚Äômun finally taking action and implementing the Mihna during the last year of his life. However it remains unclear whether the appointment of Ibn Abi Du‚Äôad is a cause or reflection of al-Ma‚Äômun's plans to institute the Mihna. Explanation 2: Al-Ma‚Äômun's Pro-Shi‚Äôite Tendencies More so than other caliphs, Al-Ma‚Äômun demonstrated a closeness with members of the Alid family and some of their doctrines, leading some scholars to suggest that he may have adopted some of their views. A distinguished religious scholar himself, al-Ma‚Äômun's letters to his prefects to initiate the inquisition seem to convey the notion that his knowledge and learning was at a higher level than that of the public or even other religious scholars, who were likened to the vulgar mob who have no insight or illumination on matters pertaining to God. This view is similar to the Shi‚Äôi belief that the Imam alone held the esoteric knowledge regarding the Qur'an and matters of faith. In addition to adopting the title of imam, Al-Ma‚Äômun extended special conciliatory gestures to the family of Alids, as evident in his designation of ‚ÄòAli al-Rida as his heir and the special reverence he held for ‚ÄòAli that he also made into a doctrine. Shi‚Äôism, like Mu‚Äôtazilism, embraced the doctrine of the createdness of the Qur'an, therefore some scholars construe al-Ma‚Äômun's declaration of this doctrine and the Mihna as reflections of his partiality to Shi‚Äôite doctrines, whereas suggesting that al-Mutawakkil's revocation of the edict was in part rooted in his antagonism towards the Alids. However, this depiction of using the createdness of Qur'an as a litmus test for Mu‚Äôtazilism or Shi‚Äôism can be misleading. While there is an overlap between the two schools of thought on this question, Mu‚Äôtazilism and Shi‚Äôism were not the only theological currents to subscribe to this belief, therefore there may not necessarily be a link between the two in the event of al-Ma‚Äômun's Mihna. Furthermore, it is inconclusive whether Shi‚Äôism during this period had fully embraced the notion of the createdness of the Qur'an, or whether it is a retrojection from later times after Sunni and Shi‚Äôism had developed its doctrines. While some scholars argue that the prevailing view among Shi‚Äôite theologians at this time followed the teachings of Ja‚Äôfar as-Sadiq, who believed in its uncreatedness, other sources challenge whether Imam Ja‚Äôfar as- Sadiq held such a view. Explanation 3: Mihna as an Assertion of Caliphal Authority Some of the more recent scholarship on the Mihna suggests that al- Ma‚Äômun may have used it as an opportunity to reassert caliphal authority on matters of religious doctrine. In a series of letters to his governors, al- Ma‚Äômun's elaborated on the caliph's role as the guardian of God's religion and laws. He appeared to draw upon the Shi‚Äôite notion that the caliph-imam alone possessed esoteric knowledge, and used this to emphasis his role as an educator to lead the people out of ignorance in religious matters. Al-Ma‚Äômun's Mihna appeared to be an effort to wrestle authority over religious knowledge from the scholars (‚Äòulama), notably from traditionalists such as Ahmed ibn Hanbal whose authority to interpret the religion was rooted in their expertise in the Prophet's traditions. However, in the longer trend of pre-modern Islamic history, religious authority would become the exclusive purview of the scholars, while the caliph was reduced first to a political authority, and gradually to a symbolic entity. This explanation for the Mihna is the position taken up by most modern scholars. Under al-Mu'tasim al-Ma'mun died in 833, but his policy was continued by al-Mu'tassim. In that same year the famous religious scholar Ahmad ibn Hanbal was put to the question, to which he answered that the Qu'ran was uncreated. Al-Mu'tassim removed him from his post, imprisoned him, and had him flogged until he was unconscious. However, the people of Baghdad threatened to riot at the news of ibn Hanbal's arrest, and al-Mu'tassim had him released. al-Mu'tassim was afterwards preoccupied with the construction of the new capital at Samarra and with military campaigns, and did not pursue the Mihna as anything more than a courtroom formality (the testimony of a person who answered in the negative was inadmissible in court.)  Aftermath  It is important to note that in classical Islam, it was private individuals and not the caliphate who undertook the mission of developing the various Islamic sciences including the law. That is, the law, contrary to what happens in modern nation states, was not the exclusive preserve of the state. In fact, the jurists developed it in conscious opposition to the state (e.g., Jackson, 2002). From early on, there was a religious order in classical Islam that was distinct from the political order. The semi-autonomy of the scholars resulted in the interesting phenomenon of the emergence of different, and regarding some issues, diametrically opposed schools of jurisprudence ‚Äî all considered Islamically valid and authentic. The Mihna, within this context, reflects the caliph's frustration with the powerful and influential juristic culture. It lasted about fifteen years, after which the domains of authority of both the political and religious orders became more well-defined. This does not mean that confrontation was the hallmark of the relationship between both orders. The relationship was more nuanced and involved not only confrontation but also collaboration. Generally speaking, the religious order stood as a buffer between the political order and the common people.

Long, Jr., and Earl Kemp Long.  Early life  Robert Maestri was born in New Orleans on December 11, 1899, the son of two Italians, Francesco Maestri and Angele (Lacabe) Maestri. He inherited his father's furniture store at an early age, and quickly built it up into one of the city's largest. After investing in real estate, Maestri was able to amass a considerable fortune. He also had political ambition, and after allying himself with governor Huey Long, he was appointed to head the state's Conservation Commission, which allowed him to control production quotas in the state's oil industry. He served as conservation commissioner from 1929 to 1936, and was a powerful member of Long's inner circle. In his autobiography, Huey Long recalls how Maestri volunteered to raise money to fight Long's impeachment by the Louisiana House of Representatives.Huey Pierce Long, Jr., Every Man a King: The Autobiography of Huey P. Long (New Orleans: National Book Club, Inc., 1933), pp. 146-157.  Rise to power  Maestri's association with the Longite political faction brought him to even greater prominence after Huey Long's death. Long had been involved in a lengthy and destructive feud with New Orleans Mayor T. Semmes Walmsley, and after his death, both sides were interested in ceasing hostilities. In 1936, an agreement was reached between Longite governor Richard Leche and Walmsley's Regular Democratic Organization, whereby Walmsley would resign as mayor before his term ended and Maestri would take his place as both mayor and as head of the powerful Old Regular political machine. In July 1936, Maestri was nominated as the Democratic candidate for mayor without opposition. After the Republican candidate withdrew in the face of almost certain defeat at the hands of a unified Longite-Old Regular machine, Maestri was acclaimed as mayor of New Orleans on August 17, 1936, without having to face election. A subsequent constitutional amendment was passed by the Longite state legislature cancelling the 1938 municipal election and extending Maestri's term to 1942.  Maestri as Mayor  Maestri poses with children during a 1938 tour of Works Progress Administration projects around the city Maestri graduated from Soule Business College. Maestri was a shrewd politician. He began the reintegration of New Orleans into the state's political structure by reorganizing the city's fiscal structure, ending the costly practice of borrowing money against anticipated tax revenue and streamlining purchasing and expenditures. He developed a popular personal governing style, going on daily tours of the city to pinpoint problems, and holding daily open sessions in which citizens could come to his office to explain their problems or request help. He used his connections with the Long machine in Baton Rouge to bring state and federal funds to the city, resulting in the construction of a new Charity Hospital and public housing projects for low-income New Orleanians. Once in City Hall, Maestri solidified his control by using spoils politics and patronage appointments, using Old Regular ward bosses to enforce loyalty and dispense patronage, and to guarantee votes for himself and for Longite candidates in local and state elections. With this powerful machine behind him, he was able to easily win reelection in 1942 against reform candidates Herve Racivitch and Shirley Wimberly, taking 75,713 votes out of a total of 137,000 votes cast. After this easy victory, though, Maestri retreated from his accessible governing style in his second term in order to spend more time running his Old Regular machine, which allowed city services to erode. With the mayor's attention elsewhere, the corruption and favoritism that already characterized his administration grew even further. Maestri and the Longites had reached a deal with mobster Frank Costello whereby the city would ignore slot-machine laws in exchange for a cut of the proceeds, so prostitution and illegal gambling flourished in New Orleans under Maestri's tenure. The growing problems of New Orleans in Maestri's second term were too much for the Old Regular machine to handle, and allowed young reformer deLesseps Story Morrison, Sr., to defeat Maestri in the mayoral election of January 1946. Morrison served until 1961. Maestri to the right of FDR at Antoine's  Personality  Maestri's most famous utterance came when dining with President Franklin Roosevelt on Oysters Rockefeller at New Orleans' famous Antoine's Restaurant, when Maestri blurted \\"How ya like dem erstuhs, Chief?\\" in his characteristic thick New Orleans accent.

Plot Alex Kovac, playing poker in New York City, drops $10,000 to gamblers Joey and Harry that he can't pay back. Alex persuades pal Jerry Feldman to hop on a plane to Las Vegas with him and try to win $10,000 to pay off the debt. Finding out that a similarly named Jerry Feldman is a regular there, Jerry is comped $10,000 by the casino, no questions asked. A room and other perks go along with the comp. A waiter named Smitty, an old acquaintance of Alex's, is an expert card-counter, so he is staked to a high-limit blackjack game by the guys. Patti Warner, a former girlfriend of Alex's, is now the mistress of the casino's boss.

Production The film was Voight's screenwriting debut. After initial delays, the film started principal photography in May 1980. Production was interrupted for five months due to an actors' strike. Director Ashby had notorious bouts with the studio and recut the film for himself before it was taken from his hands and recut by the studio. Years later, while speaking at the University of Southern California, Jon Voight discovered that the version of the film which had been shown to the students was not the theatrical version but instead Ashby's original cut (which was considered lost). This was brought to the attention of Warner Home Video who released the Ashby Director's Cut on DVD on June 30, 2009. Filming took place in Las Vegas, including the MGM Grand Las Vegas and Variety noted in their review the \\"shameless plugging for the MGM leisure palace and its entertainment shows (particularly Siegfried & Roy's magic acts).\\" Release The film was initially due to be released by United Artists but Lorimar's deal with UA expired before the film was released and Paramount Pictures acquired the film as part of a package to distribute Lorimar product. The film received poor reviews. Variety called it \\"an ill- conceived vehicle for actor (and cowriter) Jon Voight to showcase his character comedy talents in a loose, semi improvised environment.\\" They noted that \\"Voight and Young are an entertaining team, but presented in an untenable vehicle\\". The film was released on October 8, 1982 in 850 theaters and due to its poor performance, Lorimar made a $6.2 million write-off.

It was produced by Alan Silver and Raju Patel. Schroeder, Mark Geldman and Ron Yanover wrote the screenplay. The film is a direct sequel to 1989's Cyborg, starring Jean Claude Van Damme, and the second film in the trilogy. The film takes place in 2074, years after the original film, and follows Cash Reese, a new cyborg developed for corporate espionage and assassination. She rebels against her creators after revealing they plan to destroy her by using her as a suicide bomber to take over a rival company. On the way, she falls in love with her combat trainer and encounters a renegade cyborg. The film stars Angelina Jolie in the main role, alongside Elias Koteas, Jack Palance, Billy Drago, Karen Sheperd, Allen Garfield and Renee Griffin in supporting roles. Cyborg 2 was released by Trimark Pictures directly into video on November 24, 1993. A sequel titled Cyborg 3 was released in 1994.  Plot  In the year 2074, the cybernetics market is dominated by two rival companies: USA's Pinwheel Robotics and Japan's Kobayashi Electronics. ‚ÄòCyborgs‚Äô are commonplace, used for anything from soldiers to prostitutes. Casella \\"Cash\\" Reese is a Pinwheel prototype cyborg developed for corporate espionage and assassination. She is filled with a liquid explosive called \\"Glass Shadow\\". Pinwheel's CEO, Martin Dunn, plans to eliminate the entire Kobayashi board of directors using Cash as a suicide bomber to precipitate a hostile takeover of the company and obtain a monopoly over the cyborg market. Cash is programmed to mimic human senses and emotions such as fear, love, pain, and hate. Guided by Mercy, a renegade prototype cyborg who can communicate through any electronic device, Cash and her combat trainer Colton \\"Colt\\" Ricks escape the Pinwheel facility so Cash can avoid self-destruction, something that most corporate espionage cyborgs face. They are relentlessly pursued by Pinwheel's hired killer or \\"wiretapper\\", Daniel Bench. Bench must also deal with a rival bounty hunter named Chen, who plans on killing Ricks and reprogramming Cash to have her blow up Pinwheel instead as a means to punish the company's director, Dunn, as reprisal for an earlier act from Dunn that displeased her. However, Chen and Ricks get into a fight, which results in Chen getting electrocuted by a fuse box. Mercy is later revealed to be a human/android hybrid who was created by Pinwheel as an attempt to create the next stage in human evolution. Mercy escaped before they had a chance to erase his memories. Ricks and Bench fall into a boxing match to find out who lives and who dies, namely going to the African coast, which results in Bench getting mutilated by a rotating fan, resulting in his death. Cash and Ricks escape to a new life in Africa after winning the tournament, while Mercy confronts Dunn, blaming him for ruining his life. Dunn explains Mercy his motives to be his work only for the mankind's benefit. Unmoved, Mercy then activates his own Glass Shadow bomb, which kills both Mercy and Dunn as well as destroying Pinwheel headquarters. After the skirmish and Pinwheel's downfall, Cash has remained young and beautiful while Ricks continues to age. When Cash realizes that Ricks has finally died of old age, she decides to shut herself down, remaining in a dream state forever.

Reception  Alan Jones of the Radio Times rated the film 3 out of 5 stars and called it a \\"Blade Runner-inspired violent fantasy\\". Entertainment Weekly selected Cyborg 2 as Jolie's worst film. Jolie has said that after she saw the film, she \\"went home and got sick\\".  Sequel  Cyborg 3: The Recycler was produced and released in 1995, once again directed by Michael Schroeder.

Lincoln Square is centered on the intersection of Broadway and Columbus Avenue, between West 65th and West 66th streets. The neighborhood is bounded by Columbus Avenue and Amsterdam Avenue to the east and west, and West 66th and 63rd Street to the north and south. However, the term can be extended to refer to the neighborhood between West 59th Street and West 72nd Street. It is bounded by Hell's Kitchen, Riverside South, Central Park, and the Upper West Side proper. The studios for WABC-TV are located here. The area includes the 66th Street‚ÄìLincoln Center station, served by the New York City Subway's , and anchored by Lincoln Center, a performing-arts venue. Lincoln Square is part of Manhattan Community District 7 and its primary ZIP Code is 10023. It is patrolled by the 20th Precinct of the New York City Police Department.  History  Lincoln Square is located on the site of San Juan Hill, a predominantly African American neighborhood of tenements. San Juan Hill was generally bordered by Amsterdam Avenue to the east, West End Avenue to the west, 59th Street to the south, and 65th Street to the north. It has been suggested that the area was named after the 10th Cavalry that fought with Theodore Roosevelt at the Battle of San Juan Hill during the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, but this is not certain. It was possibly the most heavily populated African-American neighborhood in Manhattan in the early 20th century. One of the blocks within the neighborhood contained almost 5,000 residents. Notable residents had included Thelonious Monk, who came to live here in 1922. In addition to the significant African American community, there was also an Afro-Caribbean community there, which has left its traces in Bye-ya and Bemsha Swing compositions of Thelonious Monk, co-written much later with Denzil Best, who also grew up in this neighborhood. James P. Johnson also lived in the neighborhood in the 1910s and 1920s, during which time he created the \\"Charleston\\" dance. In 1940, the New York City Housing Authority characterized the area as \\"the worst slum section in the City of New York\\" and made plans to renew the area by demolishing the old tenements. The Amsterdam Housing Projects were built on the cleared land in 1948, replacing three blocks that had collectively housed 1,100 residents. During the 1950s and 1960s, a consortium of civic leaders and others led by John D. Rockefeller III built the Lincoln Center as part of the \\"Lincoln Square Renewal Project\\" during urban planner Robert Moses's program of urban renewals.\\"Rockefeller Philanthropy: Lincoln Center\\" (PDF format). Respected architects were contracted to design the major buildings on the site, and construction started in 1959. Over the next thirty years the previously blighted area around Lincoln Center became a new cultural hub.Roth, Leland M. (2001). American Architecture: A History. Boulder, Colo.: Westview Press. , . . Over 7,700 residents were displaced during the redevelopment project. The new developments contained 4,400 housing units, of which only a few were allocated to San Juan Hill's former residents. Most of the area's former residents instead moved to Harlem, another predominantly African American neighborhood in Upper Manhattan, as well as the Bronx. = Name = Lincoln Center was named after Lincoln Square. The reason for naming the area \\"Lincoln Square\\" is unknown, however. The name was bestowed on the area in 1906 by the New York City Board of Aldermen, but records give no reason for choosing that name. There has long been speculation that the name came from a local landowner, because the square was previously named Lincoln Square. City records from the time show only the names Johannes van Bruch, Thomas Hall, Stephan de Lancey, James de Lancey, James de Lancey Jr. and John Somerindyck as area property owners. The area may also have been named as a tribute to U.S. President Abraham Lincoln. One speculation is that references to President Lincoln were omitted from the records because the mayor in 1906 was George B. McClellan Jr., son of General George B. McClellan who was general-in-chief of the Union Army during the American Civil War and a bitter rival of Lincoln.  Demographics  Based on data from the 2010 United States Census, the population of Lincoln Square was 61,489, an increase of 6,250 (11.3%) from the 55,239 counted in 2000. Covering an area of , the neighborhood had a population density of .Table PL-P5 NTA: Total Population and Persons Per Acre ‚Äì New York City Neighborhood Tabulation Areas*, 2010, Population Division ‚Äì New York City Department of City Planning, February 2012.

It was Pitt's first major role. The film was released direct-to-video by Republic Pictures on July 17, 1989.  Plot  The plot revolves around the return of Brian Woods, a \\"problem teen\\". He has just been released from a mental hospital; he was admitted after the suspicious death of his father, who crashed and died while driving a car with cut brakes. He falls in love with his classmate, Paula Carson, but the local basketball star, Dwight Ingalls, is already Paula's boyfriend. Meanwhile, the lecherous school principal also seeks Paula's affections. Then horrible murders start happening with no one certain of the identity of the culprit. The main suspects are Dwight, whose control of his anger has never been perfect; Woods, who may not have been fully cured at the sanitarium; and the principal, who seems to stop at nothing in his attempts to sleep with Paula. The film opens with a paperboy delivering newspapers. A paper is delivered to Paula Carson's house. Paula is approached by her father, Bill, who is the district attorney, who has planned a hunting trip. He warns Paula to do her homework, not to allow boys in the house, and most importantly not to cut class. Paula then puts the newspaper in the bin, showing its headline: \\"Boy who killed father released from Mental Asylum.\\" Bill Carson drives to the swamps for his hunting trip. As he takes shots into the air, someone is hiding nearby and holding a bow and arrows. The person calls over to Bill Carson and fires an arrow into him. Bill cries out and then falls down to the ground. Throughout the rest of the movie, there are cuts to Bill struggling to get help (including asking a dog to yell for help) as well as crawl his way back home. Meanwhile, Dwight Ingalls enters class late after avoiding two accidents on his ride to school. Dwight is questioned by his teacher, Mr. Conklin, and a boy sitting next to Dwight whispers the answers to him. Dwight tells him to shut up when he teases Dwight for not knowing what H2O is. Later, Colleen and Paula are taking out gym equipment. Paula walks past a set of bow and arrows and notices a leaf hanging off one of the arrow. Paula picks the leaf off. Meanwhile, Brian is told to climb a rope by the P.E. coach, but Dwight caused him to fall. At a hot dog stand, Colleen, Paula, and Gary are waiting for Dwight. Brian approaches, and Colleen insults him before asserting that Brian has a crush on Paula. Dwight then pulls up in his car and starts talking to Paula. He asks her to go to her house, as her father is away, which would give them the opportunity to be alone. Dwight then goes to buy Paula a hot dog, but he is beaten by Brian who hands her one and says, \\"You had that look.\\" When Dwight returns, he tells Paula to get in the car and makes it clear to Brian that they are not friends anymore and to leave him and Paula alone. They all then drive off in Dwight's car. Brian and Paula nevertheless become friends, and she starts to trust him. Dwight warns her to stay away from him. A teacher is murdered in the copyroom, and the students notice that the killer made copies of the killing on the copy machine. The teacher's face is shown smashed into the copy machine glass along with a ring on the killer's finger. The ring belongs to Dwight. Soon they think that Dwight (Brad Pitt) is the killer instead of Brian. Brian tries to kill Paula, Dwight, and a math teacher in the school, and the janitor happens to be around at the time. Every classroom they run into, Brian starts talking to Paula and the math teacher through the PA in the principal's office. Paula still thinks that Dwight is the killer, and she is still running from him. Soon Brian goes into the classroom after hacking the math teacher to death. Dwight enters and gets Brian off of Paula, and they run out to the shop class and hide after Brian exclaims, \\"YOU'RE A YANKEE DOODLE DANDY TOO; YOU TWO MUST KILL OR DIE!\\" Brian knows they are in there, so he follows them while locking them in and turning on all the equipment. Brian corners Dwight and puts his head in a vice and points a drill towards his face. Paula ends up striking Brian in the head with a claw hammer, making him fall onto a moving circular saw, which goes right through his torso as Paula rescues Dwight. They leave the school and are in Dwight's car when, all of a sudden, they see Paula's dad as he is falling down the hill into the road. Paula points out that it is her dad, but Dwight cannot stop because Brian cut the brakes earlier. They swerve and miss hitting Paula's dad. All he says is, \\"Shouldn't you be in school? You're not cutting class, I hope!\\" The movie ends with the camera's freezing on Paula's face.

Its objects are to promote the art of change ringing in the University and to ring for Sunday services in Oxford during full term. History In 1873 the society visited Iffley church. The society was founded by John Edward Troyte (1848‚Äì1932, n√© Acland) on 2 February 1872, making it the oldest university society dedicated to change ringing. In the early years, the majority of its members were training as clergy or from clerical families. The first peal for the society (Stedman Triples at Drayton) was rung on the 10th anniversary of the foundation. In 1887, the society lapsed, with three brief revivals in 1890, 1892 and 1902, until it was revived in 1920 by Harry Miles and has been in continuous existence ever since. A history of the Society's first 125 years was published in 1997. For at least twenty years before the Second World War, the standard of ringing never rose much above Plain Bob Minor and Grandsire Doubles. The ban on ringing tower bells during the war could have caused the society to die out once more, but instead emphasis was placed on learning to ring handbells well with additional tied bell practices at New College. This was so successful that when the ban was lifted there were enough competent ringers to be able to ring more than had previously been possible, and surprise major began to be rung regularly. Since then the standard of ringing has mostly been quite high, with the number of peals rung peaking around 1976. For some time the society had \\"no fixed abode\\", ringing at a number of towers, including All Saints (now Lincoln College library), St Ebbe's and St Giles. By 1939 the church of St Mary Magdalen (then a 6-bell tower) had become the society's base, although other towers were still borrowed for 8-bell practices on a regular basis. In its early history the society was dependent on the help of the local bands in offering their towers for practices. This co-operation has continued to the present day, with the links between the society and the Oxford Society being strengthened further with the bell improvement projects and augmentations at St Thomas the Martyr and St Mary Magdalen from the 1970s. Current activities The society rings for Sunday services at the Oxford churches of St Thomas, St Mary Magdalen, St Mary the Virgin and St Ebbe's as well as New College. During full term, weekly practices are held at St Mary Magdalen and less frequently at St Thomas, where everything from rounds and call changes to the Standard 8 Surprise Major and Cambridge and Yorkshire Surprise Royal is rung. A day's outing is organised each term, the one in Hilary Term being joint with the Cambridge University Guild. During the Easter vacation a four-day tour is organised in a different area of the country where both present and past members visit several rings of bells each day. On the first Saturday of February an annual dinner is held which in recent years has taken place at Harris Manchester College. The society enters the SUA striking competitions in Michaelmas term and has hosted the event on a number of occasions.

It is the first installment in the Slumber Party Massacre trilogy, and stars Michelle Michaels, Robin Stille, and Michael Villella. The film follows a high school senior who gathers her friends for a slumber party, unaware that an escaped power drill-wielding killer is loose in the neighborhood. The film was originally written by Brown as a parody of the slasher genre but was shot as a straightforward horror film instead. As a result, it contains more humor, both intended and unintended, than usual for the genre at the time. The Slumber Party Massacre grossed $3.6 million at the box office on a budget of $220,000, and received mixed reviews from critics. Despite the reception, it has obtained a large cult following since its release. Two sequels, Slumber Party Massacre II and Slumber Party Massacre III, followed in 1987 and 1990, respectively. Plot In Venice, Los Angeles, Trish Deveraux, an 18-year-old high school senior, decides to throw a slumber party while her parents are away. Their neighbor, Mr. David Contant, is given the job of checking on the girls. She awakes and gets dressed shortly before going to school. Meanwhile, Russ Thorn, an escaped mass murderer, kills a telephone repair woman and steals her van. Trish meets up with her friends Kim, Jackie, and Diane. She invites the new girl, Valerie, to the party but she declines the offer. After school, one of their classmates, Linda, goes back into the school to retrieve a book but gets locked inside. She is attacked and presumably killed (or presumably passes out) by Russ, armed with a power drill. As the party begins that night, the girls smoke marijuana and drink alcohol, while Valerie babysits her younger sister, Courtney across the street. Two boys from school, Jeff and Neil, arrive and spy on the girls while they change clothes. Russ kills Mr. Contant outside with his power drill. Diane asks Trish permission to go with her boyfriend, and goes to his car to find him decapitated and is murdered as well. The girls order pizza and, while on the phone with their coach, Rachel Jana, the girls answer the door and find the pizza delivery man with his eyes drilled out. The teens arm themselves with knives as Jeff and Neil run for help, but both boys are killed. Russ gains entry to the house and murders Jackie. Trish and Kim barricade themselves in Trish's bedroom, but Russ enters through a window and kills Kim as Trish flees. Valerie and Courtney enter the house to find Kim dead, and hide from Russ. Coach Jana, having grown concerned over the phone call earlier, arrives, and is confronted by Russ, who disembowels her with the drill. Valerie chases Russ with a machete, eventually severing his hand before slicing his stomach open. Russ emerges and attacks them once more, but Valerie finally kills him with the machete. Valerie and Trish break down in tears as Courtney looks on in shock. Cast Production =Conception= Author and feminist activist Rita Mae Brown wrote the original screenplay, titled Sleepless Nights, as a parody of the slasher film. Producers repurposed Brown's script to make a \\"serious\\" slasher film against her wishes. Amy Holden Jones, a film editor, wanted to direct and asked Frances Doel for advice. Doel gave Jones a number of scripts. Jones chose the script that would become The Slumber Party Massacre, then going by the title of Don't Open the Door, and decided to film the first three scenes. Her husband, cinematographer Michael Chapman, acquired equipment and film and hired actors from the University of California, Los Angeles, and they shot the scenes at their house over a weekend for $1,000. She showed the result to Roger Corman, who agreed to finance the film. Jones had to turn down a job editing Steven Spielberg's E.T. (1982) as a result. The soundtrack was composed on a Casio MT-40. =Filming= Filming began in the summer of 1981. The film was shot on location in Los Angeles, California, mainly in Venice. Release =Box office= Distributed by New World Pictures, the film premiered in Los Angeles on September 10, 1982, and was given a limited release in New York City on November 12, 1982. It grossed $3.6 million at the box office on an estimated budget of $220,000. =Critical response= The Slumber Party Massacre received mixed reviews from critics. Janet Maslin of The New York Times wrote of the film: \\"The Slumber Party Massacre is just the usual cavalcade of corpses, all of them dispatched by a maniac who wields a power drill. At the end of the movie, a woman who has miraculously survived the carnage breaks his drill in half. That's feminism for you, and symbolism too.\\" Time Out gave the film a middling review, noting: \\"Despite the unlikely script credit for Rita Mae Brown, Jones's debut feature is little more than a Halloween clone, reliant on buckets of blood and sudden surprise rather than suspense.\\" David Hinckley of the New York Daily News awarded the film 1.5 stars out of 4, noting that the performances are \\"uneven,\\" and \\"the special effects are not special.\\" Varietys published review, however, praised the film: \\"Besides its obviously catchy title, Slumber Party Massacre is an entertaining terror thriller, with the switch that distaff filmmakers handle the 'young women in jeopardy' format.\\" Dave Kehr of the Chicago Reader also gave the film a positive review, noting its even pacing and direction by Jones. Leonard Klady of the Los Angeles Times also noted the film's pacing, writing in a retrospective that the film boasted a \\"darkly humorous vision and a breathtaking pace.\\" Dale Schenck of The Morning Call deemed the film a \\"rousing thriller\\" that \\"delivers as many vicarious thrills as one could want from this sort of cinematic mayhem.\\" Review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reports that 38% of 16 critics gave the film a positive review, with an average rating of 4.36 out of 10. Despite the critical reception, the film has a large cult following among slasher fans. =Home media= It was later released on VHS by Embassy Home Entertainment. The film has been released on DVD three times in North America. The first release came from New Concorde Home Entertainment in September 2000.

Fenton, Murray and Wood  Fenton Murray and Wood was founded in the 1790s by ironfounder Matthew Murray and textile machine engineer David Wood to build machine tools (mainly for the textile industry) and stationary steam engines. The company was capitalised by colliery owner James Fenton (1754‚Äì1834) as the main financier, and millwright William Lister, a sleeping partner.Sources: The partnership was approached to design a locomotive that would exploit the rack-and-pinion patent granted to Blenkinsop in 1811. Their 1812 product, Salamanca was successful, and a total of six engines were built before Murray's death in 1826. Fenton, Murray and Jackson After Wood's death in 1820, the company became Fenton, Murray and Jackson. In 1824 the company supplied a 60hp beam engine to the commissioners of Deeping Fen as one of two erected at Pode Hole. The other engine was supplied by the Butterley Company as were the scoop wheels for both. Although the Butterley engine was purchased outright (for ¬£3,300), it appears that the Fenton and Murray engine was not. The accounts for 1825 showed a payment of only ¬£127/6/- for the Fenton engine. It was not uncommon for beam engines to be leased, purchased 'on terms', or paid for in other novel ways such as a share of the earnings. The engine was named Kesteven and worked until 1925. From 1831, work began building engines to Robert Stephenson's designs, both 2-2-0 \\"Planets\\" and 2-2-2 \\"Patentees\\", many of them under subcontract. Many were exported, and twenty of Daniel Gooch's Firefly class for the Great Western Railway. By 1840, they were turning out up to twenty engines a year. The company's name appears on cast iron bollards still in situ at Victoria Lock (built 1843) on the River Shannon in Ireland as Fenton, Murray and Jackson Engineers of Leeds.http://www.buildingsofireland.ie/niah/search.jsp?type=record&county;=OF&regno;=14929013 However, by 1843, the boom was over and the company closed down.

It had a remastered home media release from the Criterion Collection on February 26, 2019.  Plot  Gideon (Paul Butler) and his wife, Suzie (Mary Alice), live in South Central Los Angeles, though they retain some of their rural southern ways, including raising chickens in the backyard. Harry (Danny Glover), a longstanding friend from the South who they have not seen for many years, makes a surprise visit. The couple are delighted to see him and insist that he stay with them for as long as he wishes. Harry has a charming, down-home manner, but his enigmatic and somewhat amoral presence brings to a crisis trouble simmering in the family‚Äîespecially as regards the younger son, Samuel or \\"Babe Brother\\" (Richard Brooks), and his relationships with his parents, wife, and older brother, Junior (Carl Lumbly). Harry's disruptive and even corrupting presence threatens to break up Samuel's marriage and seems to be related to the illness that puts Gideon in bed for a couple of weeks, but is ultimately purgative: Gideon's extended family is more cohesive as a result of Harry's visit. Samuel and Junior struggle over a knife in a climactic fight during a storm, which ends in Suzie sustaining a wound. During a long wait in the emergency room, the storm clears, and the simmering anger that Harry seemed to bring to a boil is also dissipated.

It is notable because four iconic horror film stars (Vincent Price, Christopher Lee, Peter Cushing and John Carradine) are together in one feature. The screenplay by Michael Armstrong is based on the 1913 novel Seven Keys to Baldpate by Earl Derr Biggers, which was also adapted into a famous play that gave birth in turn to several films. The original music score was composed by Richard Harvey.New York Times Plot summary Kenneth Magee (Desi Arnaz, Jr.), a young writer, bets $20,000 that he can write a Wuthering Heights-calibre novel in 24 hours. To get in the mood for the undertaking, he goes to a deserted Welsh manor. Upon his arrival, however, Magee discovers that the manor is not as empty as he was told. Still there are Lord Grisbane (Carradine) and his daughter, Victoria (Sheila Keith), who have been maintaining the mansion on their own. As the stormy night progresses, more people come to the mansion, including Lord Grisbane's sons Lionel (Price) and Sebastian (Cushing), Magee's publisher's secretary, Mary Norton (Julie Peasgood), and Corrigan (Lee), a potential buyer of the property. After much coaxing, the Grisbanes reveal that they are here to release their brother, Roderick, who was imprisoned in his room for 40 years because he seduced a village girl when he was 14 and killed her when he found out she was pregnant. When they go to release him, they find the room empty and conclude that he broke out recently by breaking the bars in front of the window. Moments later, Lord Grisbane has a fatal heart attack. As Magee talks about getting the police, screams are heard and they find Victoria strangled to death. When Corrigan, Magee, and Mary decide to leave, they discover all of their cars have slashed tires. Soon, Diane (Louise English) and Andrew (Richard Hunter), a young couple who Magee met at the train station, arrive seeking shelter from the storm. They are soon killed when Diane washes her face with water that has been replaced by acid and Andrew drinks poisoned punch. The remaining five decide to find Roderick and kill him before he kills them. Magee, Sebastian, and Mary search a series of tunnels behind a bookcase. During their search, they get separated and Sebastian is hanged to death from the ceiling. Mary makes it back to Corrigan and Lionel while Magee remains lost in the tunnels. Corrigan soon reveals that he, in fact, is Roderick and that he escaped his prison decades ago, but returns every now and then to make them think he was still trapped. He then proceeds to kill Lionel with a battle axe and chase Mary throughout the manor. Magee soon finds them and, after the ensuing fight, knocks Roderick down the stairs; during the fall, Roderick accidentally stabs himself with the axe. As Roderick is dying, his victims suddenly walk into the room, very much alive; it is revealed that all was a joke put on by Magee's publisher, even Roderick rises, his wound was also a fake. It is revealed that it was all Magee's story, as he finishes his novel and returns to give it to his publisher.

Reception In a contemporary review, Kim Newman (Monthly Film Bulletin) stated that the main selling point of the film was the return of these particular horror actors, which in turn became a \\"major surprise, and disappointment, is that the film should waste these Grand Old Icons on an entirely superfluous remake of Seven Keys to Baldpate\\" The review states that, along with the producers' film The Wicked Lady, their work was long out of date and that the \\"preposterous twist ending\\" that showed \\"Armstrong and Walker display an appalling contempt for the audience\\", and that the ending turned \\"a disappointing project into an infuriating one.\\" References External links   1983 horror films 1983 films British films British comedy horror films 1980s comedy horror films Films directed by Pete Walker Golan-Globus films British independent films 1980s mystery films Films based on horror novels Films set in Wales British haunted house films Films based on American novels Films based on Seven Keys to Baldpate Films scored by Richard Harvey 1983 comedy films ","title":"House of the Long Shadows"},{"id":"4343481","text":"This article comprises a list of characters that play a role in Saint Seiya (also known as Knights of the Zodiac) and its canonical continuation, Saint Seiya: Next Dimension, two manga series created, written and illustrated by Masami Kurumada. The plot of Saint Seiya begins in 1986,Saint Seiya vol. 1 Chapter 4 spanning until 1990, and follows a group of five mystical warriors called Saints as they battle in the name of the goddess Athena against agents of evil who seek to rule the Earth. Their main enemy in the first arc of the story is the traitorous Gold Saint of Gemini, who has murdered the representative of Athena and taken his place as leader of the Saints. In the second arc, the Saints are confronted with the god of the sea, Poseidon, who kidnaps the mortal reincarnation of Athena and threatens to flood the world with incessant rain to cleanse it of the evils of mankind. Their final enemy, who appears in the third arc of the series, is the god of the Underworld, Hades, whom Athena has fought since the age of myth. Saint Seiya: Next Dimension acts both as a prequel and a sequel to the first series. It details the aftermath of the war against Hades and starts with Athena seeking help from the gods of Olympus and from Chronos to save Pegasus Seiya from Hades' curse by travelling back to the 18th century. The two main antagonists are the troops of the goddess Artemis, in the 20th century storyline, and the incarnation of Hades in the 18th century. Protagonists =Pegasus Seiya= is the Bronze Saint of Pegasus in the 20th century and titular character of the series. An orphaned child later revealed to be one of Mitsumasa Kido's sons, he was separated from his sister Seika and sent to Greece to become a Saint, a soldier of the goddess Athena. Initially motivated by the desire to rejoin his sister, he eventually discovers he has protected Athena for millennia, his soul returning every time she reincarnates to assist her in the battles against the evil agents that threaten the Earth. As a warrior of immense might, Seiya achieves victory in impossible battles, occasionally donning the Sagittarius Gold Cloth before particularly challenging opponents. He defeats the gods Poseidon and Hades, although the latter curses him at the end of Saint Seiya to stop his cycle of rebirth. He is left in a comatose state which Athena seeks to revert in the canonic sequel Next Dimension. Seiya is proclaimed as the future Gold Saint of the Sagittarius successor to Sagittarius Aiolos.Saint Seiya Next Dimension vol. 11 cap. 80 =Dragon Shiryu= is the Bronze Saint protected by the constellation of Draco the Dragon, considered the calmest and most collected of the protagonists. As one of Mitsumada Kido's sons, he was sent at an early age to the Five Old Peaks of Rozan to train under the Libra Gold Saint and acquire the Dragon Cloth. This Cloth is known for possessing the strongest fist and shield. After he returns to Japan, Shiryu becomes involved in the battles to recover the Gold Cloth from Ikki and the Black Saints, and eventually discovers that Saori Kido is the goddess Athena whom he swore to protect. In the ensuing battle against the Silver Saint Perseus Algol, Shiryu is forced to blind himself to achieve victory. He recovers his sight upon awakening his seventh sense during the fight against Cancer Deathmask, but later loses it a second time while facing Poseidon's General Chrysaor Krishna. More than once, he dons the Libra Gold Cloth when confronting a particularly powerful opponent. In the Next Dimension official sequel of the manga of Saint Seiya, Shiryu and Shunrei have adopted a baby whom they named Shoryu. Then, he goes back in time with Hyoga, to the time of the previous Holy War against Hades in the eighteenth century, in order to help Saori / Athena save Seiya's life, who is cursed by the sword of the god of the underworld. Shiryu is proclaimed as the future Gold Saint of Libra successor to Dohko, from the Gold Saint of the eighteenth century Libra Dohko(Young)Saint Seiya Next Dimension vol.7 cap.52 =Cygnus Hyoga= , also known as Swan Hyoga in several international adaptations, is the Bronze Saint of Cygnus. He was born in the fictional village of Kohoutek, in eastern Siberia, which, at the time when Kurumada wrote and drew his manga, was in the Soviet Union. His mastery over his Cosmo grants him the ability to create ice and snow at temperatures as low as absolute zero by stopping subatomic particles. Hyoga is often portrayed wearing a cross and rosary of the Northern Cross, another name for the Cygnus constellation. Calm by nature, he displays a seemingly emotionless exterior, but a more tender side of his character emerges on occasions, such as when he expresses his gratitude to Andromeda Shun for having saved his life and his undying devotion to his mentor Aquarius Camus. He first appears in the series as he receives an order from Sanctuary to eliminate his fellow Bronze Saints, but he quickly abandons this mission when he discovers the truth about Saori Kido's identity and joins her in the battles against her enemies. While in Poseidon's Undersea Temple, he reencounters Kraken Isaac, a fellow apprentice of Camus. To repay an old debt to the Mariner, Hyoga sacrifices one of his eyes. He occasionally dons the Aquarius Gold Cloth. In the anime adaptation, he was given a different master: an original character referred to as the Crystal Saint, who was, in turn, Aquarius Camus's apprentice. In Japan, Hyoga is a popular character, ranking second in the main character polls of the Bronze Saints.Saint Seiya Volume 3, Argentinian Edition, Japanese characters poll In the Next Dimension official sequel of the manga of Saint Seiya, Hyoga goes back in time with Shiryu, to the time of the previous Holy War against Hades in the eighteenth century, in order to help Saori / Athena save Seiya's life, who is cursed by the sword of the god of the underworld. Hyoga is proclaimed as the future Gold Saint of Aquarius successor to Camus, from the Gold Saint of the eighteenth century Aquarius MystoriaSaint Seiya Next Dimension vol. 10 cap. 73 =Andromeda Shun= is the Bronze Saint of Andromeda and Phoenix Ikki's younger brother, although he shares the same father as the rest of the main Bronze Saints. He trained at Andromeda Island under the Silver Saint Cepheus Daidalos and returned to Japan after earning his Cloth, hoping to be reunited with Ikki. He helps Athena reclaim Sanctuary and later becomes involved in the battles against Poseidon and his Generals. In the final arc, it is revealed that the necklace he has carried since he was a baby was given to him by Pandora, to mark his body as Hades's future container. Ikki manages to free him after the god takes hold of his body and both follow Athena to Elysion, where Shun briefly dons the Virgo Gold Cloth and helps to finally defeat Hades. In Next Dimension(canonical sequel and prequel), Shun accompanies Athena to the 18th century, to save Seiya from the curse of Hades's sword. There, he joins forces with the former Pegasus Saint, Tenma, to save the helpless goddess from Hades's Specters. Shun is proclaimed as the future Gold Saint of Virgo successor to Virgo Shaka.Saint Seiya Next Dimension vol.7 cap. 50 In the anime adaptation, his master's name was changed to Albiore. =Phoenix Ikki= is the Bronze Saint of the Phoenix constellation and Shun's older brother. He trained at the hellish Death Queen Island under Guilty, which turned him into a loner, cold and harsh. Ikki first appears as an antagonist, as the leader of the Black Saints who is set on taking the Sagittarius Gold Cloth for himself and destroying the other Bronze Saints for revenge against the Graude Foundation. He later overcomes his hate and becomes an ally to Athena and the Bronze Saints, often arriving at critical moments to save them from certain death. Born under the sign of Leo, Ikki dons the Leo Gold Cloth once, during the fight against the twin gods Hypnos and Thanatos in Elysion. In Saint Seiya: Next Dimension, the ongoing canonical sequel and prequel to Saint Seiya authored by Kurumada that deals with the aftermath of the war against Hades. After Athena visits Mount Olympus to meet her sister Artemis and ask for her help to cure Seiya from the curse Hades inflicted on him, Andromeda Shun is attacked by Artemis's soldiers, the Satellites, and their commander Lascomoune. Shun manages to defeat the Satellites, but not Lascomoune, who nearly takes his life. Ikki then intervenes to protect his brother and defeats the commander of the Satellites. Afterwards, he follows Athena and Shun into the past, to the war against Hades that took place in the eighteenth century. Ikki is proclaimed as the future Gold Saint of the Leo successor to Aiolia, from the Gold Saint of the eighteenth century Leo KaiserSaint Seiya Next Dimension volume. 10 cap.70 =Saori Kido= , also known as Princess Sienna in some English versions of the series, is the reincarnation of the Goddess of War . Based on the Greek goddess of the same name, she is the daughter of Zeus and sister of Artemis and Apollo. She usually carries a golden staff representing Nike, the Goddess of Victory, and a shield which can eliminate all evil and owns a powerful Divine Cloth. She is reborn approximately every 250 years to protect the Earth from evil with the help of her loyal Saints. While still a baby, Gemini Saga attempts to kill her, but Sagittarius Aiolos saves her life and delivers her to Mitsumasa Kido, who raises her in secret in Japan. Thirteen years later, after Mitsumasa's death, Saori gathers the Bronze Saints that the Graude Foundation trained and battles to reclaim Sanctuary from Saga's control. During the Poseidon arc, she offers to be locked inside the main pillar in Poseidon's Undersea Temple while it fills with water that would have otherwise flooded the Earth. After her Saints save her, she reseals Poseidon's soul. In the Hades arc, she infiltrates the Underworld and follows Hades to Elysion, where she also seals away the evil god. In Next Dimension, hoping to save Seiya's life from the curse cast on him by Hades's sword, Saori travels to Olympus to ask for Chronos's help. The God of Time sends her back to the 18th century war against Hades, as per her request, but she appears in the past as a helpless baby at the mercy of her enemies. =Pegasus Tenma= Trained to be the Pegasus Saint by Crateris Suiky≈ç, is Seiya's incarnation in the 18th century and Alone's best friend. After he and Alone escape from Libra Dohko and Aries Shion, Tenma realizes that his friend has become Hades. He vows to protect Alone, but, when he tries to make him remember who he is, Pandora and some Skeleton soldiers intervene and Tenma has to be saved by Dohko and Shion. The trio is then beset by Griffon Vermeer and Suiky≈ç, who reveals himself as the Garuda Specter. The Saints manage to escape after Pandora summons the Specters and drink water from the Crateris Cloth to revitalize themselves. There, Tenma sees his future: Seiya in a wheelchair. Returning to Sanctuary with Dohko and Shion, Tenma later encounters Andromeda Shun and the two begin to climb the Twelve Temples, joining forces to protect the infant time-traveling Athena. An alternate version of Tenma makes an appearance in the spin-off Saint Seiya: The Lost Canvas, where his name is spelled only in katakana. =Other Saints = Athena's army is composed of warriors known as Saints, who for millennia have battled to protect the goddess and the ideals she stands for. They inhabit the Sanctuary and possess superhuman powers thanks to their Cosmo, the energy of the Big Bang that dwells inside every being. They are divided into three hierarchical ranks ‚Äì Bronze, Silver and Gold ‚Äì and wear armors that are linked to the constellations named Cloths. Although all Saints have sworn allegiance to the goddess, Kurumada first presented most of them in an antagonistic role. Antagonists The first characters to appear in an antagonistic role are the Black Saints, servants of Phoenix Ikki on his quest to kill all the Bronze Saints. The second were most of the Silver and Gold Saints, deceived by the dark personality of the Gemini Gold Saint Saga. The short story dedicated to Hy≈çga that followed the Sanctuary arc of the manga introduced the Blue Warriors from the icy lands of Bluegrad. Afterwards, most antagonists were various deities from Greek mythology: Poseidon and Hades, in the original Saint Seiya, and the Olympians of the Heavenly Realm, in Saint Seiya: Next Dimension. The anime adaptation of the manga introduced several other antagonists, such as the Ghost Saints and Odin's God Warriors. Support characters ; : Hades' chosen vessel in the 18th century, with the purest soul on earth. Prior to the Holy war, he was best friends with Pegasus Tenma since childhood. He first met Tenma during a snowstorm one night, in an abandoned shack where they both sought refuge. Tenma deceived Alone at first so that he could steal his belongings, but was stopped by Suiky≈ç. As Suiky≈ç was going to kill Tenma for theft, Alone lied and said he had given his bag to Tenma. Suiky≈ç was eventually convinced and told Tenma he was now in debt to Alone and should therefore guard Alone for the rest of his life. At the start of the war, he could feel that darkness was headed his way, and that it came after him. He and Tenma escaped from Libra Dohko and Aries Shion, and ended up outside a small mausoleum. As Tenma went back to retrieve his Cloth, a voice called for Alone inside the mausoleum. As he entered, he found Hades' Sword stuck in the ground. It was then that Pandora showed herself and convinced Alone of grabbing the hilt of the sword. Alone started plunging into darkness and ignored Tenma as he strode towards Hades' Castle.Sh≈çnen Champion #38 2006Sh≈çnen Champion #43 2006Sh≈çnen Champion #50 2006Sh≈çnen Champion #51 2006Sh≈çnen Champion #4+5 2007Sh≈çnen Champion #1 2008 ; :Voiced by: Hiroko Emori, Karen Hatch (English) :Apprentice under Aries Mu.

Motivated by this, he takes Seiya's place and dies during the fight with Leo Aiolia in order to wake the Leo Gold Saint from the control of Saga's Dellusional Demon's Emperor Fist. In the anime adaptation, he was also the younger brother of Docrates, an anime-only character. ; :Voiced by: Chisato Nakajima :She was sold as a work slave to an abusive local farmer for only three bags of grain. When Ikki first encountered her, he mistook her for Shun, because she and Shun shared the same facial features with the only differences being hair color and gender. She was killed by Guilty, Ikki's master, in order to provoke Ikki into drawing power from hatred. In the anime adaptation her background is the same, with the addition of being Guilty's daughter. ; :Voiced by: Yuko Nagashima :Lyra Orph√©e's lover, she enjoyed great happiness at the Saint's side on Earth, until the day of her untimely death because of a snake bite. Crushed by her demise, Orph√©e descended to the Underworld to bargain for her soul with Hades. Touched by the Saint's pleas and melody, she was allowed to return to Earth by the deity, only to be thwarted by Sphinx Pharaoh. She thus was condemned to remain bound to the Underworld half-turned into stone, and later helped Seiya and Shun to unearth Orph√©e's seemingly forgotten loyalty to Athena. ; :Voiced by: Hidekatsu Shibata :Master of Phoenix Ikki during his stance on Death Queen Island. Harsh and heartless, and concealing his features behind a fearsome mask, Guilty employed brutal methods in Ikki's training, to force him to become a being of pure hate, to be able to wield the power of the Phoenix Cloth. Guilty was responsible for Esmeralda's death, and died at the hands of Ikki, as his final trial to become a Saint, not before revealing to Ikki the secret of his birth. Also known as the mysterious Saint, Masami Kurumada never revealed Guilty's destined constellation. ; :The enormous, three-headed demonic watchdog guarding the entrance to the Underworld.

In the manga, it was revealed that he was actually the birth father of all the orphans he sent around the world to be trained as Saints. In the anime, he merely took the children from various orphanages, and sent them for their training. Just before he died, he told Saori all the truth regarding the encounter with Aiolos in Sanctuary and her divine origins and purpose of her birth in this era. He is known as Lord Nobu in some English versions. ; :Voiced by: Akiko Tsuboi :One of Mitsumasa Kido's women and late mother of Cygnus Hy≈çga.

After Seiya was taken away, she wandered the world looking for him. It was long implied that Marin, Seiya's mentor, could be Seika, and some characters, including Seiya, thought it was possibly true. Marin and Seika even shared the same physical characteristics: same age, same birthdate, same height, same birthplace. Also, Marin has a brother she lost and was looking for. Seika resurfaced as a separate character in the Hades chapter, completely amnesiac, after having followed Seiya all the way to Greece alone. It was Seika's voice that, more than any other, urged Seiya on in his fight against Thanatos. It is then revealed in the final arc of Kurumada's manga that Seika and Marin are not the same person. ; :A new character introduced by Kurumada in Next Dimension, an orphaned baby, found in the Five Old Peaks fairylands of Lushan, by Shunrei.

Suish≈ç's background remains to be revealed in further detail by Kurumada. ; :The Pope ruling Sanctuary in the 18th century, a survivor of the Holy War against Hades in the 15th century. He grants Shion and Dohko the rank of Gold Saints and the right to don the Aries and Libra Gold Cloths. He also foresees Hades' return to Earth and prepares Sanctuary to face such event.

Trusted man of Mitsumasa Kido and a black belt, third dan in Kend≈ç. He was in charge of overseeing the orphans who were to be sent out all over the world to train and become Bronze Saints, and due to his extreme severity and at times downright abusive behavior, most of them were resentful towards him. He always tried to be strong and protect Saori, but even the Sanctuary soldiers can defeat him. (Not without struggle, however, as he offered considerable resistance for an outnumbered man). He starts as a rather daunting and abusive retainer for the future Saints, but he is in truth a man who is honor-bound to protect Saori, and ultimately is the series' comic relief. ; :Voiced by: Tomiko Suzuki :A young boy from Kohoutek village, in Eastern Siberia, neighbor and good friend of Cygnus Hy≈çga.

They were also featured in the musical Saint Seiya: Super Musical of 2011, which is based on the same film.http://www.musical-seiya.com Official site of the 2011 Saint Seiya musical They are five former Saints, collectively known as the Ghost Saints: Southern Cross Khrist√≥s (voiced by Ry≈´sei Nakao in the film and played by Y≈´ki Fujiwara in the musical); Sagitta Maya, predecessor of Sagitta Ptolemy (voiced by Michitaka Kobayashi and played by Y≈´ki Matsuoka); Scutum Jan (voiced by Keiichi Nanba and played by Takeshi Hayashino); Lyra Orpheus, predecessor of Lyra Orph√©e (voiced by Y≈´ji Mitsuya and played by Yasuka Saitoh); and Orion J√§ger (voiced by Y≈´ Mizushima and played by Yutaka Matsuzaki). Kurumada contributed to designing the looks of the God Warriors of Odin in 1988's Saint Seiya: The Heated Battle of the Gods, but had virtually no involvement in the creation of Abel and his three Corona Saints in 1988's Saint Seiya: Legend of Crimson Youth or of Lucifer and the Fallen Angels in Saint Seiya: Warriors of the Final Holy Battle. On the other hand, the 2004 film Saint Seiya Heaven Chapter: Overture was based on an original story by Kurumada. Since the discontinuation of the project, however, the characters and events of that film have since been replaced in the canonical continuity of the series by those found in Next Dimension. Anime-only characters The anime adaptation of Saint Seiya features several original characters. Author Masami Kurumada was not involved in their creation process. Although these characters had a participation in the storyline to some extent, some were later retconned from the continuity of the anime itself to keep it closer to the manga. They range from support to antagonistic characters.

Nigel Tetley (c. 1924 ‚Äì 2 February 1972) was a British sailor who was the first person to circumnavigate the world solo in a trimaran.A Voyage for Madmen, by Peter Nichols; pages 32‚Äì33. Harper Collins, 2001.  The race  A native of South Africa, and a Lieutenant-Commander in the Royal Navy, Tetley entered the 1968 Sunday Times Golden Globe Race, which was the first non-stop, single-handed, round-the-world yacht race. Tetley sailed the Victress, a plywood trimaran that also doubled as his home. He completed the circumnavigation when he crossed his outgoing track on the evening of 22 April 1969, but at that point he was still from finishing the race and claiming the prize for fastest passage. The Victress at this point was slowly disintegrating, but Tetley thought he was being chased by another trimaran piloted by Donald Crowhurst, so instead of nursing his ailing boat along, he continued to sail as hard as he could. With to go, shortly after midnight on 21 May, the Victress broke up and sank under him. Tetley had time to get off a Mayday call before taking to his life raft, and was picked up the following afternoon. It later turned out that Tetley had not needed to hurry. Donald Crowhurst had faked his round-the-world trip, sailing only in the Atlantic and radioing false position reports. Tetley was awarded a ¬£1,000 consolation prize by the race organizers. By now he was obsessed with properly completing a circumnavigation, so he used the money to immediately build a new trimaran, which he called the Miss Vicky. He wrote a book about the experience that was published the following year.  Death  Tetley was never able to raise enough money to completely outfit the new boat. Though showing no outward signs of stress or depression, he went missing on 2 February 1972. His body was found three days later, hanging from a tree in woods near Dover, England. Three weeks later, at the coroner's inquest, it was revealed that the body had been discovered clothed in lingerie and the hands were bound behind the back. The opinion offered by a pathologist suggested masochistic sexual activity. The coroner, noting there was no evidence that Tetley had deliberately taken his life, recorded an open verdict.Chris Eakin,A Race Too Far London:Ebury Press, 2009 Nigel Tetley was cremated near Dover.

It is a sequel to The Stepfather (1987) and stars Terry O'Quinn as the title character. The cast includes Meg Foster, Caroline Williams, and Jonathan Brandis. Stepfather II received a limited theatrical release on November 3, 1989, and grossed $1.5 million at the box office. It received negative reviews from film critics. A sequel, Stepfather III, was released in 1992.  Plot  After surviving being shot and stabbed at the end of the previous film, Jerry Blake is institutionalized in Puget Sound, Washington. Blake has meetings with his psychiatrist. Having gained his trust he kills the psychiatrist and a guard. He dons the guard's uniform to help him escape. Arriving at a train depot, Blake kills and robs a traveling salesman for his car and money. Blake checks into a hotel, alters his appearance, assumes the identity of deceased publisher Gene F. Clifford, and travels to Palm Meadows, Los Angeles. In Palm Meadows, Gene poses as a psychiatrist and soon meets Carol Grayland and leases a house across the street from her and her 13-year- old son Todd. During a session with the neighborhood wives, Gene learns that Carol's husband Philip left his family the previous year. Gene begins courting Carol, eventually winning over her and Todd, but Phil returns, wanting to reconcile with his wife. Needing Phil out of the way, Gene persuades Carol to send him over for a meeting, during which Gene smashes a bottle on his head then stabs him to death. He covers up Phil's disappearance afterward by making it look like he simply ran off again. With Phil gone, Gene and Carol arrange to get married. Matty Crimmins, local mail carrier and Carol's best friend, becomes suspicious of Gene and begins looking through Gene's mail. She finds a letter addressed to the real Gene Clifford (which includes a photograph revealing him to be African American). She confronts Gene, demanding to know who he really is, although Gene tries to make it look like the letter was sent to the wrong person. Gene persuades her to let him tell Carol the truth about his past. Later that night, after making love to Carol, Gene sneaks into Matty's house and strangles her to death, making her death look like a suicide. On his way out, Gene takes Matty's last bottle of wine and crosses through the yard of Matty's blind neighbor Sam Watkins, who hears Gene whistling \\"Camptown Races,\\" which he mentions to Carol the next day. Despite Matty's death, the wedding proceeds as planned. While dressing in the church, Carol recognizes bottles of wine sent by Matty's parents as the same brand Gene had the other night, and overhears Todd whistling \\"Camptown Races\\", which he says Gene taught him. Thinking Gene may have had something to do with Matty's death, Carol confronts him, prompting Gene to attack Carol and Todd, whom he locks in a storage closet. As Gene prepares to kill Carol with a knife she used to stab him, Todd breaks out of the closet and saves his mother, knocking the knife out of Gene's hand and stabbing him in the chest with a claw hammer, apparently killing him. As Carol and Todd walk into the wedding ceremony, everyone is shocked to see them covered in blood until Carol collapses on the floor. The film ends with Gene getting up, stumbling through the room for the wedding party and collapsing on the floor by the destroyed wedding cake, weakly uttering \\"Till death...\\", then seemingly dying from his wounds.

Jeff Burr refused and director Doug Campbell was hired to do the reshoots. In an interview, Burr commented, \\"they cut a little bit of [the film] out and they added some badly done blood effects. Badly done, because Terry O‚ÄôQuinn refused to do it. Really, they were meaningless, so that was irritating.\\"http://www.iconsoffright.com/IV_Burr.htm ICONS Interview with Director Jeff Burr Release =Box office= Stepfather II was originally intended to be released direct to video; however, the producers were impressed enough with the sequel that it was released into theaters. The film was given a limited release theatrically in the United States by Millimeter Films in November 1989. It grossed $1,519,796 domestically at the box office. =Critical reception= The film received mostly negative reviews, with a 0% approval rating from Rotten Tomatoes and an average rating of 3.68/10 based on 5 reviews. Variety stated \\"this dull sequel reduces the intriguing premise of the original Stepfather to the level of an inconsequential, tongue-in-cheek slasher film\\". Richard Harrington of The Washington Post wrote that the film was cliche-ridden and lacked the reality-rooted horror that made the original film effective, finishing his review by stating \\"Stepfather 2 is just slick marketing trying to capitalize on unsettling art - and failing badly, at that\\".  Home media  After the film's theatrical release, it was released on VHS by HBO Video in the United States, and in Canada around the same time by Cineplex Odeon. In 2003, the film was released on DVD by Miramax Films and the same year in Canada by Alliance Atlantis; it included audio commentary with director Jeff Burr and producer Darin Scott. In 2009, to coincide with the release of the Screen Gems remake of the original Stepfather, Synapse Films re-released Stepfather II on DVD with special features including the ones available on the Miramax and Alliance Atlantis releases, as well as new features such as a making-of documentary.

He was given his nickname in his youth, which was a reference to the brand‚Äìname of his first pair of football boots. Career Viola is famous for his strong personality on the pitch and great appearances in many teams he has played for throughout his long career. His first great appearance was in his second match, in the final game of 1988 Campeonato Paulista (1st Division Championship of S√£o Paulo State) between Corinthians and Guarani, regarded by the press as having a better team. Viola was called just because the main Corinthians forward, Edmar, was called by the Brazil national football team and then sold to Pescara ‚Äì and because his main substitute, Marcos Roberto, was with a broken arm. Viola was not having a great offensive exhibition, but could score the title goal in the extra time ‚Äì by putting his leg in the way of a lopsided shot from Wilson Mano, turning it into an assist. Despite becoming a sudden star, Viola did not have a regular basis of good exhibitions and passed through some loanings until 1992 ‚Äì he was not part of the first Corinthians title at Brasileir√£o, in 1990, when he was loaned to S√£o Jos√©. He then had a reasonable year in 1992, not resembling anymore the skinny boy from 1988. In 1993, Viola almost did another title goal to Corinthians in the Campeonato Paulista, celebrating it with a pig imitation ‚Äì mocking the Palmeiras nickname. But in the second final match, the rivals won the tournament. Nevertheless, Viola continued to celebrate his goals in joking ways, increasing his popularity. He was then first called by the Brazil team, going to 1993 Copa Am√©rica and to 1994 FIFA World Cup when he came as a substitute in the extra time, bringing an electric performance to a tied game. Viola also ended 1994 as runner-up with Corinthians in the Brasileir√£o. By the beginning of 1995, Viola was then sold to Valencia, but remained for more six months in Corinthians - the winning the Campeonato Paulista and the Copa do Brasil. However, he did not suit himself in Spain. Despite having reasonable goal numbers, he chose to come back to Brazil by the mid of 1996, even signing with Palmeiras. He did not have a regular frequency of good exhibitions, and left the club after the runner-up campaign in the 1997 Brasileir√£o, signing with Santos. He then earned again good performances, leading the team to the semifinals of the Campeonato Paulista and of the Brasileir√£o, and to the 1998 Copa Conmebol title. He also ended the Brasileir√£o as top scorer. His career's last good moments were in Vasco da Gama, by 1999 and 2000, as a supporting member of the runner-up squad of 2000 FIFA World Club Cup and of the 2000 Copa Mercosur and Brasileir√£o champions. Viola then had an unsuccessful return to Santos in 2001. In he left Brazil again to join Turkish side Gaziantepspor, where he scored 18 goals in 46 Super Lig matches during a 1¬Ω-season spell. In mid-2003, back to Brazil, Viola would defend many other teams, alternating them with some showbol matches and even a reality television show participation by 2010. His last coming back trial was in Tabo√£o da Serra, in 2015.

Olson,The New York Times and starring Susan Strasberg, Jos√© Ferrer, and Lori Lethin. Its plot follows a group of three children born on the same day during an eclipse who begin committing murders on their tenth birthdays. Plot On June 9, 1970, at the Meadowvale General Hospital in Southern California, a doctor arrives to attend to three women in labor at the same time during a solar eclipse. Two boys and a girl are born - Curtis Taylor, Debbie Brody, and Steven Seton. Flash forward ten years to a young couple fooling around in the cemetery at night. Suddenly, unknown assailants kill the boy with a shovel and then strangle the girl with a jump rope. That same night, Joyce is interrupted from the horoscopes she's working on when her brother Timmy sneaks in the window, and lies about having locked himself out while feeding the dog. The next day, Joyce arrives at the Thomas Jefferson Elementary School, where she is volunteering for her Civics class, to find Sheriff Brody talking to Ms. Davis' class about the murder. He shows the children a jump rope handle and asks if anyone was in the cemetery the night before. Debbie and Curtis exchange glances but say nothing. After the teacher refuses to let the class go until she has officially dismissed them, the Sheriff says goodbye to Debbie, who is his daughter, and then leaves. Debbie, Curtis and Steven ask Ms. Davis not to assign homework because everyone will be at their birthday party next week, but she turns them down. When the three arrive at Debbie's house after school, she brings Curtis and Steven to the closet in her room and charges them each a quarter to watch through a peephole as her older sister Beverly strips down and dances around while she's changing clothes. Later, Debbie calls her father outside while skipping rope. After he narrowly evades a skateboard on the stairs - actually a trap set up by Curtis - Debbie drops her skipping rope on the ground, showing him that it is missing its handle. While he is distracted, Steven beats the sheriff from behind with his wooden baseball bat as Debbie stands and watches. Timmy shows up while Steven, Curtis and Debbie are arranging the Sheriff's body on the stairs, making Debbie quickly call for her mother, saying that their father fell and hurt himself. After the sheriff's funeral, Curtis, Steven, and Timmy go playing hide-and-seek in the junkyard. While Steven counts, Curtis dares Timmy to hide inside an old refrigerator, and then locks him in. Timmy manages to escape and returns home, where he tells Joyce about the incident. However, she doesn't believe him because of his lie about the dog, and he admits that he'd gone to Debbie's that night hoping to be able to use the peephole. Elsewhere, Debbie pastes a picture of Ms. Davis in her scrapbook, as well as an article about her father's death. That night, Debbie turns off the house security system and lets Curtis switch his replica gun with the sheriff's revolver. A few days later, Curtis shoots Ms. Davis with the revolver; Joyce later discovers the body in a closet. Meanwhile, Timmy attacks Curtis on the playground for locking him in the refrigerator, and on his way home is lured up to Debbie's tree house, where she almost pushes him off the edge onto a garden spike, but is interrupted by the phone ringing. Upon returning home, Joyce finds a note from Timmy, telling her he is in the junkyard. When she goes looking for him, Curtis and Steven try to run her over with a junk car, wearing a sheet with holes cut in it like a ghost to avoid being identified. She manages to avoid the car, tricking them into driving over a short drop- off. A police officer arrives and Joyce tells him what happened, but the kids are gone. That night, Joyce shows Timmy how she creates horoscopes. She says the solar eclipse that occurred during the births of Debbie, Curtis, and Steven blocked Saturn, the planet controlling the way a person treats other people, which means that something is missing from their personalities. Curtis waits outside with the revolver, hoping to kill them, but is startled by the headlights from a van. Once the couple in the van begin to have sex, he shoots them instead. Similarly, Debbie looks through the peephole at her sister, aiming an arrow at her, but does not shoot. At Curtis, Steven, and Debbie's birthday party, Curtis tricks Joyce into believing that he poisoned the cake to make her look crazy. Later, there's a brief moment of panic when she and Timmy think their house has been broken into, but it's only Joyce's college boyfriend. That evening, Beverly discovers Debbie's scrapbook of kills. She confronts Debbie over it and then shows the scrapbook to their mother. Debbie lies and says the scrapbook belongs to Curtis, so their mother forbids Debbie from hanging out with him and tells Beverly to burn the book, which she does. That night, Debbie tells Curtis and Steven to come to her house, then kills Beverly with a bow and arrow after tricking her into looking through the peephole. When the boys arrive, they are disappointed that she didn't wait for them, but help her move the body away from the house so it can be discovered. When her mother catches Debbie mopping up the blood on Beverly's floor, she lies and says it was nail polish. After Beverly's funeral, a distraught Mrs. Brody checks herself into the hospital. Curtis, Steven, and Debbie enjoy their freedom playing tag at Debbie's house, during which Curtis demonstrates that he can rewire the security system to lock all the doors to the house. When Timmy shows up and throws rocks at their window, they chase him down and almost succeed in strangling him with a garden hose before Joyce intervenes. Debbie once again blames Curtis and Steven and makes herself look innocent. When Joyce threatens to call the Sheriff, Curtis says he'll just think she's crazy, and threatens to have her arrested for assaulting a minor so she has to let them go. The next day, Debbie pastes a picture of Joyce into her scrapbook. Later, she tells Joyce that her mother has to see a psychiatrist that night, and asks if she and Timmy can babysit her at 7pm. Joyce agrees, unaware that it's a trap. After Joyce and Timmy arrive at Debbie's house, she lets Curtis and Steven in the back door, and Curtis rewires the security system to lock them in. Curtis and Steven try to shoot Joyce, while Debbie uses her jump rope to try to strangle her, as well as her bow and arrow. After several near misses, they manage to lock Steven in a trunk, and subdue Curtis after he runs out of bullets. While Timmy runs to a neighbor's house to call the police, Debbie escapes through a window just as her mother arrives home. She lies to her mother about Curtis and Steven, saying that they did bad things and Joyce was going to blame her for it. Her mother believes her and flees with her. The police arrest Curtis and Steven, much to the shock and anger of the townsfolk. As he is taken away, Curtis gives Joyce and Timmy an evil smirk. In the final scene, Debbie is playing with a large car jack outside a motel someplace else. When her mother comes out looking for her, she calls her Beth ‚Äì they've changed their names and moved to a new town. Her mother makes Debbie recite her new name again, and Debbie promises to be a good girl from then on. After they leave, the camera pans around a corner to reveal a driver crushed underneath a nearby truck.

Fluberg municipality was created January 1, 1914 when it was separated from S√∏ndre Land. Fluberg had a population of 2.027 at this point. On January 1, 1962 the municipality of Fluberg with 2,110 inhabitants was reunited with S√∏ndre Land.

This was the main church for both Nordre and S√∏ndre Land until 1866. The present church was built of timber in 1703. The pulpit from 1702 was carved by Lars Jenssen Borg (d. 1710). The baptismal fountain was made by his son, Nicolai Larsen Borg (1673-1764) and is from 1721. In 1751 Lars Pinnerud (1700‚Äì1762) carved a new altar for the church.

Without any formal scientific training, she wrote extensively on botany and birds, as well as genealogy and general history. Erickson authored ten books, co-authored four, was editor of twelve, and author or co-author of numerous papers and articles that have been printed in popular, scientific and encyclopaedic publications. Biography Kalamunda Hills, WA (1924) Born in Boulder, Western Australia, Erickson was the eldest of eight children of Phoebe Cooke and Christopher Sandilands, both of whom immigrated to Western Australia from Victoria in 1906, and met in the goldfield town. Christopher Sandilands was a farmer's son and worked at the Great Boulder Mine as a filter press hand. The family lived on Dwyer Street. Christopher enlisted into the army and served in France during World War I. He returned home disabled and was unable to resume his work at the mine, consequently purchasing a block of virgin bush at Kendenup to begin farming as an orchardist. It was here that Rica met botanical artist Emily Pelloe in 1921. Pelloe was introduced after Jack De Garis, the publisher of Pelloe's books, gave the Sandilands family a gift of her just published Wildflowers of Western Australia as a Christmas present. She returned to the goldfields to attend Eastern Goldfields High School, staying with her grandmother for five years. While living in Boulder she joined Girl Guides Australia where she developed an interest in birds and flowering plants. Choosing a career of teaching she was appointed as monitor teacher at her family town of Kendenup in 1924. After Kendenup, she was transferred to Mount Barker, Dumbleyung and Gnowangerup and in 1927 went to Perth and entered Claremont Teachers College for the required one year of training to become a country teacher. While there she met Dom Serventy and joined the Western Australian Naturalists' Club. By 1931 she was teaching at isolated one-teacher schools such as Aurora between Cranbrook and Kojonup, and later at Young's Siding near Wilson Inlet, and Denmark. The countryside on the southern coast piqued an interest in orchids and coincided with the publication of her friend Emily Pelloe's second book, West Australian Orchids. Eminent orchidologists Edith Coleman and Dr. Richard Sanders Rogers were quoted extensively in Pelloe's book, and Erickson established contact, sending them sketches and pressings of orchids found in her region. Wilson Inlet was the site of many specimens painted in 1881 by Robert D. FitzGerald, who published the important work Australian Orchids. In Christmas 1931 she holidayed in Victoria and met Coleman and Rogers who encouraged her further study. Knowing she would be returning to a school posting near Wilson Inlet, Rogers instructed her on the finer details of painting the plants using pen and ink instead of pencil as she did previously. After several years teaching on the southern coast of Western Australia, Erickson requested and received a transfer to the school at Bolgart north of Toodyay in 1934. It was here that she regularly passed by Hawthornden,'Hawthornden' coordinates: the historic house of pioneer settler, botanist and naturalist James Drummond. Later she would write a detailed family history of the Drummond family, in The Drummonds of Hawthornden, as well as histories of the surrounding districts in The Victoria Plains and Old Toodyay and Newcastle.Mansfield, C., 'Erickson (n√©e Sandilands), Frederica Lucy (Rica)', in R. Aitken and M. Looker (eds), Oxford Companion to Australian Gardens, South Melbourne, Oxford University Press, 2002, p. 203. Another interest that she followed in Bolgart was bees and wasps, which she studied with the apiologist Tarlton Rayment.\\"She became fascinated by native bees and wasps\\" in Cover of Orchids of the West (1951), Erickson's first book In Bolgart she met share-farmer and future husband Sydney \\"Syd\\" Uden Erickson (1908‚Äì1987) and they were married in Fremantle in June 1936. The couple bought land at Bolgart in 1938, which they cleared and named Fairlea. They raised four children: Dorothy (born 1939), John (1940), Bethel (1942), and Robin (1943); the next few years were devoted largely to raising the children and establishing the farm. However Erickson maintained her interest in natural history and in 1951 published her first book, the self-illustrated Orchids of the West. This was followed by Triggerplants in 1958. The state botanist Charles Gardner ran a wildflower tour in 1957 for the Midland Railway Road Service. The following year Erickson was invited to lead the tour, taking the opportunity for a paid holiday. In later years she led other groups of tourists on nature based tours in the south and north of the state. In 1965 the couple travelled to Europe for a holiday where Rica spent some time studying Drummond's plant specimens at the Kew Gardens herbarium in London, which were sent from Western Australia in the mid-19th century. On their return, they retired from farm life and settled in the Perth suburb of Nedlands, where Erickson wrote several more books. She became a member of the Royal Western Australian Historical Society and her writing during this period focussed on the early days of the state's European settlement, and its convict era. She wrote a history of the society called Forty Years of the Royal Western Australian Historical Society: 1936‚Äì1976 which was published in Early Days. Assisted by a group of volunteers, she compiled the first three volumes of the Dictionary of Western Australians in time for Western Australia's sesquicentennial year of 1979. In 1973 Flowers and Plants of Western Australia was first published. This book on Western Australian wildflowers and designed for popular use contained over 500 colour photographs and was the combined effort of Erickson as chairman and coordinator, Alex George and Neville Marchant as botanists, and Michael Morcombe as the photographer. Syd died in 1987. Rica died on 8 September 2009 at Mosman Park. Nature reserve In 1964, the Bolgart Branch of the Country Women's Association petitioned the Victoria Plains Shire Council for the protection of of remaining forest along the Old Plains Road, about south-west of Calingiri, an important track through the bush which was blazed by Drummond in 1842. The reserve is located at . The request was granted, and in 1996, following another request from the Association, the Department of Conservation and Land Management named Reserve 27595 the Rica Erickson Nature Reserve.\\"Rica Erickson ‚Äì Reserve near Calingiri named after botanist' Calm News : official newspaper of the Department of Conservation and Land Management, Sept‚ÄìOct 1996, p.12McGill, Gwenda.(1996) Reserve officially named after Dr Rica Erickson in honour of her botanical and preservation work in the area\\" Avon valley advocate, 14 Aug 1996, p. 3 Naming the reserve after a living person was an unusual step for the Department's naming committee.\\"In a rare break with tradition...\\" in Over three hundred people attended the official opening on 11 August 1996. Google Street View of nature reserve entrance. Awards and recognition In 1980 she was awarded an honorary degree of doctor of letters from the University of Western Australia for her research and work in the field of botany. In the same year she was named Western Australian Citizen of the Year in the category of the Arts, Culture and Entertainment, and in 1987 was made a Member of the Order of Australia, \\"in recognition of service to the arts, particularly as an author and illustrator\\". Her botanical illustrations have been exhibited at the Art Gallery of Western Australia and Perth's Alexander Library. In May 2007 she was awarded the Heritage Council of Western Australia individual award for her lifelong contribution to heritage in Western Australia. Noted botanist Alex George with whom she co-wrote Flowers and Plants of Western Australia in 1973, wrote: \\"Rica Erickson has been one of the foremost amateur natural historians in Western Australia in the 20th Century.\\" Ronda Jamieson, Director of the J S Battye Library in Western Australia said \\"Rica Erickson is one of Western Australia's treasures\\". The State Library houses the Rica Erickson collection, a repository which includes manuscripts of her publications, background papers relating to the genealogical dictionaries, all of her published works, field journals, and 500 of her botanical art works.

The film's plot concerns four teenagers who become trapped in a dark ride at a local carnival and are stalked by a deformed killer inside. Released by Universal Pictures, the film was director Hooper's first major studio production after Eaten Alive (1977) and The Texas Chain Saw Massacre (1974). Upon its release on March 13, 1981, it grossed $7.8 million and received mixed to positive reviews from critics.  Plot  A masked intruder attacks teenager Amy as she showers (resembling the opening scene of Halloween and the shower scene from Psycho). The attacker turns out to be her younger brother Joey, a horror film buff, and his weapon is a fake rubber prop knife. Against her father's wishes, Amy visits a sleazy traveling carnival with her new boyfriend Buzz, her best friend Liz, and Liz's irresponsible boyfriend Richie. At the carnival, the four teens smoke marijuana, peep into a 21-and- over strip show, heckle fortune teller Madame Zena, visit the freaks-of-nature exhibit, and view a magic show. Richie dares the group to spend the night in \\"The Funhouse\\", which is actually a dark ride. After the park closes, the teenagers settle down inside the funhouse, at which point they witness the ride assistant, a silent man in a Frankenstein's Monster mask, engage Zena as a prostitute. He experiences premature ejaculation, but despite his request, Zena will not return her $100 fee. He murders her in a violent rage. The teenagers try to leave, but find themselves locked inside the funhouse. As they attempt to escape, Richie secretly steals the money from the safe from which the masked assistant took Zena's fee. The funhouse's barker, Conrad Straker, discovers what his son Gunther Twibunt (the masked assistant) has done to Zena. Conrad also realizes that the money is missing. Thinking Gunther took it, he attacks him. Gunther's face is revealed to be gruesomely deformed with sharp protruding teeth, long white thinning hair, and red eyes. The teens see this, and Conrad realizes someone is watching after Richie's lighter falls on the floor from the ceiling he and the others were hiding in. Buzz concludes that Richie has the money. Richie insists that he would have split the money with the others. Despite Liz wanting to return the money, Buzz knows it's too late since they are now in danger. Conrad stalks the funhouse to eliminate any witnesses and heckles Gunther into a murderous rage. The teens arm themselves with the various funhouse props as weapons. Richie is hanged with a rope by Conrad, and the remaining three witness his corpse riding through on a cart. Liz, hysterical, falls through a trap door and is confronted by Gunther. She stabs him with a dagger, and he kills her by pushing her head through an industrial exhaust fan. Buzz stabs Conrad to death when he confronts him and Amy, but is then killed by Gunther. During a showdown between Amy and Gunther in the funhouse's maintenance area, Gunther is electrocuted and crushed to death between two spinning gears. As dawn breaks, a traumatized Amy emerges from the funhouse and heads home as the animatronic fat lady perched atop the entrance laughs.  Cast  * Elizabeth Berridge as Amy Harper * Cooper Huckabee as Buzz * Largo Woodruff as Liz Duncan * Miles Chapin as Richie * Kevin Conway as Freak Show Barker/Strip Show Barker/Conrad Straker (The Funhouse Barker) * Wayne Doba as Gunther Twibunt (The Monster) * Sylvia Miles as Madame Zena * William Finley as Marco the Magnificent * Shawn Carson as Joey Harper * Rebuka Hoye as Strip Show Dancer * Jack McDermott as Mr. Paul Harper * Jeanne Austin as Mrs. Ellen Harper Production The Funhouse was written by Larry Block, and the script was purchased by Universal Pictures, who were looking to produce a teen-aimed horror film after the success of Paramount's Friday the 13th (1980). The film was shot on location in Miami, Florida. Release The Funhouse opened in 814 theaters in the United States on March 13, 1981. It earned $2,765,456 in its opening weekend and grossed $7,886,857 in total. =Critical response= On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, The Funhouse holds a 67% approval rating based on 18 critic reviews, with an average rating of 5.96/10. Tobe Hooper was specifically praised for bringing style and suspense to what could have been a standard early-1980s blood and gore-focused horror film, and his work here was largely responsible for him getting the job of directing the original Poltergeist. Film critic Gene Siskel of the Chicago Tribune liked the film and gave it a positive review.Interview with Gene Siskel in Fangoria #15 (1981) John Corry of The New York Times gave the film a middling review, noting: \\"At times, in fact, Mr. Hooper almost persuades us that he is up to more than just gore, creepiness and trauma. He has photographed a carnival - freak show, girly show, grifters and geeks -with a sense of style. The carnival is a small vision of middle-America gone sour, reveling in mean gaiety, and it is not bad while it lasts. Then the monster comes in and drools.\\" Varietys review of the film was similarly mixed: \\"For all the elegance of photography, [the] pic has nothing in particular up its sleeves, and devotees of director Tobe Hooper‚Äôs The Texas Chain Saw Massacre will be particularly disappointed with the almost total lack of shocks and mayhem.\\" In a review published in People, the film was praised: \\"While the director, Tobe (The Texas Chainsaw Massacre) Hooper, ought to have moved on to better things, he is the master of this gore-and- sadism genre... The film features an excruciatingly tense final confrontation. Also quoted in Muir 2012, p. 167. Alex Keneas of Newsday also gave the film a positive review: \\"The Funhouse doesn't trade on gratuitous and graphic gore, but it doesn't have to. In little ways and using the traditional tried and true devices of the genre ... it skillfully heightens expectations [and] nicely evokes the chiller of a bygone era as it pays respect to Hitchcock and James Whale.\\" Composer John Beal's mostly orchestral score was praised by critics, and the soundtrack CD later became a collector's item. =Home media= =As a \\"video nasty\\"= The film was unsuccessfully prosecuted as a video nasty in the UK a few years after its release. Some commentators have questioned its attempted banning, given that the film is fairly tame in comparison to other entries on the list, leading some to suggest it was mistakenly chosen instead of the infamous Last House on Dead End Street, which was released under an alternative title The Fun House and oddly did not appear on the list. It was released uncut on VHS in 1987 and later on DVD in 1999. =Later releases= On July 18, 2011 Arrow Video released a new special edition Blu-ray disc in the UK, with the following special features: an audio commentary with The Funhouse special effects artists Craig Reardon and Jeffrey Reddick (creator of the Final Destination series), an audio commentary with producer Derek Power and genre scholar Howard S. Berger, an audio commentary with Justin Kerswell, author of Teenage Wasteland and host of the slasher cinema website Hysteria Lives, and author Calum Waddell, Carnage at the Carnival: Tobe Hooper Remembers \\"The Funhouse\\" , Miles of Mayhem: Acting in Tobe's Funhouse with star Miles Chapin, A Trilogy of Terror: The Make-up Madness of Craig Reardon, in which the S/FX wizard recollects his collaborations with Tobe Hooper; Eaten Alive, Poltergeist and The Funhouse, Master Class of Horror: Mick Garris, in which the director of Sleepwalkers and the miniseries adaptation of The Shining reflects on the crimson-covered career of his longtime colleague Tobe Hooper, a live Q&A; with Tobe Hooper from San Francisco, never-before-seen behind the scenes photographs from the collection of Craig Reardon, the film's trailer, a brand new transfer of the film in high definition (1080p), a four-panel reversible sleeve option with original and newly commissioned artwork, a double-sided fold-out artwork poster, and a collector's booklet featuring brand-new writing on the film by critic and author Kim Newman. January 30, 2012 also saw a UK release of The Funhouse by Arrowdrome DVD. Arrow Video released a special edition of The Funhouse on Blu-ray on November 26, 2012. Universal Home Entertainment released the film to DVD in the US on September 7, 2004. Shout! Factory released the film on Blu-ray and DVD in October 2012 under their horror sub- label, Scream Factory. Universal also released The Funhouse in a four-film set, including Phantasm II, Sssssss, and The Serpent and the Rainbow. Also noted that Gunther was meant to appear in the Boogeymen: The Killer Compilation; however, Gunther did not make the list. He did appear in the TV commercials of Boogeymen.  Novelization  A novelization of the screenplay was written by Dean Koontz, under the pseudonym Owen West. As the film production took longer than expected, the book was released before the film. The novel contains a great deal of backstory and characterization which was not used in the film.

Scandinavian sources In Gesta Danorum (book 6), Freawaru also appears, but unnamed. Froda and Ingeld are rendered as Danish kings, in conflict with the Saxons, and Freawaru is a Saxon princess. The Danish king Frotho (Froda) was killed through treachery by a Saxon named Swerting (Swertingus). Frotho's son Ingeld (Ingellus) lived a wanton life and married one of Swerting's daughters. This angered Starkad so much that he enlisted at the Swedish king Halfdan's (Haldanus) court instead. As Ingeld continued his sinful life and did not do his duty to avenge his father, Starkad appeared during a banquet that Ingeld had with the sons of Swerting, his father's slayer. Starkad strongly admonished Ingeld and humiliated his queen who tried to calm Starkad with kindness and her costly ribbon. Starkad succeeded in exciting Ingeld to kill Swerting's sons and to divorce his Saxon bride.

The group mainly use bass guitars and keyboards to create their soundscapes. They derived their name from the painter Mark Rothko. They have been described by others as post-rock for their use of a rock instrument, the bass guitar, to create what is according to some as non-rock music. History Formed in 1997, the original line-up consisted of Mark Beazley, Crawford Blair, and Jon Meade all playing bass guitar in a variety of different ways. This line-up released three albums on Lo Recordings and a host of singles and EPs on labels such as Bella Union, Bip Hop, Narwhal, and Livid Meerkat [Fierce Panda subsidiary] amongst others, before Beazley disbanded it in 2001. Between 2001 and 2004, Beazley continued to perform and release music under the Rothko name either solo or with a variety of different line-ups, including ones which featured Francis Morgan and Michael Donnelly, Beazley and Donnelly together, and the line-up of London/Aberdeenshire experimental rock band Delicate AWOL. Since 2004, the group stabilised as Beazley (bass guitar), Michael Donnelly (bass guitar), Ben Page (keyboards) and Tom Page (drums and percussion) - the latter three all being ex-members of Delicate AWOL. This line up of this history of the group disbanded in October 2010, with their last and final release being the \\"Sunset to Sunrise\\" EP, on Mark Beazley's own Trace Recordings label. Since disbanding, Tom and Ben Page went on to work as Rocketnumbernine, with their debut 12\\" release, Matthew And Toby produced and released by Kieran Hebden [Four Tet] on his own Text imprint and to back Neneh Cherry as both her recording and touring band. Michael Donnelly is also recording and releasing music under his own name. The first new Rothko release since 2010, the \\"Severed Tense\\" EP, was released on Trace Recordings on 1 July 2015 and features a set of 4 brand new recordings, the group now consisting again of Mark Beazley and Michael Donnelly. A new album is scheduled for a late 2015 release. As Rothko, Beazley also collaborated with artists such as Susumu Yokota, Caroline Ross of Delicate AWOL and JS Adams, aka BLK w/BEAR. He has also collaborated with Graham Dowdall, aka Gagarin, under the name Low Bias and also provided some of the original music score for the Discovery Channel documentary \\"The Flight That Fought Back\\", about United Airlines Flight 93. Rothko now consist of Mark and long time group member, Michael Donnelly. Mark also plays in Low Bias, with Graham Dowdall, aka Gagarin, and has recently collaborated with Anne Garner and James Murray under the name Tetherdown, and as Rome Pays Off, with original Rothko member, Crawford Blair.

He is one of the strongest characters in the series, although his gentle disposition and kind nature tend to hold him back from using his full power until he has no other choice but to do so. Shun is also the younger brother of Phoenix Ikki, a fellow Bronze Saint. Conception and creation As Masami Kurumada uses the Osamu Tezuka's Star System technique (a stable cast of characters which play a different or similar role in the author's various works, sometimes with the same personality and sometimes with an entirely new one), he gave Shun a design closely resembling Jindai Naoto from Otoko Zaka, the manga he wrote and drew one year before Saint Seiya, and Kirikaze from F≈´ma no Kojir≈ç, written and drawn several years before Saint Seiya. Many newcomers to the series have mistaken Shun for a female character, since Andromeda is a feminine constellation and the anime adaptation feminized Kurumada's original design of the Andromeda Cloth. A similar reference was made by Kurumada in the manga, before it was adapted to anime, when Ikki befriends a girl named Esmeralda whose only difference from Shun is her gender and her blonde hair. His hair is brown in the manga, but was modified to green in the anime adaptation to generate a better color balance. Kurumada explained in interviews that he gave the Andromeda Cloth the same color that identifies the Andromeda Galaxy found in the constellation of the same name. As Masami Kurumada was a practitioner of the martial arts in his youth, he used his knowledge about traditional Japanese martial arts weapons in his concept for Shun. The Chains of the Andromeda Cloth were a formidable weapon, perfectly suited for both defense and offense, sharing these traits with the traditional Manriki-gusari, a chain-based weapon used in Japanese martial arts. Character outline =Personality= Shun is the Bronze Saint of the Andromeda constellation. He is a merciful and gentle soul by nature and a firm believer in solving problems without bloodshed. This attitude separates him from the rest of the Saints: whereas they will not hesitate to battle when the situation demands it, Shun only allows himself to fight if it is an absolute necessity or if his almost endless patience wears out. In such cases, Shun can become an extremely skilled and deadly fighter. Shun is portrayed as being weak in the first four Saint Seiya films and in the anime-only Asgard arc. Almost every fight scene culminates with his almost defeat and subsequent rescue by his brother Ikki. In the original manga, however, Shun is shown as a formidable, if unwilling, fighter and opponent. =Abilities= Shun is the bearer of the Cloth which represents the constellation Andromeda, associated to Princess Andromeda, who was chained to be sacrificed to the monster Cetus in Greek mythology. The Cloth possesses chains that are said to be the same used to tie Princess Andromeda in the legend. Additionally the chains are related to the Andromeda Galaxy (believed to be a nebula back in the 1980s when the manga was created), hence the names for his techniques. These chains are legendary for their durability and defensive nature. They are also renowned for their great apparent length, as they can extend enough to reach light years away, penetrating the very fabric of space. When there is a threat, the chains can give out warning signs and become charged with enough electricity to release shocks of at least 10,000 volts. Shun normally relies on the Andromeda Chains to fight (as an accessory), as he does not want to use his full power to avoid killing opponents. During the Sanctuary arc of the manga, Shun awakens the seventh sense, the essence of Cosmo. Having been born under the sign of Virgo, Shun also dons the Virgo Gold Cloth during the Hades arc, in the battle against the God of Death Thanatos. After the Gold Cloths are destroyed, however, Shun manages to achieve his Andromeda God Cloth. Appearances =Saint Seiya= During the Sanctuary Saga, In the Galaxion War story arc Shun competed in the Galaxian Tournament to hopefully meet up with his older brother. He succeeds in his battle with Unicorn Jabu, eliminating him from the tournament. Eventually the tournament is interrupted by his brother, Ikki. Ikki, now cold hearted from his experiences on Death Queen Island, steals the Gold Sagittarius Cloth for his own. Shun along with the other protagonists race after him to retrieve the golden cloth. In the Sanctuary arc, at the battles of the Twelve Temples, Shun holds his own against Gemini Saga and manages to kill Pisces Aphrodite. In the Poseidon arc, he defeats the Mariner Generals Scylla Io, of the South Pacific Ocean, and Siren Sorrento, of the South Atlantic. In the Hades arc, he also manages to dispatch various opponents before it is revealed that he is the chosen human vessel of Hades, God of the Underworld. Although Shun himself is initially unaware of this, the soul of Hades possesses Shun's body during the close encounter in Hades's throne room after the death of Lyra Orph√©e. Not long after, the recently reincarnated Hades is confronted by Shun's older brother, Phoenix Ikki. Shun regains enough control of his body to strangle himself with one hand, while urging Ikki to take the opportunity to destroy him. However, Ikki hesitates at the last second and Shun's hold is lost. With the God of the Underworld back in command, the Phoenix Saint is swiftly dealt with. It takes the blood of Athena and the Goddess's encouragement to give Shun the strength to separate Hades from his body once and for all. When Shun awakens in Seiya's arms moments later, he once again dons the Andromeda Cloth and follows his fellow Bronze Saints to the Wailing Wall and then Elysion. There, they help Athena fight Hades in his true body and successfully defeat him. =Saint Seiya: Next Dimension= Shun reappears in Saint Seiya: Next Dimension, the sequel to the original Manga Saint Seiya, also written and illustrated by Masami Kurumada. In Next Dimension, Shun is the first Bronze Saint to return to Athena's side after the death of Hades and joins her in her quest to find a way to save Pegasus Seiya's life from Hades's curse. He escorts her to Olympus, to meet her elder sister Artemis, and protects Athena from the threat of Artemis's Satellites. The two eventually meet with the God of Time Chronos and manage to go to the past, to the 18th-century war against Hades. Shun is separated from Athena in the process and lands in the coliseum of Sanctuary, not without attracting the attention of several foot soldiers and Pegasus Tenma. He quickly dispatches the soldiers, but a brief fight ensues with Tenma which ends when Shun manages to convince Tenma that he is a Saint from the future. The two then join forces to climb up the Twelve Temples and reach Athena. Shun is proclaimed as the future Gold Saint of Virgo successor to Virgo Shaka.Saint Seiya Next Dimension vol.7 cap. 50 =Saint Seiya Omega= Shun also reappears in the non-canonical Saint Seiya Omega (sequel of the main series), coming to the aid of the new group of Bronze Saints. Shun reveals that, during the last battle of the 20th-century Saints against the evil god Mars, a mysterious rock fell from the sky boosting the Cosmos of every Saint and God, and granting them new elemental powers; as such, Mars himself gained the elemental power of darkness, that used to deal Shun a \\"dark wound\\" spreading all over his left arm. Unable to heal himself, and prevented to use his cosmos again, he retired himself as Saint, becoming a wandering doctor. In this facility he cured the wounded Dragon Ry≈´h≈ç, son of his old friend Shiryu, and helped Pegasus K≈çga (in which he recognized the courage of the late Pegasus Seiya) against Hound Miguel, one of the servants of Mars. However, forced to burn his Cosmos again, this time Shun lost almost completely the use of his left arm, overcome by darkness, and decided to devote himself to his new life as a physician entrusting Athena's safety to the 21st-century Saints. Despite his still meek, cheerful disposition, Andromeda Shun is still revered as one of the strongest Saints of the 20th century: when Hound Miguel faces him the first time, without knowing about his diminished strength, he escapes in fear, leaving a wounded K≈çga behind. Furthermore, K≈çga and Ry≈´h≈ç express amazement at his diminished strength, claiming to know about his legendary past deeds. =Knights of the Zodiac: Saint Seiya= Shun appears in the 2019 Original Netflix Anime Knights of the Zodiac: Saint Seiya. The character is now female under the name Shaun. Reception In a poll presented in volume 3, Shun came in as the third most favorite of the Bronze Saint protagonists. He is seen as the character with the most potential for yaoi out of the five principal Bronze Saints. Regarded as a \\"true walking caricature, this character was the most fragile and sensible, with fine traits, long hair, doe eyes and the most feminine armor of the group (with a nice 95B in the guise of a breastplate in the anime version)\\". His chains are regarded as highly symbolic, viewed as a jewel (a feminine symbol) and a weapon of changing length that can become supple or rigid at will (a phallic symbol), which can be used for defensive or offensive purposes (the sexual ambiguity and seme-uke dichotomy), and represents the original myth of Andromeda, who was tied on a rock and offered as a sacrifice to calm a marine monster's wrath, which is regarded as sexual. In the section \\"Right Turn Only!\\" from Anime News Network, writer Liann Cooper described Shun's character as \\"prissy\\" and his fight against his older brother, Phoenix Ikki, as a plot twist \\"skirmish\\". IGN felt that his caring nature, Shun is often in danger, resulting in Ikki coming to his aid. In a review of the anime, Chris Beveridge from AnimeOnDVD praised the fight between Shun and Gemini Saga due to the power the Bronze Saint shows to take down his enemy. Lorna Piatti-Farnell The Journal of Popular Culture noted that despite the character's androgynous appearance, the series never challenges his masculinity due to the way the Japanese culture accepts it. The writer of the Netflix series, Eugene Son, justified Shun's gender change after thinking the Knights needed more female representation. He explained that while the original show had some excellent core concepts, the one thing that bothered him about it was that ‚Äúthe Bronze Knights with Pegasus Seiya are all dudes‚Äù. However, this decision received backlash from fans of the original series. The gender swap of Shun, who was the only main male character of the original series who did not fit in the stereotype of the male hero - slightly effeminate, sensitive and opposed to fighting - was seen as a heteronormative move.

Located in southeastern Montana, the reservation is approximately in size and home to approximately 5,000 Cheyenne people. The tribal and government headquarters are located in Lame Deer, also the home of the annual Northern Cheyenne pow wow. The reservation is bounded on the east by the Tongue River and on the west by the Crow Reservation. There are small parcels of non-contiguous off- reservation trust lands in Meade County, South Dakota, northeast of the city of Sturgis. Its timbered ridges that extend into northwestern South Dakota are part of Custer National Forest and it is approximately east of the site of the 1876 Battle of the Little Bighorn. According to tribal enrollment figures as of March 2013, there were approximately 10,050 enrolled tribal members, of which about 4,939 were residing on the reservation, with approximately 91% of the population Native American (full or part blood quantum) and 72.8% identifying as Cheyenne. Slightly more than a quarter of the population five years or older spoke a language other than English. Members of the Crow Nation also live on the reservation.  Demographics  Traditional Cheyenne spiritual culture, like most traditional Indigenous spiritual ways, values the peoples' connection to their landbase, and sees the land itself, as well as special sites like Bear Butte, as sacred. Numerous Cheyenne work as foresters and fire fighters. This spiritual perspective is evident in traditional communities like Lame Deer and Birney and when the 2006 vote on development coal and coalbed methane on the reservation split along modernist vs traditional lines. A historical buffalo jump, burial sites of Cheyenne chiefs and spiritual leaders, the site of Custer's last camp before the Battle of the Little Bighorn, the Cheyenne Indian Museum, Ten Bears Gallery, St. Labre Indian School, and the Ashland Powwow are sites of special interest in the Ashland area. The Northern Cheyenne are related to the Southern Cheyenne, who are located in Oklahoma. Following the Black Hills War and earlier conflicts in Colorado (see Sand Creek Massacre and Washita Massacre), the Northern Cheyenne were forcibly moved to Oklahoma and restricted to lands of their southern relatives. Unable to acclimate swiftly to the heat of western Oklahoma (Indian Territory at the time), having to grow their food instead of hunting or gathering as were their ways, and the brutal conditions in the barracks where they were held, the northerners quickly began dying. In desperation, a small band left the reservation and headed north in 1878, an odyssey that came to be known as the Northern Cheyenne Exodus. The Northern Cheyenne briefly settled around Fort Keogh (Miles City, Montana). In the early 1880s, many families began to migrate south to the Tongue River watershed area and established homesteads in the northern edge of the Powder River Basin, which they considered their natural home. The Northern Cheyenne were allies of the Lakota in the Black Hills War of 1876‚Äì1877. The United States government established the Tongue River Indian Reservation, which consisted of of land, under the executive order given by President Chester A. Arthur on November 16, 1884 The boundaries originally did not include the Cheyenne who had homesteaded further east near the Tongue River, therefore those people who had were helped by the St. Labre Catholic Mission. This changed though when on March 19, 1900, President William McKinley extended the reservation to the west bank of the Tongue River, for a total of . Those Cheyenne who had homesteaded east of the Tongue River were relocated to reservation lands west of the river.Page 30, We, the Northern Cheyenne People, accessed September 20, 2009  Communities and neighborhoods  Northern Cheyenne headquarters Lame Deer, Montana, with about 4,000 residents, of which 92% are American Indian, is the capital of the Northern Cheyenne nation. Chief Dull Knife College is located there. To the west is Muddy, Montana with about 600 residents, 94% American Indian, and further west Busby, Montana with about 700 residents, 90% American Indian. Busby was the site of the Tongue River Boarding School, opened in 1904. The school would later become quite active in basketball, with their team playing a winning game against the Harlem Globetrotters and winning a State championship in the 1950s. The Busby White River Cheyenne Mennonite Church is located in Busby.\\"Busby White River Cheyenne Mennonite Church\\", Global Anabaptist Mennonite Encyclopedia Online, accessed September 20, 2009 Ashland, Montana, is to the east.

They are also very active in basketball. When Busby became part of their district, they had notable rivalry basketball games in the late 1940s and on. Birney, Montana, population about 100, 86% Indian, is south of Lame Deer and Ashland.

He served in the United States House of Representatives from November 5, 1912, to March 4, 1917, from Louisiana's 6th congressional district, which then included part of the New Orleans area. He is best remembered as the candidate of the Earl Kemp Long faction, which lost the pivotal Democratic nomination for governor of Louisiana to Jimmie Davis in the 1944 Louisiana gubernatorial election. Early life and education Morgan was born in Mandeville in St. Tammany Parish. He was a descendant of David Bannister Morgan (1773‚Äì1848), a pioneer in the settlement of Louisiana and a brigadier general in the Battle of New Orleans in the War of 1812. Morgan attended public schools and St. Eugene's College in St. Tammany Parish. In 1899, he graduated from the Tulane University Law School in New Orleans. Career Morgan was admitted to the bar in 1902 and began his law practice in Covington, the seat of St. Tammany Parish. He married the former Lenora Cefalu, and the couple had two children. From 1900 to 1908, Morgan was the president of the St. Tammany Parish Board of Election Supervisors; from 1904 to 1908, he was the president of the parish school board. He served briefly in the Louisiana House of Representatives in 1908 but resigned to become the St. Tammany Parish district attorney. He served in that position from 1908 to 1912, when he was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in a special election to fill the vacancy caused by the death of Representative Robert C. Wickliffe. He did not seek a third congressional term in 1916 but instead resumed his law practice in 1917 in both Covington and New Orleans. Morgan was a delegate to the 1912 and 1936 Democratic National Conventions, which nominated Woodrow Wilson and Franklin D. Roosevelt. He was also a delegate to the Democratic State Conventions of 1912, 1916, 1920, and 1924. Morgan was an unsuccessful candidate for governor in the election of 1944, having been backed by New Orleans Mayor Robert Maestri as the choice of the Long faction. Former Governor Earl Long was running for lieutenant governor that year, and Long had a plurality in the first primary election. Morgan was pressured to withdraw from the runoff against Davis. Had he done so, Earl Long would have become lieutenant governor without the need of a party runoff primary. By contesting the second balloting with Davis, Morgan set the stage inadvertently for J. Emile Verret of New Iberia, the seat of Iberia Parish, to defeat Earl Long for the nomination to the state's second highest office. (See Wade O. Martin, Jr., for more details on the 1944 election.) Davis received 251,228 votes (53.6 percent) to Morgan's 217,915 ballots (46.5 percent). At sixty-eight, Morgan was one of the oldest major candidates to have sought the Louisiana governorship. In 1964, the Republican nominee, Charlton H. Lyons, Sr., of Shreveport, sought the office at the age of sixty-nine, and his successful Democratic opponent, John J. McKeithen, made age an issue in that race. Morgan died in New Orleans. He is interred at Covington Cemetery in Covington. He was Episcopalian.

He took office with fellow Republican Ernie Fletcher in December 2003. Education Pence received BS (1976) and MBA (1978) degrees from Eastern Kentucky University, and a juris doctorate from the University of Kentucky in 1981. He received an Honorary Doctorate of Laws from Eastern Kentucky University in 2004. Early career After law school, Pence worked as an assistant attorney general of Kentucky from 1981 to 1982. From 1982 to 1987 he served active duty in the JAG Corps and was stationed in the Federal Republic of Germany. Pence was an Assistant United States Attorney for the Western District of Kentucky from 1990 to 1995 where he prosecuted a series of high-profile corruption cases, including those in Operation BOPTROT, an FBI investigation that ended in the convictions of over 20 legislators and lobbyists. He received the Kentucky Bar Association's \\"Outstanding Lawyer Award\\". He later became partner with the Pedley, Zielke, Gordinier and Pence law firm (1995‚Äì2001). US Attorney Pence was appointed by President George W. Bush as the United States Attorney for the Western District of Kentucky and was confirmed by the U.S. Senate to this position on September 24, 2001. Lieutenant governor He left the U.S. Attorney's Office in May 2003, to be the Republican Party's nominee for lieutenant governor when Ernie Flecher's original running mate, Hunter Bates, was disqualified from the ticket. They were elected in November 2003. He was the first Republican lieutenant governor to be elected in Kentucky in over five decades. As lieutenant governor, he served at various times as Secretary of the Justice and Public Safety Cabinet, Commissioner of State Police and Director of Homeland Security. He also was chairman of the Louisville Arena Task Force. On May 31, 2006, just a few weeks after Fletcher had been indicted on charges relating to the practices of hiring, promoting, and firing based on political affiliation, Pence he announced that he would not run for re- election with Fletcher in 2007, had no plans for any other elective office, and would no longer serve as Secretary of the Justice & Public Safety Cabinet.Lieutenant Governor Drops Off 2007 Ticket Jay Diyzer, WHAS-TV Louisville, KY, May 31, 2006 Less than two weeks later, Fletcher accelerated Pence's departure from the Justice Cabinet and named Kentucky National Guard Adjutant General Norman Arflack as Pence's replacement. Fletcher also asked Pence to resign from his role of lieutenant governor, but Pence refused, indicating that he serves as an elected representative of the people. Although Pence maintained that he did not separate himself from Fletcher's re-election effort in order to run for public office himself, there was speculation that he has not ruled out the possibility at some point in the future. In June 2006, Governor Fletcher announced that Robert \\"Robbie\\" Rudolph, secretary of the state Finance Cabinet, would be his running mate in his 2007 re-election campaign. As momentum for Kentucky's gubernatorial race began to build, Pence announced in January 2007 that he would not be a candidate for governor, and planned to return to the practice of law once his term of office ended. On February 25, 2007, Pence formally endorsed former Congresswoman Anne Northup over Fletcher in the 2007 governor's race. Fletcher was not elected to a second term, winning the primary election against Northup but ultimately losing the general election to Democrat Steve Beshear.

Gintaras Karosas continues to be involved in new contributions: the location of each piece is chosen to harmonize with the site's water features, its surrounding trees, shrubs, and flowers, and its daily patterning of lights and shadows. Activities Since 1993, the park has hosted annual International Sculpture Symposias; it hosts international artist-in-residence programs twice a year. Concerts and festivals are held, and a conference center is located at the park.

During World War II, he worked in the German V-2 rocket program under Wernher von Braun. From 1946 to 1953 he headed a group of 170 German scientists who were forced to work for the Soviet rocketry program under Sergei Korolev. After returning to West Germany in December 1953, he developed data processing systems and contributed to early commercial applications of computer science. In 1967 Gr√∂ttrup invented the basic principles of the smart card as a forgery-proof \\"key\\" for secure identification and access control. Education Helmut Gr√∂ttrup's father Johann Gr√∂ttrup (1881 ‚Äì 1940) was a mechanical engineer. He worked full-time at the Bund der technischen Angestellten und Beamten (Butab), a federation for technical staff and officials of the social democratic trade union in Berlin. His mother Th√©r√®se Gr√∂ttrup (1894 ‚Äì 1981), born Elsen, was active in the peace movement. Johann Gr√∂ttrup lost his job in 1933 when the Nazi Party came into power. From 1935 to 1939 Helmut Gr√∂ttrup studied applied physics at the Technical University of Berlin and made his thesis with professor Hans Geiger, the co-inventor of the Geiger counter. He also worked for Manfred von Ardenne's research laboratory Forschungslaboratorium f√ºr Elektronenphysik. German rocketry program From December 1939, Helmut Gr√∂ttrup worked in the German V-2 rocket program at the Peenem√ºnde Army Research Center with Walter Dornberger and Wernher von Braun. In December 1940, he was made department head under Ernst Steinhoff for developing remote guidance and control systems. Since October 1943 Gr√∂ttrup had been under SD surveillance. A report stated that he, his wife Irmgard, Wernher von Braun, and his colleague Klaus Riedel were said to have expressed regret at an engineer's house one evening that they were not working on a spaceship and that they felt the war was not going well; this was considered a \\"defeatist\\" attitude. A young female dentist who was an SS spy reported their comments. Combined with Himmler's false charges that they were communist sympathizers and had attempted to sabotage the V-2 program, the Gestapo detained them on March 21, 1944, and took them to a Gestapo cell in Stettin (now Szczecin, Poland), where they were held for two weeks without knowing the charges against them. Walter Dornberger and major Hans Georg Klamroth, representative of counterintelligence at Peenem√ºnde, obtained their conditional release so that the V-2 program could continue. Soviet rocketry program After World War II, Gr√∂ttrup decided to work with the Soviet rocketry program and to continue research as head of the Zentralwerke Bleicherode which was located in the Soviet Occupation Zone and finally occupied more than 4,000 employees for the reconstruction and manufacturing of the V-2 rockets. From 9 September 1945 to 22 October 1946, Gr√∂ttrup worked under the supervision of Sergei Korolev and Boris Chertok who reported to the Soviet military government of Dmitry Ustinov, the later Minister of Defense. Together with Kurt Magnus Gr√∂ttrup improved the design of the control system based on gyroscope for the inertial navigation system. Then during the night on 22 October 1946, a selected group of more than 170 German scientists and engineers - plus equipment - from the Zentralwerke were unexpectedly and forcibly (at gunpoint) moved to the USSR by 92 trains as part of Operation Osoaviakhim with more than two thousand German specialists . From 1946‚Äì1950, Gr√∂ttrup was in charge of the more than 170 German specialists brought to Branch 1 of NII-88 on Gorodomlya Island in Lake Seliger. The German team was indirectly overseen by Sergei Korolev, the \\"chief designer\\" of the Soviet rocketry program. Gr√∂ttrup helped Korolev with the R-1 project, a recreation of the V-2 missile using Russian manufacturing and materials. At Kapustin Yar, he helped Korolev supervise the launching of 20 rebuilt V-2 rockets and analyzing failure causes. In October 1947 they succeeded for the first time. As a reality check on Korolev's missile proposals, official Dmitriy Ustinov asked Gr√∂ttrup and his small team to design several new missile systems, including the R-10 (G-1), R-12 (G-2) and the R-14 (G-4) which was similar to the A9/A10 long range missile von Braun designed during the war. Gr√∂ttrup was also asked to consult on the R-13 (G-3) cruise missile. None of these projects went beyond the design stage. However, the theoretical work of the German scientists proposed improved solutions due to lack of material, and new ideas significantly contributed to the later success of Soviet space program. Some ideas were incorporated in the R-2 and R-5 missile systems. The launcher Vostok 1 for Yuri Gagarin's space flight in April 1961 was based on a bundling of a total of 20 A4-like engines with conical rocket bodies, as already proposed by the German scientists in 1949 in Gorodomlja. For political reasons, however, the contributions made by the German collective of rocket scientists to Soviet missile development have long been considered insignificant by the public in East and West. Return to Germany For security reasons, German specialists were not allowed to work on important missile technologies after 1951, but they were kept in the USSR for a 1.5 year \\"cooling off\\" period so they could not give timely information to British Intelligence or American Intelligence. Fritz Karl Preikschat, who managed the high frequency lab under Gr√∂ttrup from 1946-1952 on Gorodomlya Island, was released in June 1952, made it to West Germany, and briefed the U.S. Air Force on the Soviet rocketry program. Gr√∂ttrup and a few other German scientists were kept longer, based on their positions and the concern that they would move to West Germany. Gr√∂ttrup and his family returned to East Germany on 22 November 1953, among the last group from Gorodomlya Island, and, within two weeks, escaped to Cologne in West Germany with the support of British and American Intelligence. His knowledge and assumptions pointed to significant achievements of the Soviet rocketry with a strong focus on much higher payload and reach which Korolev eventually demonstrated with successfully launching the Sputnik 1 satellite to orbit in November 1957. Invention of the smart card From 1954 to 1958, Gr√∂ttrup worked for Standard Elektrik Lorenz in Pforzheim. He participated in developing the ER56, the first fully transistorized data processing system in Germany. With this, he installed one of the first commercial applications of data processing for managing the logistics of Quelle's mail-order business. In 1959, he joined the Produktograph company of Joseph Mayr, which was later taken over by Siemens & Halske, for production data acquisition and monitoring. In 1965, he formed a company called DATEGE in the data processing industry. In 1966, he filed the patent application \\"Identification Switch\\" for releasing a tapping process at a petrol station. In February 1967 he developed the principles of the smart card within the German patent application DE1574074 as an Unforgeable Identification Switch. He continued his ideas together with J√ºrgen Dethloff as a financial investor and, in 1968 and 1969, they filed several patents which were granted later-on, such as US3678250, GB1317915, GB1318850. Banknote processing In 1970, Giesecke & Devrient (G&D;) took over DATEGE and founded the Gesellschaft f√ºr Automation und Organisation (GAO). Gr√∂ttrup was managing director in charge of developing machine-readable security features to prevent counterfeit money together with half- and fully automated banknote processing systems (such as ISS 300 and ISS/BPS 3000). The Banknote Processing division (since April 2018 G+D Currency Technology) has become the world market leader for central bank equipment since the mid-1990s and has developed single note inspection systems for banknote printing companies. In 1979, G&D; presented the first smart card which later became the basic product of G+D Mobile Security. Gr√∂ttrup retired in 1980.

Description Portunid crabs are characterised by the flattening of the fifth pair of legs into broad paddles, which are used for swimming. This ability, together with their strong, sharp claws, allows many species to be fast and aggressive predators. Examples Its members include many well- known shoreline crabs, such as the European shore crab (Carcinus maenas), blue crab (Callinectes sapidus), velvet crab (Necora puber) and lady crab (Ovalipes ocellatus). Two genera in the family are contrastingly named Scylla and Charybdis; the former contains the economically important species black crab (Scylla serrata) and Scylla paramamosain. Taxonomy The circumscription of the family varies, with some authors treating \\"Carcinidae\\", \\"Catoptridae\\" and \\"Macropipidae\\" as separate families, and others considering them subfamilies of a wider Portunidae. Swimming crabs reach their greatest species diversity in the Pacific and Indian Oceans. Extinct genera are marked with an obelisk. ;Caphyrinae Gu√©rin, 1832 *Caphyra Gu√©rin, 1832 *Coelocarcinus Edmondson, 1930 *Lissocarcinus Adams & White, 1849 *Mioxaiva ‚Ä† M√ºller, 1978 ;Carcininae MacLeay, 1838 *Carcinus Leach, 1814 *Cicarnus ‚Ä† Karasawa & Fudouji, 2000 *Miopipus ‚Ä† M√ºller, 1984 *Portumnus Leach, 1814 *Xaiva MacLeay, 1838 ;Carupinae Paul‚Äôson, 1875 *Carupa Dana, 1851 *Catoptrus A.

Intramolecular nonbonded interactions E_mathrm{nonbonded} are counted only for atoms three or more bonds apart; 1,4 interactions are scaled down by the \\"fudge factor\\" f_{ij} = 0.5, otherwise f_{ij} = 1.0. All the interaction sites are centered on the atoms; there are no \\"lone pairs\\". Parameterization Several sets of OPLS parameters have been published. There is OPLS-ua (united atom), which includes hydrogen atoms next to carbon implicitly in the carbon parameters, and can be used to save simulation time. OPLS-aa (all atom) includes every atom explicitly. Later publications include parameters for other specific functional groups and types of molecules such as carbohydrates. OPLS simulations in aqueous solution typically use the TIP4P or TIP3P water model. A distinctive feature of the OPLS parameters is that they were optimized to fit experimental properties of liquids, such as density and heat of vaporization, in addition to fitting gas-phase torsional profiles. Implementation The reference implementations of the OPLS force field are the BOSS and MCPRO programs developed by Jorgensen. Other packages such as TINKER, GROMACS, PCMODEL, Abalone, Hyperchem, LAMMPS, Desmond and NAMD also implement OPLS force fields.

The objection could deal with (among others) place, time, or method of assertion. The plea in abatement was abolished as a particular form of response by the defendant when common-law pleading was replaced by Code Pleading and later by pleading rules, such as the federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Successful assertion of pleas in abatement merely pause proceedings until the problem is remedied. There were two fundamental styles of abatement. The first was abatement in proceedings which would merely suspend the proceeding until the error was fixed. Abatement in law would terminate it completely, although it could be restarted at the plaintiff's request. The second term is more common.

A member of the Liberal Party, Garrett served on the Victorian Legislative Council for eighteen years, and was knighted in 1973. Early life and career Garrett was born in Kew, in Melbourne, Victoria. He was educated at Workingman's College (now RMIT University) and the University of Melbourne. At the age of 26, Garrett graduated from flying school at the Royal Australian Air Force base at Point Cook; he became a commercial pilot in 1927, and joined the Citizen Air Force. Garrett later became the first civilian instructor in the CAF. Garrett was as keen on gliding as he was on flying aeroplanes. In 1928, he set a British Empire record for gliding duration. In 1929, he founded the Gliding Club of Victoria. In 1933, he began working in the Northern Territory for the Larkin Aircraft Company. Flying as the chief pilot for the company, Garrett ran the first Territory-wide mail route, and provided the air links between Darwin and other townships in the territory. In the mid-1930s, Garrett left the Northern Territory and returned to Melbourne, where he tried being a professional photographer. Garrett's interest in photography began in the 1920s, when he was one of the country's first aerial photographers. In 1934, Garrett married Vera Halliday Lugton, with whom he had four children. When World War II broke out, Garrett was called up into the Royal Australian Air Force. Initially based at RAAF Base Laverton, he moved to Mascot to take up a post as commanding officer of the RAAF training school. He retired from the Air Force in 1945, having achieved the rank of group captain. After the war, Garrett took his earlier love of photography and set up a successful business in Doncaster, manufacturing photographic chemicals. He later became Chairman of Ilford (Australia) Pty Ltd. Several of his descendants shared his passion, and became professional photographers. Politics It was around this time that Garrett also began to dabble in politics, sitting on the council of the Shire of Doncaster and Templestowe for six years. In 1956, Garrett contested‚Äîand won‚Äîthe seat of Southern Province for the Liberals. He served the electorate with distinction, and was elected President of the Victorian Legislative Council in 1968. Southern Province had, by that time, become over- large and difficult to represent, and, after some redistricting, Garrett joined fellow Liberal Vasey Houghton in representing Templestowe Province. He held a seat in Templestowe until his retirement from politics in 1976.

Background and education Born George Vane, he was the eldest son of Charles Vane, 3rd Marquess of Londonderry, by his second wife Frances Anne, daughter and heiress of Sir Henry Vane-Tempest, 2nd Baronet. He was the nephew of the second Marquess, better known as the statesman Lord Castlereagh, and the half-brother of the fourth Marquess. Vane was educated at Eton and Balliol College, Oxford. He became known by the courtesy title Viscount Seaham in 1823, when his father was created Earl Vane and Viscount Seaham, with remainder to his sons by his second wife.thepeerage.com George Henry Robert Charles William Vane-Tempest, 5th Marquess of Londonderry Political and diplomatic career Viscount Seaham entered the 1st Life Guards, purchasing a lieutenancy on 7 February 1845, and retiring on 5 May 1848. He was returned to parliament for Durham North in 1847, a seat he held until 1854. That year he succeeded his father as Earl Vane and entered the House of Lords. In 1867 he was sent on a special mission as Envoy Extraordinary to Russia to Emperor Alexander II, to invest the emperor with the Order of the Garter. When his half-brother, Frederick Stewart, 4th Marquess of Londonderry, died childless in 1872, Earl Vane inherited the marquessate and family estates. Two years later George Vane- Tempest, 5th Marquess, was appointed a Knight of the Order of St Patrick. In 1880 he became Lord-Lieutenant of County Durham, a post he held until his death four years later. He was appointed Lieutenant-Colonel Commandant of the 2nd (Seaham) Durham Artillery Volunteer Corps on 26 March 1864. This was a part-time unit largely recruited from his family's Seaham Colliery, and his younger brother and later two of his sons also became officers in the unit. The Marquess of Londonderry was succeeded in the command in 1876 by his eldest son. Army List.Ian F.W.

Business interests Lord Londonderry managed his father-in-law's estates (see below), which included some of the slate quarries around Corris, Gwynedd, Wales. He was one of the original promoters of the Corris Railway, created to carry the slate from the quarries to the markets. He sat on the board of the Cambrian Railways, latterly as Chairman. He owned lead mines at Van near Llanidloes and was a supporter of the Van Railway, which connected the mines to the Cambrian Railways mainline at Caersws. Family Lord Londonderry married Mary Cornelia Edwards, daughter of Sir John Edwards, 1st Baronet, on 3 August 1846. They set up home at Plas Machynlleth, the Edwards family seat, and had six children: * Charles Vane-Tempest-Stewart, 6th Marquess of Londonderry (1852‚Äì1915) * Lord Henry John Vane-Tempest (1 July 1854 ‚Äì 28 January 1905) * Lord Herbert Lionel Henry Vane-Tempest (6 July 1862 ‚Äì 26 January 1921), chairman of the Cambrian Railways, killed in the Abermule train collision * Lady Frances Cornelia Harriet Vane-Tempest (c.1851 ‚Äì 2 March 1872) * Lady Alexandrina Louise Maud Vane-Tempest (8 November 1863 ‚Äì 31 July 1945),Viscountess Allendale portraits married The 1st Viscount Allendale * Lady Avarina Mary Vane-Tempest (c. 1858 ‚Äì 26 June 1873) Lord Londonderry died in November 1884, aged 63. He was succeeded by his eldest son, Charles. The Dowager Marchioness of Londonderry, as she became upon her husband's death, remained in residence at Plas Machynlleth, where she entertained Princess Alexandra, Princess of Wales, in 1897. The Dowager Lady Londonderry died in September 1906. The 6th Marquess left Machynlleth on succeeding to the marquessate, but Lord Herbert Vane-Tempest remained resident at the Plas. He also served as Chairman of the Cambrian Railways, until he was killed in the Abermule train collision. The family gave the Plas to the townspeople after the Second World War. Lady Frances Anne Emily Vane (1822‚Äì1899), sister of the 5th Marquess, married The 7th Duke of Marlborough. She was the mother of Lord Randolph Churchill and grandmother of Winston Churchill. On Lord Herbert's death without issue, a trust set up by his grandmother Frances Anne passed to Winston Churchill, who was his first cousin once removed. This enabled Churchill to purchase Chartwell.

A mysterious character of unknown origins, The Wizard is constantly in search of a good party, cold beer, and attractive women. The Cheech Wizard is often drawn in graffiti murals and street art, and has been repeatedly referenced in pop music.  Publication history  Though the character was, according to Bodƒì, created in 1957, Cheech didn't first appear in print until April 1966 in the \\"Daily Orange\\" Syracuse University newspaper with the initial story \\"Race to the Moon\\", when he appeared in various publications being produced by the counterculture developing around the Syracuse University campus (where Bodƒì was attending school). Cheech Wizard stories ran in the \\"Funny Pages\\" of National Lampoon magazine in almost every issue from 1971 to 1975. The first Cheech Wizard collection was published in 1972 by the San Francisco-based underground publisher Company & Sons. All the Cheech Wizard stories were later collected and reprinted in two volumes by Fantagraphics Books. Cheech Wizard was revived by Bodƒì's son Mark Bod√© in The Lizard of Oz (Fantagraphics, 2004), a send-up of The Wizard of Oz based on an original concept by Vaughn Bodƒì.  Character appearance and personality  The Wizard wears a very large yellow Phrygian cap decorated with wizard symbols instead of a wizard's pointed hat, with his legs, clad in what appear to be red tights, visible underneath. His appearance and species have never been revealed. In an early comic, Captured by Morton Frog (1967), Cheech takes off his hat for a police officer, a priest and a political leader. You can clearly see him holding his hat in his hands, away from the rest of his body. The face is hidden by the speech balloon, but you can see glimpses of hair on top. All three persons witnessing his face fall into cataleptic states forever. Cheech walks away from their fortress claiming that \\"Their primitive minds couldn't accept da truth\\". In a later comic, Who is C.W.? (1974), one of Cheech's lovers insists on seeing his true face. Cheech claims that she will die instantly, or go insane. After having her sign a waiver freeing him of legal responsibilities, he agrees to take off his hat. The comic ends abruptly at mid-page with Cheech saying \\"Okay! Here goes, but I bet you go blind!\\", followed by a blank (white-out) panel. Cheech Wizard speaks in an ungrammatical sort of urban dialect. He was generally accompanied by his lizard apprentice, Razzberry (until that character was killed off). Cheech was depicted as foul-mouthed, often drunk or high on drugs, and constantly on the make. His attitude towards his fellow residents of the magic forest in which he lived (generally talking male animals and human females, the latter invariably under-dressed) was usually one of contempt. Curiously, he was referred to (often by himself) as the Cartoon Messiah, which suggested Bod√©'s long-standing interest in mysticism. But his general reaction to anyone who annoys him (and the list there is quite long) is to deliver a swift kick to the groin. Mark Bod√© claims that the Cheech Wizard was his father's \\"alter- ego, . . . a bad-mouth hat with no respect for anyone, completely the opposite of Vaughn, who was charismatic but shy.\\" In popular culture  *Kidrobot's first toy was a Cheech Wizard *In 2007, Puma released a limited-edition shoe and matching hoodie inspired by Cheech Wizard (and designed by Mark Bod√©).Harmanci, Reyhan, \\"The Bay Citizen: In Finishing Comics, a Son Completes a Legacy,\\" New York Times (July 1, 2010). *The cable TV show Burn Notice had an Cheech Wizard graffiti in the background of one scene. *The logo of Lucky Spin Recordings is based on the drawings of RazzberryLucky Spin Recordings entry, MusicStack.

Coleridge-Taylor Perkinson was Afro-American. He was named after Afro-British composer Samuel Coleridge-Taylor (1875‚Äì1912). Perkinson's mother was active in music and the arts as a piano teacher, church organist, and director of a theater company.De Lerma, Dominique-Rene. \\"African Heritage Symphonic Series Vol. III\\". Liner note essay. Cedille Records CDR066. Perkinson attended the High School of Music and Art in New York City. After graduating from high school, he attended New York University. He later transferred to the Manhattan School of Music, where he studied composition with Vittorio Giannini and Charles Mills. He received bachelor's and master's degrees from the Manhattan School of Music. He also studied with Earl Kim at Princeton University. He was on the faculty of Brooklyn College (1959‚Äì1962) and studied conducting in the summers of 1960, 1962, and 1963 in the Netherlands with Franco Ferrara and Dean Dixon and also learned conducting in 1960 at the Mozarteum in Salzburg. Perkinson cofounded the Symphony of the New World in New York in 1965 and later became its Music Director. He was also Music Director of Jerome Robbins's American Theater Lab and the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater. Perkinson composed a ballet for Ailey entitled For Bird, With Love inspired by the music of jazz great Charlie Parker. Perkinson wrote a great deal of classical music, but was equally well- versed in jazz and popular music. He served briefly as pianist for drummer Max Roach‚Äôs quartet and wrote arrangements for Roach, Marvin Gaye, and Harry Belafonte.

The Cana particle is a personal name meaning 'wolf cub'.\\"The McCann Surname\\", Ancestry.com. According to Irish tradition they are a Milesian people descended from Colla-da-Chrioch, the first king of Airgialla. The family of the name Mac Cana, were known as lords of Clanbrassil. They were a branch of the Cenel Eoghain, the large group of Northern U√≠ N√©ill septs claiming descent from King E√≥gan mac N√©ill, the son of the High King Niall of the Nine Hostages. Amhlaoibh Mac Cana is mentioned in the Annals of the Four Masters. He was praised for his chivalry, his vigour, and his strong drink he made from apples in his orchard. The McCanns are also stated as having had a castle at Portadown in County Armagh. The last recorded Chief of the name, Donall MaCanna, was still known as lord of Clanbrassil as late as 1598. The title of lord of Clanbrassil is still held by the family of McCann in the area of County Louth. Their territory lay to the south of Lough Neagh in modern-day County Armagh and County Tyrone, flanked by the River Bann and River Blackwater. The McCann line features in John O' Hart's 19th century pseudo- historical book, Irish pedigrees. In this book, the McCann line along with other surname lines are taken right back to Adam and Eve. Due to anglicization the original form Mac Cana has had many different variations, such as McGann, MacCann, MacCan, Maccan (this part of the Maccans had connections with many European noble and royal families, such as the Maccan of Villanova or Maccan de Gueldre), MacCana, and became Canny and Canney upon Ulster migration to the south (Leinster and Munster).  The House of Maccan  From Ireland, a branch of the family moved to France in the 11th century with the surname Maccan. With Philip IV of France, called ‚Äúle Bel‚Äù (the handsome), of the Capet dynasty, to Maccan Family, who for some time had held important positions within the court, such as vicars general, leaders and generals of the royal army and administrators of justice in the name of King Philip IV, was assigned the Marquis title and then, in the first half of the 14th century, through marriage and testamentary bequest, the title of Counts and Dukes of Guelders (de Gueldre) by the Wassenbergs. https://almanachdegotha.altervista.org/the- house-of-maccan/ Over the years, a branch of the family from France moved to Italy. In this period the family was also known as Maccani (Italianization of the surname) they also changed the original family coat of arms, becoming a talking coat of arms (the new crest had as a symbol a dog, which become then two dogs facing each others, in fact ‚ÄòCan‚Äô and ‚ÄòCani‚Äô in italian translates to ‚Äòdog‚Äô and ‚Äòdogs‚Äô). Here in the first half of the 17th century, from Nobles of Trento they became Counts of Tres by concession of Ferdinand Charles, Archduke of Austria and subsequently Marquis. During the fourteenth century, the evidence of the existence of some members of the Maccan family, armigers, Vicars General, administrators of local noble goods, judges, lawyers and notaries, have come down to us.https://noblesseobligeitalia.blogspot.com/2019/01/famiglia-maccan-maccan- di-gheldria-poi.html Although was assumed that they carried out these duties before, the first document attesting the presence of a Maccan (Maccani) as Vicar General it is date in the 1600s with Luca Maccan von Clers (Vicar general of Prince Bishop Carlo Emanuele Madruzzo and of the Diocese of Trentino), while as a notary is from 1652 with Giovanni Maccan von Tres (Ioannes Maccanus de Tresio utraque auctoritate notarius ).

Donald Harcourt De Lue (October 5, 1897, Boston, Massachusetts ‚Äì August 26, 1988, Leonardo, New Jersey) was an American sculptor, best known for his public monuments.Howlett, D. Roger, The Sculpture of Donald De Lue: Gods, Prophets and Heroes, David R. Godine, Publisher, Boston, 1990 Life and career De Lue studied at the Boston Museum of Fine Arts and later served as an assistant to sculptors Richard Henry Recchia and Robert P. Baker. This was followed by five years in Paris where he continued his study, while working as an assistant to various French artists. He returned to the United States where he was engaged by Bryant Baker. In 1940 he was elected into the National Academy of Design as an Associate member, and became a full Academician in 1943. In 1941, De Lue won a competition to create sculpture for the U.S. Post Office and Courthouse Building in Philadelphia, and from then on he stopped being an assistant for other artists and only worked on his own commissions and creations. De Lue's works can be found in many museums across America. Like many other sculptors of his generation, he executed architectural works. He was also a prolific designer of medals and medallions. De Lue taught at the Beaux-Arts Institute of Design in New York City during the early 1940s. In 1960, he won two Henry Hering Awards, given by the National Sculpture Society for outstanding collaboration between a sculptor and an architect, for the Normandy American Cemetery and Memorial in Colleville-sur-Mer, France, and for the Stations of the Cross at the Loyola Jesuit Seminary in Shrub Oak, New York. In 1967, De Lue won the American Numismatic Society's J. Sanford Saltus Award for Outstanding Achievement in the Art of the Medal, known as the Saltus Award. Beginning in 1964, for many years De Lue was a Trustee of Brookgreen Gardens, as well as Chairman of the Art Committee. In his later years, De Lue and his wife Naomi (who served as a model for many of his statues) lived in the Leonardo section of Middletown Township, New Jersey, a small shore town with a bayside beach and long-distance view of lower Manhattan.Stattel, Erin O. \\" From monumental to medallions, exhibit showcases De Lue's work; Leonardo sculptor known for powerful human figures\\" , The Hub, August 6, 2009. Accessed August 29, 2013. \\"De Lue, best known for his sculpture 'Rocket Thrower,' showcased at the 1964 New York World's Fair, was originally from Boston but took up residence in the Leonardo section of Middletown after seeking more space for his sculpting passion.\\" De Lue cited the 23rd Psalm and the words \\"He leadeth me beside the still waters...\\" as the inspiration by which he arrived in Leonardo from New York City. Although he continued to maintain his NYC apartment, it was in his Leonardo studio that many of his largest statues were made. One of the last was a commission by a private individual intended for the Alamo in San Antonio, Texas. The bigger-than-life statue of Bowie, Travis and Crockett was considered \\"too violent\\" by the Daughters of the Republic of Texas for placement in a sacred chapel. A compromise was sought, that the statue be installed outside the building in the large courtyard rather than inside. DeLue and his patron, a wealthy Texan, preferred the statue be installed in the interior space for which it was made. Unfortunately, the impasse was never resolved in De Lue's lifetime. Donald and Naomi De Lue are buried in Manalapan Township, New Jersey at the cemetery at Old Tennent Presbyterian Church.

He later received a Doctor of Divinity degree from Indiana Central, as well. Episcopal ministry Milhouse was elected a Bishop by a special mail-in ballot in November, 1960. He spent eight years supervising E.U.B. churches in the denomination's Southwestern Area (with offices in Kansas City). In 1968 he was assigned to the Oklahoma Area of the (new) United Methodist Church (U.M.C.). He was President of the U.M.C. Council of Bishops, 1977-78. He retired in 1980.

A new perspective on the health of Canadians. A working document. Ottawa: Government of Canada, 1974. It proposed the concept of the \\"health field\\", identifying two main health- related objectives: the health care system; and prevention of health problems and promotion of good health. The report is considered the \\"first modern government document in the Western world to acknowledge that our emphasis upon a biomedical health care system is wrong, and that we need to look beyond the traditional health care (sick care) system if we wish to improve the health of the public.\\"Hancock, Trevor. \\"Beyond Health Care: From Public Health Policy to Health Public Policy.\\" Canadian Journal of Public Health 76, Supplement One (May/June 1985).. The Report also recognizes that use of the local Health System shapes how people define their health-related need, options for care and definition of health. Background Marc Lalonde, who was the Canadian Minister of National Health and Welfare in 1974, proposed a new \\"health field\\" concept, as distinct from medical care. Lalonde noted that the \\"traditional or generally-accepted view of the health field is that the art or science of medicine has been the fount from which all improvements in health have flowed, and popular belief equates the level of health with the quality of medicine.\\" The new concept \\"envisage[d] that the health field can be broken up into four broad elements: Human biology, Environment, Lifestyle, and Health care organization;\\" that is, determinants of health existed outside of the health care systems. The report was written by a group of civil servants led by Hubert (Bert) Laframboise, based on population studies in Canada, where care aims to address one of the most ethnically diverse populations in the world. The report is considered to have led to the development and evolution of health promotion, recognizing both the need for people to take more responsibility in changing their behaviors to improve their own health, and also the contribution of healthy communities and environments to health.Glouberman S. Towards a New Perspective on Health Policy. Canadian Policy Research Networks, 2001. Accessed 18 July 2011. Another innovation of the report was that it proposed that public health interventions should focus attention on that segment of the population with the highest level of risk exposure. It this sense, the report was fundamental in identifying health risk behaviours as a determinant of health inequalities. The proposals advocated by the report seem to have had mixed outcomes; while its nutritional and exercise recommendations are believed to have been widely accepted, there remains disagreement about its overall impact on population health. It has been argued such debates highlight the need for a fuller exploration of the health policies in place. Health field The concept of the \\"health field\\", as identified in the Lalonde report, is considered to be composed of four interdependent fields determined to influence individual's health. These include: * Biology: all aspects of health, physical and mental, developed within the human body as influenced by genetic make-up; * Environmental: all matters related to health external to the human body, over which the individual has little or no control, including the physical and social environment; * Lifestyle: the aggregation of personal decisions (i.e. over which the individual has control) that can be said to contribute to, or cause, illness or death; * Health care organization: includes medical practice, nursing, hospitals, nursing homes, medical drugs, public health services, paramedic services, dental treatment and other health services.

Although the Plas was in Montgomeryshire, the station was across the Afon Dulas in Merionethshire. The station was built at Llwyngwern, rather than at Pantperthog, because there is a very tight bend and a steep gradient on the railway at Pantperthog. The station was opened on 1884, and closed with the end of passenger services in December 1930.

The branch was built after 1887. There was a short siding at the start of the branch, which was used to store wagons waiting to travel on the Corris Railway. The branch ran on top of a high slate embankment and crossed the Afon Dulas on a timber viaduct. On the east bank, another slate embankment took the branch over the Ffridd Gate to Pont Ifans road on a high bridge, and on to the bottom of the quarry. Here an incline led up to the quarry mill level, and a long tunnel ran to the bottom of the main quarry pit. Around 1927, the wooden bridge was declared unsafe and the branch was abandoned.

It is often referred to as the \\"lost\\" land of Disneyland. Opening on June 16, 1957, Holidayland had its own admission gate into Disneyland and could hold up to 7,000 guests for large events. It also had playgrounds, horseshoes, baseball field, volleyball, \\"the world's largest candy-striped circus tent\\" (previously used by the short- lived Mickey Mouse Club Circus and Keller's Jungle Killers attractions) and other activities. Food and concessions were available for purchase including beer, which was not sold on the neighboring premises of Disneyland. Holidayland closed in September 1961 due to its lack of shade, no nighttime lighting or restrooms, and alleged lack of Disney \\"flavor\\". According to Disney Legend Milt Albright, Holidayland's manager, \\"It wasn't any one thing that killed Holidayland. It was just the combined effect of a whole lot of things.\\" Today, the former location of Holidayland houses support facilities for Disneyland, including show buildings for The Haunted Mansion and Pirates of the Caribbean. History Tickets used to promote the Disneyland Railroad before the opening of Disneyland in 1955 The original concept for Holidayland was that of a turn-of-the-century town park, with picnic areas, horseshoe pits, a baseball diamond, and perhaps an open field where a circus could come to perform. This original version would be located where the Matterhorn sits today. As Disneyland came together in 1954, it became apparent that there wasn't enough space within the park for Holidayland to become a reality, and the land (now sometimes called \\"Recreationland\\") became a picnic and recreation area, with minor seasonal holiday decorations. In November 1955, the Mickey Mouse Club Circus came to Disneyland, in the Fantasyland section of the park.

It took place from December 2002 to February 2003, when it faded. The government fired over 18,000 PDVSA employees for \\"dereliction of duty\\" during the strikeMcCaughan, p 128; L√≥pez Maya, p 19. and arrest warrants were issued for the presidents of the striking organizations. The main impact of the strike derived from the stoppage of the oil industry, in particular the state-run PDVSA, which provides a majority of Venezuelan export revenue. The strike was preceded by the 2002 Venezuelan coup d'√©tat attempt in April 2002, and a one-day strike in October 2002. Buildup After April's coup d'√©tat attempt, conflict simmered throughout the rest of 2002. On 14 August the Supreme Tribunal of Justice absolved four military officers involved in the April coup. This set the scene for further actions by the military.\\"Fue √©sta una clara decisi√≥n pol√≠tica y no jur√≠dica del m√°ximo tribunal, que abri√≥ la puerta para una nueva aventura militar.\\" (Lopez Maya 2004)Human rights group PROVEA denounced the decision as a denial of justice \\"only explicable by the politicisation of the court\\". \\"Negar la posibilidad de un juicio cuando es p√∫blico y notorio la existencia de indicios de comisi√≥n del delito de rebeli√≥n militar ser√≠a un acto de impunidad de suma gravedad, s√≥lo explicable por la politizaci√≥n del TSJ de la cual, como hemos dicho, el oficialismo es uno de sus principales responsables\\" (PROVEA, 14 August 2002, cited in Lopez Maya 2004) Altamira On 21 October a one-day general strike (paro) took place (two general strikes had taken place in December 2001 and in April 2002BBC, 9 April 2002, Venezuelan general strike extended), aimed at forcing the resignation of Ch√°vez or at least the calling of new elections.(Lopez Maya 2004) On 22 October 14 military officers who had been suspended for participating in the coup, led by General Enrique Medina G√≥mez, occupied Plaza Francia in Altamira, an Eastern Caracas neighbourhood, and declared it a \\"liberated territory\\".L√≥pez Maya, p 17; McCaughan, p 121. They said they would not leave until Ch√°vez had resigned, and called on their colleagues in the military to rise against the government.\\"Anunciaron que s√≥lo abandonar√≠an la plaza cuando cayera Ch√°vez y llamaron a sus compa√±eros de armas a alzarse contra el gobierno.\\" (Lopez Maya 2004) In early November, there was a major clash of government and opposition demonstrators in downtown Caracas; and, in the middle of the month, a shootout which resulted in three deaths occurred in Caracas' Plaza Bolivar between the Metropolitan Police and the National Guard.L√≥pez Maya, pp 17‚Äì18; McCaughan, p 120 has additional information on the conflict in and around the Metropolitan Police, who were controlled by the anti-Ch√°vez mayor of Caracas, Alfredo Pe√±a. Sometime in November, Ch√°vez replaced the commissioner of the force, Henry Vivas, with Gonzalo S√°nchez Delgado; whereupon the mayor ordered the police not to obey him. Oil strike =Launch= The Coordinadora Democr√°tica, led by the business federation Fedec√°maras and the trade union federation Confederaci√≥n de Trabajadores de Venezuela (CTV), called for a fourth paro c√≠vico, which turned out to be the most serious, and is known as the 2002‚Äì2003 oil strike, to begin on 2 December 2002. The opposition also called a recall-referendum- petition-signature-gathering day for 4 December.Michael McCaughan, The Battle of Venezuela. London, 2004. p 123. Initially the strike had a mixed response, with affluent eastern Caracas seeing most shops closed, while downtown and western Caracas was busy; many business owners either supported Ch√°vez or put their business above politics. Early attempts to block a crucial navigation channel in Lake Maracaibo, in order to paralyse the oil industry, were foiled by the navy. The National Electoral Council voted to hold a non-binding recall referendum on 2 February, but the Coordinadora Democr√°tica chose to ignore it.Jones, Bart (2008), Hugo! The Hugo Ch√°vez Story From Mud Hut to Perpetual Revolution, London: The Bodley Head, p374 On 4 December the captain of a large oil tanker named for the beauty queen Pil√≠n Le√≥n anchored in the Lake Maracaibo shipping channel and refused to move. The rest of PDVSA 13-ship fleet was quickly similarly grounded. Combined with the PDVSA management walkout, this effectively paralysed the Venezuelan oil industry.Jones (2008:375) The key element of the paro was the stoppage of production at the state oil company Petr√≥leos de Venezuela (PDVSA), which was effected by management's locking workers out of facilities, along with the shipping shutdown. Many low and mid-level employees ignored the strike and reported for work.INTESA, the information and technology enterprise that was formed to run electronic operations at Petr√≥leos de Venezuela, was at this time 60 per cent owned by a United States company, Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC), which is \\"closely linked to the U.S. government\\", with \\"former chiefs of staff, ex-CIA agents, and high-level government employees comprising its board of directors.\\" (Golinger, \\"Machine\\", p 135.) Golinger reports that during the work stoppage, INTESA refused requests by Petr√≥leos de Venezuela president Ali Rodriguez to provide him the computer access codes so that Petr√≥leos employees could operate the company's machinery. Eventually, Petr√≥leos employees had to enter INTESA headquarters and seize equipment to reestablish operations. Source: Golinger, \\"Machine\\", pp 135, 6, on INTESA; and Golinger, \\"Media\\", p 100, on the management's activities. Unlike the previous strikes, this oil strike included not only the PDVSA management but also substantial parts of its operational staff, including virtually all of its marine flotilla captains. Within days the company was paralyzed. Long vehicular traffics in gas stations on December 10, 2002. Petroleum production soon fell to one-third normal; Venezuela had to begin importing oil to meet its foreign obligations; and domestically, gasoline for cars became virtually unobtainable, with many filling stations closed and long queues at others.One third normal: McCaughan, p 126; gas shortages: L√≥pez Maya, p 18. According to a previous version of this article, Venezuela's normal production of oil and oil derivatives before the strike was per day Many privately owned businesses closed or went on short time, some out of sympathy for the strike, others because of the fuel shortage and economic paralysis. As long waits for gasoline became common, airlines cancelled many domestic flights, banks limited their opening hours, and many shops were shut despite it being peak Christmas shopping season. The Coordinadora adopted the slogan \\"2002 without Christmas, 2003 without Ch√°vez\\". The private television networks gave enormous coverage to the near-daily protest rallies and strike activities, as well as daily updates by the Coordinadora Democr√°tica. They also \\"canceled regular advertisements and ran pro-strike, anti-Ch√°vez spots around the clock.\\" Venevisi√≥n's president openly declared solidarity with the strike.Golinger, \\"Machine\\", p 133. She also writes, in \\"Media War Against the People,\\" (p 101) that \\"The four primary stations suspended all regular programming throughout the duration of the 64-day strike: no product commercials, no soap operas, no movies, no cartoons, and no sitcoms. They broadcast an average of 700 pro- opposition advertisements each day, paid for by the stations themselves and by the opposition umbrella group, Democratic Coordinator.\\" A media war between the private networks and the state-run Venezolana de Televisi√≥n resulted, with for example the private networks declaring all universities and schools closed, while on VTV the Minister for Education declared them open.Eva Golinger, Venezuelanalysis.com, 25 September 2004, A Case Study of Media Concentration and Power in Venezuela =Indefinite strike= Large pro- and anti-Ch√°vez marches were held in the first weeks of the strike. On 6 December a Portuguese taxi driver named Jo√£o de Gouveia killed three and injured 28 at Plaza Altamira. The opposition blamed Ch√°vez, and the killings \\"energized and radicalized the opposition movement\\".Jones (2008:376-7) On 9 December the opposition declared the strike to be of indefinite duration, and said that only Ch√°vez's resignation could end it. As shortages of gasoline and later basic foods took hold, the government responded by developing an informal emergency import network with the support of other governments in the region.Jones (2008:378) Ch√°vez also took an increasingly hard line with PDVSA in an attempt to break the strike. On 12 December he fired four PDVSA executives leading the strike; he had previously fired them and others in April before the coup, but reinstated them after the coup. He continued to dismiss striking executives and managers on a daily basis; 300 were gone by early January.Jones (2008:378-9) Attempts to use the navy to take over the key Pil√≠n Le√≥n tanker were initially thwarted by a lack of a qualified crew. On 19 December a team of retired seamen took command, and worked for two days to restart the ship, eventually successfully returning it to port. The departing crew \\"had sabotaged the ship, leaving behind hard-to-notice traps in the computer system and elsewhere that could set off an explosion.\\"Jones (2008:379‚Äì380) Gradually, the government restarted oil production by promoting lower-level employees, typically loyal to Ch√°vez or at least opposed to using the company with political purposes. The company was also split into eastern and western parts, with the eastern Caracas headquarters, where striking executives and managers were concentrated, being heavily reduced.Jones (2008:382) Efforts to restart production were hampered by sabotage, which included changing electronic safety limits and the use of remote computers to interfere with reactivation attempts.Jones (2008:380‚Äì381) =Collapse= By New Year, the strike was beginning to unravel, despite the still increasing scarcity of consumer goods. More and more small and medium businesses re- opened; many small businesses had never closed in the first place. \\"small- and medium-sized businesses reopened their doors, admitting that the strike now threatened to turn into a 'suicide watch' that could well bankrupt their businesses for good.\\"McCaughan, p 128. The Coordinadora attempted to promote a tax boycott (which the television networks supported); the government pointed out that tax evasion was a crime. Towards the end of January the Coordinadora began to accept first privately and then publicly the partial re-opening of businesses and schools, and on 27 January the Caracas Stock Exchange re-opened for the first time in 9 weeks, for a few hours a day. On 23 January a rally of several hundred thousand Chavistas took place.Jones (2008:384-5) By the time of the 11th anniversary of the 4 February 1992 coup attempt, the strike was virtually over outside the oil industry.Jones (2008:386) The government gradually reestablished control over PDVSA; oil production reached pre-strike levels by April 2003.McCaughan, p 128, says April, but I seem to recall that this is disputed. Aftermath In the aftermath of the strike, the government fired 18,000 PDVSA employees, 40% of the company's workforce, for \\"dereliction of duty\\" during the strike.McCaughan, p 128; L√≥pez Maya, p 19. Arrest warrants were issued for the presidents of Fedecamaras (Carlos Fernandez) and the CTV (Carlos Ortega). Involvement in government efforts to maintain food and gasoline distribution saw turning points in the careers of leading businessmen Ricardo Fern√°ndez Barrueco and Wilmer Ruperti respectively. After the February 2003 collapse of the strike, the Coordinadora Democr√°tica (CD) was much more willing to participate in the Organization of American States (OAS) \\"mesa\\" dialogue process which had been set up following the 2002 Venezuelan coup d'√©tat attempt. The CD pushed for a binding recall referendum under Article 72 of the Constitution of Venezuela, which was ultimately agreed on 23 May 2003,Andrew F. Cooper, and Thomas Legler (2005), \\"A Tale of Two Mesas: The OAS Defense of Democracy in Peru and Venezuela,\\" Global Governance 11(4)OAS, Agreement Between the Representatives of the Government of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela and the Political and Social Groups Supporting It, and the Coordinadora Democratica and the Political and Civil Society Organizations Supporting It, Caracas, 23 May 2003. and took place in August 2004. The strike produced severe economic dislocation. The country's GDP fell 27% during the first four months of 2003, and it cost the oil industry $13.3bn. Open unemployment, which was running about 15% before and after the shutdown, reached 20.3% in March 2003; the volume of crude oil produced was 5% less in 2003 than the previous year; and the volume of refined oil products was 17% less.L√≥pez Maya, p 19. Oil figures from OPEC, Annual Statistical Bulletin, 2004, tables 14, 19. During the lockout Venezuela had, for the first time in the country's history, defaulted on its international petroleum supply contracts, unable to meet its commitments ‚Äì including to its principal customer, the United States. The informal network importing basic goods which the government developed during the strike went on to provide the basis for Mission Mercal. In addition the transformation of PDVSA had lasting political consequences, enabling the government to make much more direct use of PDVSA revenues for political projects such as Bolivarian Missions.Venezuelanalysis.com, 5 August 2010, Auditors: Venezuela's State Oil Company Recovering from Oil Price Slump References Sources *Eva Golinger, Esq., \\"The Adaptable U.S. Intervention Machine in Venezuela,\\" in Olivia Burlingame Goumbri, The Venezuela Reader, Washington D.C., U.S.A., 2005. *Jones, Bart (2008), Hugo!

ETV has been an auxiliary means for teaching the primary and secondary school curriculum on television since the early 1970s. ETV programmes change with the curriculum from time to time, covering a wide spectrum of topics. Programmes are broadcast during daytime non-peak hours on the English channels of TVB and ATV from Monday to Friday, during the 32 weeks of the school year. As the popularity of the Internet has increased, ETV has made its programmes available on the World Wide Web on demand. History ETV began with the primary school curriculum and developed gradually. In 1972, the first programme was aimed at Primary 3 students. It extended one level up yearly and covered Primary 6 in 1974. In September 1976, ETV started to cover junior secondary school. It began with Secondary 1 and reached Secondary 3 in 1978. There was no major change in range until 1999. ETV extended to Primary 1 and 2 in junior primary and Secondary 4 and 5 on selected topics in senior secondary school. In 2000, ETV also began to broadcast Teacher Resource Programmes for teachers. In April 2020, ETV stops filming new episodes. On 12 May 2020, the Education Bureau notified RTHK that it had to hand over the Education Television Centre in Kowloon Tong by September 2020. Programmes The programmes are closely tied with the curriculum devised by Hong Kong Government. Most of programmes are in the Cantonese language. In the early days, it covered the primary subjects of Chinese language, English language and Mathematics, and the secondary subjects Social Studies, Health Education (absent in secondary school) and Nature (later renamed to Science). Programme topics are changed weekly for primary school and biweekly for secondary school. The length of a programme is 15 minutes for primary school and 20 for secondary. Later the secondary subjects were merged to General Studies for primary school as the curriculum changed. As Putonghua has become increasingly important in Hong Kong, it was introduced into the Hong Kong curriculum, and ETV now produces programmes in the language. Social Studies for secondary schools was renamed to Personal, Social and Humanities Education. Media During normal school terms, ETV programmes are broadcast from Monday to Friday (except some long school vacations like public holidays and weekend) on the free-to-air terrestrial television channels such: TVB Pearl and ATV World alternately so that one of the stations broadcasts ETV television programmes in the morning from 08:00 until 12:00 HKT on TVB Pearl and television programmes in the noon from 12:00 until 16:00 HKT on ATV World. In each academic year the two English free-to-air terrestrial television stations such: TVB Pearl and ATV World. From school year 2006-07 to 2011-12, the broadcasting hours for ETV programmes reduced to 2 hours on each channel, which was scheduled from 08:30 until 10:30 HKT on TVB Pearl, and from 14:00 until 16:00 HKT on ATV World. Beginning from school year 2012-13, the broadcasting hours further reduced to 1 hour on each channel, which is scheduled from 09:00 until 10:00 HKT (Morning session) on TVB Pearl and from 15:00 until 16:00 HKT (Afternoon session) on ATV World. Due to the expiration of license of Asia Television on 2 April 2016, the Afternoon session of ETV programmes is scheduled from 15:00 until 16:00 HKT on RTHK 31A, which simulcast with Digital Channel RTHK 31. Although each programme is broadcast several times a week their broadcast times are not adapted to school class timetables. The government therefore provides necessary television and recording equipment for reception of ETV programmes for government schools and aided schools in Hong Kong. The recorded programmes can then be viewed out of the broadcast time frame as required by the school. Some programmes are distributed in form of VCDs or interactive multimedia CD-ROMs to schools.

On the right, the church of Santa Maria del Popolo Porta del Popolo, outer fa√ßade Porta del Popolo is a gate of the Aurelian Walls in Rome (Italy). The current Porta del Popolo was built by Pope Sixtus IV for the Jubilee Year 1475 on the site of an ancient Roman gate which, at that time, was partially buried. History The previous name was Porta Flaminia, because the consular Via Flaminia passed, as it passes even now, through it (in ancient times, Via Flaminia started at the Porta Fontinalis, close to the current Vittoriano). In the 10th century the gate was named Porta San Valentino, due to the basilica and the catacomb with the same name, rising at the beginning of Viale Pilsudski. The origin of the present name of the gate, as well as of the piazza that it overlooks, is not clear: it has been supposed that it could derive from the many poplars (Latin: populus) covering the area, but it is more likely that the toponym is connected with the origins of the Basilica of Santa Maria del Popolo (Saint Mary of the People), erected in 1099 by Pope Paschal II thanks to a more or less voluntary subscription of the Roman people. Considering the importance of the Via Flaminia, Porta del Popolo had, since the beginning of its existence, a prevalent role of sorting of the urban traffic rather than a defensive use. This brought to a never confirmed conjecture that the gate was formerly built with two archways (as well as two cylindrical side towers) and that only during the Middle Ages, as a consequence of the decrease of traffic due to the demographic fall, it was reduced into a single archway. At the age of Sixtus IV, the gate was half-buried and victim of a centuries-old negligence, damaged by time and medieval sieges; a shallow restoration was limited to a partial reinforcement of the structure. The gate rises still today about a metre and half above the ancient ground level. The debris carried by the river during its desultory floods and the slow but continuous flaking of the Pincian Hill had lifted the surrounding ground, so that the elevation of the whole gate could no longer be procrastinated. This need had already been felt during the restoration carried out in the 5th century by emperor Honorius, but the intervention was not carried out. The present aspect is the result of a rebuilding carried out in the 16th century, when the gate had again gained a great importance for the urban traffic coming from north. The outer fa√ßade was commissioned by Pope Pius IV to Michelangelo, who in turn assigned the task to Nanni di Baccio Bigio: he erected the gate between 1562 and 1565, taking inspiration from the Arch of Titus. The four columns of the fa√ßade come from the former St. Peter's Basilica and they frame the single, great archway, overlooked by the stone commemorating the restoration and by the papal coat of arms sustained by two cornucopias; the former circular towers were replaced with two powerful square watchtowers and the whole building was garnished with elegant battlements. In 1638, two statues of St. Peter and St. Paul, sculpted by Francesco Mochi, were inserted between the two pairs of columns: the statues had been rejected by the Basilica of Saint Paul Outside the Walls and given back to the sculptor without payment. The inscription on the central stone, remembering the restoration carried out by Pius IV, says: PIVS IIII PONT MAX PORTAM IN HANC AMPLI TVDINEM EXTVLIT STRAVIT ANNO III The inner fa√ßade was designed by Gian Lorenzo Bernini for Pope Alexander VII and it was released on the occasion of the arrival in Rome of the abdicant queen Christina of Sweden, on December 23, 1655: the occurrence is commemorated by the inscription carved on the attic of the inner fa√ßade together with the coats of arm of the Pope's family (the six-pieces mount under the eight-rays star, the emblem of the House of Chigi. FELICI FAVSTOQ(ue) INGRESSVI ANNO DOM MDCLV The positioning of the inscription - on the inner fa√ßade instead of the outer one, where it would have been visible while accessing the town - and the quite short text itself, are nonetheless singular; Cesare D'Onofrio deduces that probably the Pope would hold off the intrusiveness and the lively personality of the newly converted former queen, together with all the relevant diplomatic involvements. The visit was nonetheless a memorable event for Roman people, both for the profusion of pomp and splendor and for the annoyance of merchants and peddlers, which were forced to suspend for some days their activities, in order to allow the cleaning and to maintain the decency all along the itinerary of the cort√®ge from Porta del Popolo to St. Peter's Basilica.The diarist Giacinto Gigli wrote: ‚ÄùOn the 21 day a Ban was published, that the following day all the shops should have been kept closed, and nothing should not be sold, ‚Ä¶, and the streets through which the Queen, from Porta del Popolo to St. Peter, should be ornamented, but then in the evening the feast was intimated, and in the streets the notice ran, that the ride had been deferred to the next day.‚Äù Other spectacular cort√®ges had already passed through the gate: the most impressive was the one of the French army of Charles VIII, which on December 31, 1494 paraded for six hours, giving am uncommon demonstration of military power; but also che processions of the cardinals, gathering into consistory with the Pope in the lead, aroused the enthusiastic and respectful admiration of the people. Due to the increase of the urban traffic, in 1887 the two lateral archways were opened, after the demolition, in 1879, of the towers flanking the gate; the works costed 300.000 lire). On that occasion, some remains of the ancient structure of the age of Aurelian and of the cylindric towers were discovered: these proved to be very important for the historic recreation of the gate. The works were commemorated with two stones on the outer fa√ßade, to the sides of the fa√ßade of Pius IV; the inscription on the left is about the first intervention: ANNO MDCCCLXXIX RESTITVTAE LIBERTATIS X TVRRIBVS VTRINQVE DELETIS FRONS PRODVCTA INSTAVRATA The one on the right is about the second intervention: S P Q R VRBE ITALIAE VINDICATA INCOLIS FELICITER AVCTIS GEMINOS FORNICES CONDIDIT Close to the gate, one of the \\"duty stones\\" placed in 175 AD was discovered. Similar stones were discovered in different times nearby other important city gates (the Porta Salaria and the Porta Asinaria); they marked a kind of administrative border, where the \\"customs offices\\" rose. These offices formerly collected the duties on the incoming and outcoming goods, but during the Middle Ages were also assigned to the collection of the toll for the transit through the gates, some of which belonged to rich lairds or contractors.

In the 9th century (when the Popes, clashing with the Municipality of Rome, held the administrative control on the duties of almost all the gates), Pope Sergius II granted the proceeds of the toll of the Porta Flaminia to the cloister of San Silvestro in Capite.

It was the last game show hosted by Gene Rayburn and aired as filler programming on the American Movie Classics (AMC) cable network. The regular panel of the show consisted of veteran New York Times movie and theatre critic Clive Barnes and longtime To Tell the Truth panelists Kitty Carlisle and Peggy Cass. Game play At the start of each episode, the announcer would introduce Cass, who in turn introduced Barnes, on through to Carlisle and Rayburn, the last of whom was escorted out by the hostess. (This conceit had previously been used on What's My Line?) The goal of the game was to identify a famous movie scene hidden behind a 3-by-3 puzzle board. Each puzzle piece included a movie-related question, identified by a category; the question often involved \\"fill-in-the-blank\\" movie quotes similar to Rayburn's previous game show Match Game. Correctly answering a question revealed that piece of the puzzle; two incorrect answers in a category eliminated that piece from being chosen again and kept it permanently hidden (as the show only prepared two questions for each category). Winning the game (by correctly guessing the movie scene) earned a prize package for a home viewer, the size of which depended on how many questions the winning panelist had answered correctly. Each panelist was addressed in sequence in lieu of a buzzer system; the panelist would be given the opportunity to answer each question before either of the other panelists were called upon.

The hamlet and former station are near to the confluence of the Afon Dulas and the River Dyfi, around west of the village of Llanwrin and north of the town of Machynlleth.  History  Around 1830 a toll house was built at Ffridd Gate to control the south end of the turnpike road to Dolgellau - now the A487. When the Corris, Machynlleth & River Dovey Tramroad was built in 1859, it crossed the road to Llanwrin (now the B4404) and passed on the east side of the tollhouse before entering Ffridd Wood. The station, built in 1885, was on the south side of the level crossing and had a simple wooden shelter for passengers. There was no platform.  Positioning  South of the station was the railway's bridge over the Dyfi, originally a wooden trestle construction and later a three-span steel bridge.

It is often composed of wood dust combined with a binder that dries and a diluent (thinner), and, sometimes, pigment. Pore fillers used for large flat surfaces such as floors or table tops generally contain silica instead of or in addition to wood dust. Pores can also be filled using multiple coats of the final finish rather than a pore filler. The main problem in using putty is matching the colour of the putty to that of the wood. Putties are usually sanded after they dry before applying the finish. Many different brands, types, and colours are commercially available. Binders include lacquer, water- base, and linseed oil.

On Pioneer 10, the instrument used an array of seven miniature Geiger-M√ºller tubes, collectively known as a Geiger Tube Telescope (GTT). Each tube was a small gas-filled cylinder. When a charged particle passed through the gas, an electrical pulse was generated by the applied voltage. Individual pulses from five of the tubes and coincident pulses from three combinations of the seven tubes were transmitted. Protons of energy greater than 5 MeV and electrons with energies greater 40 keV were detected. On Pioneer 11, one Geiger-M√ºller tube was replaced by a thin silicon wafer to detect protons in the specific energy range 0.61 to 3.41 MeV. Other minor changes were made to improve the characteristics of the detector system. The trains of pulses were passed through quasi-logarithmic data processors and then to the radio telemetry system of the spacecraft. Angular distributions were measured as the spacecraft rotated. This telemetry data was transmitted to the earth by an 8 watt S band transmitter within the Pioneer probe at one of eight data rates (from 16 to 2048 bits per second).

The film, like the song, focuses on prostitution in Sheffield, and uses the same actors as the music video to document a night in the life of the fictional 'Nina', a 15-year-old drug addict who works as a prostitute in the Neepsend district. The film stars Lauren Socha as 'Nina' and Stephen Graham as George, known by the nickname of 'Scummy Man', a violent and manipulative 'customer' of 'Nina's, who attacks and intimidates both 'Nina' and those who try to help her escape prostitution, such as a magician who offers her a job as his assistant in his act. The magician becomes a victim of the Scummy Man's behaviour but is not without his own flaws, as the film-maker begs if anyone is really inherently good. In order to achieve a documentary feel for the footage, the film was shot in 16 mm film by Danny Cohen. The DVD includes an extra film titled Just Another Day, which is more hopeful and upbeat in tone, and focuses on how every day events, such as being offered a lift by a taxicab driver, present opportunity and hope for her future. Just Another Day depicts the same chain of events, but from the perspective of the taxi driver who brings the Scummy Man to Nina, who takes pity on her as she reminds him of his own daughter who died young and would have been the same age as Nina were she still alive. The name of the film comes from a line in \\"When the Sun Goes Down\\", describing the \\"customer\\" of the girl featured in the song, The film won an award for \\"Best Music DVD\\" at the 2007 NME Awards on 1 March 2007.

The school is best known for having nationally leading programs in business and chemistry,Maclean's - 2014 Guide to Canadian Universities. Print. as well as one of the best Canadian women's basketball programs. The campus is situated in Halifax's South End and covers approximately . History =Founding= Saint Mary's was established in Glebe House (the brick building on the right). Saint Mary's is the second oldest English-speaking and first Roman Catholic initiated university in Canada. The Roman Catholic church founded Saint Mary's College in Halifax, Nova Scotia in 1802. It was established in Glebe House, on the corner of Spring Garden Road and Barrington Street, with the aim of extending educational opportunities for Catholic youth and training candidates for the clergy. In 1840 the Nova Scotia Legislature bestowed the degree granting charter to Saint Mary‚Äôs and eleven years later granted the University formal legal status. Saint Mary's collapsed in 1883, but was revived in 1903 by Cornelius O'Brien, then Archbishop of Halifax. It reopened as a high school in a new campus on Windsor Street, near the junction with Quinpool Road. In 1913 the Christian Brothers of Ireland were asked by the Archdiocese of Halifax to direct the college and academic programs. Degree-granting resumed in 1918. With this change of leadership the university's reputation thrived as a liberal arts institution and expanded its undergraduate programs, with the most notable being the Faculty of Commerce in 1934 (now known as the Sobey School of Business), which was the first of its kind in Canada. In 1940 the Upper Province of the Society of Jesus (the Jesuits) was invited to succeed the Christian Brothers as both administrators and faculty. A Roll of Honour at St. Mary's University is dedicated to students of St. Mary's College who volunteered for the Second World War. =Expansion= Due to rapid growth the college was fast outgrowing the Windsor Street campus, and so the Gorsebrook Golf Club was purchased in 1943. Construction of the new campus was delayed by wartime steel shortages. The relocation was completed in 1952. The former college building was rented by the Halifax school board and the overcrowded Saint Patrick's Boys' School was relocated there. The modern Saint Patrick's High School opened on the site in 1954 and operated until 2007. The old Saint Mary's College building was rented for a time by the Maritime Conservatory of Music before it was sold to the city in 1968 and demolished to make way for the expansion of Saint Patrick's. The next 30 years would see the university flourish under Jesuit supervision, with such advancements as the formal recognition of the \\"college\\" as a university in 1952 and purchasing the first computer in Atlantic Canada (a Royal McBee LGP-30) in 1959. In 1970 the Jesuits formally incorporated the university under the \\"Acts of Incorporation\\" which gave all administrative and academic duties to the Board of Governors and Academic Senate, making Saint Mary's a secular institution. Saint Mary's University was established by the Saint Mary's University Act, 1970.An Act to Amend Chapter 147 of the Acts of 1970, the Saint Mary‚Äôs University Act, 1970, SNS 2007, c. 57 =High school= In 1951, the High School moved with Saint Mary‚Äôs College to the Robie Street campus where they occupied three classrooms on the second floor of the new McNally building. The High School offered an embellished junior matriculation for grades 9,10,11 and many of the boys entered Saint Mary's directly upon graduation although some went to Saint Patrick's or Queen Elizabeth to attend grade 12. The Jesuit influence which incorporated the principles of a sound mind and a sound body meant that everyone who attended the high school became an active participant in intramural hockey, football and basketball. With fewer than 100 students enrolled in any one year, developing teams to represent Saint Mary's University High School on the extracurricular level seemed daunting but with the astute coaching of the future Hall of Fame coach, Frank \\"Mr Basketball\\" Baldwin success was achieved. Saint Mary's High School \\"A\\" and \\"B\\" basketball teams won three straight Halifax City Championships. Back to back Provincial Headmasters Championships by the \\"A\\" team in 1960-61 and 1961-62 epitomized the rich athletic tradition cultivated by the Jesuits. This accomplishment was even more significant when you consider that the school drew its athletes from less than 100 students. The Saint Mary‚Äôs University High School closed in 1963. A plaque detailing the history of the high school was placed at the entrance to the McNally building in 1988 as part of a Twenty Five year reunion. =Modern history= Since then the university has continued expansion of its academic programs with the most notable being the offerings of doctoral level studies in astronomy and business and the accreditation of the business school with the AACSB (Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business). At the same time the university has expanded its campus facilities with noted additions of the Burke-Gaffney Observatory in the 1970s and the Sobey Building in 1998. In 1992, the Faculty of Commerce was renamed the Sobey School of Business, after Frank H. Sobey, founder of Sobeys. In 2001, SMU's Huskies were the first Atlantic Canadian university team to advance to the world finals in the ACM International Collegiate Programming Contest World Finals. In early 1994 workers renovating the Rice Residence found that an exterior wall on the 16th storey was dangerously unstable and posed a hazard to those walking below. Over 250 students were moved to the Halifax Hilton, which had recently gone out of business, which was used as a temporary residence while repairs were carried out. In the 1990s the provincial government sought to cut funding to Nova Scotia's universities. Teacher education programs were consolidated at Mount Saint Vincent University, Acadia University, and Universit√© Sainte-Anne, while the education faculties at Saint Mary's and Dalhousie were wound up and the 140-year-old Nova Scotia Teachers College was closed altogether. The Saint Mary's education program ended in the spring of 1996. It was not forcibly closed by the province, but the minister of education stated that he would only licence teachers who had graduated from the three approved universities. In 2013 the Saint Mary‚Äôs High School basketball achievement was recognized at the Hall of Fame events and a plaque containing the names of all of the players who represented the school on the 1959 - 1962. The plaque can be seen in the Tower at Saint Mary‚Äôs University. =Rape chant controversy= On September 2, 2013, a video was uploaded to Instagram that brought national attention to a frosh cheer. In the video, Saint Mary's students, both male and female, were seen participating in a chant that expressed excitement towards rape. The chant, which had been part of Orientation Week for at least five years, contained a particular line saying \\"N is for No-consent\\". Jared Perry, chair of Students Nova Scotia and president of Saint Mary's University Students' Association stepped down from the former position and called his failure to stop the chant \\"the biggest mistake\\" of his life. Communications manager Steve Proctor opined that \\"nobody actually doing the cheer believed in what it was\\" but the Avalon Sexual Assault Centre reported that it received calls from survivors specifically regarding the cheer. Nova Scotia cabinet minister Peter MacKay also criticized the chant as \\"offensive and dangerous\\". A review conducted in the following months detailed a plan to require sensitivity training for the frosh leaders and to discuss informed consent with the incoming students. The university also changed the name \\"Orientation Week\\" to \\"Welcome Week\\" for 2014.  Faculties  Saint Mary's comprises four faculties: * Arts ** Dean: Dr. Margaret MacDonald * Sobey School of Business ** Dean: Dr. Harjeet Bhabra * Science ** Dean: Dr. Lori Francis (Acting) * Graduate Studies and Research **Dean: Dr. Adam Sarty Campus McNally Building Loyola Residence The Saint Mary's 80-acre (32 hectare) campus is located in the south end, not far from Downtown Halifax and just down the road from Dalhousie University. Major buildings include: Over the past decade many of the older buildings on campus have been substantially renovated. In March 2005, Saint Mary‚Äôs started the ‚ÄúScience Building Renewal Project‚Äù which was estimated to cost $100 million. This project is part of the larger project the ‚ÄúUniversity‚Äôs Strategic Directions and Academic Plan‚Äù which was developed in consultation with students, faculty and local citizens in order to meet both the needs of the university and local community over the next decade. The project focused on modernising and expanding the science faculty's resources, generally renewing the architectural, mechanical and electrical infrastructures of the Science Building, providing additional office and research space to faculty members, improving lab layout, and integrating with future campus developments. The university completed construction of the Atrium and Global Commons project in late 2009. The three-storey $17.5 million complex links the Science Centre, the Burke Building and the Patrick Power Library. The space features a common area, theatre style classrooms, offices and study spaces. The project also features advanced green environmental technologies, has fully integrated hard and Wi-Fi systems, a food outlet and a three-storey green wall. The 62-year- old McNally Building recently underwent a $27 million renewal thanks in large part to the Canadian governments Infrastructure Renewal Programme. Estimated to be completed by March 2011, most of the interior of the four floor, four wing complex is being rebuilt. Construction of the new Homburg Centre for Health and Wellness began in October 2010. This complex, an extension of the Tower fitness centre, houses new space for community health and wellness activities and is the new home for the Centre for the Study of Sport and Health. The $8 million project was funded by a donation from real estate developer and manager Richard Homburg and the University's capital campaign. It opened in 2012. 960 Tower Road, a three-storey, 28,000 square foot building, opened in 2013. It is home to the English as a second language program as well as the Sobey School Business Development Centre, which moved back to campus from a downtown location. The university stirred controversy when it demolished the former Halifax Infants‚Äô Home in 2014. SMU is currently constructing a new $14.8 million ice arena on the site of the 54 year old Alumni Arena. Made possible through generous donations from the estate of the late alumni Bob Dauphinee and SMU parents Glen and Nancy Holmes. The Dauphinee Centre will be connected to the Homburg Centre for Health and Wellness, by a pedway and will feature an NHL regulation ice surface, heated viewing gallery and capacity of 1200 fans. The Dauphinee Centre is slated to open for the 2019-2020 AUS hockey season. The university is presently planning a new $30-million, 42,700-square-foot project at the southern edge of the campus. Dubbed the Entrepreneurship Discovery and Innovation Hub, the building will be integrated with the Loyola Complex and the Sobey Building. University administration anticipate completion of the building by 2018. Legacy The Saint Mary's University mace shows the religious background of this now secular institution. There are crests for the Archdiocese of Halifax. the LaSalle Christian Brothers, the Irish Christian Brothers and the Jesuits. On 27 May 2002, Canada Post issued \\"Saint Mary's University, 1802-2002\\" as part of the Canadian Universities series, based upon a design by Steven Slipp, based on photographs by James Steeves and on an illustration by Bonnie Ross. The 48¬¢ stamps are perforated 13.5 and were printed by Ashton-Potter Canada Limited. Reputation Saint Mary‚Äôs University was evaluated in 2011 and 2012 by two different national reports on post-secondary institutions in Canada. The Canadian University Report is conducted annually by The Globe and Mail, and reflects the opinions of more than 33,000 undergraduate students across the country as gathered in a student satisfaction survey. Saint Mary‚Äôs University is in the ‚Äúsmall‚Äù category of along with 15 other universities with enrolment between 4,000 - 12,000 students. The annual Maclean‚Äôs rankings measure universities on 13 performance measures. Maclean‚Äôs evaluates 49 universities in three categories; with Saint Mary‚Äôs being ranked amongst other universities the publication categorized as a \\"primarily undergraduate\\" institution. In Maclean's 2019 rankings, Saint Mary's was ranked 7th amongst other \\"primarily undergraduate\\" universities in Canada. The Canadian University Report stated that overall student satisfaction had a grade of B+ in 2013, the same as in 2012, A- in quality of teaching, A- in class size, A- in buildings and facilities and improvement shown in six key categories Saint Mary‚Äôs ranks eighth overall in its category with the highest number of professors who have won national awards (amongst all primarily undergraduate universities in Atlantic Canada) and has the highest percentage of full-time faculty with a PhD in Nova Scotia (this includes comprehensive and primarily undergraduate combined. Student life =Huskies football= The Huskies won back-to-back Canadian University Football Championships (2001 & 2002), the third university to do so (after Manitoba and Western). =Huskies hockey= In 2010, the men Huskies won their first CIS University Hockey Cup by defeating the Alberta Golden Bears 3-2 in overtime. =Saint Mary's University Students' Association= The Saint Mary's University Students' Association (SMUSA) is the official representation of the students of Saint Mary's University. The association was incorporated in 1966, however, unofficially has represented students for many years previous. The Association main offices are located on the top floor of the student centre at the heart of campus. SMUSA provides such services as a safe drive program, tutor database, online book exchange, health and dental plans and the Gorsebrook Lounge. SMUSA also operates many departments that help in the mission of serving students and making their lives at Saint Mary's the best possible. These departments include the volunteer department, events and programming, marketing and communications, the yearbook, the information desk and husky patrol. SMUSA came under scrutiny after their first-year frosh orientation in 2013. A traditional chant promoting non-consensual sex with underage girls was posted on Instagram, and then picked up by traditional media. Student union president Jared Perry resigned as president of Students Nova Scotia but stayed on as head of the university's student association. The Saint Mary's University Students Association is represented federally by the Canadian Alliance of Student Associations and provincially by StudentsNS (formerly ANSSA. =Saint Mary's University Student Athletic Clubs= Saint Mary's University is home to numerous student based sports clubs that provide club members with the opportunity to get involved in a variety of athletic activities.

The Project centers on an original science fiction setting that enables the creative writing project and its supporting role-playing game. It was co-founded by Alex Perry and Kim Leonard Smouter, and is a registered non-profit corporation in the United States and the European Union. Origins The New Worlds Project was inspired by a similar play-by-post game entitled Star Trek: Independence. The game used the Star Trek setting and modified it so as to create a setting compatible with the methods of play-by-post gaming. The New Worlds Project's co-founders served as administrators within that game and were able to see the strengths and weaknesses of Star Trek: Independence. Also inspired to create a wholly original setting, the administrators inspired themselves from the gameplay of Star Trek: Independence as the basis for their own project.Lit.org, http://www.lit.org/view/954, Online, 2006 The co-founders spent two years perfecting their concept, focusing particular attention around their original setting.Archive.org; https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://rpgnewworlds.org Online, 2006 The Project opened with much fanfare in August 2003 to the public, receiving a hundred applications within a month.OMGN.com Archive; http://archive.omgn.com/news.php?Item_ID=1004&Offset;=0&Order;=desc&Game;=112/ Online, 2003 =Four Seasons of Existence= The New Worlds Project catalogues its years of existence by calling each year a season, this borrowing the idea from TV series. In its first \\"season\\", 2003‚Äì04, New Worlds further expanded its setting and featured its first role-plays. The first generation of role- players brought to life the war-torn setting that had been created by the co- founders. The second season, 2004‚Äì05, was affected by a website domain name change and featured for the first time the \\"Starport Nuribis Personal Access Network\\" a full-featured website for just members. The second generation of role-players brought to life Starport Nuribis through numerous civilian storylines that further enriched the original setting. These civilian storylines would be the inspiration for the Season II finale taking place on the civilian Starport Nuribis, featuring a blockade on the symbol of peace.Online Games, http://games.plit.dk/cgi- bin/games.pl?_cmd=ViewText&TextId;=96, Online, 2005 By the third season, the New Worlds Project continued to professionalise its services, in December 2005 the website was closed in order to upgrade back-end software and further enhance the setting. Re-opening on February 2006, a full-month behind schedule, the Project's website has since returned to service.Lit.org, http://www.lit.org/view/31388, Online, 2006 A new generation brought with them renewed interest in the main war-torn setting that had been created. As a result, whilst stories involving civilians and civilian storylines became less present, storylines focusing on the war increased sensitively. This renewed interest in military storylines allowed for the Season III finale to be a massive battle between the Gohorns and the Terrans. In the following year, Season IV, New Worlds Project announced the bifurcation of its game-play between New Worlds: Target Locked and New Worlds: Weapons Free. The bifurcation was motivated by a need to offer new players an easier integration process. The new arrangement has meant that for the first time in the game's history, writing groups are being organised and minimum posting requirements created.RPG News, http://www.rpgnews.com/article.php?sid=5025, Online, 2006 The bifurcation was preceded by the implementation of a brand new website which fundamentally changed the navigational structure of the RPG's homepage.RPG News, http://www.rpgnews.com/article.php?sid=5043, Online, 2006 In 2010, the New Worlds Project forums succumbed to inactivity as the administrators encountered offline issues with employment and medical conditions. It remains to be seen if they will be relaunched. =New Worlds Project Reboot= On 28 September 2013, New Worlds Project's leadership announced plans to reboot the creative community. The community would expand its focus to include writers, graphic artists, and musicians. A new website was to be developed by Corllete Ltd using a heavily modified e107 content management system. The community was to be driven by the 360¬∞ Creativity Concept which would allow contributors to the community to be published and earn royalties for their contributions. Initially the community was slated to come online in November 2013 but development delays led to the public launch date being pushed back to 2 January 2016. Setting The New Worlds Project centers on its original science-fiction setting. The setting has evolved since it was launched to the public in 2003 and is continually adapted by both staff and members of the New Worlds Project. The Project's setting is characterized by a rich atmosphere. It is estimated over 1000 pages combined form it. =Concept= The New Worlds Project's story begins in the 26th century, in the year 2501. Humanity has learned to travel at faster than light speeds safely and has made first contact with a number of alien species. Humanity has united under a single banner, the United Nations governs the Terran Democratic Republic. For almost a century, peace has been administered by the Organisation For Interstellar Peace. Whilst interstellar peace has been secured, tensions haven't been erased. Indeed, tensions between two major powers: The Gohorn Directorate and the Terran Democratic Republic continue to boil. When the O.I.P. tries to settle a border dispute between the Gohorns and the Humans, it proves unable to resolve differences. War is soon declared. The O.I.P.'s attempts to stop the spread of the war fail, the Terrans call in their allies the Rosebourg Monarchy further expanding the war so that most of the major powers of the OIP are now engaged. The war has spun out of control and now threatens the sanctity of the Known Galaxy. As soldiers from a thousand worlds mobilize, peace no longer seems possible ‚Äì all out war is a reality. =Major powers= The New Worlds Project's setting centers on a number of major powers that are intricately described on the New Worlds Project's website. The Project features biological information about the species governed under those major powers, as well as social information about these species. The Project also details military and government information about the major powers. The Major Powers of the setting include the Terran Democratic Republic (Humans), the Gohorn Directorate (Gohorns), the Rosebourg Monarchy (Navaks and Avrans), and the multi-species Luna Minoris Confederacy of Non-Aligned Worlds. =Other features= The New Worlds Project's setting other features are grouped around the website's Omnipedia. Within the Omnipedia is information about the setting's day-to-day life realities, technical briefings on the vehicles and starships that exist within the setting, as well as definitions of all kinds of terms, organisations, etc. Role-playing game The New Worlds Project's setting is used as the basis of a play-by-post role-playing game. It is this role-playing game that opened to the public in August 2003. The role-playing game counts more than 200 registered users. The setting is used as the backdrop for on-going cooperative writings that feature players' characters struggling to survive combat missions (whether in space or on the ground). Other players have also tried to further expand the setting using civilian characters. =External relations= The New Worlds Project maintained an office of external relations to govern its relations with other role-playing games. Under this aegis, the New Worlds Project maintained regular contacts with its partner games via the DragonMuseNetwork (now defunct), a premium partnership of which it was a member. Through the Network it was partnered with Blue Horizon, a New Worlds offshoot, and Tazlure (closed 22 January 2009), an original fantasy role- playing game. New Worlds also maintained a small list of affiliate sites. New Worlds has had tumultuous relations with the Simming League, a Star Trek role- playing game network. Members of the New Worlds Project voted to withdraw its membership from the League in response to dissatisfaction with the organization. Despite this, in 2004 the League awarded to the project its Internet Technology Prize for unique applications of content management systems.Simming League, http://www.simmingleague.com/page.php?9, Online, 2004 Creative writing project The Creative Writing Project also uses the setting as the basis for its works. The creative writing project uses the settings in order to create compatible storylines. Writers can also elect to co-write novels together. At the time of writing the Creative Writing Project featured two completed full length novels, and three novels in production. A number of finished role-playing storylines were also billed to become full- length novels. Registered non-profit corporation Since Season II, the New Worlds Project's administration team has been working to implement a strategy plan released by Kim Leonard Smouter. The strategy plan hoped to capitalise on New Worlds Project's potential and further advance the unique approach of the administration. With guidance from Glenn David Gregory, the co-founders drafted by-laws for the New Worlds Project non-profit corporation. These were approved by a founding committee composed of the staff at the time of writing of those by-laws. The registration process was completed by 4 October 2006, when the authorities in Draper, Utah and Brussels, Belgium granted non-profit corporation status to New Worlds Project in both the United States and the European Union.Le Moniteur Belge, Document #0156768, pp. 1‚Äì10, 2006 The by- laws have now codified New Worlds' mission: New Worlds Project is organized exclusively for education and literary purposes. The purpose of this corporation is: * To improve creative writers‚Äô writing skills by providing internet-based platforms for community-based cooperative writing. * To facilitate interaction amongst creative writers by providing internet-based platforms for the discussion of all aspects of creative writing. * To introduce and raise awareness of writers to the methods of ‚Äúplay-by-post role- playing‚Äù as a useful tool to improve the quality of creative writing. * To develop and provide other services and tools to aid the members in writing fiction. The Corporation was initially led by an interim board of directors composed of co-chairs Glenn David Gregory, Alex Perry. Additional members from Belgium, Australia, Canada, and the United Kingdom joined the first permanent Board on December 2006. Initial attempts to secure government funding for the initiative failed, though the corporation successfully trialled the concept in creative writing courses at a community college in Draper, Utah using a sandbox setting called Nalnath. By 2010, however, the corporation went inactive. In 2013, as part of the reboot initiative, the non-profit association was reactivated.

Despite Al-Aziz having specifically inherited suzerainty over the whole Ayyubid empire, soon he had to face revolts by the Zengid emirs of Mosul, by Ahmad Sanjar and by the Artuqids in southern Iraq. When al-Afdal expelled all the ministers left by his father to support him, they came to Egypt, asking al-Aziz to reconquer Syria. In 1194, al-Aziz besieged Damascus. Al-Afdal asked for help from Saladin's brother, al-Adil I, who met al-Aziz and managed to bring about a reconciliation. The following year al-Aziz again attacked Syria, but al-Afdal was able to persuade some of the emirs of al-Aziz's army to desert. Later al- Adil allied with al-Aziz against al-Afdal, who was besieged and captured in Damascus on 3 July 1196. Al-Afdal was exiled to Salkhad, while al-Aziz was proclaimed supreme overlord of the Ayyubid empire. However, most of the effective power was in the hands of al-Adil I, who installed himself in Damascus. During his reign, al-Aziz tried to demolish the Great Pyramids of Giza, Egypt, but had to give up because the task was too big.

The Church of the Holy Ghost, Midsomer Norton, Somerset, England is a Roman Catholic parish church housed in a converted tithe barn. It is served by monks of the Order of St. Benedict from Downside Abbey and is a Grade II* listed building. History of the building The building was formerly a tithe barn built and owned by the Augustinian Canons at Merton Priory, Surrey. It is the second-oldest existing building in Midsomer Norton (after the old priory itself), with Pevsner assigning it to the 15th century. Following the Dissolution of the Monasteries under Henry VIII, the barn was handed over to the King along with all of the Priory's property, and subsequently became part of the patrimony of Christ Church, Oxford. By 1886 it was no longer needed for the storing of tithes in kind and was sold to a private owner in auction. Conversion to church use In 1906 the building was purchased by Downside Abbey for use as a church. Since its auction in 1886 the barn had been used as a kennels, a stable and even a chicken house and was by now in a very poor state. Abbot Edmund Ford engaged the services of the architect Giles Gilbert Scott to plan restoration and conversion of the building. In addition to restoring the splendid timber roof and timbers, Scott made several structural changes to the building, including new doorways and a new gothic style window in the south wall, the tracery for which was copied from that of a room above the porch. The barn was blessed as a church on 17 May 1913. Church furnishings The tabernacle of the church is elaborately carved in wood and richly gilded. It dates from 1794, and previously stood on the High Altar of the Chapel of the Bavarian Embassy, Golden Square, London. The Stations of the Cross are Flemish and are early examples of the painted depiction of the stations, dating from the end of the 18th century. Other church furnishings, including the Jacobean panelling behind the High Altar (now carrying the words \\"Deus Caritas Est\\", or God is Love), were taken from the buildings of Downside Abbey and School. The pulpit used to be the Prefect's desk in the school's study room.

Neidan, or internal alchemy (), is an array of esoteric doctrines and physical, mental, and spiritual practices that Taoist initiates use to prolong life and create an immortal spiritual body that would survive after death (Skar and Pregadio 2000, 464). Also known as Jindan ( \\"golden elixir\\"), inner alchemy combines theories derived from external alchemy (waidan ), correlative cosmology (including the Five Phases), the emblems of the Yijing, and medical theory, with techniques of Daoist meditation, daoyin gymnastics, and sexual hygiene (Baldrian-Hussein 2008, 762). In Neidan the human body becomes a cauldron (or \\"ding\\") in which the Three Treasures of Jing (\\"Essence\\"), Qi (\\"Breath\\") and Shen (\\"Spirit\\") are cultivated for the purpose of improving physical, emotional and mental health, and ultimately returning to the primordial unity of the Tao, i.e., becoming an Immortal. It is believed the Xiuzhen Tu is such a cultivation map. In China, it is an important form of practice for most schools of Taoism. Terminology The Chinese compound n√®idƒÅn combines the common word n√®i meaning \\"inside; inner; internal\\" with dƒÅn \\"cinnabar; vermillion; elixir; alchemy\\". The antonym of n√®i is w√†i \\"outside; exterior; external\\", and n√®idƒÅn \\"internal elixir / alchemy\\" was coined from the earlier complementary term w√†idƒÅn \\"external elixir / alchemy\\". Chinese alchemical texts and sources ordinarily call neidan the jƒ´ndƒÅn d√†o or Way of the Golden Elixir. In Modern Standard Chinese usage, the term n√®idƒÅn sh√π (with \\"art; skill; technique; method\\") refers generally to internal alchemical practices. The date for the earliest use of the term neidan is uncertain. Arthur Waley proposed that it was first recorded in the 559 vow taken by Tiantai Buddhist patriarch Nanyue Huisi praying to successfully make an elixir that would keep him alive till the coming of Maitreya (1930: 14). Many scholars agreed, including Joseph Needham and Lu Gwei-djen who translated Huisi's vow to live as an ascetic in the mountains: > I am seeking for the longevity in order to defend the Faith, not in order to > enjoy worldly happiness. I pray that all the saints and sages will come to > my help, so that I may get some good magic mushrooms [zhi ], and numinous > elixirs [shendan ], enabling me to cure all illnesses and to stop both > hunger and thirst. In this way I shall be able to practice continually the > way of the Sutras and to engage in the several forms of meditations. I shall > hope to find a peaceful dwelling in the depths of the mountains, with enough > numinous elixirs and medicine to carry out my plans. Thus by the aids of > external elixirs [waidan] I shall be able to cultivate the elixir within > [neidan]. (1983: 140) Others believed that neidan first occurred in the biographies of Deng Yuzhi (fl. 483‚Äì493) and Su Yuanming (fl. c. 600). However, the authenticity of the relevant passages in these \\"pseudo-historical sources\\" is doubtful (Baldrian- Hussein 1989: 164‚Äì171). The term neidan was seldom used throughout the late Tang dynasty (618‚Äì907) and Five dynasties (907‚Äì960) period, and only became widespread around the beginning of the Song dynasty (960‚Äì1279) period, when neidan evolved into a highly complex system in both its theoretical and practical aspects (Baldrian-Hussein 2008: 763). Tang texts described internal alchemical practices with the words f√∫y√†o \\"take drug/medicine\\" and ch√°ngshƒìng \\"long life, longevity; (Daoism) eternal life\\" (Baldrian-Hussein 1989: 170). Liu Xiyue's 988 Taixuan langranzi jindao shi (Master Taixuan Langran's Poems on Advancing in the Dao) has the earliest datable mention of the terms neidan and waidan (Baldrian-Hussein 1989: 174, 178, 180). The c. 1019 Yunji Qiqian Daoist anthology mentions the term neidan (Baldrian-Hussein 1989: 178). Early texts that mention neidan define it as synonymous or similar with some qi circulation techniques: Cultivation and Transmutation (xiulian ), Embryonic Breathing (taixi ), the Cyclical Elixir (huandan ), the Golden Elixir (jindan ), the Great Elixir (dadan ), the Interior and Exterior Medicines (nei/waiyao ), the Inner and Outer Counterparts (nei/waixiang ), and the Yin Elixir and Yang Elixir (yindan and yangdan ) (Baldrian-Hussein 1989: 179‚Äì186). Based upon the textual evidence, Farzeen Baldrian-Hussein concludes that in early texts, neidan refers to a specific technique, and by Song Emperor Zhenzong's reign (997‚Äì1022), the term designates a group of techniques, expressed in specific alchemical language (1989: 187). It is sometimes incorrectly called Neitan in literature on western Alchemy. History and development Chinese woodblock illustration of neidan \\"Putting the miraculous elixir on the ding tripod\\", 1615 Xingming guizhi (Pointers on Spiritual Nature and Bodily Life) Chinese woodblock illustration of neidan \\"Cleansing the heart-mind and retiring into concealment\\", 1615 Xingming guizhi (Pointers on Spiritual Nature and Bodily Life) Neidan is part of the Chinese alchemical meditative tradition that is said to have been separated into internal and external (Waidan) at some point during the Tang dynasty. The Cantong qi (The Kinship of the Three) is the earliest known book on theoretical alchemy in China; it was written by the alchemist Wei Boyang in 142 AD. This text influenced the formation of Neidan, whose earliest existing texts date from the first half of the 8th century. The authors of several Neidan articles refer to their teachings as the Way of the Golden Elixir (jindan zhi dao). The majority of Chinese alchemical sources is found in the Daozang (Taoist Canon), the largest collection of Taoist texts. Neidan shares a significant portion of its notions and methods with classical Chinese medicine, fangshi and with other bodies of practices, such as meditation and the methods for \\"nourishing life\\" (yangsheng). What distinguishes alchemy from these related traditions is its unique view of the elixir as a material or immaterial entity that represents the original state of being and the attainment of that state. The Neidan tradition of internal alchemy is practiced by working with the energies that were already present in the human body as opposed to using natural substances, medicines or elixirs, from outside of the body. The Shangqing School of Daoism played an important role in the emergence of Neidan alchemy, after using Waidan mainly as a meditative practice, and therefore turning it from an external to an internal art. The Three Treasures Internal alchemy focuses upon transforming the bodily sanbao \\"three treasures\\", which are the essential energies sustaining human life: *Jing \\"nutritive essence, essence; refined, perfected; extract; spirit, demon; sperm, seed\\" *Qi \\"vitality, energy, force; air, vapor; breath; spirit, vigor; attitude\\" *Shen \\"spirit; soul, mind; god, deity; supernatural being\\" According to the 13th-century Book of Balance and Harmony: :Making one's essence complete, one can preserve the body. To do so, first keep the body at ease, and make sure there are no desires. Thereby energy can be made complete. :Making one's energy complete, one can nurture the mind. To do so, first keep the mind pure, and make sure there are no thoughts. Thereby spirit can be made complete. :Making one's spirit complete, one can recover emptiness. To do so, first keep the will sincere, and make sure body and mind are united. Thereby spirit can be returned to emptiness. ... To attain immortality, there is nothing else but the refinement of these three treasures: essence, energy, spirit.\\" (tr. Kohn 1956, 146). When the \\"three treasures\\" are internally maintained, along with a balance of yin and yang, it is possible to achieve a healthy body and longevity, which are the main goals of internal alchemy (Ching 1996, 395). =Jing= Neidan practice Jing \\"essence\\" referring to the energies of the physical body. Based upon the idea that death was caused by depleting one's jing, Daoist internal alchemy claimed that preserving jing allowed one to achieve longevity, if not immortality. (Schipper 1993, 154). =Qi= Qi or ch'i is defined as the \\"natural energy of the universe\\" and manifests in everyone and everything (Carroll 2008). By means of internal alchemy, Taoists strive to obtain a positive flow of qi through the body in paths moving to each individual organ (Smith 1986, 201). Healing practices such as acupuncture, massage, cupping and herbal medicines are believed to open up the qi meridians throughout the body so that the qi can flow freely. Keeping qi in balance and flowing throughout the body promotes health; imbalance can lead to sickness. =Shen= Shen is the original spirit of the body. Taoists try to become conscious of shen through meditation (Smith 1986, 202).

The municipality existed from 1852 until its dissolution in 1992. It is located in the present-day municipality of Hammerfest. The former municipality encompassed the eastern part of the island of S√∏r√∏ya, the northern part of the island of Seiland, and the northern part of Kval√∏ya (with the exception of the town of Hammerfest). The administrative centre of S√∏r√∏ysund was the town of Hammerfest, even though the town was not part of S√∏r√∏ysund. History The municipality of Hammerfest landdistrikt (\\"the rural district of Hammerfest\\") was established on 1 January 1852 when it was separated from the town of Hammerfest. The initial population of S√∏r√∏ysund was 1,256. On 1 July 1869, the southern district of Kvalsund (population: 514) was separated from Hammerfest landdistrikt to form a municipality of its own, leaving Hammerfest landdistrikt with 932 inhabitants. On 1 January 1875, a small part of Hammerfest landdistrikt (population: 20) was transferred to the neighboring town-municipality of Hammerfest. On 1 January 1919, the name of the municipality was changed from Hammerfest landdistrikt to S√∏r√∏ysund. On 1 January 1963, another small area of S√∏r√∏ysund (population: 33) was transferred to the town of Hammerfest. On 1 January 1992, S√∏r√∏ysund was merged into the neighbouring town-municipality of Hammerfest. Prior to the merger, S√∏r√∏ysund had 2,341 inhabitants. =Name= The name is taken from the S√∏r√∏ysundet sound between the islands of S√∏r√∏ya, Stjern√∏ya, and Kval√∏ya. =Coat of arms= The coat of arms is modern and they were granted on 8 June 1979. The arms are blue with three white boats; two smaller ones over one larger one. The boats were chosen to show the importance of fishing in S√∏r√∏ysund. The number three also refers to the three islands in the municipality: S√∏r√∏ya, Kval√∏ya, and Seiland. Government =Municipal council= The municipal council of S√∏r√∏ysund was made up of 17 representatives that were elected to four year terms.

The character first appeared in Metamorpho #10 (Feb. 1967), written by Bob Haney and drawn by Sal Trapani. Element Girl's death was featured in Neil Gaiman's Sandman series in issue #20, \\"Fa√ßade\\". A similar character named Element Woman appeared during the events of Flashpoint and later appearing in The New 52 as part of the Justice League. Both characters are similar in design to Metamorpho and have the same powers. Fictional character biography =Element Girl= Urania \\"Rainie\\" Blackwell began as a spy for the United States government. Her first major assignment was to infiltrate a European crime syndicate called Cyclops and get a firsthand look at the workings of its leader‚Äîa man code-named Stingaree. She soon fell in love with him, and agreed to marry him, only to have him spurn her when his mercurial affections turned elsewhere. In turn, Blackwell managed to convince her agency that the romance had been a sham, as part of her role, and asked their help in finding some way to strike back at Stingaree. The agency obliged by offering her the chance to take part in a long-planned experiment. A few months earlier, an adventurer and soldier of fortune named Rex Mason had entered the Egyptian pyramid of Ahk-Ton on a treasure hunt. There he had been exposed to the radiation of a buried meteor, part of the great Orb of Ra, and had been transformed into Metamorpho the Element Man. Blackwell volunteered to duplicate Mason's encounter, and consequently found herself, once inside the pyramid, molded by the mystical sun god Ra into an elemental with superpowers identical to Mason's. Blackwell, now calling herself Element Girl, sought out Metamorpho and recruited his help in her mission to destroy Stingaree. Together they destroyed Cyclops, and the two allies found themselves in danger of becoming a romantic pair, much to the dismay of Metamorpho's fiancee, the debutante Sapphire Stagg. Though it was obvious to Mason that he and Blackwell were kindred spirits, he eventually severed his ties with her to salvage his relationship with Sapphire. This abandonment devastated Blackwell. Overnight, she found herself cast back into the \\"real world\\", a place where men and women labored in mundane nine-to-five jobs and where contact with superhumans like her was limited to television newscasts and the occasional fleeting glimpse of an Earthbound demigod. She turned to the agency for help and acceptance, but their activities had become delicate and covert; their missions were such that a \\"metamorphosized freak\\" like her would be more of a hindrance than a help. Her insecurities caused problems, and in later years when her feelings for Metamorpho went unrequited, she became isolated. Blackwell found herself utterly alone, ostracized by the employers who had helped destroy her humanity and terrified of interacting with more normal-looking men and women. For years she endured a completely insulated existence, living on a disability pension and for the occasional phone call from the agency. Abandoned by her employers and unwilling to face the world, Blackwell attempted suicide many times; however, her powers saved her every time. Eventually, Death of The Endless helped Blackwell. Death stated that she could not personally help Blackwell, since Blackwell's immortality and powers had originated from the sun god Ra. Death revealed that Blackwell was one of many \\"metamorphae\\" created by Ra to battle the god Apep, \\"the serpent that never dies\\". Death comments on the irony of this, stating that Apep is long dead. Death then tells Blackwell how to ask Ra to remove her \\"gift\\", by looking straight into the Sun and asking him, and Blackwell finally dies, leaving behind a disintegrating husk of a body with an expression of pure joy. Element Girl appeared again as Rex Mason's sidekick in the \\"Metamorpho\\" feature of the summer series Wednesday Comics.Splash Page: Wednesday Comics Week One. This feature is written by Gaiman with art by Mike Allred and occurs outside of DC continuity. =Element Woman= Emily Sung, the Element Woman, first appears during the \\"Throne of Atlantis\\" crossover as one of Cyborg's new recruits for the Justice League. During a battle with a number of Atlantean soldiers loyal to the Ocean Master, Element Woman nonchalantly chats with Black Lightning, expressing joy over being asked to join the League.Aquaman #16 She is later inducted into the League alongside a new female Atom and Firestorm.Justice League #18 (May 2013) Her relation to Metamorpho is unknown. However, she does reference him by first name. After the events of Forever Evil, Element Woman joins the Doom Patrol. Flashpoint Prior to appearing in the mainstream DC Universe, Element Woman made her debut in the alternate Flashpoint universe. She first appears at a meeting of superhumans assembled by Cyborg with the intention of stopping an oncoming war between the Amazons and Atlanteans. She offers her help, but is dismissed by Shade, the Changing Man, who uses his M-Vest to reveal to the others that Element Woman is insane.Flashpoint #1 (May 2011) She subsequently reappears in Metropolis, where she rescues Cyborg, Batman and the Flash from a group of soldiers working for the mysterious Project Superman. She then reveals that she has been following Cyborg ever since his initial failed attempt to recruit the heroes to stop the war, and that she wishes to help him.Flashpoint #4 (August 2011) Emily continues to accompany the new gathering of heroes as they travel to visit the members of SHAZAM. Despite her social awkwardness, she offers to help the group and joins the mission to the elevated coast of New Themyscira. After the death of Billy Batson, Emily uses her powers to protect the remaining children alongside Cyborg.Flashpoint #5 (October 2011) Powers and abilities Like Metamorpho's original powers, Element Girl (and Element Woman) could transform her body into any of the elements naturally found in the human body and shape them at her will. She can change her hair color using metals, and she can create silicate faces that fall off after a while. She uses the faces for ashtrays. She said she once tried to transmutate her body into flesh, but this experience ended badly and she vowed never to try it again. Other versions Emily Sung appears in DC Bombshells. Quotes from Neil Gaiman Neil Gaiman, author of the Sandman comic book series, discussed the death of Element Girl in an interview with Comix Experience: : Neil Gaiman: There's one called \\"The Death of Element Girl\\", in which Sandman probably won't even appear. He might appear, I dunno. That has Death, and an old DC character called Element Girl, who nobody remembers any more. : Comix Experience: From Metamorpho. : Neil Gaiman: Yeah. The Lady Metamorpho. So famous she never even made it into Who's Who. Anyway, she's in there. Terribly sad story. Although she did not have an entry in the original series, Element Girl received an entry in Who's Who in the DC Universe #10 (June 1991), stamped \\"DECEASED\\" after her appearance in Sandman.

It was a mixed school of non-denominational religion. The school logo was traditionally that of a Griffin. However, when the school achieved specialist college status its motif was modernised; it became a two panelled shield with a griffin above a diagram of an atom.  History  Sawyers Hall College opened in 1936 as a single block mixed school known as Brentwood Secondary School. However, genders were separated during school hours. Later in life, the school expanded and genders were allowed to mix. When it was the first school in the area to become Comprehensive, it was renamed Hedley Walter after the Chairman of Governors. Under the Head, Arthur Gregson, the school went from strength to strength as a pioneer of mixed ability teaching and the innovative Humanities course. Visiting educationalists from all over the country and the world came to learn these new techniques. In around 2003, the school's name was changed to Sawyers Hall College. The original school building, circa 1936, became known as The Jack Petchey Building. The school was formally closed in 2012, however the former school buildings are now used as the site for Becket Keys Church of England School.  School layout  The school was split into six buildings each named after someone who was related to the history of the school, plus a Sports Hall and an Astroturf pitch, which could be used in most weather conditions. An athletics track and football and rugby pitches were situated in fields across the road from the school. There were separate playgrounds for the various years, with years 10 and 11 sharing the same playground. From 2006 the sixth form had its own common room and study rooms for computer use.

Old Norse √ûr√∫√∞r, the daughter of Thor), and Fremu are reconstructed names for a character who figures as the queen of King Offa in Beowulf. Naming problem: Modthryth, Thryth or Fremu? The reason for the usage of both Thryth and the compound name Modthryth is that the latter name is an emendation by Frederick Klaeber . Mod appears just before √ûry√∞ on line 1932 of the poem, where she is introduced, and scholars are divided as to whether mod is part of her name, or a separate word. The queen of the eighth-century Mercian king Offa in the thirteenth-century Vitae duorum Offarum, which portrays both this Offa and his fifth-century namesake, is called Quendrida, a somewhat flawed Latin rendering of Cynethryth, the actual name of Offa's wife. The author, moreover, etymologised the word as consisting of the words quen 'queen' and the personal name Drida: Quendrida, id est regina Drida. This parallel has sometimes been taken as a further argument that the Offa of Beowulf had a queen called Thryth and that the passage was intended as a veiled reference to the eighth-century queen. More recently, R.D. Fulk has challenged the long- held view that the queen was named either Modthryth or Thryth, pointing out difficulties with the ending -o, its implications for the overall syntax, and the weaknesses of the Drida argument. Instead, he revives the suggestion made by Ernst A. Kock in 1920 that ' is not an adjective modifying ' \\"the people's princess\\" and meaning \\"excellent\\" (which would be inappropriate at this stage of the narrative), but her actual name. On the basis of such parallels as ' \\"bore arrogance\\" (Old English Genesis A line 2240b), he likewise treats ' as a common noun, although this necessitates an emendation of the ending -o to -a.Robert D. Fulk, \\"The Name of Offa's Queen: Beowulf 1931‚Äì2.\\" Eric Weiskott has challenged Fulk's reinterpretation on grounds of poetic syntax, concluding that the queen remains anonymous.Eric Weiskott, \\"Three Beowulf Cruces: healgamen, fremu, Sigemunde.\\" Notes & Queries 58 (2011): 3-7 From wicked princess to virtuous queen The relevant passage immediately follows, almost interrupts, a favourable description of Hygelac's queen Hygd.

Based on the similarity of name, the portrayal of 'Thryth' has been interpreted as an attack upon Offa of Mercia's wife Cynethryth.  Alternate Readings of Modthryth  While scholars such as Seamus Heaney and R. D. Fulk adhere to the limiting tamed virago motif of Modthryth that is apparently suggested by the Beowulf poet, there are various possibilities in regards to the reading of this character. For instance, Helen Damico and Mary Dockray-Miller view Modthryth as a far more majestic and powerful figure than either Fulk or Heaney attests. Damico views Modthryth as encompassing both the threatening and benevolent aspects of the W√¶lcyrge: she 'parallels the evolution of the archetypal figure that Modthrytho is modelled upon, the progression of fierce war-demon to gold- adorned warrior-queen'. Dockray-Miller fails to agree specifically with Damico's Valkyrie idea, however, stating that she is 'neither a reformed peace pledge, nor a heroic Valkyrie. Instead, her character both confirms and denies a masculine economy that depends on women as commodities [thus] Mod√æry√∞o's masculine performance manages to subvert the usual use of women as objects in exchanges between men'. Another feminist scholar, Pat Belanoff, comments upon the Old English tradition of strong female characters and images, positing that '[w]ithin the resources available to Anglo-Saxon poets was a traditional image of the female: an intelligent strong minded, usually glowing or shining, verbally adept woman whose actions are resolute and self-initiated'. Considering that the poem itself includes similar descriptions of Modthryth, stating that she is 'famous for her good deeds and conduct in life' and similarly referencing her shining beauty, certain ignored possibilities for this character are being explored.Taken such recent criticism into account, it is apparent that complexities hitherto denied to Modthryth are being explored through the revision of feminist scholars -thus uncovering nuances of gendered power that are implicit within the poem. With this in mind, Modthryth no longer acts solely as a foil to the good queen Hygd, but contributes to a tradition of strong female figures. Evidently, it would be profitable to view Modthryth as comparable to such figures as Judith or even the Old Norse Valkyrie-brides.

Biography  Hamilton, an Irish emigrant, lived in Lawrenceburg in Dearborn County, Indiana, in 1820, when he married Emerine J. Holman, the daughter of a prominent Indiana judge.Judge Jesse Holman was a justice of the Indiana Supreme Court and a founder of Indiana University, Franklin College, and the Indiana Historical Society. Gugin and St. Clair, Justices of the Indiana Supreme Court, p. 9. In 1823 the Hamilton family moved to Fort Wayne, where Hamilton was appointed deputy clerk in the U. S. Land Office. Hamilton also served as Allen County sheriff (1824-1826), Fort Wayne's postmaster (1825-1831), and as Allen County auditor, clerk, and recorder (1831-1838). In the 1820s Hamilton partnered with Cyrus Taber to form Hamilton and Taber, an Indian trading company. The firm prospered as Hamilton won the trust and confidence of many Indians, in particular Chief Jean Baptiste de Richardville of the Miami. In 1834 and 1838 Hamilton was appointed to the U. S. Commission to Negotiate Treaties with the Miami in northern Indiana. In 1840 he served on the Commission to Extinguish Indian Titles in Indiana and was appointed the U. S.

Golding, who is a member of Royal Southampton Yacht Club, is the eponymous co founder of the commercial company Mike Golding Yacht Racing Ltd. His partner in this venture was Jorgen Philip-Sorensen (d.2010). Golding led the team Group 4 to second place in the British Steel Challenge in 1992‚Äì3. He did one better in the next edition the BT Global Challenge 1996‚Äì7, taking first place with a new team of amateur sailors, again onboard Group 4. Golding came seventh in the 2000‚Äì2001 Vend√©e Globe solo non stop round the world race having lost seven days to the dismasting of his Open 60, again called Group 4. His present Open 60 campaign is sponsored by Ecover, a Belgian ecological cleaning products company which has sponsored his team since 2001. In 2004, he won the IMOCA World Championship and successfully defended his title the following year, in which he also won the 2005 FICO World Championship. In the 2004 Vend√©e Globe, Golding finished third despite losing his keel ‚Äî an accident which had caused boats in previous Vend√©e Globe races to overturn ‚Äî on the last day of the race. He sailed the last fifty miles with a tiny sailplan to keep the boat upright. In October 2006, he started the Velux 5 Oceans yacht race. He rescued fellow sailor Alex Thomson in the Southern Ocean, then the yacht Ecover had a mast failure with them both aboard. He announced he was retiring from the race on making emergency landfall in Cape Town. In March 2007 Golding announced a technical partnership with fellow British sailor Dee Caffari to allow both the UK entries in the Vend√©e Globe 2008‚Äì9 round the world yacht race to work together. Golding skippered the Ecover Sailing Team in the 2009 iShares cup, a selection of races all over Europe, sailing catamarans in fast, competitive races against world-leaders in this sport. The races took place in Venice, Hy√®res, Cowes, Kiel, Amsterdam and Almeria.

It aims at developing a curated resource that gives reliable information about ortholog and paralog assignments, and evolutionary history of various gene families. TreeFam defines a gene family as a group of genes that evolved after the speciation of single-metazoan animals. It also tries to include outgroup genes like yeast (S.cerevisiae and S. pombe) and plant (A. thaliana) to reveal these distant members. TreeFam is also an ortholog database. Unlike other pairwise alignment based ones, TreeFam infers orthologs by means of gene trees. It fits a gene tree into the universal species tree and finds historical duplications, speciations and losses events. TreeFam uses this information to evaluate tree building, guide manual curation, and infer complex ortholog and paralog relations. The basic elements of TreeFam are gene families that can be divided into two parts: TreeFam-A and TreeFam-B families. TreeFam-B families are automatically created. They might contain errors given complex phylogenies. TreeFam-A families are manually curated from TreeFam-B ones. Family names and node names are assigned at the same time.

He played as a back pocket for the Fremantle Football Club after beginning his senior football career with South Fremantle Football Club in the West Australian Football League (WAFL). Fremantle career Hayden was drafted by Fremantle in the 2000 Rookie Draft. He spent the entire 2001 season on the rookie list and played for South Fremantle, mainly as a midfielder. When full back Anthony Jones tore his pectoral muscle, Hayden was elevated off the rookie list. He made his AFL debut in round 15, 2002 against the Kangaroos in Canberra at Manuka Oval. In his second game, a Western Derby, he was challenged to play well on Phil Matera, or else it would be his last game for Fremantle. Hayden performed brilliantly (in just his second game as a defender), restricting Matera to a single goal. He would play three more games in 2002 before a hamstring injury forced him out of the team. He had shown enough, however, to be elevated permanently off the rookie list onto the senior playing list. Hayden cemented his place amongst the so-called No Name defence alongside Robert Haddrill, Dion Woods, Antoni Grover and Shane Parker of 2003 that helped Fremantle to reach their first ever finals appearance. He played in 21 of the 23 games and finished equal 9th in the Doig Medal best and fairest award. In round 4, 2003, Hayden was one of the seven indigenous players to represent Fremantle, the most ever to play in a single AFL team. The other indigenous players for Fremantle that day were Troy Cook, Jeff Farmer, Antoni Grover, Des Headland, Steven Koops and Dion Woods. Hayden continued his good form into 2004, but broke his leg in the round 21 Western Derby. A long and arduous rehabilitation program meant that he was unavailable for the start of the 2005 season and another hamstring injury in a WAFL game meant he was unable to break back into the Fremantle side. He was, however, able to play for South Fremantle in their 2005 Premiership side. After returning to the Fremantle lineup in Round 2 of 2006, he only managed to remain in the team for three games being dropped after a poor game against Adelaide in Round 4. After consistent performances in the WAFL for South Fremantle he returned to the AFL for the remainder of the 2006 season. The 2007 AFL Season was undoubtedly Roger Hayden's best, playing in all 22 games and was named among the final 40 for selection in the 2007 All-Australian team.All-Australian squad announced On 31 August 2011, Roger Hayden announced his retirement at the age of 30, owing to a long-term foot injury.Roger Hayden retires He has been a development coach at Fremantle since the 2012 AFL season.

The fresh variant is prepared by the restaurant or eatery and consists of agar or gelatin, mangoes, evaporated milk, and sugar. In addition, fresh fruit such as mango, strawberries, berries and kiwifruit, are occasionally added as garnish. Served and eaten refrigerator cold, mango pudding has a rich and creamy texture. Some Chinese restaurants make the mango pudding in fish shape because goldfish or koi expresses good luck in Chinese culture. On the other hand, factory-made mango pudding does not contain fresh mangoes and instead, consists of mango essence and either gelatin or agar.

It was formed in 1967 by consolidating the three Catholic high schools in Acadia Parish; St. Michael of Crowley, St. Joseph of Rayne, and St. Francis of Iota. It is located in the Roman Catholic Diocese of Lafayette. Notre Dame's Shield Notre Dame's shield symbolizes the three principal Catholic ethnic groups which originally settled the area of Acadia: The German people are symbolized by the heraldic eagle, displayed with wings and outstretched legs; the Lebanese are represented by the Lebanon Cedar; and the Fleur-de-lis (or white lily), a religious symbol, is the national symbol of France. History Notre Dame High School of Acadia Parish began its operation as a Catholic, co-educational school for students in grades 9‚Äì12 in September 1967. It was formed by consolidating the three Catholic high schools in Acadia Parish; Saint Michael in Crowley, Saint Joseph in Rayne, and Saint Francis in Iota. At the time of consolidation it was decided that the facilities of St. Michael be used until Notre Dame could build its own facility or make some other arrangements. On January 31, 1977, the Notre Dame School Board of Directors and seven church parishes purchased proportionate shares of Notre Dame from St. Michael Parish thus giving Notre Dame a permanent home. Preceding the consolidation, committees under the direction of Father Robert Sibille, composed of faculty members and students from all three schools, met and selected possible uniforms, school colors, mascots, emblems and size. A school philosophy was written and curriculum and faculty began to take shape. The Catholic Church parishes actively participating in the government of the school are: St. Michael, Crowley; St. Joseph, Rayne; St. Francis, Iota; Immaculate Heart of Mary, Crowley; St. Lawrence, Mowata; St. Leo IV, Roberts Cove; St. John the Baptist, Lyons Point; and Immaculate Conception, Morse. Each church parish provides leadership in the government of the school and each financially subsidizes the school based on the number of students who attend the school from the parish. Board members are elected lay people from each parish and a priest-chancellor who represents the pastors of the eight church parishes. Notre Dame is accredited by Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (SACS), the Louisiana State Board of Education, and it is a diocesan school under the direction of the Office of Catholic Schools of the Diocese of Lafayette. The school undergoes periodic professional self-study under the direction of the Diocesan School Board's professional staff and the SACS accreditation team. The Meaning of Notre Dame \\"Notre Dame\\" is French for Our Lady. Mary, the Mother of Christ is the patroness of the school, and her statue stands in the center of the campus.

Howdy accessdate= 2020-03-06 It was originally released on December 1, 2006 after public beta testing by Grey Havens, a non-profit organization founded by several former employees of Three Rings. In 2008, the game reached a milestone of 500,000 players as reported on Three Rings' website. The game mixes different elements from a variety of related genres, namely Western, steampunk, and Native American mythology. This is evident in the game's different locales and various gameplay elements. At the 2006 Game Developer's Conference, Three Rings described Bang! Howdy's gameplay formula as \\"Chess + Mario Kart + Real Time/Turn-Based + Steampunk Westerns + Secret Sauce\\".Slashdot coverage of Bang! Howdy at the 2006 Game Developers Conference  Setting  Bang! Howdy incorporates many elements from the Western and steampunk genres, as well as Native American mythology. This is evident in the game's different \\"towns\\", player lobbies which also act as the different main settings of the game, outside of in-game instances. Frontier Town is the game's starting town. It is modelled after the archetypal \\"Western\\" town found in most depictions of the genre, complete with a saloon, general store, and sheriff's office. Indian Trading Post, the second town, is host to a variety of Native American-themed locales, shops, and non-player characters. In addition to these, there are also the planned but still-unreleased towns of Boom Town, Ghost Town, and City of Gold. Aside from taking inspiration from and expanding on all the aforementioned genres, these last three towns would have also incorporated elements of Latin American folklore The game also features a host of controllable units which are in-line with the game's established unique setting. For example, several of the players' available units are entirely mechanical, including autonomous artillery units, steam powered dirigibles, and a \\"steam gunman\\" robot. These can be played alongside the more conventional units such as cavalry and gunslingers. A third assortment of Native American-themed units can also be unlocked as players progress past the starting town, such as mystics with supernatural abilities and a unit inspired by the Thunderbird, a legendary creature in Native American mythology.  Development  Initially conceived as an insect-themed game, the primary mechanic of Bang! Howdy is designed to get around the problems of both real-time and turn-based strategy. Michael Bayne, project leader of Bang! Howdy, described RTS as \\"overly complex and too fast-paced\\", and described turn-based strategy as \\"no fun when it's not your turn.\\" Bayne described the development approach as episodic, with the plan of getting the core game released quickly and working on new towns in turn.

During his father's reign, angry that he was not created crown prince, he tried to seize that position by force, but after his failure was killed. Murong Hui was born to Murong Bao and a concubine described as of lowly birth while Murong Bao was a low-level Former Qin official, after Murong Chui, a Former Yan prince, had sought refuge with Former Qin's emperor Fu JiƒÅn in 369 after a dispute with Former Yan's Empress Kezuhun and regent Murong Ping, and after Former Qin had destroyed Former Yan in 370. He was therefore probably born in the Former Qin capital Chang'an, where Murong Bao served. When Murong Chui rebelled against Former Qin in 384 and established Later Yan, Murong Hui was in Chang'an, then still under Former Qin control. After the last Former Yan emperor Murong Wei, then a Former Qin general, tried to rebel within the city around the new year 385, Fu JiƒÅn ordered the Xianbei in the city killed, but Murong Hui, along with his uncle Murong Rou (ÊÖïÂÆπÊüî) and brother Murong Sheng, were not killed, apparently because Murong Rou had been adopted by the eunuch Song Ya (ÂÆãÁâô). Soon thereafter, though, Murong Rou, Murong Sheng, and Murong Hui fled Chang'an and sought refuge with Murong Wei's brother and the leader of the nascent Western Yan state, Murong Chong. Western Yan eventually captured Chang'an, but Murong Chong was killed in a coup, and the Xianbei people of the state abandoned Chang'an and began heading east back to their homeland. After a series of coups in 386, Murong Yong became emperor, and under his leadership Western Yan settled in at Zhangzi (Èï∑Â≠ê, in modern Changzhi, Shanxi). In winter 386, Murong Sheng saw that they were being suspected by Murong Yong on account of their being descendants of Murong Chui, and therefore persuaded Murong Rou and Murong Hui to flee to Later Yan. It took them a year to arrive in the Later Yan capital Zhongshan (‰∏≠Â±±, in modern Baoding, Hebei), and upon arrival in the capital, Murong Hui was created the Duke of Qinghe. Murong Chui greatly favored Murong Hui's abilities and impressive looks, and whenever Murong Bao, then Murong Chui's crown prince, would accompany Murong Chui on campaigns, Murong Chui put Murong Hui in charge of the crown prince's household, and ordered that he accorded the same respect as the crown prince during those times. In 395, after Murong Bao had suffered a devastating defeat at the hands of Later Yan's former vassal, Northern Wei's prince Tuoba Gui, in preparation of another attack against Northern Wei, Murong Chui recalled Murong Hui's uncle Murong Long, the viceroy at the old Former Yan capital Longcheng (ÈæçÂüé, in modern Jinzhou, Liaoning), to the capital with his troops, and he made Murong Hui viceroy at Longcheng. He grew extremely ill in early 396, however, and died during the campaign and was succeeded by Murong Bao. Before Murong Chui died, he urged Murong Bao to make Murong Hui crown prince. However, Murong Bao favored his young son Murong Ce (ÊÖïÂÆπÁ≠ñ, 13 years Murong Hui's junior) and did not consider Murong Hui. Murong Sheng, who was slightly older than Murong Hui, also did not want to see Murong Hui as crown prince, and therefore persuaded Murong Bao to create Murong Ce crown prince. Murong Hui was only promoted to Prince of Qinghe, and he resented this greatly. Later in 396, Northern Wei launched a major attack on Later Yan, immediately seizing most of the central and western provinces of the empire, and putting Zhongshan under siege. Murong Hui mobilized his troops under guise of heading for his father's aid, but did not actually have the desire to do so, and so advanced slowly only after the urging of the general Yu Chong (È§òÂ¥á). As he reached Zhongshan's vicinity, his father abandoned Zhongshan and joined his army. Murong Bao immediately saw that Murong Hui was still resentful, and tried to transfer the command of the army to his own brothers Murong Long and Murong Nong, but this only angered Murong Hui more. Seeing his uncles as his threats, he sent assassins against them, killing Murong Long but only wounding Murong Nong, and then falsely accused Murong Long and Murong Nong of treason. Murong Bao initially pretended to believe him, and then tried to have him assassinated but failed. Murong Hui then rose in open rebellion, demanding the position of crown prince, and as Murong Bao had then reached Longcheng first, Murong Hui tried to put Longcheng under siege. The general Gao Yun, however, led a surprise attack against him, and his troops collapsed. He fled back to Zhongshan, then under the control of his cousin Murong Xiang (ÊÖïÂÆπË©≥) the Duke of Kaifeng, but Murong Xiang executed him. Murong Bao executed his mother and sons as well.

It is a large gull native to North America that breeds in the Arctic islands of Canada and winters primarily on the Pacific coast, from southern Alaska to the Gulf of California, though there are also wintering populations on the Great Lakes and the upper Mississippi River. The species has occurred as a vagrant to Japan, Denmark, and other parts of western Europe. Somewhat intermediate between American herring gull and Iceland gull in habit and appearance and at times considered conspecific with either species, the adult Thayer's gull in nonbreeding plumage has a pale gray mantle, with obvious blackish wingtips, and extensive brown streaking on the head and neck. The head, neck, breast, belly, and underwings are primarily white, and the legs are pink. There is a red spot on the lower mandible, and the color of the iris is generally dark. In summer, the head and neck are white, with the bill turning bright yellow with a larger red spot on the lower mandible.

These gulls with lay 3 bluish or greenish eggs in nests lined with grass, moss or lichens. Their voice consists of mostly mewing and squealing notes. There is continuing debate about the taxonomic status of this species, and some authorities consider Thayer's gull to be the dark-mantled form of Iceland gull, with Kumlien's gull (variously treated as a subspecies of either Thayer's or Iceland gulls) as an intermediate example, forming a cline rather than separate species. The American Ornithologists' Union considered Thayer's gull a subspecies of American herring gull from 1917 until 1973, when they determined it was a separate species from herring gull. After numerous papers had been written suggesting downgrading this species to a subspecies or even a morph of Iceland gull, the American Ornithologists' Union invalidated the Thayer's gull as a full species in the 2017 annual supplement to the American Ornithologists' Union checklist. Thayer's gull is now considered a subspecies of Iceland Gull. The verdict was based on geographic location of breeding populations rather than objective genetic evidence, and thus the lump was received negatively by some. It is possible that proposals to resplit Thayer's gull and Iceland gull will be submitted to the American Ornithologists' Union in the future. The British Ornithologists' Union follows the publication Birds of North America in lumping the three (thayeri, kumlieni, and glaucoides) as forms of Iceland gull. Both the common and species names honor ornithologist John Eliot Thayer, and so the first part of its name is pronounced \\"THAY-erz\\". References *del Hoyo, J., et al., eds. (1996).

History The municipality of Orkland was originally a part of the municipality of Orkdal (see formannskapsdistrikt), but on 1 July 1920 it was separated from Orkdal to form a new municipality of its own. Initially, it had a population of 1,760. During the 1960s, there were many municipal mergers across Norway due to the work of the Schei Committee. On 1 January 1963, the municipalities of Orkland, Orkanger, Orkdal, and Geitastrand were merged to form a new, larger municipality of Orkdal. Prior to the merger, Orkland had a population of 1,707. Government All municipalities in Norway, including Orkland, are responsible for primary education (through 10th grade), outpatient health services, senior citizen services, unemployment and other social services, zoning, economic development, and municipal roads. The municipality is governed by a municipal council of elected representatives, which in turn elects a mayor. =Municipal council= The municipal council of Orkland was made up of representatives that were elected to four year terms.

The song had been performed in concert by the Grateful Dead starting in 1971, but it first appeared on record on Weir's debut solo album Ace in 1972. It subsequently appeared on several Grateful Dead live albums. Composition Weir is credited with writing \\"One More Saturday Night\\", although there is evidence that the song was originally written with Robert Hunter, with different lyrics. Weir wanted to call his version \\"US Blues\\", but Hunter did not agree and disavowed himself of the song.Grateful Dead Lyric and Song Finder: One More Saturday Night Hunter later wrote a song with that title for the Dead's 1974 album From the Mars Hotel. Although the studio version of \\"One More Saturday Night\\" featured on Ace is credited as a Bob Weir solo recording, the song - like the entire album - featured the other members of the Dead acting as Weir's backing group. Performances The song was first performed on 19 October 1971 by the Grateful Dead. Aside from Ace, it also appeared on the Dead's Europe '72 live album. After 1972, it became a regular part of the Dead's repertoire, and as might be expected, was frequently heard on Saturday shows; with its short, compact form and energetic crescendoes, it was a popular break from some of the Dead's more challenging pieces. It has continued to be regularly performed by post-Grateful Dead collaboratives, including The Other Ones, Phil Lesh & Friends, The Dead, Furthur, RatDog, Dead & Company, and various solo Weir projects. U. S. Senator (D-MN), comedian, and political commentator Al Franken, a Grateful Dead fan who used the group's music on his radio show, named his 1986 comedy film One More Saturday Night after the song. Basketball player and Deadhead Bill Walton's 2000s Sirius satellite radio show is named after the song.

It generates a library of pairwise alignments to guide the multiple sequence alignment. It can also combine multiple sequences alignments obtained previously and in the latest versions can use structural information from PDB files (3D-Coffee). It has advanced features to evaluate the quality of the alignments and some capacity for identifying occurrence of motifs (Mocca). It produces alignment in the aln format (Clustal) by default, but can also produce PIR, MSF, and FASTA format. The most common input formats are supported (FASTA, PIR). Comparisons with other alignment software While the default output is a Clustal-like format, it is sufficiently different from the output of ClustalW/X that many programs supporting Clustal format cannot read it; fortunately ClustalX can import T-Coffee output so the simplest fix for this issue is usually to import T-Coffee's output into ClustalX and then re-export. Another possibility is to request the strict Clustalw output format with the option \\"\`-output=clustalw_aln\`\\". An important specificity of T-Coffee is its ability to combine different methods and different data types. In its latest version, T-Coffee can be used to combine protein sequences and structures, RNA sequences and structures.

Early history William Howard White 1915The original railroad was established by William Howard White of Boyne City, Michigan in 1893. William H. White was a northern Michigan industrialist who owned the W.H. White Company. The company operated saw mills in Boyne City, the White Transportation Steamship Company with service to Chicago, Buffalo, Georgian Bay, Ontario and Boyne City, a commercial dock on Lake Charlevoix and controlled extensive timberlands around Boyne Falls. The company needed an economical way to supply the lumber camps and haul the cut timber to the saw mills located in Boyne City. In addition, the White Transportation Steamship Company wanted to compete with the steamship lines that docked at the Port of Petoskey. A railroad intersecting the Grand Rapids & Indiana Main Line at Boyne Falls with service to the Boyne City would make the commercial docks at Boyne City more competitive. A railroad controlled by the W.H. White Company was the solution. Boyne City Southeastern Railroad In 1893, the W.H. White Lumber Company established the Boyne City Southeastern Railroad to access the company timber holding around Boyne Falls. Mile 0 started at the White Lumber Dock in Boyne City and proceeded east to Boyne Falls where it intersected the mainline of the Grand Rapids & Indiana Railroad. From Boyne Falls, the Thumb Lake Branch Line was built to access the company timber around Thumb Lake. The railroad was built north along the GR&I; to Easton (Thumb Lake Road & US Hwy 131) and then east (7 miles) to Thumb Lake. The W.H. White Company established logging camps 1 through 3 in the area.Supreme Court of Michigan, July 15 to December 10, 1909 Volume 158, published by the Michigan Secretary of State Boyne City Gaylord & Alpena Boyne City train in 1905. \\"The Pup\\" locomotive of the B.C.G & A in 1911.

On March 28, 1905, the Boyne City, Gaylord & Alpena Railroad Company was incorporated and became the successor to the Boyne City & Southeastern Railroad. It was proposed that the railroad would eventually reach Alpena on Lake Huron, to the east. On November 25, 1905, the railroad reached the town of Gaylord where it intersected the Michigan Central Main Line, east of Boyne City. After reaching Gaylord, the W.H. White Company continued to harvest the timber along the B.C.G.&A.; right-of-way. In addition, the Southend Branch Line was built between 1908 and 1912 from the railroad junction named Project (the current parking lot of Boyne Mountain Resort) to the Upper Jordan River Valley (south of M-32) to harvest the W.H. White Company‚Äôs timberland in the valley. In November 1913, the Michigan Trust Co. of Grand Rapids, MI was appointed receiver of the W.H. White Company and the B.C.G. & A Railroad since the companies had missed all mortgage payments in the previous quarter. Liabilities of the combined companies were stated at roughly $2 million with no mention of asset value.Full text scan of The Hardwood Recorder, Volume 33 11/25/1913 published by The Hardwood Company Chicago, IL By 1915, the railroad operated of main line track, of branch lines, of siding, 12 locomotives, 305 cars (mostly Russel Log Cars) and car repair shops in Boyne City. The 1915-1916 fiscal year revenue for the B.C.G&A.; was: gross earnings $263,753, net earnings $185,038, interest expense ($32,559) and net income $46,595. 86% of the revenue was from freight traffic. In 1915, the officers of the company were W.H. White, President & General Manager; Thomas White, V-P & Assistant General Manager; W.L. Martin, Secretary; J.M. Tompkins, Auditor & Purchasing Agent; all of Boyne City; James A. White, Treasurer, Buffalo, NY. The 1915 directors of the company were: William H. White, Thomas White, L.H. White, W.L. Marin, J.M. Harris, J.T. Wylie.Moody Manual Company, 33 Broadway New York, NY. Copyright 1915 In late 1916, the B.C.G & A was stalled from Alpena, MI at the Thunder Bay River since the company had run out of money. In February 1917, the Michigan Trust Company, Grand Rapids, MI announced a tentative reorganization plan in which the B.C.G&A; would issue $800,000 in 20 year bonds paying 5%. The bonds would have first lien on the line as projected from Boyne City to Alpena. The $800,000 would be issued as follows: $195,000 to the previous bond holders and other debt holders, $330,000 to the Michigan Trust Company (receiver) in payment of receivers claims and $275,000 sold for cash to provide funds to complete the line to Alpena, MI. As a caveat, Michigan Trust Company required that all earnings in excess of expenses including interest be deposit annual by March 1. In addition, the Michigan Trust Company required principal and interest guarantees from William H., Thomas White and James White. This was accomplished by the brothers by pledging all their capital stock in the B.C.G & A Railroad Company. In August 1917, the Michigan Bankruptcy Court and the Michigan Railroad Commission approved the plan.Moody Manual Company, 33 Broadway New York, NY. Copyright 1918 On December 20, 1918, the BCG&A; reached Alpena, Michigan on Lake Huron where it intersected the Detroit and Mackinac Railway main line. The expanded BCG&A; offered service to Charlevoix County, Antrim County, Otsego County, Montmorency County, and Alpena County. The BCG&A; operated of main line track, 3 branch lines had over 300 Russel Log Cars, 13 locomotives, 12 passenger cars and 1 interurban gasoline passenger car. By this time, the W.H. White Company had 4 saw mills in Boyne City with a combined capacity of of lumber. In addition, the Iron & Chemical Company and the Michigan Tanning & Extract Company required a constant source of hardwood timber that the BCG&A; could deliver.Boyne City Gazette, Edward May III, Historian The extension of the BCG&A; was an attempt to maximize the land holdings of the W.H. White Company. The railroad was necessary to harvest the timber that the W.H. White Company owned east of Gaylord. In addition, after the timber was harvested, the land was near worthless without settlers. So, the W.H. White Company marketed the cut over land to farmers in Ohio, southern Michigan and Indiana. In addition, W.H. White Company marketed to Europeans looking to immigrate and farm in Northern Michigan. The rationale was that the BCG&A; provided a modern transportation system to new immigrants not only for getting there, but also for shipping their farm products and the necessary goods to them. The BCG&A; provided the W.H. White Company a way to sell the near worthless cut over land to European immigrants looking to farm. In addition, the new immigrants would become the passengers and the freight customers of the BCG&A;, which the W.H. White Company planned to continue to operate. Unfortunately for the immigrants, Northern Michigan has a short growing season and the majority of the cut over land was of poor farming quality. The BCG&A; attempted to operate rail service between Boyne City and Alpena, but passenger and the diminished freight revenues after the timber was gone were not sufficient to profitably operate the railroad. In 1935, the BCG&A; went bankrupt and the line was sold for scrap. In addition, the W.H. White Company could not pay taxes on their cut over land. As a result, the company forfeited their ownership to the State of Michigan. Much of the former White Company land was reorganized as key land parcels within the Mackinaw State Forest, a Michigan state forest that aimed at long-term rehabilitation of the damaged land. Boyne City Railroad Boyne City Railroad was a short line operating on the railroad's original of roadbed in 1935-78. The Boyne City Railroad resumed its predecessor's primary function of providing freight service from Boyne City to the Boyne Falls north-south trunk line, operated successively by the Pennsylvania Railroad, the Penn Central, and the Michigan Northern. During the final two years of its operating life (1976‚Äì78), the short line was known as the Boyne Valley Railroad, and offered excursion passenger service only. Passenger service ended after the summer of 1978, and the railroad was formally abandoned in 1982. Roadbed Remains All of the tracks associated with the Boyne City Railroad have been removed. However, there are many locations where the old roadbed is clearly visible. ‚Ä¢ Thunder Bay River East to M-65: In 1931, the river was dammed by the Alpena Power Company. The impounded water eventually eroded the roadbed, however the roadbed is still visible on Google Earth. ‚Ä¢ M-65 west: the road is used to access private homes and hunting properties in an area formerly known as the Spratt Club. ‚Ä¢ Kerston: The BCG&A; crossed a spur of the Detroit & Mackinac Railroad at Kerston. That spur of the D&M; railroad ran west from Alpena to Hillman, Michigan. ‚Ä¢ Boyne Falls to Elmira: A utility right-of-way that follows the old roadbed is still visibly on Google Earth‚Äîstarting from the south end of the Boyne Mountain ski resort and running south and east to just north of Elmira. A concrete bridge foundation is visible at the junction of the Grand Rapids & Indiana railroad and Webster Road. ‚Ä¢ Hallock Road & Parmeter Road-Otsego County: From there it meanders cross-country towards Gaylord passing just east of the former town and station of Hallock, Michigan. Hallock was located at the corner of Parmeter Road and Hallock Road about a mile north of W-M32 in Otsego County.From Michigan Railroads Website referencing the book Ghost Towns of Michigan Volume II, by http://www.michiganrailroads.com/RRHX/Stations/CountyStations/OtsegoStations/HallockMI.htm The remnants of the BCG&A; still visible are a built up right of way and a cut through sand hills. Power lines follow the old right of way. Just outside Gaylord, the old railroad grade intersects Murner Road just north of M-32.http://www.michiganrailroads.com/RRHX/Maps/Counties/04-AlpenaCoMap.htm ‚Ä¢ Jordan River Valley Road follows the old railroad grade. Alongside the road there is excavation evidence as well as bridge pilings crossing the Jordan River. O‚ÄôBrien Pond is formed by the old road bed of the Boyne City & Southeastern Railroad.

She was named after Ren√© Duguay-Trouin. She patrolled the Mediterranean during the Spanish Civil War, and after the outbreak of the Second World War, she hunted Nazi pocket battleships before being interned after the Fall of France and until 1943. She then took part in Allied operations in the Mediterranean, supporting the Provence Landings and shelling Nazi and Fascist troops on the coasts of Italy until the end of the war. Duguay-Trouin then took part in the decolonisation wars in Algeria, and in Indochina. Design and description The design of the Duguay-Trouin class was based on an improved version of a 1915 design, but was reworked with more speed and a more powerful armament to match the British and the American light cruisers. The ships had an overall length of , a beam of , and a draft of . They displaced at standard load and at deep load. Their crew consisted of 591 men when serving as flagships.Jordan & Moulin, p. 30  Construction and career  =Pre-war= Started on 4 August 1922, Duguay-Trouin was the first large unit put on keel in France after the First World War. Launched on 14 August 1923, she was one of the longest light cruisers of the era, which made her a fast ship, capable of sustaining 30 knots for an entire day during trials. She entered active service on 2 November 1926. After completion, she was assigned to the 2nd Squadron and based at Brest. In 1929, she became flagship of the 3rd Light Division in the Mediterranean and, in 1931, she undertook an extended cruise to Indo-China, then a French colony. Duguay- Trouin returned to the 2nd Squadron at Brest in 1932, this time as flagship, remaining there until 1935. In 1936, she took part in the international effort to safeguard shipping in the Mediterranean on the backdrop of the Spanish Civil War. For the occasion, the top of her upper turrets was painted in Blue- White-Red colours, to make identification easier and avoid attacks by belligerants. In 1936, she became a gunnery training ship. The following year, she was modernised, notably fitting a reinforced anti-air artillery. In 1938, she was under the command of Captain de Pr√©vaux. In June 1939, when she joined the 6th Cruiser Division. =World War II= France declared war on 3 September 1939 as Duguay-Trouin was in Dakar. Along with other French and British ships, she commenced Atlantic patrols to intercept German pocket battleships. On 16 October 1939 Duguay-Trouin intercepted the German merchant ship Halle south-west of Dakar. Halle was scuttled to prevent its capture. In early May, 1940, she was transferred to the eastern Mediterranean, based at Beirut, for operations in the Adriatic and Dodecanese. In July 1940, after the French surrender, she joined Admiral Ren√©-√âmile Godfroy's Force X at Alexandria, Egypt; there, she was disarmed by agreement between the British and French admirals during Operation Catapult and interned by the British from 22 June 1940. Axis forces occupying the so-called Free Zone in November 1942 made Armistice terms between France and the Third Reich moot, and Duguay- Trouin rejoined the Allies on 30 May 1943. She was re-armed in July, and after modernisation in Casablanca and Oran, she returned to active service in September 1943. During her refit, Duguay-Trouin had her torpedo tubes and aircraft removed, and instead gained 4 75-millimetre AA guns, 15 20-millimetre guns and 10 13.2-millimetre machine guns. In March 1944, she ferried troops between Algiers, Ajaccio, Oran and Napoli. She supported the landings in southern France in August 1944 and subsequently undertook bombardments along the Italian coast with the Flank Force until April 1945. =Post-war= On 10 and 11 May 1945, Duguay-Trouin bombarded villages in Algeria during the S√©tif and Guelma massacre, opening fire in ten instances. On 28 May 1947, with the outbreak of the Indochina War, Duguay-Trouin departed Toulon, bound for the Far East by way of Diego-Suarez in Madagascar, arriving at Saigon on 13 November 1947. She remained in the region until September 1951 as flagship of the Far East Division, supporting landing parties with land bombardment from 1948 to October 1951. Duguay-Trouin was eventually decommissioned on 19 March 1952, and sold for scrap in 1953, having served one of the longest careers of the warships of her time.

It is dedicated \\"To the Czechoslovak Army\\" and Jan√°ƒçek said it was intended to express \\"contemporary free man, his spiritual beauty and joy, his strength, courage and determination to fight for victory\\". It started by Jan√°ƒçek listening to a brass band, becoming inspired to write some fanfares of his own. When the organisers of the Sokol Gymnastic Festival approached him for a commission, he developed the material into the Sinfonietta. He later dropped the word military. The first performance was in Prague on 26 June 1926 under V√°clav Talich. The typical performance duration is 20‚Äì25 minutes. Structure Sinfonietta is typical of Jan√°ƒçek's tight construction in that the material of each movement derives from the opening motif. It features several variants based on Jan√°ƒçek's original fanfare. : relative c' { clef bass time 2/4 set Staff.midiInstrument = #\\"trombone\\" tempo \\"Allegretto\\" 2 = 72 2(f   )  << { (    ) }  { s2  s2  ges8( ees ges4  ees ges8 ees) } >> } The piece is in five movements, all of which have descriptive subtitles: The first movement is scored only for brass and percussion. The second movement begins with a rapid ostinato from the wind but later has a more lyrical episode. The third begins quietly in the strings but is interrupted by a stern figure in the trombones, leading to another fast dance-like passage. In the fourth movement, Jan√°ƒçek celebrates the newly liberated Czechoslovakia with a joyous trumpet fanfare. The finale begins in the key of E minor with a calm retrograde version of the opening melody. However, this quickly moves into a triumphant finale, the return of the opening fanfare decorated with swirling figures in the strings and wind.  Orchestration  The score calls for the following orchestra with expanded brass section: ;Woodwinds: :Piccolo, alternating Flute 4. :3 Flutes :2 Oboes :English horn :Clarinet in E :2 Clarinets in B :Bass clarinet :2 Bassoons ;Brass: :4 Horns in F :9 Trumpets in C* :3 Trumpets in F :2 Bass trumpets* :4 Trombones :2 Euphoniums (as \\"Tenor Tubas\\")* :Tuba ;Percussion2 :Timpani :Cymbals :Chimes ;Strings :Harp :Violins I, II :Violas :Violoncellos :Double basses *) The nine C trumpets, the bass trumpets, and tenor tubas are heard only in the first and last movements.

Born in Ta'if, Mukhtar moved to Iraq at a young age and grew up in Kufa. Following the death of Husayn ibn Ali, a grandson of the Islamic prophet Muhammad, at the hands of the Umayyad army in the Battle of Karbala in 680, he allied with the rival caliph Abd Allah ibn al-Zubayr in Mecca, but the alliance was short-lived. Mukhtar returned to Kufa where he declared Muhammad ibn al-Hanafiyyah, a son of caliph Ali (r. 656‚Äì661) and brother of Husayn, the mahdi and the imam, and called for the establishment of an Alid caliphate and retaliation for Husayn's killing. He took over Kufa in October 685, after expelling its Zubayrid governor, and later ordered the execution of those involved in the killing of Husayn. Hostile relations with Ibn al-Zubayr ultimately led to Mukhtar's death by the forces of the Zubayrid governor of Basra, Mus'ab ibn al-Zubayr, following a four-month siege. Although Mukhtar was defeated, his movement would have far-reaching consequences. After his death, his followers formed a radical Shi'a sect, later known as the Kaysanites, who developed several novel doctrines and influenced later Shi'a ideology. Mukhtar raised the social status of mawali (local converts to Islam) and they became an important political entity. The mawali and Kaysanites went on to play a significant role in the Abbasid Revolution sixty years later. Mukhtar is a controversial figure among Muslims; condemned by many as a false prophet, but revered by Shi'a because of his support for the Alids. Modern historians' views range from regarding him as a sincere revolutionary to an ambitious opportunist. Background Ali moved the capital of the caliphate from Medina to Kufa. Mukhtar was born in Ta'if in 622 CE (the year that the Islamic prophet Muhammad migrated to Medina) to Abu Ubayd al-Thaqafi, a Muslim army commander from the Banu Thaqif tribe, and Dawma bint Amr ibn Wahb ibn Muattib. Following Muhammad's death in 632, Abu Bakr became caliph. He died two years later and was succeeded by Umar, who expanded the Muslim conquests initiated by Abu Bakr, and sent Mukhtar's father Abu Ubayd to the Iraqi front. Abu Ubayd was killed at the Battle of the Bridge in November 634. Mukhtar, then thirteen years old, remained in Iraq after the Muslim conquest of this region, and was raised by his uncle Saad ibn Masud al-Thaqafi. Umar was assassinated by a Persian slave Piruz Nahavandi in 644, after which his successor, Uthman, ruled for twelve years before being assassinated by rebels in 656. After Uthman's death, Ali, a cousin and son-in-law of Muhammad, became caliph and moved the capital from Medina to Kufa, where Mukhtar held some minor office under him, and Mukhtar's uncle became governor of nearby al- Mada'in. A few companions of Muhammad, including Muawiyah, the governor of Syria, refused to recongnise Ali's authority, and war broke out. The Battle of Siffin ended in stalemate (July 657), when Ali's forces refused to fight in response to Muawiyah's calls for arbitration. Ali reluctantly agreed to talks but a faction of his forces, later called Kharijites, broke away in protest, condemning Ali's acceptance of arbitration as blasphemous. Arbitration could not settle the dispute between Muawiyah and Ali and the latter was subsequently murdered by a Kharijite in January 661. Ali's eldest son Hasan became caliph, but Muawiyah challenged his authority and invaded Iraq. While Hasan was mobilizing his troops, he was injured by a Kharijite near al-Mada'in and was brought to the home of Mukhtar's uncle. There, Mukhtar reportedly recommended that Hasan be handed over to Muawiyah in return for political favour, but was rebuffed by his uncle. In August 661, Hasan abdicated the caliphate to Muawiyah in a peace treaty and the capital was transferred to Damascus. A few years before his death, Muawiyah nominated his son Yazid as his successor, thus founding the Umayyad Caliphate. Yazid's nomination angered Alid partisans, because it was seen as the violation of the peace treaty, which stipulated that Muawiyah would not nominate a successor. Scant information exists about Mukhtar's early life and he only rose to prominence when he was aged around sixty. Revolt Upon Yazid's accession in April 680, pro-Alid Kufans urged Husayn ibn Ali, the younger brother of now deceased Hasan, to lead a revolt against Yazid. Husayn subsequently sent his cousin Muslim ibn Aqil to assess the political environment in Kufa. Mukhtar hosted Ibn Aqil at his house before the arrival of Ubayd Allah ibn Ziyad. The latter was appointed to replace Mukhtar's father-in-law, Nu'man ibn Bashir, as governor due to Ibn Bashir's benign attitude towards Ibn Aqil and his followers. As a result of Ibn Ziyad's suppression and political maneuvering, Ibn Aqil's following started melting away and he was forced to declare the revolt prematurely. Mukhtar was not in the city at the time. After hearing the news, he attempted to gather supporters from Kufa's environs, but Ibn Aqil's revolt was defeated and he was executed before Mukhtar returned to the city. Mukhtar was arrested and brought to the governor but he denied involvement in the revolt. While Mukhtar was imprisoned, Husayn was slain by Ibn Ziyad's forces at the Battle of Karbala on 10 October 680. Mukhtar was afterward released upon the intervention of Abdullah ibn Umar, an influential son of the second caliph and Mukhtar's brother-in-law, and ordered to leave Kufa. =Exile in Mecca= By this time, Abd Allah ibn al-Zubayr, a son of Muhammad's companion Zubayr ibn al-Awam, secretly started taking allegiance in Mecca and came to control the entire Hejaz (western Arabia). Having left Kufa, Mukhtar headed for Mecca and offered allegiance to Ibn al-Zubayr on the condition that he be consulted about important matters and awarded a high post, which Ibn al-Zubayr refused. Mukhtar then left for Ta'if and, after one year, Ibn al-Zubayr, persuaded by his advisers, accepted Mukhtar's homage under the same terms. When Yazid dispatched an army to retake Mecca in 683, Mukhtar participated in the city's defence. After Yazid died in November, the Umayyad army retreated and Ibn al-Zubayr openly proclaimed his caliphate. Mukhtar was informed by people coming from Kufa that the city had come under Ibn al-Zubayr's control but many Kufans were looking for an independent leader of their own. He claimed that he was the man they were looking for. While in Mecca, he sought permission from Ali's son, Muhammad ibn al-Hanafiyyah, to avenge Husayn's death and secure power for Ibn al-Hanafiyyah. The latter responded that he neither approved nor disapproved of such an action, but bloodshed should be avoided. Earlier, he had made the same offer to Husayn's son Ali Zayn al-Abidin but was refused. Five months after Yazid's death, he returned to Kufa without informing Ibn al-Zubayr, who he thought had not kept his promise. Some accounts state that Ibn al-Zubayr himself sent him to Kufa as governor with instructions to gather force capable of resisting Umayyad attempts to reconquer Iraq. This is considered unlikely by the modern historians. =Return to Kufa= Great Mosque, where his grave is located. In Kufa, Mukhtar began recruiting people to take revenge against the killers of Husayn, promising them victory and fortune. At the same time, Sulayman ibn Surad, a companion of Muhammad and an Alid supporter, was rallying a group of Kufans, who called themselves Tawwabin, to fight the Umayyads to atone for their failure to support Husayn during the Battle of Karbala. The Tawwabin movement created difficulties for Mukhtar. Most pro-Alid Kufans supported Ibn Surad because he was Muhammad's companion, and as a result, Mukhtar was unable to attract many recruits. He criticised the Tawwabin's actions as premature and destined for failure, arguing that Ibn Surad was old, weak, and militarily inexperienced. He then claimed that he was a lieutenant of Ibn al-Hanafiyyah, whom he called the Mahdi (Messiah). He convinced many Alid partisans, including some five hundred mawali (sing. mawlƒÅ; local converts to Islam), that he was working under the orders of the Mahdi. Doubting the authenticity of Mukhtar's claims, a group of Alid partisans from Kufa went to Mecca seeking verification from Ibn al-Hanafiyyah. He replied in an ambiguous manner that he was satisfied with anyone whom God uses to take revenge on enemies of the family of the prophet. They interpreted this as confirmation of Mukhtar's claims and returned to join him. To win over the hitherto unpersuaded Ibrahim ibn al-Ashtar, an influential Alid partisan and head of the Nakhai tribe, Mukhtar presented him with a letter, which he claimed was authored by Ibn al- Hanafiyyah. In it, Ibn al-Hanafiyyah ostensibly called himself the Mahdi and urged Ibn al-Ashtar to support Mukhtar. After expressing some doubts, Ibn al- Ashtar eventually joined him. The letter was likely fabricated, and Ibn al- Hanafiyyah seems to have had no involvement in the revolt. He tolerated the use of his name, however, and did not disapprove of Mukhtar's activities. Nonetheless, when he wanted to visit his followers in Kufa, he was deterred by a rumour, floated by Mukhtar upon hearing this news, that the true Mahdi would not die if struck by a sword. Ibn al-Zubayr appointed Abd Allah ibn Yazid as governor of Kufa in 684. Fearful of Mukhtar, Ibn Yazid imprisoned him. Some time later, Abdullah ibn Umar interceded for Mukhtar, who promised to refrain from anti-government activity and was released. =Overthrow of the Zubayrid governor= After his release Mukhtar resumed his revolutionary activities. The Tawwabin were defeated by the Umayyads at the Battle of Ayn al-Warda in January 685, and most of the pro-Alid Kufans shifted allegiance to Mukhtar. Ibn al-Zubayr replaced Ibn Yazid with Abd Allah ibn Muti as governor to contain the expected agitation but to no avail. Mukhtar and his followers planned to overthrow the governor and seize control of Kufa on Thursday, 19 October 685. On the evening of 17 October Mukhtar's men clashed with government forces. Mukhtar signaled an early declaration of revolt to his troops by lighting fires. By the evening of Wednesday, 18 October, the government's forces were defeated. Ibn Muti went into hiding and later, with help from Mukhtar, escaped to Basra. The next morning, Mukhtar received allegiance from Kufans in the mosque on the basis of, \\"Book of God, Sunnah of the Prophet, revenge for the Prophet's family, defence of the weak and war on sinners\\". Rule over Iraq Mukhtar controlled much of Iraq from October 685 until the end of 686. Support for Mukhtar's revolt came from two divergent groups: the Arab tribal nobility and the mawali. At first, he attempted to reconcile their differences and appease both. Most government positions, including the governorships of Mosul and al-Mada'in, were awarded to Arabs. Mawali, hitherto treated as lower-grade citizens, were entitled to war booty and army salaries and allowed to ride horses. He announced that any mawali slaves who joined him would be freed, resulting in increased support from this group. His personal guard was also staffed by mawali led by Abu Amra Kaysan. Nobles, however, were disturbed by his policies towards the mawali. At this stage he controlled most of Iraq and its dependencies including Arminiya, Adharbayjan, Jibal and parts of Upper Mesopotamia. Efforts by his supporters to take Basra, which was under Zubayrid control, did not succeed. By then Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan had taken reigns of the Umayyad power in Syria and was struggling to regain control of the lost provinces. =Counter-coup= One year after the Battle of Ayn al-Warda, the Umayyad army occupied Mosul and headed for Kufa. Mukhtar sent three thousand cavalrymen under the command of Yazid ibn Anas. On 17 July 686, they defeated the Umayyad army, twice their size, near Mosul. That evening, after ordering the execution of all the Syrian captives, Ibn Anas died from an illness. Having lost their commander, the Kufans retreated in the face of another Umayyad army. In Kufa, rumour spread that Mukhtar's forces had been defeated and Ibn Anas slain. In response, Mukhtar deployed seven thousand reinforcements headed by Ibn al-Ashtar. Taking advantage of the troops' absence, the Kufan nobility, whose relations with Mukhtar had grown estranged due to his favouritism toward the mawali, attempted to topple Mukhtar by besieging his palace. They accused him of robbing their prestige: Despite the siege, Mukhtar was able to recall Ibn al- Ashtar. Three days after its departure from Kufa, Ibn al-Ashtar's army returned and defeated the revolt. 350px After eliminating his opposition, Mukhtar enacted punitive measures against those involved in the battle of Karbala. He executed most of them, including Umar ibn Sa'ad and Shimr ibn Ziljawshan. Many others were killed under the pretext of their direct or indirect involvement in the battle, while about ten thousand Kufans fled to Basra. The houses of many absconders were destroyed. This further reduced Arab support for Mukhtar and he became increasingly reliant on mawali. =Battle of Khazir= Two days after reasserting control over Kufa, Mukhtar dispatched Ibn al-Ashtar with a thirteen thousand-strong force to confront the approaching Umayyad army led by Ibn Ziyad. Some of Mukhtar's soldiers carried a chair, circling around it, which they claimed belonged to Ali and would give them victory in the battle. The idea is said to have been Mukhtar's. He had invented it to increase his support among more religious people and compared it to the Ark of the Covenant, but orientalist Julius Wellhausen holds he was not the originator of the concept. He allowed them to carry the chair, as he needed their zeal. The armies met at the banks of Khazir River in early August 686. The Umayyad army was defeated, and many of the senior Umayyad military leaders including Ibn Ziyad and Husayn ibn Numayr al-Sakuni were killed. The exact date of the battle is unknown, although some sources put it on 6 August, coinciding with 10 Muharram, the date of Husayn's death. The death of Ibn Ziyad was seen as the fulfillment of Mukhtar's promise of revenge against Husayn's killers. =Relations with Ibn al-Zubayr= Sometime after expelling Ibn Muti, Mukhtar complained to Ibn al-Zubayr about the failure to keep his promise, despite Mukhtar having served him well. Mukhtar, nonetheless, offered his support if needed. Though Ibn al-Zubayr had considered Mukhtar loyal, the latter refused to surrender his control of Kufa to the caliph's appointed governor, Umar ibn Abd al-Rahman. The governor left the city after being bribed and threatened by Mukhtar. In 686, Mukhtar feigned an offer of military support to Ibn al-Zubayr against an impending Umayyad attack on Medina with the ultimate intention of ousting him. Ibn al-Zubayr accepted and requested troops to Wadi al-Qura, a valley north of Medina, but instead, Mukhtar dispatched three thousand fighters under Shurahbil ibn Wars with orders to enter Medina until further notice. Meanwhile, Ibn al-Zubayr sent his confidant Abbas ibn Sahl at the head of a two thousand-strong force with instructions to escort Ibn Wars and his men to Wadi al-Qura in anticipation of the Syrian army and to kill Mukhtar's loyalists if they refused. Ibn Wars indeed refused and was killed along with most of his men. Mukhtar subsequently informed Ibn al- Hanafiyyah of his foiled plan to seize the region for the Alid and offered to send another army to Medina if Ibn al-Hanafiyyah notified the city's inhabitants that Mukhtar was working on his behalf. Ibn al-Hanafiyyah refused, citing his opposition to bloodshed. Nonetheless, Ibn al-Zubayr, after becoming aware of Mukhtar's intentions and fearing a pro-Alid revolt in the Hejaz, detained Ibn al-Hanafiyyah to forcibly gain his allegiance, hoping Mukhtar would follow suit. Ibn al-Hanafiyyah requested help from Mukhtar, who subsequently dispatched a four thousand-strong force to free him. This caused a further deterioration in relations between Mecca and Kufa. Death In 687, Mus'ab ibn al-Zubayr, the governor of Basra and younger brother of Abd Allah ibn al-Zubayr, launched an assault against Kufa. A sizable portion of his army consisted of Kufan nobles, who had previously fled Mukhtar's punitive measures. The size of Mukhtar's Kufan army is not certain with ranges between three thousand to sixty thousand, depending on the source. The Kufans retreated following their defeat at the battles of Madhar, located along the Tigris between Basra and Kufa, and Harura, a village near Kufa. Mus'ab then besieged Mukhtar's palace for four months. Ibn al-Ashtar, who was then governor of Mosul, did not attempt to relieve Mukhtar, either because he was not called to action, or because he refused Mukhtar's summons. In either case, he later joined Mus'ab. On 3 April 687, Mukhtar came out of the palace accompanied by nineteen supporters, (the remainder had refused to fight), and was killed fighting. Soon afterwards, Mukhtar's remaining partisans, totaling about six thousand, surrendered and were executed by Mus'ab. One of Mukhtar's wives, Umrah bint Nu'man ibn Bashir al-Ansari, refused to denounce her husband's views and was consequently executed, while his other wife condemned him and was spared. Mukhtar's hand was cut off and hung on the wall of the mosque. His grave is, reportedly, located inside the shrine of Muslim ibn Aqil, at the back of the Great Mosque of Kufa. Some sources, however, state that Mus'ab had burned his body. Legacy Though Mukhtar ruled for less than two years, his ideology survived his death. It was during his rule that the mawali rose to significance, much to the dissatisfaction of the Kufan Arab nobility. He had proclaimed Muhammad ibn al-Hanafiyyah as the Mahdi and the Imam. This was likely the first reference to the Mahdi in the history of Islam. This idea became influential afterwards, particularly in Shi'a Islam, where it became one of its central tenets. He was the first person to introduce the concept of Bada' (change in the divine will), when after defeat at the battle of Madhar, for which he had claimed he was promised victory, he said that God had changed his plan. His followers later developed into a distinct Shi'a sect known as the Kaysanites. They introduced the doctrines of Occultation (Ghayba) and Return (Raj'a) of the Mahdi. After the death of Ibn al-Hanafiyyah, some Kaysanites believed that he had not died but was hidden in Mount Radwa and would return some day to rid the world of injustice. Most Kaysanites, however, declared his son Abu Hashim to be their Imam. He then transferred the Imamate to Muhammad ibn Ali ibn Abdallah ibn Abbas before dying. The Abbasids used this as a propaganda tool during their revolution to boost their legitimacy and appeal to pro-Alid masses. Two of Muhammad ibn Ali's sons, as-Saffah and al-Mansur, would eventually establish the Abbasid Caliphate. Describing similarities between Mukhtar and Abbasid revolutionary Abu Muslim Khorasani, who recruited both Arabs and mawali in his army and treated them as equals, Wellhausen writes: \\"If the doctrine of Raj'a is correct, then the Arab of Khutarnia [Mukhtar] came to life again in the Maula [mawlƒÅ] of Khutarnia [Abu Muslim].\\" Many Muslims hold Mukhtar a liar who claimed prophethood and consider him an enemy of the Alids, who used their name to gain power, and executed Husayn's killers to consolidate his support among pro-Alids. According to Wellhausen, although he did not explicitly call himself a prophet, the allegations took root because of his boasting and excessive claims, which he made in the rhymed prose style of ancient Arabian soothsayers. Muhammad is reported to have said: \\"In Thaqif there will be a great liar and destroyer.\\" To them, the liar is Mukhtar and the destroyer is Hajjaj ibn Yusuf. Shi'a, on the other hand, regard him a sincere partisan of Ali and his family, who avenged the murder of Husayn and his company. They maintain that the allegations levelled against him regarding prophethood, his role in the Kaysanites sect, and his lust for power are Umayyad and Zubayrid propaganda. Early Shi'a, however, had a hostile opinion of him, that arose from his attitude towards Hasan and his alleged incompetence during Ibn Aqil's revolt. His proclamation of Ibn al-Hanafiyyah, a non-Fatimid, may also have contributed to this as most Shi'a in later times adhered to the Fatimid line of Alids. =Views of the Alid family= There are differing accounts of how prominent members of the Alid family viewed Mukhtar. One account holds that Husayn's son and the fourth Shi'a Imam, Ali Zayn al-Abidin, prayed for him after seeing the heads of Ibn Ziyad and Umar ibn Sa'ad, while another account holds that he rejected Mukhtar's gifts and called him a liar. Husayn's grandson, Muhammad al-Baqir, praised him: \\"Do not speak ill of Mukhtar, he killed our killers, sought vengeance for our blood and arranged marriages for our widows.\\" Al-Baqir further praised him when Mukhtar's son asked al-Baqir about his opinion of Mukhtar. Husayn's great-grandson, Ja'far al-Sadiq, is reported to have said: \\"The women of the Banu Hashim did not comb and colour [their hair] until al-Mukhtar came to us with the heads of those [who] killed Husayn\\". Ja'far al-Sadiq is also reported to have said that Mukhtar used to lie about Ali Zayn al-Abidin. =Modern scholarly views= While early historical accounts are unanimous in portraying Mukhtar in a negative light, modern historians hold a variety of views. Wellhausen writes that although Mukhtar did not claim to be a prophet, he made every effort to create the impression that he was one, and spoke in a way as if he sat in the counsel of God. He concludes that Mukhtar was nevertheless a sincere man who tried to eradicate the social differences of his time. He further argues that Mukhtar made extravagant claims and exploited Ibn al-Hanafiyyah's name out of necessity, as he could not have achieved his goal in his own name. He calls him \\"... one of the greatest men of Islamic history; [who] anticipated the future\\". Historian Hugh Kennedy writes that Mukhtar was a revolutionary who tried to put together a united Kufan coalition but was beset by internal divisions and let down by the Alid family. Before his death, Mukhtar is reported to have said: Middle East scholar Moshe Sharon describes this as an accurate description of his activities. Professor Abdulaziz Sachedina, on the other hand, calls him an ambitious politician who manipulated the religious sentiments of common people for his own good. Popular references As with Maqtal-namas narrating the story of Karbala, various Mukhtar-namas elaborating on the life and movement of Mukhtar, were written during the Safavid era. An Iranian television series, Mokhtar Nameh, based on the Shi'a perspective of his life and revolt, was produced in 2009.

The municipality existed from 1906 until its dissolution in 1964. S√∏r-Fr√∏ya included the southwestern part of the island of Fr√∏ya in what is now the municipality of Fr√∏ya in Tr√∏ndelag county. The main population center of S√∏r- Fr√∏ya was the village of Titran on the western tip of the island. The main church for the municipality was Hallaren Church (S√∏r-Fr√∏ya Church) which is located in Storhallaren on the southern coast of the island. History The municipality was established on 1 January 1906 when the old municipality of Fr√∏ien was divided into two new municipalities: S√∏r-Fr√∏ya in the south (population: 2,091) and Nord-Fr√∏ya in the north (population: 3,972). During the 1960s, there were many municipal mergers across Norway due to the work of the Schei Committee. On 1 January 1964, the municipalities of S√∏r-Fr√∏ya (population: 2,208) and Nord-Fr√∏ya (population: 4,348) were merged to form the municipality of Fr√∏ya. Name The municipality is named after the island of Fr√∏ya. The prefix S√∏r- means \\"southern\\", literally meaning the southern part of Fr√∏ya. The second part of the name comes from Norse mythology. Although Fr√∏ya is a variant of the name of the Norse goddess Freyja, the Old Norse form of the name of the island was Fr√∏y or Frey (the ending -a in the modern form is actually the definite article - so the meaning of Fr√∏ya is 'the Fr√∏y'). Therefore, the name of the island probably has the same root as the name of the Norse god Freyr, brother to Freyja. The names originally were titles: \\"lord\\" or \\"lady\\". The oldest meaning of the common word was \\"(the one) in front; the foremost, the leading\\" and here in the sense \\"the island in front of Hitra\\". Until 1906, the island and municipality name was spelled Fr√∏ien (-en is the definite article in Danish-Norwegian).

Big Brother Adams was born in Cwmbran. Originally a hairdresser for Classy Cutz, Newport,Salon's rooting for Helen! South Wales Argus and part-time dance instructor, Adams gained celebrity status in the UK due to her on-screen relationship with fellow Big Brother contestant Paul Clarke, a car designer from Reading. During their time in the Big Brother house, their relationship captivated the nation's interest, with millions of viewers tuning in to see the latest development in their soap opera-like romance. Adams was noted for her spontaneous tendency to blurt out whatever came into her head, which often tended to be bizarrely illogical and were referred to as \\"Helenisms\\" by fans and the tabloid press. Despite being the bookies' early favourite for eviction, she went on to take second place in the contest, losing to Brian Dowling in the final. Dowling polled 4,231,660 votes (58%) out of a total 7,255,094, while 2,680,463 viewers (37%) voted for Adams.\\"4.2m vote Brian winner of \`Big Brother'\\", The Independent.

It is first recorded at the start of the tenth century CE, when a commentary was written on it by the Egyptian mathematician Ahmad ibn Yusuf al-Misri (later sometimes confounded with his namesake Ali ibn Ridwan ibn Ali ibn Ja'far al-Misri, or in Latin \\"Haly ibn Rodoan\\", who lived a century later and wrote a commentary on Ptolemy's Tetrabiblios).  Influence and authorship  The Centiloquium opens with a dedication to Syrus, like the classical astronomer Ptolemy's astrological treatise the Tetrabiblos (\\"Four books\\"). Ptolemy was indeed accepted as its author by medieval Arabic, Hebrew and Latin scholars, and the book was widely taken up and quoted. In Arabic it was known as the Kitab al-Tamara (\\"Book of the Fruit\\"), the name supposedly a translation of the Greek Œ∫Œ±œÅœÄŒøœÇ meaning \\"fruit\\", the book's aphorisms being seen as standing as the fruit or summation of the earlier treatise. It was translated at least four times into Latin, in which it was also known as the Liber Fructus, including by John of Seville in Toledo in 1136 and by Plato of Tivoli in Barcelona in 1138 (printed in Venice in 1493). In Hebrew it was translated at the same time by Tivoli's collaborator Abraham bar Hiyya, and again in 1314 by Kalonymus ben Kalonymus, as the Sefer ha-Peri (\\"Book of the fruit\\") or Sefer ha-Ilan (\\"Book of the tree\\").Shlomo Sela (2003), Abraham ibn Ezra and the rise of medieval Hebrew science. Brill. , p. 321 Regardless of its authorship, the text has been described as \\"one of the most influential texts in astrology's history\\".John Frawley (2000), Electional Astrology, in The Real Astrology. London: Apprentice Books. . Footnote 2, page 109. Cited by Deborah Houlding (2006). It was, for example, a standard set text for medical students at the University of Bologna in the fifteenth century.H. Darrel Rutkin (2006), Astrology, in Roy Porter et al. (eds.), The Cambridge History of Science: Early modern science. Cambridge University Press. , p. 546 However, as even the original commentary on the book noted, the Centiloquium contains quite substantial differences in focus from the Tetrabiblos: for example, it is very concerned with \\"Interrogations\\", the asking of astrological questions about forthcoming plans and events, which is not treated at all in the earlier work. In the 1550s the Italian scholar Cardano considered this, and pronounced the work to be pseudoepigraphic ‚Äì not by Ptolemy at all.Anthony Grafton (1999), Cardano's cosmos: the worlds and works of a Renaissance astrologer, Harvard University Press. , p. 137. This has also tended to be the view of subsequent centuries. For example, aphorism 63 discusses implications of a conjunction of Jupiter and Saturn; but this is a doctrine developed by Arabic astrologers, not known to the Greeks. The author of the book is therefore now generally referred to as Pseudo-Ptolemy. One influential view, argued by Lemay (1978) and others, is that the original author of the work was in fact Ahmad ibn Yusuf himself, reckoning that presenting his views as a commentary on an unknown work by the great Ptolemy would make them far more influential and sought after than merely issuing such a compilation under his own name. Others however still see the Centiloquium as potentially containing a core of genuinely Hellenistic material, which may then have suffered adaptation and partial substitution in the chain of transmission and translation.See, for example, Deborah Houlding, Ptolemy's Centiloquium; or S.

The main church for the municipality was Sletta Church (or Nord-Fr√∏ya Church) which is located at Svellingen (the administrative centre of the municipality) on the northern coast of the island. History The municipality was established on 1 January 1906 when the old municipality of Fr√∏ien was divided into two new municipalities: S√∏r-Fr√∏ya in the south (population: 2,091) and Nord-Fr√∏ya in the north (population: 3,972).

Individuals and groups in Croatia that employ far-right politics are most often associated with the historical Usta≈°e movement, hence they have connections to Neo-Nazism and neo-fascism. That World War II political movement was an extremist organization at the time supported by the German Nazis and the Italian Fascists. The association with the Usta≈°e has been called \\"Neo-Ustashism\\" by Slavko Goldstein. The common perception is that the far right includes people who were either involved with the Independent State of Croatia (NDH) during World War II; sympathizers; and people who utilise their symbolism. The far right mainly arose from a combination of the residual hatred from the Yugoslav wars and Croatian nationalism. Pro-Usta≈°a symbols and actions have been restricted by law in Croatia since 2003. The most common venue for expressing these beliefs is graffiti. Background The Usta≈°e was a Croatian right-wing ultranationalist movement founded in 1929 by Ante Paveliƒá. After the establishment of the 6 January Dictatorship by Alexander I of Yugoslavia, Paveliƒá fled to Italy where he set up his organization's headquarters. Prior to World War II the Usta≈°e functioned as a paramilitary and terrorist organization, as it sought the separation of Croatia from Yugoslavia into an independent state through violent means. Notably, it was involved in the assassination of King Alexander in 1934 with the assistance of the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization (IMRO). The Usta≈°e however lacked broad support due to its radical and violent nature. When Nazi Germany invaded Yugoslavia in 1941, its territories were occupied by German, Italian and Hungarian forces. A german puppet-state, the Independent State of Croatia (NDH) was established and ruled by Paveliƒá and the Usta≈°e. During the Second World War, the Usta≈°e conducted genocide against Serbs, Roma and Jews within their borders. The Jasenovac concentration camp was a notorious death camp where extermination of these groups took place. After the war ended, many of the Usta≈°e fled to safety abroad in countries like Argentina and Spain. In 1957 Paveliƒá was wounded after an assassination attempt on him and died two years later from his injuries. Several far-right political parties in Croatia trace their roots to Ante Starƒçeviƒá and view the Independent State of Croatia as a legitimate foundational state. Most openly declare their affiliation with the Usta≈°e. Across the right-wing spectrum, various common themes emerge with varying degrees of which include the desire for a Greater Croatia, a negative stance towards the ICTY, anti-Serbianism, positive view of the NDH and negative attitudes towards NATO and the European Union. Za dom spremni (\\"Ready for the Homeland\\") was the WWII fascist salute used by the Usta≈°e and is considered to be the equivalent of the Nazi German Sieg heil. In some elements of Croatian society there is a narrative that claims the usage of the greeting predates the Usta≈°e, a claim that is rejected by the scholarly consensus. Since Croatia's independence, the salute has become \\"re-popularized\\" through public discourse by the right-wing. Croatian far right during Yugoslavia At the end of World War II, the Communist authorities pursued a strict set of policies which could be deemed as a form of denazification, only more similar to the Soviet style than to the American style. People who collaborated with the Usta≈°e were often court-martialled at the end of the war, and there were extrajudicial killings of collaborationist troops that refused to surrender. Trials against suspected collaborators continued long after the end of the war. In the 1980s, Andrija Artukoviƒá was extradited to Yugoslavia from the United States, and prosecuted in SR Croatia where he died in a prison hospital. The secret service exercised harsh control over both citizens with links to the Usta≈°e and mere Croatian nationalists. UDBA continuously monitored the Croatian diaspora, and was implicated in numerous assassinations, notably that of Bruno Bu≈°iƒá in 1978. In the aftermath of WWII, a guerrilla/terrorist anti-communist and Croatian nationalist insurgency group, the Crusaders, formed, and carried out terrorist acts against the new multi-ethnic communist state. Between 1962 and 1982, Croatian nationalist groups carried out 128 terror attacks against Yugoslav civilian and military targets; notably it bombed a JAT plane killing 27 people in 1972. All of these groups operated outside of Yugoslavia, given the Yugoslav regime's consolidation of power which made it difficult for them to operate inside the country. Early independent political scene In the process of the breakup of Yugoslavia, Croatia gained independence from the SFR Yugoslavia in the 1990s. The modern Croatia was formed long after World War II was over, and aside from occasional exceptions, there was no desire by the Croatian political elite to associate the new country with the former Independent State of Croatia, or to revisit the status of Croatia as a member of the winning side of that war. Nevertheless, the introduction of the freedom of speech enabled public expression of far-right politics. The new mainstream politics showed significantly more courtesy to the Usta≈°e for their desire to make Croatia independent, but they were neither rehabilitated nor explicitly banned. Subsequently, no new laws were passed in the 1990s that specifically targeted the issues of Nazism or fascism. The primary reason for the disregard of past fascism in Croatia has been a lack of priority and care taken by the Croatian public and the mainstream politics towards the issue, because numerous other issues plagued the country at the time. The late president of Croatia, Franjo Tuƒëman, who had been a Partisan general who had fought the Usta≈°e, became a champion of reconciliation (Croatian pomirenje or pomirba), whereby Croats of all political views should unite against the shared threat from Serbia. This had the effect of also bringing pro-Usta≈°e Croats into the fray, their philosophy and ideas no longer taboo. Tuƒëman publicly stated that the Usta≈°a state was not only criminal in nature but also an expression of the desire of Croats to regain their independence after centuries. Such a notion could be considered true in view of Croatia's long historical struggle for independence, but does not give enough consideration to the puppet-state status of the NDH. After the war more anti-fascist-inclined people were no longer willing to set aside political differences with the more fascist- inclined. At the time, Croatia was often accused of ignoring the crimes committed by the World War II-era fascist Usta≈°a regime, and of tolerating the symbols and the activities of individuals sympathetic to that regime. This has led to criticism of Croatia, particularly among Serbs. This was exacerbated with war-time propaganda for the Yugoslav wars. The antagonism between the Croats and the Serbs grew, and had become widespread by the time the Croatian War of Independence had started. The Croatian-Serbian animosity during the Yugoslav wars was viewed by some as a rivalry between the \\"Usta≈°a\\" and the \\"Chetnik\\", even if both of these World War II-era organizations did not actually exist at the time. To some extent, it is a consequence of wartime propaganda, in the course of which such moralistic debasement is common. Members of the Croatian Defence Forces, the paramilitary arm of the Croatian Party of Rights In the absence of a specific policy or laws against it, instances of pro-Usta≈°e sentiment and hate speech were rarely sanctioned, to the dismay of the left-leaning public, as well the Serbs of Croatia who were the most common targets. Among the organizations formed during wartime which were most commonly associated with neo-Ustashism was the Croatian Defence Forces (Hrvatske obrambene snage, HOS), which emerged as the de facto paramilitary wing of the Croatian Party of Rights. Their symbols included dressing in black, at the time widely perceived to be reminiscent of blackshirts, and using the phrase Za dom spremni. These units, however, quickly fell out of favor with the Croatian authorities and were eliminated through more or less violent means before the end of the first phase of the war in Croatia. In recent years the HOS has gained popularity, their members making appearances during state war commemorations. The far-right part of the Croatian political scene in the 1990s was fragmented between various right- wing political parties: primarily Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) and Croatian Party of Rights (HSP), as well as other smaller parties such as the Croatian Christian Democratic Union (HKDU), the Croatian Party of Rights 1861 (HSP 1861) and Croatian Pure Party of Rights (HƒåSP). =Defacement of monuments= In the early 1990s, during the Croatian War of Independence, numerous monuments erected in honour of the Partisans have been damaged or destroyed throughout the country, and these incidents were generally not censured by the authorities at all. Furthermore, the devastation of World War II partisan monuments also often extended to those erected in honour of civilian victims of war, also with little or no intervention from the police. The defacements occurred during a period when communist parties lost power in much of Eastern Europe. Political parties = Active = * The Croatian Party of Rights (HSP), far-right with a blend of ultra-nationalism and free market economics. Gained 7% of votes in the 1992 Croatian parliamentary election and five seats in the Croatian parliament. Since then it has attracted less support. The HSP's military wing, the Croatian Defence Forces (HOS), participated in the Croatian War of Independence and openly displayed Usta≈°e symbols. * The Croatian Pure Party of Rights (HƒåSP), far-right or neo-fascist and ultranationalist, founded by Ivan Gabelica and Nedeljko Gabelica. A marginal party with some representation in local municipalities. It holds an annual event on 10 April to celebrate the establishment of the NDH. It also protests the Pride parade and commemorations for Usta≈°e victims. * The Miroslav ≈†koro Homeland Movement (DPM≈†), right-wing nationalist or far-right party founded by folk singer Miroslav ≈†koro. Miroslav ≈†koro, the founder and leader of the Homeland Movement The coalition led by the Miroslav ≈†koro's far-right Miroslav ≈†koro Homeland MovementHomeland Movement came third at the 2020 parliamentary election, winning 10.89% of the vote and 16 seats. The abortion debate was one of the leading topics during political debates, while the Homeland Movement advocated a ban on abortion. = Defunct = * The Croatian Democratic Party of Rights (HDSP), extreme-right or neo-fascist, founded by Kre≈°imir Paveliƒá that was active during the 1990s. * The National Democratic League (NDL), extreme-right or neo-fascist, led by Ivan Vekiƒá. * Croatian Block (HB), extreme-right and militant, founded in 2004 and disbanded in 2009. Post-war political scene =WWII Genocide Denial= In recent times, mainstream Croatian politicians, such as Stjepan Mesiƒá, brought more focus to anti- fascist stances and veterans groups. Remembrance ceremonies at the site of Jasenovac concentration camp resumed, with support from the highest levels of government, including the right-wing HDZ under Ivo Sanader. The World War II war crimes committed by the Usta≈°e had been processed in Yugoslavia, but some cases had protracted long enough to become the responsibility of the modern- day Croatian authorities. In 1999, Croatia extradited Dinko ≈†akiƒá from Argentina, one of the commanders of the Jasenovac concentration camp, and he was subsequently tried and sentenced to 20 years in prison, at the time the highest penalty under Croatian law. The conservative parties such as the Croatian Party of Rights (HSP) and the Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) permeated in their support for extreme forms of nationalism and far-right ideas. This has been particularly apparent in the latter, which has a large membership and voter base and appeals to a broad spectrum of right-wing voters. The two-time prime minister Ivo Sanader of HDZ came to power after promoting himself as an avid advocate of Croatian general Mirko Norac in 2001. The far-right position with regard to war crimes committed in the Croatian war of independence has been one of a general denial - the Croatian side is seen as inherently not responsible for any crimes because its role in the war is one of a victim. This view is the extreme form of the position taken by the Supreme Court of Croatia, which allows \\"pursuit of a legitimate goal of defending one's country against an armed aggression\\" to be considered a mitigating circumstance in war crimes trials. In general, with respect to processing war crimes, the Croatian Government (mostly under HDZ) has had a rather spotty record for processing those committed by Croats. Pressure from the European Union helped rectify this. After Sanader and HDZ were elected in 2003, Norac was prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. Croatia has also been cooperating with the ICTY in the legal prosecution of all persons accused of war crimes, which has included Croatian officers, notably Ante Gotovina, who was acquitted of all charges by the ICTY on 16 November 2012. Parties like the Croatian Party of Rights which are most commonly associated with Usta≈°ism generally aren't able to attract support from more than a few percent of the population (HSP coalition won 6.4% of the national popular vote in the 2003 election and 3.5% in the 2007 election). In recent times, the HSP's image of \\"pro-Usta≈°a\\" was repetitively shunned by its leaders in an attempt to sway more votes. The Croatian Pure Party of Rights openly praises the Usta≈°e regime, though the party does not meet the minimum number of votes needed to enter Parliament. On July 11, 2003, the Ivica Raƒçan coalition government passed amendments to the penal code which outlawed hate speech, in a new section titled Praising fascist, Nazi and other totalitarian states and ideologies or promotion of racism and xenophobia. The law is not perfectly applied, evidenced by the examples of regular public display of Ustasha memorabilia by the group \\"Hrvatski domobran\\" from Zadar that only recently started to get sanctioned by the police. On June 20, 2006 Croatian prime minister Ivo Sanader issued a message ahead of the Anti-Fascist Struggle Day (an official holiday in Croatia), in which he rejected extremism and radicalism, and said that \\"antifascism was a commitment weaved into the foundations of independent, democratic Croatia\\". Croatia has no laws against historical revisionism or Holocaust denial. This can be attributed to the change of political system, and the change in the entire system of values as the country became independent. Revisionism was not frowned upon because priority was placed on the re-evaluation of history as recorded during the Communist era, which was therefore deemed almost implicitly tainted, because it systematically omitted or misrepresented issues related to what was perceived to be Croatian nationalism. On the other hand, the revision of history books often went too far in making them increasingly focused on Croatian national issues, even with far-right interpretations of various World War II events. The re-examination of the number of victims of the Independent State of Croatia, particularly the Jasenovac concentration camp and Genocide of Serbs, was fairly common, as well as fairly controversial. Statistical research such as that by Vladimir ≈Ωerjaviƒá indicated serious flaws with Yugoslav data, whose sources had been kept secret until 1989. Croatia's far- right often advocates the false theory that Jasenovac was a \\"labour camp\\" where mass murder did not take place. Among them is the far-right NGO \\"The Society for Research of the Threefold Jasenovac Camp\\" which also claims that the camp was used by the Yugoslav authorities following the war to imprison Ustasha members and regular Home Guard army troops until 1948, then alleged Stalinists until 1951. Members of the organization includes public figures such as journalist Igor Vukiƒá, Catholic priest Stjepan Razum and academic Josip Peƒçariƒá. The ideas promoted by its members have been amplified by mainstream media interviews and book tours. Vukiƒá's book \\"The Jasenovac Lie Revealed\\" prompted the Simon Wiesenthal Center to urge Croatian authorities to ban such works, noting that they \\"would immediately be banned in Germany and Austria and rightfully so\\". Croatian filmmaker Jakov Sedlar also peddled this theory in his documentary Jasenovac ‚Äì The Truth, bringing accusations of holocaust and genocide denial from organisations representing the ethnic groups that were the primary victims of the camp. In November 2016 in Jasenovac, a plaque with the slogan \\"Za dom spremni\\" was unveiled. =Graffiti= Far-right extremist graffiti in Croatia often targets ethnic Serbs, Roma and homosexuals. Bobetko!\\", as well as the logo of the Usta≈°e and the acronym for the Independent State of Croatia. (see text) The conflation of modern and obsolete nationalist themes sometimes produces bizarre inconsistencies, as shown at picture on the right: at the time when the ICTY wanted Croatian general Janko Bobetko, the right-wing part of the public was adamant in its demands to prevent that, and some extremist painted graffiti saying so, together with neo-fascist symbols. At the same time, Bobetko was quite clearly not a neo-fascist himself, because his family was killed by the Usta≈°e, and he fought against them. =Names of squares and streets= A square in the central part of Zagreb had been named the \\"Square of the victims of fascism\\" (Trg ≈ærtava fa≈°izma) because during World War II, over sixteen thousand people had been deported via the square to concentration camps. In the early 1990s, this square was renamed to \\"Square of great Croats\\" (Trg hrvatskih velikana). This decision was later reverted in December 2000 during Milan Bandiƒá's mayoralty of Zagreb. In several Croatian cities, streets were renamed after Mile Budak, a prominent Usta≈°a ideologist, on the basis that he was otherwise a writer. The moves to hail Budak this way, were supported by 120 university professors, scholars, and other public figures. Conversely, the leftist newspaper Feral Tribune regularly satirized the Mile Budak streets, and its journalists explicitly criticized this trend. The renaming of streets and squares after Budak (and other Usta≈°a-related people) has mostly been reversed by recent governments. In 2003, Ivo Sanader's government decided to finally deal with the issue which resulted in a decision to rename all the streets bearing Budak's name. In 2004, a plaque commemorating Budak's birth in the village of Sveti Rok was removed by the same authorities. Numerous local authorities however refused to follow up with the renames or delayed them. On 6 October 2009, the Croatian extreme right-wing NGO, the Croatian Cultural Movement (HUP), publicly declared its intention to erect a monument in honour of former Usta≈°e leader Ante Paveliƒá in Zagreb adjacent to the capital's centre square. The Israeli director of the Simon Wiesenthal Center slammed the proposed monument as a falsification of history and an insult to the memory of the victims of the NDH. No such monument was actually erected. Popular culture Black Legion, Usta≈°e Militia sign at the Thompson concert In the world of popular culture, the pop/folk/rock singer Marko Perkoviƒá (Thompson) caused a scandal when the media obtained a copy song Jasenovac i Gradi≈°ka Stara allegedly sung by him. Perkoviƒá was reportedly not prosecuted for this due to uncertainty as to whether it was really he who sang the song. He has appeared on public television, and can still sometimes be seen on it, even though mainstream TV stations do tend to avoid him in order to avoid controversy. His concerts regularly attract the far-right crowd. It has been widely alleged that he achieved such large attendances with the support of right-wing political organizations who helped rally people to the concerts. He has been banned from performing in Netherlands and other states that do not allow display of Nazi symbols and celebration of the Holocaust, although his group (Thompson) performed at SS Cyril and Methodius Roman Catholic church in Manhattan in November 2007, despite well-reported controversy and criticism from the Simon Wiesenthal Center. Thompson himself has denied he has anything to do with Nazism numerous times, and called the campaign against him cheap propaganda, saying he was merely a proud Croatian. Catholic clergy A part of the Catholic clergy in Croatia openly praises the Usta≈°e regime and denies any wrongdoing from the side of Croats and Catholic Church. Praise for the regime is primarily expressed through commemorations for Ante Paveliƒá on 28 December, his birthday. Catholic representatives do not attend Holocaust commemorations but they regularly attend Bleiburg reparations commemorations. Controversy was caused on June 2008 when Croatian military bishop Juraj Jezerinac sang a song named Bijeli golubovi by Marko Perkoviƒá Thompson, the controversial singer mentioned above, during a sermon in a church in Vukovar. The song contained also the NDH motto \\"Za dom spremni\\". Simon Wiesenthal Center director Efraim Zuroff complained to the Croatian president Stjepan Mesiƒá about the funeral of Dinko ≈†akiƒá, one of the leaders of the army of the Independent State of Croatia, who died on July 2008. At that funeral, Croatian Dominican priest pater Vjekoslav Lasiƒá held a speech in which he said that \\"the court that indicted Dinko ≈†akiƒá indicted Croatia and Croatians\\", and that \\"every Croat should be proud of ≈†akiƒá's name\\". Sports Ultranationalist Croats have shouted the slogan \\"Kill the Serb\\" during some sporting events. According to some Croatian media, a group of youths chanted this during a concert by Marko Perkoviƒá Thompson.60 tisuƒáa ljudi po nevremenu doƒçekalo Thompsona, vikalo se i 'Ubij, ubij Srbina!' - Dnevnik.hrVijesti.net - Thompson pozdravio Norca, rulja uzvikivala \\"Ubij Srbina!\\" In January 2006, the Ustasha song \\"Jasenovac i Gradi≈°ka Stara\\" was played publicly during the interval of an international club volleyball match. Officials later attributed the incident to a single individual, and the police did not intervene. During a friendly 2006 match between Croatia and Italy in Livorno, a group of some 200 Croatian fans arranged themselves into a \\"human swastika\\" formation, with many also performing Nazi salutes, allegedly in response to leftist Italian fans jeering at the Croatian national anthem and waving Yugoslav communist flags. UEFA penalized the Croatian Football Federation for the incident.https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/croatia-threatened-with- euro-2008-expulsion-by-uefa-7253785.html In 2007, Croatian football fans formed the letter U in a stadium during a match in Bosnia and Herzegovina.www.fildzan.info - Ko≈°evo: Navijaƒçi Hrvatske formirali \\"U\\" In October 2007, the Croatian newspaper Slobodna Dalmacija reported that NK Imotski's official clothing items featured Usta≈°a-related symbols (The letter U and the Independent State of Croatia-resembling coat of arms inside the letter. That was, in fact, the logo of the club's leading sponsor, the edile company gUj (meaning \\"Gojko Und Jure\\"). Some historians and critics claim the symbols display is an open praising of the Usta≈°e. The club's president, Nediljko Tolo, said: \\"As long as the sponsor finances our club, we will carry those symbols on our dresses\\". In early November 2007, the Croatian Second League Association announced that NK Imotski violated FIFA, Croatian Football Federation rules and laws of the Republic of Croatia. NK Imotski had to end a sponsorship deal with gUj until the company changes its logo. NK Imotski had to find new uniforms for the players and remove all gUj advertisements around the stadium. In November 2007, it was reported that members of the Hajduk Split supporters' group, Torcida Split, were wearing black T-shirts featuring the words \\"Hajduk jugend\\" (alluding to Hitlerjugend) in Fraktur and an eagle atop Hajduk's logo (resembling a Nazi Party symbol). The T-shirts were also being sold on Torcida's website. Stipe Lekiƒá, the secretary of Torcida said to reporters that \\"Torcida has always been leaning to the right\\", but rejecting accusations that the T-shirts have connections with Nazism. He said that he was wearing the T-shirt because he liked the symbols. Also in November 2007, a swastika appeared on Osijek's Gradski vrt football field, together with the slogan \\"Play, fags!\\" That was, reportedly done before the match with Meƒëimurje. NK Osijek's and their Kohorta fan association condemned the acts.Net.hr In June 2012, the Croatian and German football federations were fined for singing songs associated with Nazism and wearing Nazi symbols. In November 2013, after the FIFA World Cup 2014 Qualification match between Croatia and Iceland, the Croatian defender of Australian descent, Josip ≈†imuniƒá, reportedly celebrated and motivated the crowd with the Ustashe chant \\"Za dom, Spremni\\" upon Croatian qualification to the 2014 FIFA World Cup. Simunic was disciplined by FIFA in December with a ten-match suspension and a fine of CHF 30,000. Croatian Wikipedia In September 2013 complaints about right-wing bias of administrators and editors on the Croatian Wikipedia arose. Those complaints were already present, but they started receiving media attention after the launch of a Facebook page titled Razotkrivanje sramotne hr.wikipedije (Exposing the shameful Croatian Wikipedia) whose creators warned the media about the bias. Croatia's Minister of Science, Education and Sports, ≈Ωeljko Jovanoviƒá, called for pupils and students in Croatia to avoid using the Croatian Wikipedia. Snje≈æana Koren, a historian at the Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences, University of Zagreb, has judged the disputed articles as \\"biased and malicious, partly even illiterate\\". She further added that \\"These are the types of articles you can find on the pages of fringe organizations and movements, but there should be no place for that on Wikipedia\\", expressing doubts on the ability of its authors to distinguish good from evil. Koren concludes that the ulterior motive of such writings is to rehabilitate the Independent State of Croatia, a Nazi Germany puppet state, and that \\"there is no other way to characterize such efforts than as Ustashe movement\\".

It consists of the old Ottoman Mahmut Pa≈üa bazaar storage building, and the Kur≈üunlu Han. Because of Atat√ºrk's desire to establish a Hittite museum, the buildings were bought upon the suggestion of Hamit Z√ºbeyir Ko≈üay, who was then Culture Minister, to the National Education Minister, Saffet Arƒ±kan. After the remodelling and repairs were completed (1938‚Äì1968), the building was opened to the public as the Ankara Archaeological Museum. Today, Kur≈üunlu Han, used as an administrative building, houses the work rooms, library, conference hall, laboratory and workshop. The old bazaar building houses the exhibits. Within this Ottoman building, the museum has a number of exhibits of Anatolian archeology. They start with the Paleolithic era, and continue chronologically through the Neolithic, Early Bronze, Assyrian trading colonies, Hittite, Phrygian, Urartian, Greek, Hellenistic, Roman, Byzantine, Seljuq and Ottoman periods. There is also an extensive collection of artifacts from the excavations at Karain, √áatalh√∂y√ºk, Hacƒ±lar, Canhasan, Beyce Sultan, Alacah√∂y√ºk, K√ºltepe, Acemh√∂y√ºk, Boƒüazk√∂y (Gordion), Pazarlƒ±, Altƒ±ntepe, Adilcevaz and Patnos as well as examples of several periods. The exhibits of gold, silver, glass, marble and bronze works date back as far as the second half of the first millennium BC. The coin collections, with examples ranging from the first minted money to modern times, represent the museum's rare cultural treasures. Museum of Anatolian Civilizations reaching the present time with its historical buildings and its deeply rooted history was elected as the first \\"European Museum of the Year\\" in Switzerland on April 19, 1997. The history of the museum Open square in front of the museum entrance The first museum in Ankara was established by M√ºbarek Galip Bey, Directorate of Culture, in 1921, in the section of the Castle of Ankara called Akkale. In addition to this museum, artifacts from the Augustus Temple and the Byzantine Baths were also collected. Upon recommendation of Atat√ºrk and from the view of establishing an \\"Eti Museum\\" in the center, the Hittite artifacts from the region were sent to Ankara and therefore a larger museum was needed. The Director of Culture at that time, Hamit Z√ºbeyir Ko≈üay and Saffet Arƒ±kan, Minister of Education recommended that the Mahmut Pa≈üa Bazaar and the Inn be repaired and converted into a museum. This recommendation was accepted and restoration continued from 1938 to 1968. Upon the completion of repairs of the bazaar, where the domed structure is, in 1940, a committee chaired by German Archaeologist H. G. Guterbock arranged the museum. In 1943, while the repairs of the building were still in progress, the middle section was opened for visitors. Repair projects of this part were carried out by Architect Macit Kural and repair work upon tender was performed by Architect Z√ºht√º Bey. In 1948 the museum administration left Akkale as a storage house, and the museum was in four rooms of Kur≈üunlu Han the repairs of which were completed. Restoration and exhibition projects of the part around the domed structure were prepared and applied by Architect ƒ∞hsan Kƒ±ygƒ±. Five shops were left in their original form, and the walls between the shops were destroyed and thus a large location was provided for exhibition. The museum building reached its present structure in 1968. Kur≈üunlu Han, which has been used as an administration building, has research rooms, a library, a conference hall, a laboratory and workshops, and the Mahmut Pasha Vaulted Bazaar has been used as the exhibition hall. History of buildings The Anatolian Civilizations Museum is in two Ottoman buildings located near Ankara Castle, in the historical Atpazarƒ± district of Ankara. One of the buildings is Mahmut Pa≈üa Bedesteni and the other is Kur≈üunlu Han (inn, caravanserai). The Mahmut Pa≈üa Bedesteni was built by Mahmut Pasha, one of the ministers (viziers) of Mehmed II the Conqueror during 1464-1471. The building does not have any inscriptions. In some sources, it is recorded that pure Angora garments were distributed here. The design of the building is of the classical type. There are 10 domes covering a rectangle designed to enclose the location, and there are 102 shops facing each other. According to historical records and registry books, the Kur≈üunlu Han was built as a foundation (vakƒ±f) to finance Mehmet Pasha's (Mehmet the Conqueror's vizier) alms giving in √úsk√ºdar, Istanbul. It does not have any inscriptions either. During the repairs of 1946, coins of the Murat II period were discovered. The findings indicate that the Han existed in the fifteenth century. The Han has the typical design of Ottoman Period hans. There is a courtyard and an arcade in the middle and they are surrounded by two-storey rooms. There are 28 rooms on the ground floor, 30 rooms on the first floor. The rooms have furnaces. There is a barn with an \\"L\\" type on the ground floor on west and south directions of the rooms. On the north side of the han there are 11 shops and 9 shops on east side and 4 shops facing each other within the garden. The inn (han) was built by Mehmet Pasha and in 1467 Mehmet Pasha was promoted to Prime Minister (Grand Vizier). Upon orders by Mahmut Pasha the vaulted bazaar was built. He kept his position until 1470. He had his mosque, soup kitchen and madrasa in √úsk√ºdar, and his body is buried there. These two buildings constituting the museum today were abandoned after the fire in 1881. Exhibited artifacts *Palaeolithic Age (....8000 BC): The Palaeolithic Age is represented in the museum by the finds uncovered in the Antalya Karain Cave. People of the Palaeolithic Age were hunter-gatherers who used stone and bone tools. The stone tools are displayed under three time categories: Lower Paleolithic Age, Middle Paleolithic Age and Upper and Late Upper Paleolithic Age. *Neolithic Age (8000-5500 BC) : During this age, the first villages appeared and agriculture began. The artifacts from √áatalh√∂y√ºk and Hacƒ±lar, which are two of the most important sites of the Neolithic Age, are exhibited in this section. The collection includes Mother Goddess sculptures, wall paintings, clay figurines, stamps, earthenware containers, and agricultural tools made from bones. The most impressive parts of this exhibit are a hunting scene on plaster from the 7th millennium BC, a reproduction of a √áatalh√∂y√ºk room with wall-mounted bull heads, a Mother Goddess Kybele (later Cybele) sculpture, obsidian tools, wall paintings of Mount Hasan erupting, and wall paintings of a leopard. *Chalcolithic Age (Copper-Stone) (5500-3000 BC): In addition to stone tools, copper was processed and used in everyday life during this age. The artifacts recovered in Hacƒ±lar, Canhasan, Tilkitepe, Alacah√∂y√ºk and Ali≈üar H√ºy√ºk are exhibited in the museum. The collection includes a large collection of stone and metal tools, goddess figurines, seals, and decorative jewelry. Bronze figurine of a naked woman breast-feeding a baby, from a grave in Horoztepe. *Early Bronze Age (3000-1950 BC): The people of Anatolia amalgamated copper and tin and invented bronze at the beginning of the 3000 BC. They also processed the known metals with casting and hammering techniques. In addition to valuable metal artifacts buried as grave goods in royal tombs in Alacah√∂y√ºk, artifacts from Hasanoƒülan, Mahmatlar, Eskiyapar, Horoztepe, Karaoƒülan, Merzifon, Etiyoku≈üu, Ahlatlƒ±bel, Karayav≈üan, Bolu, Beycesultan Semah√∂y√ºk, Karaz-Tilkitepe are represented in the Old Bronze Age section of the museum. The Hatti tribes dominate the Bronze Age display. The collection includes solar discs, deer- shaped statuettes, thinner version of female figurines and gold jewelry. There is also a reconstruction of a burial ceremony which emphasizes the religious practices of this ancient people. * Assyrian Trade Colonies (1950-1750 BC): In this period, writing emerged in Anatolia for the first time. Since Akkadian times, Mesopotamians were aware of Anatolian resources and riches. As a result, they engaged in broad trade relations, spearheaded by Assyrians and with them they brought in their languages and cylinder and stamp seals which later was developed into a writing system. Over 20,000 clay tablets, inscribed in Assyrian cuneiform, shed light to this period. Most of the written documents are concerned with trade, economy, and law. Tin, textiles, and clothes were brought by the Assyrian donkey caravans for the local people and these goods were exchanged for silver and gold. K√ºltepe was the center of the trade network. As a result, we witness an explosion in the diversity of the finds. Cuneiform tablets, drinking vessels in the shape of sacred animals like bull, lion, eagle, boar, rabbit, which were used in religious ceremonies, cult objects, cylinder and stamp seals and their impressions, all kinds of weapons and metal cups of artistic value made of clay, stone, gold, silver, lead, copper, bronze, precious stones and tiles from the Assyrian trade colonies were discovered at K√ºltepe, Acemh√∂y√ºk, Ali≈üar and Boƒüazk√∂y. Another interesting class of finds related to this 200-year period is rhytons of Kultepe, a special group of ceramic art which constitutes the basis of the Hittite culture. Bronze tablet from √áorum-Boƒüazk√∂y dating from 1235 BC *Hittite Period (1750-1200 BC): The ancient Hittites' first political union was established near the crescent of the Kƒ±zƒ±lƒ±rmak River in Anatolia around 2000 BC. The important sites are Boƒüazk√∂y (Hattusa), ƒ∞nandƒ±k, Eskiyapar, Alacah√∂y√ºk, Ali≈üar, Ferzant. The highlight of the Great Hittite Empire section is the relief of the God of War taken from the King's Gate at Boƒüazk√∂y (Hattusa). Embossed bull figure containers, various fruit bowls and vases with animal shapes, infamous ƒ∞nandƒ±k vase that depicts a wedding ceremony, tablets of government archives as well as the seals of the kings, bronze statues of fertility gods, bulls, and deer are other interesting displays. The exhibit also includes pictures from Boƒüazk√∂y, reconstruction of a religious ceremony, reconstruction of King's Gate at Boƒüazk√∂y and pictures from the excavation at Boƒüazk√∂y. One of the most important artifacts is the tablet in Akkadian scripts (1275-1220 BC) - a correspondence from Egyptian Queen Nefertari (wife of Ramses II) to Hittite Queen Puduhepa (wife of Hattusili III) written after Kadesh Peace Treaty - the first peace treaty in the world history, dated 1275-1220 BC found at Boƒüazk√∂y. *Phrygian Period (1200-700 BC) : The Phrygians, the Sea People, came to Anatolia from the Balkans in 1200 BC. They acquired control over Central Anatolia and made Gordion their capital city. The finds from the royal tumulus at Gordion form the majority of this section. The tumulus measured in diameter and in height. The reproduction of the tomb of King Midas, found in the ancient tumulus, is also displayed here. Carved and inlaid wooden furniture, hinged dress pins, ritual vessels, depictions of animals such as lions, rams and eagles, the reconstruction of a burial ceremony and the statue of the Mother Goddess Kybele (to whom the Phrygians worshipped as their main deity) are represented in this section. *Late Hittite Period (1200-700 BC) : After the fall of the Hittite Empire as a result of the invasion of the Phrygians, some of the Hittites moved to south and south-east Anatolia and established new states. The most important sites of this period are Malatya-Arslantepe, Karkamƒ±≈ü (Carchemish) and Sak√ßag√∂z√º. The 10-domed old bazaar forming the center hall of the museum houses reliefs and statues from Neo-Hittite period. The theme of war is emphasized in the reliefs with soldiers and chariots. Also, rock-cut reliefs portraying the Hittite rulers, the gods of the Hittite pantheon, and statues of powerful animals such as lions and bulls are represented. *Urartian Period (1200-600 BC) : The Urartuans lived in East Anatolia during the same period as the Phrygians. The most important Urartian sites are Altƒ±ntepe, Adilcevaz, Kayalƒ±dere, Patnos, Van, Haykaberd. Urartians made new advances in architecture and mining. *Lydian Period (1200-546 BC) : The origin of Lydian art comes from the Bronze Age in which there were relations, friendly or hostile, between their ancestors and the Hittites. Lydians made spectacular progress in the Iron Age, especially from Gyges period to Croesus (685 to 547 BC). The exhibited artifacts mostly date from the 6th century BC. * Classical Period and Ankara through the ages: The collection includes Greek, Hellenistic, Roman and Byzantine Period artifacts such as statues, jewelry and decorative vessels made of gold, silver, glass, marble, and bronze as well as coins with examples ranging from the first minted money to modern times. In addition, there is a section displaying the finds uncovered recently from Ankara's surroundings.

Life and career  Pieter Klijnveld was born on 16 August 1874 in Amsterdam in the Netherlands. He was the son of Pieter Klijnveld Sr. and Maria Christina Klijnveld. He married Cristina Johanna Royaards on 2 August 1906 in Amsterdam. After working at the Amsterdam office of the Twentsche Bank (a precursor of ABN Amro), he opened a small accountancy practice in 1917 in his home on the Viottastraat. It would take a few years before a second office was in use on the Tesselschadestraat. Amsterdam was a bustling trade and investment hub for European and Asian industrialists. Many foreign enterprises, including royalty, governments, and even the Bank of England, traded extensively in the Netherlands at the time, making it an active market for financiers as well as importers and exporters of virtually everything. Klijnveld became the chief accountant to many of these emerging businesses. To meet the demands of his growing client roster, he teamed up with a local tax firm called Meijburg & Company. One of these accountants was Jaap Kraayenhof, who joined Klynveld and eventually become senior partner of the Dutch firm \\"Klijnveld Kraayenhof & Co.\\", abroad usually written as Klynveld Kraayenhof & Co. (KKC). Klijnveld died just before the liberation of the Netherlands in 1945 and his wife died in September 1947. They had an art collection that included amongst others works by Piet Mondriaan.  Legacy  Specializing in banking and exporting, KKC kept its name and independence by serving Dutch clients who were expanding throughout Europe and South America. In 1979, Klynveld Main Goerdeler (KMG) was formed with the merger of Klynveld Kraayenhof & Company, Deutsche Treuhand-Gesellschaft (DTG), and McLintock Main Lafrentz to create a strong European-based international firm. In 1987, KMG and Peat Marwick International (PMI) combined in the first mega-merger of large accounting firms forming KPMG.

A convicted sorceress, her imprisonment for treasonable necromancy in 1441 was a cause c√©l√®bre. Family Eleanor was daughter of Reginald Cobham, 3rd Baron Sterborough,Both The Complete Peerage and Harris in the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography state Sterborough was then in Surrey 3rd Lord Cobham, and his first wife, Eleanor Culpeper (d. 1422), daughter of Sir Thomas Culpeper, of Rayal. =Mistress and wife to the Duke of Gloucester= In about 1422 Eleanor became a lady-in-waiting to Jacqueline d'Hainault, who, on divorcing John IV, Duke of Brabant, had fled to England in 1421. In 1423, Jacqueline married Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester, the youngest son of King Henry IV, who since the death of his elder brother King Henry V was Lord Protector of the child king Henry VI and a leading member of his council. Gloucester went to France to wrest control of his wife's estates in Hainault. On his return to England in 1425 Eleanor became his mistress. In January 1428, the Duke's marriage to Jacqueline was annulled and he married Eleanor. According to Harrison, \\"Eleanor was beautiful, intelligent, and ambitious and Humphrey was cultivated, pleasure-loving, and famous\\". Over the next few years they were the centre of a small but flamboyant court based at La Plesaunce in Greenwich, surrounded by poets, musicians, scholars, physicians, friends and acolytes. In November 1435, Gloucester placed his whole estate in a jointure with Eleanor and six months later, in April 1436, she was granted the robes of a duchess for the Garter ceremony. In 1435, Gloucester's elder brother, John, Duke of Bedford died, making Humphrey heir presumptive to the English throne. Gloucester also claimed the role of regent, hitherto occupied by his brother, but was opposed in that endeavour by the council. His wife Eleanor had some influence at court and seems to have been liked by Henry VI. Trial and imprisonment J.W.E. Doyle 1864 Eleanor consulted astrologers to try to divine the future. The astrologers Thomas Southwell and Roger Bolingbroke predicted that Henry VI would suffer a life-threatening illness in July or August 1441. When rumours of the prediction reached the king's guardians, they also consulted astrologers who could find no such future illness in their astrological predictions, a comfort for the king, who had been troubled by the rumours. They also followed the rumours to their source and interrogated Southwell, Bolingbroke and John Home (Eleanor's personal confessor), then arrested Southwell and Bolingbroke on charges of treasonable necromancy. Bolingbroke named Eleanor as the instigator but she had fled to sanctuary in Westminster Abbey so could not be tried by the law courts. Hollman, Gemma. Royal Witches: From Joan of Navarre to Elizabeth Woodville. History Press, 2019. The charges against her were possibly exaggerated to curb the ambitions of her husband. Eleanor was examined by a panel of religious men whilst in sanctuary and she denied most of the charges but confessed to obtaining potions from Margery Jourdemayne, \\"the Witch of Eye\\". Her explanation was that they were potions to help her conceive. Eleanor and her fellow conspirators were found guilty. Southwell died in the Tower of London, Bolingbroke was hanged, drawn and quartered, and Jourdemayne was burnt at the stake. Eleanor had to do public penance in London, divorce her husband and was condemned to life imprisonment. In 1442, Eleanor was imprisoned at Chester Castle, then in 1443 moved to Kenilworth Castle. This move may have been prompted by fears that Eleanor was gaining sympathy amongst the Commons, for just a few months prior an unnamed Kentish woman had met with Henry VI at Black Heath and scolded him for his treatment of Eleanor, saying he should bring her home to her husband. The woman was punished by execution. In July 1446 Eleanor was moved to the Isle of Man, and finally in March 1449 to Beaumaris Castle in Anglesey, where she died on 7 July 1452. Children Eleanor's husband Humphrey had two known children, Arthur and Antigone. Sources are divided about whether they were born to Eleanor before the marriage, or were the offspring of an \\"unknown mistress or mistresses\\".. Richardson's many sources and research are outlined within the entries in his book. K.H. Vickers, Alison Weir and Cathy Hartley all suggest that Eleanor was their mother, though other authors treat their maternity as unknown.K.H.

Hogging describes a beam that curves upwards in the middle, and sagging describes a beam that curves downwards. Ships Diagram of ship's hull that is (1) sagging and (2) hogging under loads. Bending is exaggerated for illustrative purposes. =Dynamic stress= Hogging is the stress a ship's hull or keel experiences that causes the center or the keel to bend upward. Sagging is the stress a ship's hull or keel is placed under when a wave is the same length as the ship and the ship is in the trough of two waves. This causes the middle of the ship to bend down slightly, and depending on the level of bend, may cause the hull to snap or crack. Sagging or dynamic hogging may have been what sank the Prestige off Spain on 19 November 2002. The 2013 loss of container ship MOL Comfort off the coast of Yemen was attributed to hogging. Subsequent lawsuits blamed the shipbuilder for design flaws. =Time-induced stress= Hogging, or \\"hog\\", also refers to the semi- permanent bend in the keel, especially in wooden-hulled ships, caused over time by the ship's center's being more buoyant than the bow or stern. At the beginning of her 1992 refit, had over 13 inches (33 cm) of hog. The keel blocks in the drydock were set up especially to support this curve. During her three years in drydock, the center keel blocks were gradually shortened, allowing the hog to settle out. Additionally, the diagonal riders specified in her original design to resist hogging, which had been removed in an earlier refit, were restored. The similar-sized had 36 inches (91 cm) of hog before refitting in the mid-1990s. = Cargo loading = During loading and discharging cargo, ships bend (hog or sag) due to the distribution of the weights in the various holds and tanks on board. The maximum amount of cargo that a vessel can load often depends on whether her Plimsoll mark is submerged or not. Therefore, sagging can reduce her effective cargo capacity ‚Äì especially if her loadline has already been reached prematurely due to the sag. This is taken into account when calculating cargo, by applying what is called a \\"3/4 mean draft\\". This method is also called the \\"two-thirds mean correction\\", directly derived from Simpson's first rule. Structural beams In building construction, the sagging of beams is called \\"deflection\\". The amount of deflection varies, based on the beam's stiffness, the span between supports, and the load it carries. Sagging is a common problem in older houses.

The family is made up of corrupt officials and landowners of Irish descent, who hold absolute power in Basin City. They are the main antagonists in the series, and are frequent catalysts to various plots and storylines. Several of their associates also serve as villains within the stories. History The family founded what would become Basin City during Gold Rush, when a Roark ancestor brought with him a large number of foreign prostitutes to the gold mining camp. The prostitutes were immediately popular, turning a small camp into a thriving city. Over the years, the prostitutes themselves eventually split from the family and formed their own district reserved specifically for prostitution. This red light district would later be known as Old Town. In the time period of the comics, the Roark dynasty is currently thriving, with family members in the United States Senate, an Attorney General and a Cardinal. Family members =Cardinal Roark= Patrick Henry Roark, otherwise known as Cardinal Roark, appears in The Hard Goodbye as the brother of Senator Roark and Attorney General Roark and the uncle of Roark Junior. According to Marv, he was once a doctor and priest serving in the medical corps during either World War II or the Korean War. He earned significant praise as a result and later became a Cardinal, gaining much political influence and extending the corruption within Basin City. Marv also mentioned that the Cardinal's influence is what allowed his brother to become a Senator. While serving the clergy, Cardinal Roark met Kevin, a cannibalistic young serial killer who mutilated and ate Old Town's prostitutes, believing he was devouring their souls. Convinced that Kevin has been spoken to by God, Cardinal Roark shelters him at the Roark family farm outside the city. He also joins in on Kevin's crimes, consuming parts of his victims' corpses. The Old Town prostitute Goldie learns of these shocking crimes and prepares to inform the other prostitutes; she spends a night with Marv to gain his protection, but Cardinal Roark sends in Kevin to murder Goldie, and then frames Marv for the crime. Marv then hunts down several members of the city's underworld to find Goldie's killer, eventually killing Kevin at the farm. In the end, he finally breaks into the Cardinal's bedroom. Cardinal Roark calmly and resignedly explains the story to Marv, who then proceeds to murder him. It is never actually shown how Marv kills him, but it's implied he breaks Roark's jugular with his thumbs. In the 2005 film adaptation, Cardinal Roark was portrayed by Rutger Hauer. Hauer was one of the last actors to be cast, completing his role several months after Mickey Rourke, who portrayed Marv, had finished shooting. The only time they appear on-screen in the same shot is during their final confrontation, which was later edited in post-production utilizing both of their performances. =Kevin= While not an actual member of the Roark family, Kevin nevertheless plays an important role in The Hard Goodbye as the hitman of Cardinal Roark. An intentionally mute serial killer, Kevin hunts down and cannibalizes prostitutes in an attempt to \\"inherit\\" their souls and (he believes) save them from Hell. He confesses these crimes to Cardinal Roark, after which the Cardinal begins to join in with him, believing that they are doing God's work. Goldie soon learns of their rituals and seeks safety with Marv, but Kevin is nevertheless able to find Goldie and kill her. When Marv goes on a violent search for her killer, Kevin is one of his many casualties. Marv knocks out Kevin, feeds most of his body to his hungry pet wolf, and finally beheads him with a hacksaw. Kevin does not utter a sound throughout the torture, dying with a serene smile on his face. Kevin also makes a cameo appearance during the climax of That Yellow Bastard, taking place four years before the events of The Hard Goodbye. As John Hartigan murders Junior's guards, Kevin is seen quietly reading a Bible on the side porch. Kevin was portrayed by Elijah Wood in the film adaptation, who never met Mickey Rourke on-set during filming. As with Hauer, his shots were edited together with Rourke's. =Senator Roark= Senator Ethan Roark is the main antagonist of Sin City. He is a rich and corrupt politician, who largely holds Basin City in his grip. These privileges are inherited by his son, Roark Junior. Senator Roark once beat his wife to death with a baseball bat, for which he was never arrested, even though (by his own admission) he left his fingerprints all over the crime scene. He is the younger brother of Cardinal Patrick Henry Roark; the third brother serves as the US Attorney General (not featured in the story). Senator Roark hopes for his son to one day become President of the United States, but Junior has a serious problem: he enjoys raping and murdering pre-teen girls. Senator Roark frequently uses his police connections to cover up his son's crimes, but when Junior kidnaps 11-year-old Nancy Callahan, Detective John Hartigan intervenes and shoots off Junior's ear, hand, and genitals. Senator Roark then visits Hartigan in the hospital, smugly explaining that he actually has no intention of killing him whatsoever. Instead, he plans to finance Hartigan's medical treatment to keep him alive; his ultimate plan is to frame Hartigan for Junior's crimes while Junior slowly recovers from surgery. He also says that he can and will kill anyone to whom Hartigan tells the truth. Hartigan serves eight years in prison until he finally confesses to Junior's crimes, with the Senator personally appearing at his parole hearing. During these years, the Senator had recourse to alternative medicines in order to heal his son and restore his reproductive organs, to eventually obtain an heir for his dynasty. By the end of the story, Hartigan exacts his revenge on Junior; he then commits suicide, rendering Senator Roark unable to have his own revenge. In the final narration, Hartigan mentions that the Roark family line is ended, and the Senator's plans for a legacy destroyed (though there remains the third Roark brother, the Attorney General, he is not featured and has no visible connections with the city or his brothers, meaning Roark's nephews by him presumably would and could not fulfill Junior's role): Hartigan reflects as he dies that, with the Roarks eliminated, it is more likely that Sin City may one day change for the better. Senator Roark was portrayed by Powers Boothe in the movie. The role was also offered to Christopher Walken and Willem Dafoe, who both turned it down. Boothe reprises his role in the 2014 sequel, where he is the central villain in the two original stories. In \\"The Long Bad Night,\\" he is beaten at a high-stakes poker game by Johnny, a cocky young gambler who Roark realizes is his illegitimate son by an unknown prostitute though Roark contemptuously admits that he will only ever recognize his legitimate son, Roark Jr. After Roark arranges for Johnny's hand to be broken, shoots him in the leg, and kills Johnny's companion Marcie, Roark is challenged again the following night. Johnny defeats Roark again at poker and tells Roark that he will be haunted by the fact that he was beaten twice by the same man; Roark shoots Johnny dead and orders his men to dispose of the gambler's body. In \\"Nancy's Last Dance,\\" Roark is aware that Nancy Callahan seeks to avenge Hartigan's sacrifice by killing him, but dismisses her as an actual threat despite wishing to kill her for her role in Roark Jr's death. Nancy, with the aid of Marv, is able to break into Roark's estate, where he gains the advantage after shooting her several times. However, Roark is distracted by a shade of Hartigan, allowing Nancy to recover and kill Roark. =Roark Junior= Ethan Roark Junior, later known as the Yellow Bastard, is the son of Senator Roark and nephew of Cardinal Roark. His public profile is that of a handsome young playboy; he is in fact a sadistic pedophile who rapes and murders pre-pubescent girls. (It's implied that he \\"came by his proclivities honestly\\" at the Roark family farm.) These atrocities are frequently covered up by his father and the Basin City police department, but Detective John Hartigan is nevertheless determined to bring him to justice. When Junior kidnaps the 11-year-old Nancy Callahan, intent on making her his fourth victim, Hartigan pursues him and kills his thugs before shooting Junior himself, blowing off his hand, his ear, and his genitals. Junior lapses into a coma as a result of these traumatic injuries. As Junior undergoes years of surgeries to repair his limbs and genitals, Hartigan is framed for Junior's crimes and serves eight years in prison. The surgeries leave Junior horribly disfigured; he now has bright yellow skin and emits a disgusting stench. His disfigurements do not prevent him from killing, however; during the eight years Hartigan is imprisoned, Junior rapes dozens of little girls. When Hartigan is freed from prison, Junior follows him to Kadie's Bar, where a 19-year-old Nancy is working as a stripper. Hartigan wounds him in the neck as he follows them to a local motel, but he nevertheless bursts in, kidnaps Nancy and leaves Hartigan to die with his neck in a noose. Junior takes Nancy to the Roark farm and begins lashing her with a whip, trying to make her scream before he rapes and kills her. However, Nancy refuses to scream during the torture, as she realizes that Junior is impotent unless he hears the victim's cries of pain. At this moment, Hartigan arrives and stabs Junior in the chest before tearing off his genitals a second time -- this time with his bare hands -- and smashing his head into a bloody yellow pulp. In the film, Junior was played by Nick Stahl, who also appears in flashbacks in the sequel, Sin City: A Dame to Kill For. In the latter film, his first name is revealed to be Ethan. In the comics, however, he has no first name and is referred to only as Roark Junior, Junior, or That Yellow Bastard. =Attorney General Roark= Attorney General Roark is the third unseen Roark brother that so far has not appeared in any Sin City stories. The Farm The Roark family's farm is located on the corner of North Cross and Lennox, in an area of open farmland bordered by woods; it appears in several stories, including The Hard Goodbye, That Yellow Bastard, The Babe Wore Red and Hell and Back. As well as many previous generations of the family, it was also home to Kevin since at least four years before the events of The Hard Goodbye; he is seen living there during the climax of That Yellow Bastard. It is suggested by Hartigan that the deviant behavior of Junior and Kevin has been going on at the Farm for generations, as every cop in Basin City knows better than to stray too close to it. The Farm consists of the following buildings and areas:- *Farmhouse - the main building, containing the living quarters. The basement contains a tiled room where Kevin kept the heads of his female victims mounted on the wall. This part of the farm was partially destroyed when Marv threw a petrol bomb through the window to smoke out Kevin. *Barn - An old wooden barn with a hayloft and sliding doors. This is where Hartigan and Junior have their final confrontation in That Yellow Bastard, and where Wallace finds a nude and partially brainwashed Esther at the conclusion of Hell and Back. *A grain silo. *A workshed. *A deserted farmyard. There is no obvious evidence of any traditional agriculture occurring here in what has to have been years, despite the presence of a tractor. There is also a wood pile and chopping block with a hatchet embedded there, which Marv later takes as a weapon (see below). *The Woods - Heavy woodland that borders the Farm and the roads leading up to it. The trees here are gnarled and twisted and the atmosphere is unsettling. Both Marv (in The Hard Goodbye) and Hartigan (in That Yellow Bastard) sneak up to the Farm through the Woods, having driven up to a short distance from the road entrance, and Dwight defeats Fat Man and Little Boy here during The Babe Wore Red. When Marv first passed through the Woods, he found them very disturbing, and his instincts told him at once that bad things had gone on at the Farm; by his second and final time at the Farm, however, he was no longer afraid and proceeded to use the Woods to his physical and tactical advantage during his duel with Kevin. When Hartigan passes through, during heavy snow, he suffers what he thinks is another bout of angina, even though he was supposed to be cured of it. = Battles = The following battles have also occurred at the Farm: *Hartigan vs. Armed Cops/Guards - That Yellow Bastard (Hartigan is armed with a switchblade, and several guns. He stealthily kills two of them with the switchblade and the other two with the Beretta and the P22.) *Hartigan vs. Yellow Bastard/Roark Junior - That Yellow Bastard (Hartigan, whilst suffering a fake heart-attack, staggers into the barn where he is confronted and mocked by Junior. He then collapses and as Junior moves in on him, pulls out a switchblade and stabs him. He then castrates him with his bare hands before pounding his head into the floorboards, finally killing him. *Wallace and Jerry vs. Enemy Helicopter - Hell and Back (Wallace is prepared for this by wearing a Kevlar vest which shields him and Esther, whom he arrived to rescue. The helicopter is shot out of the sky by Jerry, armed with a TOW missile). *Marv vs. Kevin - The Hard Goodbye (Despite Marv's brute strength and durability, Kevin gets the drop on him and disarms/blinds him with his sharp fingernails before knocking him out with a sledgehammer). *Marv vs. Armed Cops - The Hard Goodbye (Marv manages to wipe out a whole squad of heavily armed cops whilst armed only with a hatchet). *Marv vs. Kevin II - The Hard Goodbye (Marv manages to trap Kevin, handcuff himself to him and knock him out with one punch, before proceeding to methodically dismember Kevin with a hacksaw). *Dwight vs. Fat Man and Little Boy - The Babe Wore Red (Dwight and the 'babe' are chased to the farm, where, upon being cornered, Dwight subdues them by hand and feet, before shooting them in the legs).

The AED1.8 billion complex features a 1,608-room hotel run by Marriott International. History This project, owned by The Emirates Group, was originally conceived as a single, , 77-storey tower intended to be completed in 2008 and built alongside the Sheikh Zayed Road. However, its design and location had to be changed because of the construction of a creek extension belonging to the Business Bay megaproject. The new twin-tower design was launched at the Arabian Travel Market in Dubai in 2006 with towers. However, the shape of the towers was modified and the height decreased to in a later redesign. The concrete structural frames of both towers topped out in April 2010. By April 2011, the spires on both towers had been added and the outer structure of both towers almost completed. The buildings were completed in 2012, surpassing the Rose Rayhaan by Rotana as the world's tallest hotel. With the first tower open, the hotel comprises 14 food and beverage outlets, rooftop bars, a business center, conference halls and meeting rooms, an extensive banquet hall, a spa and health club, as well as retail outlets, a swimming pool, and a gymnasium. The 2B+G+82 storey twin towers were completed in November 2012. The hotel has 1364 standard guest rooms, 240 suites, 4 \\"presidential suites\\", a banquet hall, an auditorium, 18 Shops, 19 restaurants and a spa. The form is inspired by the date palm. The towers are symmetrically placed on the 7-storey high podium to get views of the Burj Khalifa, Business Bay and the sea. The podium houses all the public areas, restaurants, banquet hall and back of house areas. The entrance lobby is 4 floors high and overlooks the Business Bay. The 1000-capacity banquet hall has an independent access. The podium terrace has one of the largest spas in Dubai and is landscaped with gardens and swimming pool.

It was endemic at the Lago de Atitl√°n in Guatemala at an altitude of 1700 m asl. It was described in 1929 by Ludlow Griscom based on a specimen collected in 1926 and had been overlooked in the past. American ecologist Anne LaBastille observed the decline of this species over a period of 25 years. It was declared extinct by 1990.  Description  The Atitl√°n grebe reached a length of about 46‚Äì50 cm. The call and appearance were similar to the much smaller pied-billed grebe. The bill was large and pied but the color varied from white in the spring to brown in other seasons. The plumage was mainly dark brown with white-flecked flanks and grey on the ears. The underparts were dark grey flecked with white. The head was almost black and the neck was glossy flecked with dark brown in the spring and white in the winter. The legs were slaty grey. The bill had a bold black vertical band in the middle. The irises were brown. It had small wings and was flightless.  Reproduction  They laid a clutch of 4 to 5 white eggs. Both parents shared the rearing of the hatchlings. Extinction The decline of the Atitl√°n grebe began in 1958 and again in 1960 after smallmouth bass (Micropterus dolomieu) and largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) were introduced into Lake Atitl√°n. These invasive species reduced the crabs and fish which the grebes depended on for food and the fish even killed the grebe chicks. The population of the Atitl√°n grebe declined from 200 individuals in 1960 to 80 in 1965. Thanks to the conservation efforts of Anne LaBastille, in 1966 a refuge was established where this species was able to rebound. The population recovered to 210 in 1973. Unfortunately after the 1976 Guatemala earthquake, the lake bed fractured. An underwater drain led to a fall of the water level and to a further severe decrease of the number of grebes. In 1983 only 32 individuals were left, of which the largest part were hybrids with the pied-billed grebe. The last two birds were seen in 1989, and after they disappeared the Atitl√°n grebe was declared officially extinct.

Soviet postage stamp Biography A peasant's son, Shubin was born in a Pomor village near Kholmogory and, inspired by the example of his neighbour Mikhail Lomonosov, he walked all the way to St Petersburg at the age of 18. Lomonosov took notice of his talent in walrus ivory carving (a folkcraft traditionally practised in Kholmogory) and helped him join the newly established Imperial Academy of Arts, where his instructor, Nicolas-Fran√ßois Gillet, was so impressed with his abilities that he had Shubin awarded with a gold medal, which opened to him the prospect of furthering his education abroad. Through the help of Falconet, in 1767 he joined the Paris atelier of the great Pigalle, before moving to Rome three years later. Upon his return to Russia in 1772, Shubin became the most fashionable and sought-after sculptor in the country. In the 1770s and 1780s, he executed numerous pieces for the Marble Palace and the Alexandro-Nevsky Lavra, designed 58 medallions representing all the Russian sovereigns from Rurik onward, and was admitted into the Academy of Arts as an academician. The intrigues of his rivals undermined his career, however. He remained destitute until 1794, when the Academy eventually bestowed a professorship on him. A plaster copy of an early Shubin bust of Tsar Alexander I is housed at Thomas Jefferson's house Monticello in Albemarle County, Virginia. The original Shubin work was a gift from the American consul general at St. Petersburg, Levett Harris, in 1804. Shubin's original work given by Harris to Jefferson was lost. Shubin's portrait of Tsar Alexander is in the collection of the Voronezh Museum of Plastic Arts in Voronezh, Russia. The plaster copy, executed in 1955, is housed in the parlor at Monticello.

Premise  Loot systems exist solely because of the game mechanics of popular massively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPGs). One of the primary objectives in this genre of game is to improve one's character, the representation of the player in the virtual world. The common ways to do this involve obtaining experience or by upgrading the items the character uses. In the most popular MMORPGs, such as EverQuest or World of Warcraft, much of a player's improvement must come from looted items because the amount of experience a player can obtain has a hard limit. Herein lies the dilemma: One mechanism by which loot is obtained is the completion of content built by the game developer. This often occurs by defeating a difficult non-player entity, or \\"mob\\". However, since MMORPGs are meant to reward players who work together, several players often desire a particular piece of loot that has been rewarded (or \\"dropped\\"). A loot system attempts to provide a fair and equitable method for players to decide who gets what.  Classes  There are obviously multiple ways in which this decision can be made. Systems range from a reflex based, first come first served method to an almost dictatorship-like system where the appointed leader of the group awards the loot to players he or she feels deserve it. However, most players enjoy a system that gives equal chance to all who were involved and removes any real or perceived favoritism from the decision. = \\"First Come First Served\\" = The most simple loot system is one of anarchy. The players who have the fastest reflexes to perform the action necessary to receive the loot do so. This has several obvious downfalls which tends to aggravate players: *Reaction time is often hindered by outside forces such as lag or other game mechanics. *It can ruin the cooperative nature that many players enjoy about this genre. = Random Number Generation Based Loot Systems = The overwhelmingly most used loot system class is one where the decision on which player receives which items is completely based on a public random number generator. This type of system completely removes all human input from the decision, and gives an obvious statistically equal chance to those players involved. Using random number generators for the basis of a loot system is so common that many games have coded the system directly into the game experience to expedite the process. Due to the similarity between using a random number generator and rolling a die (or set of dice) the process is referred to as \\"rolling\\" and the act of \\"rolling for loot\\" is the process by which players are assigned a number by the random number generator which determines if they will obtain the desired items.  Pure Random  A very simple random system which just assigns the loot to a random player in the group regardless of any other factors. This variant is a common method for distributing loot that has only monetary value (\\"trash loot\\") and is often coded into the game. It is not usually used for items which players might equip, due to game mechanics.  \\"Need Before Greed\\"  The vast majority of MMORPG games have some sort of class system, where each player can choose a class which allows them certain skills, as well as placing certain restrictions on which items the player can use. Players of a certain class also prefer items which have attributes which improve statistics which give benefit to the primary skills of their class. Thus, each player often does not desire the same item, as a group of players generally has several of these classes in its makeup. However, many items also have some value in the in-game currency, so there is often some interest in the item from all players involved. The \\"Need Before Greed\\" system allows players who will make the most use of the items have priority over those who only desire the item for its monetary value, such that only the subset of players who will benefit the most are allowed to \\"roll\\" for the item. If no players desire the item, then a pure random system is used to determine who obtains the item for its monetary value. This system can be very straightforward and simple, especially in smaller groups of players where perhaps only two or three players desire the same item. However, this system also has some perceived downfalls which tend to aggravate players: *Deciding \\"Need\\" can be a difficult task due to the different playstyles and overlapping class needs and restrictions that exist in game mechanics. This can (and does) cause heated debates about which player receives the most benefit from an item. *Players can deceive other players in the group about their need, when they really desire the item for its monetary value. *No consideration is given to players who have completed the content many times compared to players who have only completed the content a few times. *There is no cost involved in the act of rolling, nor any influence on the ability to get loot in the future, so there is little reason not to attempt to obtain any item you could reasonably use. These perceived downfalls often cause various extra restrictions to be placed on the system such as: *Democratic decisions on which player has the most \\"need\\". *Restrictions on the number of items a player can get during one time period. = Point-based systems = Point based loot systems have arisen for a number of reasons. The first is that players feel that their previous attempts and completion of the content that contains the loot they desire should somehow determine their priority over other players, which is obviously impossible in a random system due to memorylessness. Players also often feel that items should go to the player that has a high amount of desire for it, something impossible to quantify in a random based loot system. Lastly, a common game mechanic is to place the most highly desired items in content that requires very large amounts of both time and personnel to master and complete, meaning that players are even more aggravated by the downfalls of a random based system as described earlier. Since statistically, over time, all players will move towards receiving the items they want, point based systems do not determine anything but the order in which the players get the items. Common problems with point based system problems include: *Point inflation - points are earned faster than they can be spent, meaning that less frequent participants can never hope to catch the top point holders. *Collusion - some systems are vulnerable to players colluding with one another to gain advantage over other players. *Dealing with unwanted items.  Earning points  Obviously to be able to spend points, there must exist a method of earning them. There are two main methods of obtaining points in a point based loot system, time based and content completion based. These two systems are often modified in a variety of ways, usually to reward (or demerit) players for certain behaviors or to provide incentives them to participate in certain content. Regardless of the method, the players are rewarded for participation in the content so that players who participate most frequently obtain a larger ratio of the loot obtained, or perhaps more correctly, a larger ratio of the total \\"desirability pool\\" of the content. = Content completion point earning = Often there are milestones in the content players participate in. The system rewards point rewards for certain milestones, regardless of the amount of time required to reach them. Points of Consideration *Encourages quick completion of content as it will increase the points/time ratio for all involved. *Allows content leaders to award larger point values for certain milestones. *Can cause low incentive to learn new content, as the points/time ratio can be very low if the content has a steep learning curve. *Content is not required to abide by a time schedule and players who can simply stay longer are rewarded for poor planning on the part of the leader. = Time-based point earning = In this method, points are simply awarded for the amount of time the player chooses to participate in the content. Points of Consideration *Purely time based point earning rewards players who participate in content before it has been mastered as they receive full value for their time, even if little content is being completed. This encourages players to come and help learn content at an early stage, rather than waiting until others have done the (often difficult) task of mastering the content. *Can allow content leaders to simply schedule a set time for content participation, only awarding points for the time window set for the content. *Does not inherently encourage speedy completion of content as there is a fixed point/time ratio.  Converting points into items  The largest differential between the various point based loot systems is the method by which points are converted into items, or priority to receive items. These systems can be described as three subsets, fixed cost, auction bid, and constrained bid. = Fixed-cost = A fixed cost system (or \\"purchase system\\") is one where each item that has a statistical chance to drop in the content the players are currently participating in has been assigned a point value. These values can be derived in a number of ways, from gauging desire for the item compared to its probability of dropping (simple supply and demand) to a method based on the attributes of the item. In this way items are purchased with some created currency that players can earn. Since each item no longer has zero cost to each player, players now must consider the opportunity cost of the item, as it will impact their ability to obtain other items. Points of Consideration *Each player pays the same cost for the item regardless of when it is received, meaning that players who participate less do not have a better points/loot ratio than players who participate more frequently. *If multiple players can afford to pay the cost for the item, another system (such as a random loot system) must be used to determine which player will receive the item. *Players must decide what cost to assign each item, meaning that human bias enters the system. *Collusion between players is not possible as the cost for each item is fixed. = Auction bid = In an auction bid system players can bid any amount of their current points on an item. The bids can be made public or done in secret, depending on the variant of the system. Much like a fixed-cost system each item now has a non-zero cost to the player, but now the cost of each item is purely dependent on the market forces created by the player pool which desires the item, rather than an artificial system which can be open to discussion. Points of Consideration *Bid collusion between bidders is possible in some cases, due to game mechanics. Often, some items are only usable by a very small subset of players, while other items by a larger subset. If players in the small subset all agree to bid low on those items, that gives them an advantage on items in a larger subset. *On average the cost of each duplicate/similar item received is lower, as the subset of the players who desire the item gets smaller. Thus players who participate less frequently will on average have a better loot/time ratio. *Private auctions could be tainted by collusion between the auctioneer/content leader and specific players. = Constrained bid = In a constrained bid system players are forced to bid a certain fraction of their current points. Thus this system is inherently different from a fixed-cost or auction bid system in that points don't determine purchasing power as much as they do a player's ability to exercise priority over another player. Points only serve to quantify how many places \\"in line\\" a player loses for receiving an item or gains for participating in content. Points of Consideration *Bid collusion is not possible since players cannot choose the size of their bid. *Low desirability items may not get any bids, since the bid is fixed. *By choosing the size of the constrained-bid content leaders can encourage a certain loot distribution. *Players can choose to save points to receive first priority on a highly desirable item at a large cost, or bid often and receive multiple lesser desirability items for lesser cost. = In-game currency-based loot system = An alternative to a points based loot system is an in-game currency based loot system. Participants pay for items with virtual currency instead of with an arbitrary set of points. The currency paid may then be split among those members in attendance. This includes the buyer if he/she helped. Like a points system, those that attend a higher percentage of events will have earned more currency and, therefore, have more to spend in the open market system or at future group events on loot. Currency based systems offer maximum freedom for individual players over the course of their current game. As loot is accumulated, players may bid in-game currency on loot, with the loot going to the highest bidder. Some groups may accept a mixture of sellable loot and currency as a bid. Some argue that bids this way can be forced up artificially by false bidders. In practice this tends to not be the case, as those that wish to push up the bid realize they have a chance of actually winning an item they do not desire, thus losing an inflated amount of money through no one's fault but their own. Points of Consideration *Bid collusion is possible if bids are done in private. Public bidding is recommended. *When the values of specific loot falls, players can move on to higher valued loot to maximize their payday. This is a way of following demand, rather than dictations. *Individual players are always free to donate their time and work free of charge.  Systems in use  There are many loot systems in current use, this list is not comprehensive. *DKP - The name DKP really refers to a set of loot systems, variants of which fall under several of the categories outlined above. The common thread that exists for all DKP is that points are earned via content completion and that each player has a point total that can be spent in some manner on items. The list of variants is summarized here. ** Basic DKP - simple auction bid system ** Zero-Sum DKP - a fixed cost system that removes point inflation by giving all participants an equal fraction of the points spent on an item by a single participant. ** Spend-all DKP - a constrained bid system where the only allowed bid is all points. ** Spend-enough DKP - a constrained bid system where the only allowed bid is 1 more than the next eligible player's point total. ** Probabilistic DKP - a hybrid between a fixed cost and a random number generator system where points are used to weight the statistical chance the players will receive an item. *gold DKP - an example description of an In-game Currency Based loot system. *Shroud Loot System (SLS) is a time-based point-earning, constrained bid system. SLS uses a half point bid but also allows a small fixed cost bid to be placed on items, to ensure that even items of low desirability are distributed. This system allows frequent participants to receive items first, but at a worse loot/time ratio than less frequent participants. *Ladder/Reel is a constrained-bid system that doesn't use points. Players simply take turns having top priority. Very similar in distribution method to a Spend-all DKP system. Suicide Kings is an example of a Ladder/Reel system.

Population: Name The name Miass is taken from the Bashkirs (), the indigenous inhabitants of these places. History A building in Miass It was founded in 1773 as a copper mining factory. During the 19th century, the development was driven by the discovery of the richest gold deposits in the Urals. Average annual extraction of gold from the Miass region was about . In the mid-19th century, the volume of gold mining went down, and the development of Miass also slowed. Town status was granted to Miass in 1923. In 1941, an automobile factory (which still operates as UralAZ) was built. Administrative and municipal status Within the framework of administrative divisions, it is, together with twenty-eight rural localities, incorporated as the City of Miass‚Äîan administrative unit with the status equal to that of the districts.Resolution #161 As a municipal division, the City of Miass is incorporated as Miassky Urban Okrug.

Overview The traditional kernel categories are monolithic kernels and microkernels (with nanokernels and exokernels seen as more extreme versions of microkernels). The \\"hybrid\\" category is controversial, due to the similarity of hybrid kernels and ordinary monolithic kernels; the term has been dismissed by Linus Torvalds as simple marketing. The idea behind a hybrid kernel is to have a kernel structure similar to that of a microkernel, but to implement that structure in the manner of a monolithic kernel. In contrast to a microkernel, all (or nearly all) operating system services in a hybrid kernel are still in kernel space. There are none of the reliability benefits of having services in user space, as with a microkernel. However, just as with an ordinary monolithic kernel, there is none of the performance overhead for message passing and context switching between kernel and user mode that normally comes with a microkernel. Examples =NT kernel= The Windows NT operating system family's architecture consists of two layers (user mode and kernel mode), with many different modules within both of these layers. One prominent example of a hybrid kernel is the Microsoft Windows NT kernel that powers all operating systems in the Windows NT family, up to and including Windows 10 and Windows Server 2019, and powers Windows Phone 8, Windows Phone 8.1, and Xbox One. NT- based Windows is classified as a hybrid kernel (or a macrokernel) rather than a monolithic kernel because the emulation subsystems run in user-mode server processes, rather than in kernel mode as on a monolithic kernel, and further because of the large number of design goals which resemble design goals of Mach (in particular the separation of OS personalities from a general kernel design). Conversely, the reason NT is not a microkernel system is because most of the system components run in the same address space as the kernel, as would be the case with a monolithic design (in a traditional monolithic design, there would not be a microkernel per se, but the kernel would implement broadly similar functionality to NT's microkernel and kernel-mode subsystems). The primary operating system personality on Windows is the Windows API, which is always present. The emulation subsystem which implements the Windows personality is called the Client/Server Runtime Subsystem (csrss.exe). On versions of NT prior to 4.0, this subsystem process also contained the window manager, graphics device interface and graphics device drivers. For performance reasons, however, in version 4.0 and later, these modules (which are often implemented in user mode even on monolithic systems, especially those designed without internal graphics support) run as a kernel-mode subsystem. Applications that run on NT are written to one of the OS personalities (usually the Windows API), and not to the native NT API for which documentation is not publicly available (with the exception of routines used in device driver development). An OS personality is implemented via a set of user-mode DLLs (see Dynamic-link library), which are mapped into application processes' address spaces as required, together with an emulation subsystem server process (as described previously). Applications access system services by calling into the OS personality DLLs mapped into their address spaces, which in turn call into the NT run-time library (ntdll.dll), also mapped into the process address space. The NT run-time library services these requests by trapping into kernel mode to either call kernel-mode Executive routines or make Local Procedure Calls (LPCs) to the appropriate user-mode subsystem server processes, which in turn use the NT API to communicate with application processes, the kernel-mode subsystems and each other. The XNU Kernel =XNU kernel= XNU is the kernel that Apple Inc. acquired and developed for use in the macOS, iOS, watchOS, and tvOS operating systems and released as free and open source software as part of the Darwin operating system. XNU is an acronym for X is Not Unix. Originally developed by NeXT for the NeXTSTEP operating system, XNU was a hybrid kernel combining version 2.5 of the Mach kernel developed at Carnegie Mellon University with components from 4.3BSD and an object-oriented API for writing drivers called Driver Kit. After Apple acquired NeXT, the Mach component was upgraded to OSFMK 7.3, which is a microkernel. Apple uses a heavily modified OSFMK 7.3 functioning as a hybrid kernel with parts of FreeBSD included. (OSFMK 7.3 includes applicable code from the University of Utah Mach 4 kernel and applicable code from the many Mach 3.0 variants that sprouted off from the original Carnegie Mellon University Mach 3.0 kernel.) The BSD components were upgraded with code from the FreeBSD project and the Driver Kit was replaced with a C++ API for writing drivers called I/O Kit. Description Like some other modern kernels, XNU is a hybrid, containing features of both monolithic and microkernels, attempting to make the best use of both technologies, such as the message passing capability of microkernels enabling greater modularity and larger portions of the OS to benefit from protected memory, as well as retaining the speed of monolithic kernels for certain critical tasks.

A Biography. Rehovot: Balaban, 1997; . Early life Adler was born in 1895 in Kerelits (Karelichy), then in the Russian Empire, now in Belarus. In 1900, he and his family moved to England and they settled in Leeds. He studied at University of Leeds and the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine. One of his brothers was Solomon Adler, the economist. Career Werner Braun From 1917 until 1920, Adler served in the Royal Army Medical Corps, attaining the rank of Captain, serving in the Middle East, where he developed his first taste into research into tropical medicine, which he commenced studying after his military service, initially in Liverpool. In 1921, Adler went to Sierra Leone to conduct research into Malaria. In 1924, Chaim Weizmann offered him a job in Jerusalem to develop the new Institute of Microbiology. Later that year, he emigrated to Mandate Palestine and started working in Hadassah Hospital, becoming director of the department of parasitology in 1927. In 1924, he became Assistant Professor of the Department of Parasitology at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, serving as Professor from 1928 to 1955. In 1930, in conjunction with Israel Aharoni, Adler had three Syrian hamsters brought back from Syria and successfully bred them as laboratory animals. This led to the domestication of the Syrian hamster. In the 1940s he was a leader in developing a leishmaniasis vaccine using live parasites, a practice widespread in Israel and Russia until the 1980s, when large-scale clinical trials showed that the practice led to long-term skin lesions, exacerbation of psoriasis, and immunosuppression in some people.

Biography Moses Blackman (known as Morris) was born in Cape Town on 6 December 1908, the son of Esther (n√©e Oshry) and Rabbi Joseph Blackman. His early school years were in Upington; he then attended Victoria Boys High School when the family moved to Grahamstown in 1921. When matriculating in 1925 Blackman gained the only scholarship to nearby Rhodes University, where he concentrated on physics, mathematics, applied mathematics and German. He achieved firsts in maths, physics and German. He continued with an MSc in physics, again being awarded a first. He then spent a year as a demonstrator, building up his funds, before following his teachers‚Äô advice and moving to the University of G√∂ttingen in March 1931. Max Born took him on as a research student. By March 1933 he had written up his work on the Raman spectrum of rock salt, just as Hitler was coming to power, and was awarded the DPhil degree by his external examiner, Werner Heisenberg. Backman returned to England in 1933, having won a fellowship to Imperial College, where he joined Sydney Chapman‚Äôs Mathematics Department. Here, he worked on lattice theory for two years, after which he was awarded a PhD, his second doctorate. Blackman then succeeded in obtaining an industrial research senior research award from the DSIR, enabling to undertake research in Cambridge and register for a third doctorate. He worked on the detail of the Born-von Karman crystal lattice, resulting in another PhD. He was very soon invited back to Imperial College by George Thomson. He joined the Physics Department as an assistant lecturer in 1937, and was soon seen as the theoretical physicist of the Department. In the late 1930s Thomson was investigating the possibility of achieving a sustained chain reaction of uranium fission by neutrons. Blackman was one of several people involved, and contributed by making theoretical calculations concerned with neutron diffusion. The work resulted in his being appointed to serve on the British Committee on Atomic Energy during 1940 and 1941. Later, from 1942 to 1945, he carried out scientific work for the Ministry of Home Security mainly involving the properties of foams used in fire-fighting; some of the work ws published after the war.For example After the war, Blackman turned his attention to electron diffraction. ‚ÄúUnder Blackman‚Äôs leadership the electron diffraction group flourished for many years, and a total of about 20 research students completed doctorates between 1949 and 1977.‚Äù He was appointed to a personal chair in electron physics at Imperial College in 1959, and elected to Fellowship of the Royal Society in 1962. He retired in 1976, but was appointed a Senior Research Fellow. This gave him the freedom to take up another interest: the magnetism of lodestone; his last publications were on this subject. During his career Blackman was a member of the International Commission on Electron Diffraction, 1957‚Äì66, and of the Safety in Mines Research Advisory Board, Ministry of Power, 1963-74. =Family= Moses Blackman married Anne Olivia Warburton (n√©e Court), a former stenographer from Sydney, in 1959. The marriage was terminated a few years later. At the time of his death, on 3 June 1983, he lived at 48, Garden Royal, Kersfield Road, Putney.

As Ab grows older, he helps the tribe kill a marauding sabre-tooth tiger, leads his people in a great battle against an invading tribe, and eventually becomes the leader of the cave men, and the patriarch of a large personal family. Ab is used by the author to support his contention that there was no sharp division between the Paleolithic and Neolithic periods, that man learned to make fine, polished tools and weapons gradually and naturally, as Ab does. During his life Ab invents and perfects the bow and arrow, and is the first of the primitives to domesticate wolves as pets.

In the historic divisions of local administration, Firhouse is in the civil parish of Tallaght and the barony of Uppercross. Location and access =Location= Firhouse is located between Knocklyon, Ballycullen, and Tallaght, close to the foothills of the Dublin Mountains, in an area that was predominantly rural a few decades ago. It is situated on the eastern bank of the River Dodder, just upriver from Templeogue (2 km from the village) and similarly located with regard to Tallaght district (and 2 km downstream from Tallaght village). Modern development only began in recent decades, although there were previously a number of mills and the two hamlets. The Eircode routing code for Firhouse starts with D24, which reflects the district's location in the Dublin 24 postal district. =Access= Firhouse is located by Junction 12 on the M50 motorway and is also served by the Firhouse Road and Killinniny Road. Several Dublin Bus routes reach the area, including the 175,15, 49, 65B and 75, and night buses 49N and 15N. Etymology The origin of the place-name derives from the Irish(Gaelic) word 'Teach an Gi√∫ise' - meaning 'The house of fir' or as it was named: Firhouse. This name came from what was previously the wild forest of fir trees that Firhouse once was. It may also come from a manor that was located at the top of the laneway joining Scoil Treasa and Scoil Carmel. Like much of the rest of the area, this laneway, which led up to the main house, was lined with fir trees.) The Irish place-name is 'Teach an Gi√∫ise' ((Chak on gyioo-sha)). Among the local population, the pronunciation of Firhouse is as contentious an issue as the origin of the name, some using \\"Fir\\" and some \\"Fur\\", though the use on historical maps, which tended to capture phonetic spellings, of \\"Furhouse\\", suggests the probable form. History Firhouse was historically the site of a small rural settlement near the river bank, and another, Upper Firhouse, nearby. Firhouse lay within the townland of Knocklyon, and was owned, over time, by Walter de Ridelford, and later families including the Burnells, the Bathes, the Nugents and the Talbots, eventually being sold by the Duke of Wharton to the famous Speaker Conolly. In the 14th century, a weir, the City Weir or Great Weir, was made in the Dodder there, named for Balrothery, the district on the north bank opposite, and much of the Dodder's water was diverted to the course of the River Poddle, to supply the then-small Dublin city. In the early 1800s, Handcock referred to \\"a small dirty village, principally inhabited by stonebreakers.\\"Dublin, 1889: Handcock, George Domville: \\"The History and Antiquities of Tallaght in the County of Dublin\\", 2nd edition, Chapter 17 While there was no bridge near in a south westerly direction until the 20th century, a bridge was made just north of the village. The settlement grew further in the 19th century, and a number of mills existed in the vicinity, including a paper mill across the river.Dublin, 1889: Handcock, George Domville: \\"The History and Antiquities of Tallaght in the County of Dublin\\", 2nd edition By the 1910s, the village already extended for half a mile, with a school, church, convent, public house and two smithies,Dublin, Ordnance Survey Office: Ordnance Survey Mapping, 1911 and 1935 editions but the population remained small until suburban development began in the 1960s and 1970s. =Historical account= A brief history of Firhouse (as \\"Fir-house\\") is included in \\"The History and Antiquities of Tallaght in the County of Dublin\\", a comprehensive account of the large historic ecclesiastical and later civil parish of Tallaght. Handcock in fact refers to two villages of Fir-house, the main settlement and another he calls \\"the village of Upper Fir-house.\\" The scholar Gerry Smyth has written a cultural history of Firhouse in his book Space and the Irish Cultural Imagination.'The Location of Criticism, or, Putting the \\"I\\" into Ireland', in Gerry Smyth, Space and the Irish Cultural Imagination (Basingstoke: Palgrave, 2001), pp. 93-129 =The Kearneys= Firhouse was the site, in 1816, of the hanging of the Kearneys, a father and two sons. Following the disappearance of gamekeeper John Kinlen, a bloody axe was found near the Kearneys' pub in Firhouse and they were convicted of the killing. A gallows was built at the scene of the crime, outside their pub, for their hanging. When the son, William, fell through the gallows, it was discovered that he was too tall to be strangled by the rope around his neck, so a hole was dug under the gallows, the hangman then pulled down on his legs and held onto him until he was dead.The History Show, RT√â Radio One 12 June 2011, \\"Public executions through history\\" No public reference to this bloody incident can be found in modern Firhouse. Politics Firhouse is in the Firhouse-Bohernabreena electoral area of South Dublin County Council, and the Dail Eireann constituency of Dublin South-West. Amenities There are two community centres, Firhouse Community and Sports Complex, which is home to various sporting teams, as well as the local Scouting Den, and The Park Community Centre in Ballycragh Park. Firhouse also has one main shopping centre, Firhouse Shopping Centre, anchored by a supermarket. There is also a local Credit Union, a post office and a Chinese restaurant, while the local pubs are Scholars, The Speaker Conolly and Mortons, The Firhouse Inn.

Education Local primary schools are Scoil Carmel (a Junior National School), Scoil Treasa, Holy Rosary, Firhouse Educate Together National School, Gaelscoil na Giuise and there is also a second-level school, Firhouse Community College. =Scoil Carmel and Scoil Treasa = These are National Schools, Scoil Carmel having Junior Infants - Second Class, thus ranging in age from 4 to 8, while Scoil Treasa Third Class - Sixth Class takes 8 to 12 year olds. =Gaelscoil na Gi√∫ise= Gaelscoil na Gi√∫ise is a multi- denominational, co-educational Irish language primary school, opened in September 2013. The school is located off Ballycullen Drive and Killininny Road, in a purpose-built 16-classroom building, including a 2-classroom Special Needs Unit. =Firhouse Educate Together National School= FETNS, an Educate Together school, opened its doors in September 2013 for Junior Infants. =Firhouse Community College= The college was established in 1982 and currently has around 700 students and 60 staff members. The school contains a theatre, physical education hall, a multi-sport arena and a large playing field which is around 800m long and is used for soccer and rugby matches. The school's 4th years go on a school trip to Delphi, an adventure centre in Mayo. They also perform an annual play. Previous plays include Romeo & Juliet, Playboy of the Western World, Macbeth, Hamlet, The Wiz, Smike, Seven Brides for Seven Brothers and Grease. There is also a school website: http://www.firhousecommunitycollege.ie/ Firhouse College Religion There is a Roman Catholic parish entitled Parish of Firhouse which stretches out as far as Hunterswood and has a church named Our Lady of Mount Carmel. Various regions of Firhouse belong to the Parish of Ballyboden. Bohernabreena Parish also takes up much of the area, with a church in the mountains and another in Holy Rosary school. Historically the broad area was part of the large post- Penal Law parish of Rathfarnham. Adjacent to the Dodder valley stood the Victory Center, a Christian theological facility, and subsequent to its closure, a facility of the Church of Scientology has opened there.  Sport  Firhouse Carmel Football Club (Firhouse Carmel F.C.), based at Firhouse Community Centre, caters for over 300 schoolboys and girls from the local area, in 22 teams. Playing grounds are at Carrigwood and Scholars pitches, and 2005 saw Brian Kerr open the purpose-built changing rooms at the Community Centre after years of fundraising. The club is sponsored by Reagans, SuperValu. Local Leinster Senior League side Firhouse Clover also avail of the clubhouse facilities when training at Firhouse Community College. Ballyboden St Enda's GAA located on the Firhouse Road and St Anne's GAA, located in Bohernabreena, are major clubs in the area, with camogie, hurling and Gaelic football teams. Firhouse also has a basketball club, and Firhouse Community College has active clubs including GAA and basketball. Village status and planning In 2001 the voluntary group Firhouse Village Community Council was given a mandate at a general meeting to have the title \\"Firhouse Village\\" recognised for the area. In pursuing this they obtained EU and National Development Plan grant aid for Firhouse Village Park. While there is no formal definition or legal status of \\"village\\" in Ireland, by its name and the fact that grant aid was obtained under the Village Urban Renewal Scheme and E.U. funding, some form of recognition by the local authority that Firhouse was a village in its own right can be inferred, as the Village Urban Renewal Scheme 2000‚Äì2006 allocated monies only to villages throughout Ireland outside Dublin City and County. The most significant planning and development issue to concern Firhouse in recent years has been the decision of South Dublin County Council to grant permission for the rejuvenation of the core area with a mixed development of apartments, offices and retail outlets to be developed around the existing shopping centre.

Ayyavazhi came to be noticed by the large number of people gathering to worship Ayya Vaikundar in the middle of the 19th century. The majority of the followers of Ayyavazhi were from marginalised and poor sections of society.G.Patrick's, Religion and Subaltern Agency, Chapter 5, page 90 Right from the beginning of its development Ayyavazhi was seen in competition by the Christian missionaries on their mission. This is evident by the reports on Ayyavazhi presented by the Christian missionaries.The LMS Reports itself were gathered in the article headed Ayyavazhi in reports by Christian missionaries Although the majority of the followers of Ayyavazhi were from the Chanar caste (a social group), people of other castes also crowded around Vaikundar.Ailattirattu Ammanai, published by T.Palaramachandran Nadar, 9th impression, 1989, Page 251:Akilam speaks of 18 castes's gathering around Vaikundar. It was not usual at the time for people of different castes to intermingle.G.Patrick's, Religion and Subaltern Agency, Chapter 2, South Tiruvitankur Early years By the middle of the 19th century, Ayyavazhi had come to be a recognisable religion, in South Travancore and South Tirunelveli.G.Patrick's, Religion and Subaltern Agency, Chapter 5, The Religious Phenomenon of Ayyavazhi, page 91 Sub-heading:Spread of the Phenomenon, line 1 The growth of the religion increased significantly from the 1940s through the decades.G.Patrick's, Religion and Subaltern Agency, Chapter 5,page 92 Almost a century after Akilam was written down, it was released in printed form for the first time in 1933. The first printed form of Arul Nool came in 1927. While some others view that it released first in 1918. And then onwards Ayyavazhi is spread on the base of the teachings of Akilam rather than by oral tradition, which was active until then. Ayyavazhi's fast growth in its first century of existence was noted by Christian missionary reports of the mid-19th century.See the LMS Reports gathered in the article Ayyavazhi in reports by Christian missionaries from the book Religion and Subaltern Agency. As per the reports from the headquarters, from the period of Indian Independence Ayyavazhi spreads quickly and furthermore from the 1990s. =Seedars and Thuvayal Pandarams= When Ayya was alive he instructed the five Seedars with the rules and regulations.G.Patrick's, Religion and Subaltern Agency, Chapter 5, They were asked to preach them to the people. After he attained vaikundam, the disciples went to different parts of the country, preaching them to the people.G.Patrick's, Religion and Subaltern Agency, Chapter 5, page 120 The participants of Thuvayal Thavasu who were called Thuvayal Pandarams were the primary missionaries of Ayyavazhi who went to different parts of the country carrying the Gospels of Vaikundar. Also their descendants too do so. =Payyans= According to some oral traditions Vaikundar called the son of Thirumalammal affectionately as Payyan (little boy). Payyan was allowed to perform the panivedai to Ayya whenever the Citar were away. He was allowed to offer the Nithiya Pal to Ayya along with Seedars. And after the period of Ayya, Seedars started administrating the Swamithoppe Pathi. After the period of Seedars, the Payyan family members started administrating the temple, in spite of the disputes with Vellaicchamiyar who claimed for the administration in the court, but the judgement was in favour of Payyan family members. Other Pathis came under the administration of the native followers of Ayya of that places.N.Elango and Vijaya Shanthi Elango Ayya Vaikuntar - The Light of the World, 1997, Chapter 8, Pancha Pathis, pages 41-43 The Swamithoppe Pathi, administration was continued by Payyan family descendants. The panividiyalar was called as \\"Dharmaghartta\\". Dharmaghartta's so far were,N.Elango and Vijaya Shanthi Elango, Ayya Vaikuntar - The Light of the World, Chapter 4, The Gurukulam, (The Payyan dynasty is mentioned here as Gurukulam) pages 21 #Dharmaghartta. Podukkutty #Dharmaghartta. Krishna Narayana Vadivu #Dharmaghartta. Chella vadivu #Dharmaghartta. Bala Krishnan #Dharmaghartta. Chella Raj #Dharmaghartta. Bala Prajapathi Adikalar Though the eldest of the Payyans now is Anantha kutty Nadar, due to unknown reasons he refused to accept the rank.N.Elango and Vijaya Shanthi Elango, Ayya Vaikuntar - The Light of the World, Chapter 4, The Gurukulam, (The Payyan dynasty is mentioned here as Gurukulam) pages 21 So the next elder most, Bala Prajapathi Adikalar is considered as the present Dharmaghartta.In Swamithoppe Pathi, usually the Pattathu Ayyas use to lead other Panividaiyalars and use to carry the holy Pirambu and other things believed to be used by Ayya during the holy procession etc. Presently the \\"Pattathu Ayya\\" Anathakutty Nadar does not, and this was practiced by Bala Prajapathi Adikalar. =Nizhal Thangals= The Nizhal Thangals are the worship centers of Ayyavazhi built by devout followers of Ayya. Some of them are believed to be built when Ayya was alive. Eachenvilai Nizhal Thangals is Thalamai Nizhal Thangals (Like Thalamai Pathi Swamithoppe). Eachenvilai Thalamai Nizhal Thangals was the first one established and there is a Kai Vizhaku (lamp) lighted by Ayya himself in this temple. Many of the Nizhal Thangals were not under the rules of Ayyavazhi scriptures. Hundreds of Thangals arose in different parts of the country. Some were run by single individuals and some other by Ayyavazhi organisations and independent trusts.P.Sarvesvaran, Sri Vaikunda Swamikal - A Forgotten Social Reformer, page2-3 But all were bonded under Swamithoppe only religiously by not officially. This rate of rise of Thangals even increased after the 1970s. After Indian Independence Symbol of Ayyavazhi, Lotus with Namam The growth of Ayyavazhi after the independence of India is significant especially in the northern districts of Tamil Nadu.P.Sarvesvaran, Sri Vaikunda Swamikal - A Forgotten Social Reformer, page 2-3 : Here the author told about the spread of Ayyavazhi to other parts of Tamil Nadu, which means north to Kanyakumari. Nizhal Thangals rose in hundreds throughout the state.C. Poulose, Advaita Philosophy of Brahmasri Chattamoi Swamikal, Chapter 2, page 24 Around the 1940s, the Lotus with Namam was announced as the Symbol of Ayyavazhi. Many Ayyavazhi based social welfare movements raised in the late 20th century. Alternative to the commonly accepted Palaramachandran version, many other versions of Akilam were released during the late 20th century including some controversial versions. 27 years after the release of Palaramachandran Version, the most controversial Sentratisai Ventraperumal version of Akilam was released in 1966, while Vaikundar Thirukkudumbam Version was released in 1989. =Fast Spread= Bala Prajapathi Adikalar, the present Dharmaghartta of Swamithoppe Pathi had a significant role in the later day developments of Ayyavazhi. He has been awarded communal harmony award in the year 2003.The Hindu Report - The communal harmony award of the Tamil Nadu Government for the year 2003 was presented to Bala Prajapathi Adigalar of Kanyakumari district. From 1975 the Masi Procession (The Vaikunda Avatara Orvalam also called as Vaikunda Jayanthi Orvalam) was held and today it was one among the largest religious processions in Tamil Nadu. People from almost all the districts of Tamil Nadu and from some parts of Kerala, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, and Maharashtra participate in this procession. A few years later the Thiruvananthapuram procession and the Thiruchendur Procession were also held. From 1994 onwards The Vaikunda Avataram was declared as a holiday for the district of Kanyakumari. From the year 2006 Ayya Vaikunda Avataram was declared as a Holiday for the districts of Tirunelveli and Tuticorin.See the report on the news paper The Hindu- The report on declaration Also Ayyavazhi and its leaders played an important role in resolving the religious tensions during the Mondaicaud dispute. In 1993 a democratic body, Anbukkodimakkal Thirucchabai was formed by the headquarters to organise Ayyavazhi and its followers. Currently, Bala Prajapathi Adikalar, one of descendant of Payyan dynasty and G N Siva Chandran, one of the primary singer of ayyavazhi are considered to be the leaders of Ayyavazhi,N. Elango & Vijaya Shanthi Elango 1997 Ayya Vaikuntar - The Light of the World Chapter 4, Page 21-22 \\"The Gurus are Payyan Chella Raj, Bala Prajapathi, Bala Janathipathi, Balalokathipathi, Payyan Sami, Thangapandian and Sekar to name a few.

A spar will easily break or cleave into rhomboidal, cubical, or laminated fragments with smooth shiny surfaces. The various spar minerals were a historical term among miners and alchemists for any nonmetallic mineral akin to gypsum, known in Old English as sp√¶rstƒÅn, spear stone, referring to its crystalline projections. Thus, the word spar in mineralogy has the same root as \\"spear,\\". Amongst miners the term \\"spar\\" today is frequently used alone to express any bright crystalline substance. Most frequently, spar describes easily cleaved, lightly colored nonmetallic minerals such as feldspar, calcite or baryte. Baryte (BaSO4), the main source of barium, is also called \\"heavy spar\\" (Greek \\"barys\\" means \\"heavy\\"). Calcite often forms the dogtooth spar crystals found in vugs and caves. Formation underwater Generally, a spar will form underwater, either in a phreatic zone, or below the water table, the essential place where most caves form, or in standing pools, as pool spar. If a cave floods and a pool forms, that submerges stalactites, a formation known as bottlebrushes may form. Mineral component ions in the water, mostly calcite or gypsum, but sometimes even halite, quartz, and fluorite, are deposited through the course of thousands of years, building up on each other. Formation in the air Sometimes, spar will form in the air due to solutions seeping out of the cave's walls or through porous sediments. When grown in the air, it is often made of gypsum or selenite. Sometimes it will form as small needles found in sediments. Others spar can be found on the tips of gypsum chandeliers.
