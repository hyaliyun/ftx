It completes the Divergent trilogy that Roth started with her debut novel Divergent in 2011. The book is written from the perspective of both Beatrice (Tris) and Tobias (Four). Following the revelations of the previous novel, they journey past the city's boundaries to discover what lies beyond. Allegiant was published simultaneously by Katherine Tegen Books and HarperCollins Children's Books in the UK. Four weeks earlier, a free electronic companion book to the trilogy titled The World of Divergent: The Path to Allegiant was released online. The novel was to be adapted into a two- part film, the first part, The Divergent Series: Allegiant, was released on March 18, 2016, while the second part, called Ascendant, was planned to release in June 2017 but was ultimately cancelled. Plot A future dystopian Chicago has a society that defines its citizens by strict conformity to their social and personality-related affiliations with five different factions. That removes the threat of anyone exercising independent will and threatening the population's safety again by war or another human-created catastrophe. Those who fail the initiation of their particular faction are deemed Factionless and are treated as a lower class and a drain on society. After the revelation about their city, Evelyn Johnson-Eaton becomes Chicago's leader, which forces all factions to live equally with the Factionless. Confessing their role in the insurgency, Beatrice \\"Tris\\" Prior, Christina, and Cara are pardoned. Tris learns from Tobias \\"Four\\" Eaton about the rebel \\"Allegiant,\\" who work to restore the faction system. Several people are killed in a confrontation between faction members and the Factionless, including Evelyn's right-hand man, Edward. Tris is invited to a meeting with the Allegiant, whose leaders, Cara and Johanna Reyes, plan to usurp Evelyn and send envoys outside the city. Tris is selected for the expedition, alongside Tobias, Cara, Christina, Peter Hayes, Uriah Pedrad, and Tori Wu. Tris asks Tobias to free her brother Caleb from execution. Tori is killed by the Factionless, and the others escape and meet Tobias's mentor, Amar, who has long been presumed dead. They are taken to the Bureau of Genetic Welfare and its leader, David. David explains that Chicago is walled off from the outside world in an experiment sanctioned by the US government to produce genetically-purer (GP) \\"Divergents\\" from the genetically-damaged (GD) population, the result of a failed attempt to correct human genes that led to the \\"Purity War.\\" David gives Tris her mother Natalie's journal that details her life before Chicago. She was a refugee from Milwaukee who joined the Bureau and became a volunteer to stop Erudite's killing of Divergents. Those rescued included Amar and Tori's brother, George. Tobias learns he is not a true Divergent and joins GD Bureau member Nita in a rebellion against the GP staff. Tris is skeptical of the plan but jealous of Nita. The GP informant Matthew helps Nita access the Weapon Room and set off a bomb that causes to be Uriah brain-damaged. Tris stops Nita's rampage by holding David hostage before she wounds and arrests her. Tris is appointed a council member and realizes that the Bureau supplied Erudite with the simulation serums that controlled Dauntless in the invasion of Abnegation. Security footage reveals that Marcus Eaton, who was banished by Evelyn, is working with Johanna to steal weapons from the Factionless, which Evelyn will counter by releasing the death serum. Tris learns that David intends to release serums that can erase the population's memories to save his experiment. She formulates a plan to release the memory serum on the Bureau while Tobias, Christina, and Peter, with Amar and George's help, return to Chicago with antiserums for Christina and Uriah's families. Tobias, with his own plan to inject his mother with a memory serum, confronts her and asks her to avert the war in exchange for becoming his mother again. Evelyn agrees, negotiates peace with Johanna and Marcus, and exiles herself for two years, and Marcus vows never to lead Chicago. Tobias gives the memory serum to Peter, who intends to start anew. Caleb volunteers to expose the memory serum, a suicide mission, but Tris replaces him. She successfully repels the death serum but is shot by David. Dying, Tris sees visions of her mother embracing her, before she succumbs to her wounds. Tobias, Christina, and Peter return to the Bureau and learn from Cara of Tris's death. In a deep depression, Tobias is about to drink the memory serum to erase his memories of Tris until Christina stops him. Uriah's brother, Ezekiel \\"Zeke\\", and his mother, Hana, are with Uriah as his life support is unplugged. Two-and-a-half years later, Chicago is reopened and being rebuilt, and people co-exist regardless of gene purity. Tobias, now an assistant council member under Johanna, welcomes Evelyn back from her exile. To celebrate Choosing Day, he, Christina, Caleb, Zeke, Shauna, Cara, and Matthew ride a zip line from the Hancock Building, where Tobias scatters Tris's ashes and finally accepts her sacrifice. Background =Development= On July 18, 2013 at the San Diego Comic-Con panel for the film Divergent, Roth revealed that Allegiant is from the points of view of both Tris and Four. About that, she said, \\"I tried repeatedly to write Allegiant in just Tris's voice, but it didn't work; her perspective, her way of seeing things, was a little too limited for the story I needed to tell, I wanted to do two things with it: A. let two characters experience different things, and B. let them react differently to the same things, so that I (and eventually, the reader) would get a better sense of the whole story, the whole picture.\\" She further said, \\"I've said before that I've always seen Four (increasingly, as the series goes on) as a plot-mover alongside Tris, so he was the obvious choice for the second POV (though not the only one I tried). Exploring him and his choices and his assumptions about the world was incredibly interesting to me.\\" =Title= Roth said that she did not try to choose titles ending with \\"-ent\\" for all three books. She also said, \\"I did not go through other ideas. It was always Allegiant,\\" which she defined as \\"One who is loyal or faithful to a particular cause or person.\\" The World of Divergent: The Path to Allegiant The World of Divergent: The Path to Allegiant is a promotional electronic book by Roth that was released free of charge by HarperCollins on September 24, 2013. Published four weeks before Allegiant was released, it was intended to be a companion book to the Divergent trilogy. Roth continues to write related fiction, and The Path to Allegiant is a companion book to the entire Divergent universe in many respects. It contains an exclusive detailed description of Factions and their origin, the inspirations for the trilogy, a quiz on \\"Factions,\\" and answers by Roth regarding the trilogy. The book also contained ten teasers from Allegiant. Critical reception In a review for Entertainment Weekly, Hillary Busis gave the novel B+ and wrote that \\"If you've already been sucked into Roth's world, you'll appreciate the book's twisty plot‚Äîwhich provides needed context for the series' prefabricated society‚Äîand its chastely torrid Tris/Tobias love scenes.\\" Publishers Weekly said in its review that \\"The alternating perspectives are bothersome at times, due to the similarity between Tris and Tobias's first-person narratives. However, for those who have faithfully followed these five factions, and especially the Dauntless duo who stole hearts two books ago, this final installment will capture and hold attention until the divisive final battle has been waged.\\" Film adaptations On December 16, 2013, Summit Entertainment announced that the film adaptation of Allegiant would be released on March 18, 2016. On April 11, 2014, Lionsgate announced that the film adaptation would be split into two films titled The Divergent Series: Allegiant and The Divergent Series: Ascendant. On July 9, 2014, Lionsgate recruited Noah Oppenheim to write the screenplay for Part 1. Shailene Woodley, Theo James, and Naomi Watts will reprise their roles. However this is now not confirmed as Theo James has backed out on the final instalment. On December 5, 2014, it was announced that Robert Schwentke, who directed The Divergent Series: Insurgent, would return to direct Allegiant. Principal photography for The Divergent Series: Allegiant began in Atlanta on May 18, 2015. The film was released to generally negative reviews from critics, and was a box office disappointment, grossing only $179 million worldwide against a $142 million budget. Ascendant was to have had a release date of June 9, 2017. After the poor performance of Allegiant at the box office, it was announced it will be created as a television film, followed by a television spinoff series. However, in February 2017, when it was announced that the fourth film will be a television project, it was announced Woodley had backed out of her starring role.

It is one of the emerging groundbreaking works being created by the reborn Pakistani film industry It has been banned by the government and hence did not play in any major cinemas in the country. It contains themes of an irresponsible media, apathetic youths, political stagnation and class struggle. It has played in various film festivals and shows a very different side of Pakistan. The films is a series of encounters between the protagonist and various archetypes of people who live in Pakistan. The film was written and directed by London-based Pakistani filmmaker Hammad Khan. This is his second film and acts as sort of fantasy sequel to his first film \\"Slackistan\\". The film is still being dismissed by major Pakistani institutions but is quickly gathering a large following. This film was a collaboration between Animage Production and Number Eight Films. The film premiered at the 2013 South Asian International Film Festival.  Plot  The film opens with a group of college kids sitting in a coffee shop, silent and bored. As they as exiting the building, they are all shot and killed by a strange man whose face is covered in bandages. The strange man approaches them from a distance and shoots all five of them. After which he gets into a taxi and exits the scene. We then see the Stranger roaming around the hills of Islamabad. He seems to be experiencing some sort of psychosis, as clips from various news channels and radio shows play in his head. He goes up to a police officer and asks to be arrested. The policeman dismisses him. After being refused thrice and having his money taken, the stranger shoots the police officer. The Stranger sits inside a hospital, waiting to be looking at however no one shows up. He exits the hospital and finds a beggar woman asking for money and her child obliviously playing with the toy camera. The Stranger opens his wallet but finds it empty, for having tried to bribe the policeman. He hands the poor woman all his credit cards and walks away. We then see the poor woman look at the cards and then throw them away. The Stranger sneaks into a projector room and sleeps there. A series of old pop culture films and news clips play. We see him slip out as soon as the projectionist comes back. We find our protagonist in a restaurant. The waiter complains of bad economic conditions and we see a woman whose hands are covered in blood, standing by the window. She looks exactly like the beggar woman at the hospital. The Stranger bumps into a laughing madman on an intersection. He goes home with him and has a few joints. He watches TV and masturbates to an old clip of Pakistan winning the cricket world cup in the '70s. The laughing madman and the Stranger walk hand in hand around the hill station but eventually, the eccentric man is shot down too. Later the Stranger goes to a news agency and asks to be on the show. The news anchor refuses, saying that there are too many other important things to talk about. The Stranger understanding the fact that the Anchor is merely choosing sensational news, offers to shoot himself on air during an interview. The News Anchor agrees. During the live interview on the show, The Stranger looks nervous. After 20 questions, the Stranger shoots the News Anchor instead of himself. The crew keeps rolling. He then tells the population that media turns them into monkeys and that they should go out and do something instead. The Stranger enters a room and finds a hooker, she tells him eccentric stories about her customers. They make love and his bandages come off. We see our Stranger with his bandages off, carrying a camera around. He sits down next to a young girl at a Caf√©, who recognizes him as the director of the film Anima State. Soon she is joined by an army of other youths, who begin beating him with their keyboards. The Stranger runs away and finds himself in crowd of people blocking the highway, protesting the corrupt government. However, most of the people seem to be more interested in being on TV rather than actually changing anything. The stranger hops on a boat, that‚Äôs being driven by the projectionist. The boat is just roaming a lake. However, the Stranger closes his eyes and tells the boatman to take him somewhere far away.Khan, Hammad. \\"Anima State\\". Animage Films. 2013.

They were not missionaries, but ministered to the British population. On the other hand, they tried to facilitate missionary activity in line with their evangelical Christian views. Background Christian missionary activity, at this period, opposed the East India Company's wishes, which in general and by tradition were \\"orientalist\\": based on respecting local laws, customs and religions. So-called \\"Company orientalism\\" is dated to 1772, when the Company had revenue collection in Bengal farmed out to it, and adopted a stance of rationalising existing institutions but working with the grain of the local culture. (See also Scottish orientalism.) The Company's Charter came up for renewal every 20 years, and in 1793 political moves to modify the \\"orientalist\\" line failed. In 1813, however, the Company's complete control of missionary activity in its domains was eroded, with an appeal possible. The evangelical chaplains were closely associated with the Church Missionary Society (CMS) and the early London Missionary Society (LMS). In common with the LMS, they made little of the denominational differences between the Church of England and dissenters such as the Baptists and Methodists. Charles Simeon The Cambridge-based evangelical Charles Simeon used his influence to find posts in India for a group of evangelical chaplains, the first of whom was Claudius Buchanan. He arrived in Calcutta in 1797, first lodging with David Brown. Brown's appointment as a presidency chaplain had come in 1794, eight years after his arrival in Bengal. Buchanan spent some months with Brown, before moving to Barrackpore for two years, where he had little to do as a minister. He was appointed to Fort William College, but as a company chaplain was barred from missionary activity. He left India in 1808. It was not until 1805 that Simeon, with the support of Charles Grant as East India Company director, was able to nominate chaplains who were recognised as evangelists to the Indian population. The phase of evangelical activity condoned in this way by the Company was short, however: it came to an end when Brown and Henry Martyn died in 1812. =Nominees and followers= *Daniel Corrie *Thomas Dealtry *Thomas Truebody Thomason *Marmaduke Thompson (died 1851) The \\"five chaplains\\" is a phrase attributed to John William Kaye, as applying to David Brown, Claudius Buchanan, Henry Martyn, Thomas Thomason, and Daniel Corrie. Kaye in fact mentions this group as \\"Bengal chaplains\\" and \\"Christian heroes\\". Missionary societies The CMS formed a Calcutta branch in 1807. The chaplains Daniel Corrie and Thomas Truebody Thomason were effective supporters.

He finished landscape architecture studies in Vilvoorde in 1986 and founded his own practice in Brussels in 1989. \\"Renowned for his free and sensitive interpretations of historical garden design\\", in his work he combines landscaping with art and the use of abstract forms is typical in his design. During his career, he designed numerous large-scale private projects in Europe but also overseas. Among other projects, in 1997 he designed a 55-acre park for fashion designer Dries Van Noten and in 2003 started working with the project of the garden of Baron and Baroness Guy Ullens de Schooten. In 2014 Dhont designed garden Mus√©e Picasso in Paris for its re-opening. His portfolio includes other projects as gardens, farmyards, and landscape restorations such as the one at Baljuwshuis, Gaasbeek, near Brussels, working for Baron and Baroness Piet Van Waeyenberge between 1992‚Äì5, and the restoration of the landscape around the Palm Brewery, Diepensteyn, Steenhuffel-Londerzeel.

It was opened in 1910 and closed permanently in 1995. It was finally demolished in 2015. History The facility was designed by George Thomas Hine in an echelon formation. Construction started in 1910 and it opened as the Gateshead Borough Lunatic Asylum in 1914. The hospital was requisitioned for military use during the First World War and then became Gateshead County Borough Mental Hospital in 1920. A nurses' home was completed in 1928, as well as various other additions to the site. Part of the hospital was also requisitioned for military use during the Second World War. The hospital joined the National Health Service in 1948. After services transferred to Bensham General Hospital, the hospital closed in 1995.

Despite facing multiple allegations of corruption, he did not face trial until implicated in the embezzlement of funds from a national electronic ID card program. Following his arrest by the Corruption Eradication Commission in November 2017, he resigned as DPR speaker for a second time and was later removed as Golkar chairman. He was sentenced to 15 years in jail in April 2018. Since then, he has often left jail, purportedly for medical examinations, although he was once spotted at a shopping center. Early life, education and career The fifth of eight children, Setya Novanto was born on 12 November 1955 in the West Java capital of Bandung to Sewondo Mangunratsongko and Julia Maria Sulastri. After he completed kindergarten, his family moved to the East Java capital of Surabaya, where he commenced elementary school. His parents later divorced, with his father remaining in Surabaya, while his mother and the children moved to Jakarta in 1967. His mother made a living by selling cakes from door to door. Setya attended Tebet Junior High School 73 (1967‚Äì70) and then Senior High School 9 in South Jakarta (1970‚Äì73). After high school, Setya moved back to Surabaya for higher education, but he reportedly refused to stay with his father and instead stayed with friends. He studied accounting management at Widya Mandala Catholic University. He sold honey and rice to support himself, starting with capital of just Rp82,500 and growing to running two trucks selling rice delivered from Lamongan regency. He also operated a stall at the city‚Äôs Keputren Market but reportedly fell afoul of dishonest partners. While still a student, Setya founded a company called Mandar Teguh with Hartawan, the son of the director of Bank Rakyat Indonesia for Surabaya. He was hired by a Suzuki dealership as a car salesman for the Eastern Indonesia region. He also worked as a model and was awarded the title of Most Handsome Man of Surabaya in 1975. After graduating from university in 1979, Setya worked for PT Anindya Cipta Perdana, a company variously described as a distributor of fertilizer, cement and building materials for East Nusa Tenggara province. The company was owned by Setya‚Äôs former high school classmate, Hayono Isman, who would later become youth affairs and sports minister under president Suharto. PT Anindya Cipta Perdana reportedly failed after two years, but it led to Setya's long-running involvement with East Nusa Tenggara, which he would later represent as a legislator for four terms for Golkar Party. He was reported to be a frequent donor to churches and farmers on his visits to the province, but environmentalists accused him of exploiting local people for his financial benefit. Setya returned to Jakarta in 1979 and stayed at Hayono‚Äôs Menteng house. According to Leo Nababan, a deputy secretary general of Golkar, Setya became the personal driver of the Hayono family. In Jakarta, Setya studied accounting at Trisakti University and opened a photocopying service near the campus to support himself. Setya‚Äôs business career took off after he married Luciana Lily Herliyanti, the daughter of West Java Police deputy chief Brigadier General Sudharsono. He started managing his in-laws‚Äô gas station in Cikokol, Tangerang, then branched out into livestock, contracting, buying and selling paper and textiles, and developing hotels and golf courses. His business interests were spread across Jakarta, Batam and Kupang. As a businessman, Setya proved adept at lobbying and networking, especially among people close to officials, from aides to personal secretaries and subordinates. He was also comfortable carrying the bags of high-ranking military officers, such as General Wismoyo Arismunandar. This gave him entry to the elite community of Indonesian sports organizations, which were dominated by senior military officials and tycoons. In 1986, Setya completed the Nagoya Plaza Hotel project on Batam Island. Seeking more capital for a bigger resort, he tried to approach Suharto‚Äôs cousin, tycoon Sudwikatmono. Setya reportedly spent days at a parking lot, from 6am to 10pm, trying to speak to Sudwikatmono, who finally decided to give him a chance. Their partnership led to the opening in 1989 of the Talvas Golf and Country Club (later redeveloped as the Palm Springs Golf & Beach Resort), a 400-hectare golf course and resort on Batam that cost $100 million. This was followed by more resorts and hotels, and telecommunications and satellite projects. From 1995 to 1996, Setya was chairman of Bamuhas Kosgoro, one of Golkar's constituent organizations. He was treasurer of the National Sports Committee of Indonesia from 1995 to 2003. Dealings with Suharto family Setya first met Suharto in 1989 at the opening of the Talvas golf course on Batam. In 1991, Suharto‚Äôs eldest daughter, Siti Hardiyanti Hastuti ‚ÄòTutut‚Äô Rukmana appointed Setya to lead PT Citra Permatasakti Persada (CPP), a company selected by police to make Indonesian driving licenses from 1992 to 1998. Of the official fee of Rp52,500 per license, Rp48,500 was allocated to CCP and the remaining Rp4,000 to the state treasury. In 1992, Rp48,500 was equivalent to $24. The State Audit Agency (BPK) recorded that from October 1992 to March 1998, PT CPP produced 16,575,710 licenses. The cost of producing a license at that time was put at Rp11,000. In 1992, Elsye Sigit, the wife of Suharto‚Äôs oldest son Sigit Harjojudanto, appointed Setya to become involved in PT Solusindo Mitra Sejati (SMS), a company that was in February 1993 given a contract to computerize the system for making Indonesian identity cards. Data for ID cards had previously been entered on typewriters, enabling some individuals to hold multiple cards. An agreement between PT SMS and the Home Affairs Ministry was signed in February 1993. It was temporarily suspended by Home Affairs Minister Yogie Suardi Memet amid claims that some parties had been excluded from the deal. When the deal resumed, proposed fees in 1995 for identity cards, family cards, birth certificates and death certificates were raised between 100% and 350%. Setya chaired a committee that produced a 1996 book titled President Suharto's Management as Narrated by 17 Ministers (Manajemen Presiden Soeharto dalam Penuturan 17 Menteri). He said the book was the result of two years of hard work and he hoped it would inspire Indonesia's younger generation to emulate the science and art of Suharto's management style. Political career Setya Novanto as MP in 1999. In 1998, Setya became vice-treasurer of Golkar's central organization, and the following year was elected to the People's Representative Council representing Indonesia-occupied East Timor. He had a difficult year as East Timor voted for independence and he was caught up in a corruption scandal. In 2004, Setya was re-elected to the legislature as a representative from West Timor. He was re-elected in 2009, representing the same area, and became head of the Golkar Party faction in the legislature. He also became a member of House Commission III, which discusses legal affairs and laws, human rights and security issues. In 2014, Setya was elected for a fourth time, still representing Timor, and was selected as speaker of Indonesia's House of Representatives by the opposition Koalisi Merah Putih, which initially controlled the parliament. After being caught on tape demanding shares from Freeport Indonesia, Setya resigned as House speaker on 16 December 2015, shortly after a House committee ruled his actions had violated House ethics. Setya was elected chairman of Golkar Party at its 15‚Äì17 May 2016 party conference. He then announced that Golkar was now supporting the government of President Joko 'Jokowi' Widodo, despite having backed Jokowi‚Äôs rival, Prabowo Subianto, in the 2014 presidential election. In mid- November 2016, despite having been angered by Setya's use of his name in the demand for Freeport shares, President Jokowi invited Setya to the State Palace for a meeting. Golkar subsequently decided to reinstate Setya as House speaker, and he was officially re-appointed on 30 November 2016. On 9 December 2017, it was reported that Setya had resigned as House speaker ahead of his corruption trial. He nominated Golkar politician Azis Syamsuddin as his successor. Deputy House Speaker Fadli Zon on 11 December said Setya's resignation had been accepted by a meeting of the House's Deliberation Council but a successor was yet to be selected. Legislators said the House had received Setya's resignation letters on 4 December and 6 December, and the meeting of the Deliberation Council had decided Golkar Party's House faction should handle the matter of a replacement. Golkar on 13 December 2017 replaced Setya with Airlangga Hartarto as party chairman. Setya's replacement in the legislative body was sworn in on 31 October 2018. Trump rally In September 2015, Setya visited New York to attend the Fourth World Conference of Speakers of Parliament. He and some fellow Indonesian legislators, including Fadli Zon, then had a half hour business meeting with Donald Trump and joined one of his campaign rallies at Trump Tower in New York. Their presence was arranged by Trump‚Äôs Indonesian business partner, Hary Tanoesoedibjo. After appearing to wrap up the rally, Trump returned to the podium with Setya in hand. ‚ÄúLadies and gentlemen, this is a very, an amazing man,‚Äù declared Trump. ‚ÄúHe is, as you know, right, Speaker of the House of Indonesia. He‚Äôs here to see me. Setya Novantno [sic]. One of the most powerful men and a great man and his whole group is here to see me today and we will do great things for the United States.‚Äù Some Indonesian legislators later demanded sanctions against Setya and Fadli for appearing to take sides in the US presidential election while on an official visit. The pair were investigated by the House Honor Council, but they skipped three ethics hearings. Despite their repeated refusal to attend the hearings, the pair were merely given a reprimand for having publicly endorsed Trump. Controversies Setya has been linked to numerous corruption cases but was never prosecuted until December 2017. =Bank Bali scandal= In 1999, Setya was involved in the Bank Bali scandal. The Indonesian Bank Restructuring Agency (IBRA) in February 1999 colluded with Golkar Party officials to force Bank Bali chief Rudy Ramli to pay a commission of Rp546 billion to Era Giat Prima (EGP) in order to collect Rp904 billion owed by three banks taken over by IBRA. The money was then paid out in more than 150 transfers to top politicians and legislators, partly in an effort to buy votes for the re-election of then-president B.J. Habibie. Setya was the president director of EGP and the deputy treasurer of Golkar, and part of Habibie‚Äôs re- election team. After the scandal broke, Setya was not prosecuted. Instead, prosecutors focused on EGP director Djoko Tjandra, an ethnic Chinese Indonesian. An investigation into Setya‚Äôs role was terminated by then-attorney general M.A. Rachman, who was known to be close to Golkar Party. =Rice smuggling= In 2003, Setya's company PT Hexatama Finindo imported 60,000 tons of rice from Vietnam but paid customs duty on only 900 tons after paperwork was allegedly falsified. The case caused state losses of Rp28.5 billion and was examined by the Attorney General‚Äôs Office in 2006, but Setya was questioned only once and not prosecuted. Instead, his fellow Golkar legislator, Nurdin Halid, who had ordered the rice, was sentenced to two years and six months in jail. =Toxic waste imports= In 2004, about 1,000 tons of hazardous waste listed as fertilizer was shipped from Singapore to Indonesia‚Äôs Galang Island by PT Asia Pasific Eco Lestari, which was previously owned by Setya. He denied involvement despite reports he was a signatory of the transaction. The incident sparked a diplomatic row with protesters attacking the Singapore Embassy in Jakarta. The company‚Äôs director, Rudi Alfonso, received a six-month jail sentence. =National Games scandal= In 2012, Setya and another Golkar legislator allegedly received Rp9 billion in bribes from the then-governor Riau province, Rusli Zainal, in return for facilitating the release of state budget funds for graft-ridden National Games projects. Rusli was sentenced to 14 years in jail. Setya denied any knowledge of the matter when questioned by the Corruption Eradication Commission (KPK). =East Java election fraud= In 2014, Setya was linked to a corruption case involving former Constitutional Court chief Akil Mochtar, who was sentenced to life imprisonment for fixing the results of disputed elections. Local media alleged that Setya helped to pay to uphold the victory of Golkar‚Äôs candidate in the 2009 East Java gubernatorial election. He denied any involvement. =Fuel depot= In 2015, Setya sent a letter demanding that state oil and gas company Pertamina pay allegedly inflated costs for use of a fuel terminal, PT Orbit Terminal Merak, owned by his crony, oil trade kingpin Riza Chalid. =Freeport shares= In 2015, in one of the biggest corruption scandals in the history of Indonesia, Setya was recorded by Freeport Indonesia President- Director Maroef Sjamsoeddin allegedly attempting to extort 20 percent of shares (worth USD 4 billion) in the company in exchange for an extension of its contract to manage the Grasberg mine in Papua. He claimed to be acting for President Joko Widodo. Setya later claimed this request for shares was only a joke. Both Maroef and Indonesian Energy minister Sudirman Said, gave testimony to a House Ethics Panel set up to investigate the allegations against Setya, who subsequently reported Sudirman Said to the police for defamation. The proceedings were televised live and attracted a large audience. Setya resigned as House speaker on 16 December 2015 shortly before the committee voted to dismiss him. The Attorney General's Office began an investigation into the case, but it was never completed. Setya subsequently petitioned the Constitutional Court for a review of the Electronic Information and Transactions Law. The court ruled that only recordings made by law enforcement officials were admissible as evidence in court. Therefore, as Maroef was a private individual, the recording he made could not be used to prosecute Setya. Electronic ID card (E-KTP) scandal In 2013, Setya was accused of demanding a 10 percent fee from the owner of a company that won a contract to produce electronic ID cards. He denied the charges. On 10 April 2017, the KPK banned Setya from leaving Indonesia for six months after linking him to the case. The following day, KPK investigator Novel Baswedan was blinded in one eye in an acid attack. Setya urged the public not to jump to conclusions. He claimed the attack was not only against Novel and KPK, but against \\"us, the Indonesian people and nation fighting against corruption\\". In July 2017, the KPK named Setya a suspect in the Rp2.3 trillion electronic ID card corruption case. On 4 September 2017, Setya filed a pretrial motion with South Jakarta District Court to challenge his status as a corruption suspect. He was summoned by KPK for interrogation on 11 September 2017 but failed to appear on the grounds of poor health. A team of doctors from the House of Representatives examined him the following day and claimed he was suffering vertigo as a result of playing ping-pong. On 27 September 2017, a plenary meeting of Golkar recommended he be temporarily suspended as party chairman because his status as a corruption suspect had harmed the party. On 29 September 2017, South Jakarta District Court accepted Setya's pretrial motion and rescinded his status as a suspect,. In response, the KPK on 31 October again named him a suspect in the case. Setya's lawyer said he would seek protection from the president, the military and the police, if the KPK tries to summon his client. He asserted that under Indonesia's constitution, members of parliament have immunity and cannot be touched. =2017 staged car crash= On 15 November 2017, Setya failed to appear at KPK's office for questioning and instead attended a plenary meeting of the House of Representatives. KPK officers went to his Jakarta residence at 9.38pm with a warrant for his arrest, but he was not at home and was later declared a fugitive. According to his lawyer, Fredrich Yunadi, Setya was outside Jakarta and returned on 16 November to the House of Representatives, where he called a Metro TV reporter, Hilman Mattauch, to come and interview him. A subsequent interview, relayed via a telephone call to Metro TV, was reportedly conducted in a black Toyota Fortuner vehicle owned and driven by Hilman. The two were accompanied in the car by Setya's aide, Reza, who is a senior police inspector. During the interview, Setya denied any wrongdoing and said he was being oppressed by KPK, so he was seeking another judicial review and asking the president for legal protection. According to his lawyer, Setya then requested to be driven to the KPK office to comply with its summons, but Hilman wanted to take him to Metro TV studios. During the drive, the vehicle mounted a sidewalk alongside a canal on Permata Hijau Street and reportedly scraped the side of a tree before hitting a power pole. An unidentified vehicle stopped and took Setya to Medika Permata Hijau Hospital. Hilman and Reza, who were seated in the front of the vehicle, were not injured. Setya's lawyer told reporters that Setya was unconscious and seriously injured, sustaining a lump the size of a bakpao (steamed bun) to his head and bleeding. Police later examined the car and found no traces of blood. An investigation found the car was traveling at 50 km/h on the street but had slowed to 21 km/h when it hit the power pole. Golkar Party official Mahyudin, who visited Setya at the hospital on 17 November, denied Setya had sustained a bakpao-sized lump to the head. He said there was bruising to his left temple and a scratch on his left cheek. He said Setya told him he had intended to meet some Golkar officials at Jakarta's Mandarin Hotel so they could accompany him to the KPK office, but then the car accident occurred. Police said Hilman claimed the accident occurred because he was tired and had been talking on his phone and talking to Setya. On 17 November, Setya was transferred to Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital. His lawyer claimed that if Setya were not evacuated to Singapore for treatment, he could lose his memory. Many Indonesian netizens ridiculed the \\"accident\\" by sharing memes that expressed sympathy for the power pole. The Indonesian media also ran mocking headlines, such as TRIBUNews.com's \\"Here's the Clarification from the Electricity Pole that was the Victim of Setya Novanto's Car Collision\\". Police declared Hilman a suspect for negligent driving. Hilman had served as Coordinator of Parliamentary Journalists from 2014-2016, a position that enabled him to become close to Setya. Fredrich rejected rumors that Setya had given Hilman an apartment and a car, saying, ‚ÄúIf he's a girl maybe yes, unfortunately he's a guy, a fat guy, so who would want him, right?‚Äù On 28 June 2018, Setya's lawyer Fredrich was sentenced to seven years in prison for obstruction of justice because he conspired for Setya to be hospitalized after the staged car accident. The lawyer's appeal was rejected by the Supreme Court, which extended his sentence by six months. On 16 July 2018, Setya's doctor, Bimanesh Sutarjo of private hospital Medika Permata Hijau, was sentenced to three years in jail for obstructing the KPK investigation. =Arrest, second pre-trial motion= On 17 November 2017, KPK announced it had officially arrested Setya as a suspect in the E-KTP scandal. His lawyer said a \\"sick\\" person should not be arrested. On 19 November, he was transferred to the KPK detention center after doctors ruled him fit for questioning. He arrived in a wheelchair but was walking normally after his initial questioning. He was detained in a KPK cell measuring 2.5 x 5 meters, where his two cellmates were Rochmadi Saptogiri of the State Audit Agency and businessman Sujendi Tarsono alias Ayen. Rochmadi said Setya, like most new inmates, found it difficult to sleep for the first two nights. After his arrest, Setya wrote a letter to the House of Representatives, asking to be allowed to keep his position while he attempts to prove his innocence. He also wrote a letter to Golkar, nominating Idrus Marham as acting party chairman. The deputy chairman of South Jakarta District Court, Judge Kusno, on 14 December 2017 rejected Setya's second pre-trial motion to have his suspect status revoked, on the grounds that Setya's corruption trial had started the previous day, rendering the pre-trial motion legally void. =Corruption trial and sentencing= On 13 December 2017, Setya appeared as a defendant at Jakarta Corruption Court. He initially refused to respond when the presiding judge asked him to identify himself. The hearing was adjourned for several hours pending a medical examination after a defense lawyer claimed Setya was sick. KPK prosecutors said Setya was lying and only pretending to be ill. The trial resumed later that day with the reading of indictment, in which Setya was accused of receiving $7.3 million and a $135,000 wristwatch in bribes from members of a consortium that won a tender for the E-KTP project. Less than a week before the trial started, two of Setya's senior defense lawyers resigned, citing differences of opinion. In January 2018, Setya's lawyer stated his client's intention to become a justice collaborator. By March, he had returned Rp 5 billion (USD 350,000) and named other alleged recipients of E-KTP project bribes, including Central Java Governor Ganjar Pranowo and cabinet members Puan Maharani and Pramono Anung. On 29 March, prosecutors recommended he be jailed for 16 years and fined Rp 1 billion. On 24 April 2018, Jakarta Corruption Court convicted Setya of corruption and sentenced him to 15 years in jail. He was also ordered to pay a fine of Rp 500 million or have his sentence extended by three months. Judges said he was proven to have committed corruption in the budgeting and tender processes for the electronic ID project over 2011-2013. Judges said Setya was spared a heavier sentence because he was polite during the trial and had never been convicted before. Judges barred him from public office for five years after his sentence expires. =Imprisonment= In September 2018, Indonesia's National Ombudsman found that Setya was enjoying special treatment at Bandung's Sukamiskin prison, including a cell twice the size of regular cells. In June 2019, Setya was allowed to visit Bandung's Santosa Hospital, where he had a room on the 8th floor. On 14 June, he left the hospital and was later seen at a shopping center with his wife in West Bandung. The Justice and Human Rights Ministry responded by transferring him from Sukamiskin prison to Gunung Sindur prison in Bogor. On 14 July 2019, he was transferred back to Sukamiskin after meeting various \\"administrative requirements\\" and promising not to repeat his actions. On 12 August 2019, Setya was sporting a beard and moustache when he testified at Jakarta Corruption Court as a witness in a power project corruption case. He joked that he had grown the beard because the other inmates at Gunung Sindur \\"are all terrorists\\". In December 2019, Emerson Yuntho, a former coordinator of Indonesian Corruption Watch, claimed Setya had again gone missing from his cell. A prison official denied that Setya had left the jail for medical treatment, insisting he was in good health, while the Justice Ministry said Setya had been moved to another room because his cell was being repaired and the work would not be completed until 31 December. On 26 December 2019, Setya was transferred to Jakarta's Cipinang prison, officially because he required treatment at Gatot Subroto Army Hospital in Jakarta. A Justice Ministry official said Setya's heart rhythm required examination and he would be sent back to Sukamiskin prison upon recovery. National Ombudsman official Ninik Rahayu made a surprise visit to Cipinang jail on 29 December 2019 and found the jail's luxury block was registered in the name of Setya, who was not there. Ninik questioned why Setya had a special \\"very comfortable\\" cell with \\"better facilities\\" when the jail is not supposed to discriminate against inmates. Cipinang Prison head Hendra Eka Putra explained the special block is for prisoners with heart disease and infectious diseases, so it was impossible to allow other inmates there. He said Setya had arrived at the jail at 8am on 26 December and then at 10am went directly to hospital, so he had not yet had time to stay at the jail. He said Setya qualified for the special block because he had heart disease and complications of several other diseases. =Supreme Court Appeal= On 6 January 2020, Setya filed for a judicial review of his sentence at the Supreme Court. Indonesia Corruption Watch said the panel of three justices handling the review, led by justice Surya Jaya, should reject the appeal if no new evidence is submitted. Memes and defamation allegation Setya‚Äôs links to corruption cases resulted in him becoming the subject of numerous internet memes, shared widely on social media. On 10 October 2017, Setya's lawyer reported 32 social media accounts to police for allegedly defaming and slandering his client. The accounts comprised 15 Twitter accounts, 9 Instagram accounts and 8 Facebook accounts. Among those reported to police was Dyann Kemala Arrizzqi, who had uploaded memes of Setya to her Instagram account. On 31 October, police arrested Dyann at her house in Tangerang, Banten province. She was charged under Indonesia‚Äôs Information and Electronic Transactions Law, as well as Articles 310 and 311 of the Indonesian Criminal Code. She was released the following day but remained under investigation and faced up to six years in jail. Setya‚Äôs lawyer, Fredrich Yunadi, on 1 November 2017 complained there were at least 60 memes mocking his client. He suspected a ‚Äúcertain party‚Äù had ordered or paid for the memes to discredit Setya. He urged the public to uphold the presumption of innocence and cease spreading hatred and slander against Setya. He said Setya‚Äôs position as House of Representatives speaker is equal to that of the president, so he should not be mocked. A 2014 Toyota Fortuner, similar to that one Novanto drove. After Setya's disappearance on 15 November 2017 and his subsequent hospitalization following a car crash, Indonesian social media and news media published more memes ridiculing him. Fredrich said his subordinates were evaluating the memes and he would report offending social media accounts to police. Novanto Center In 2009, Setya founded the Novanto Center, an institution that carries out social, economic and community activities in East Nusa Tenggara, one of Indonesia's poorest provinces. The center has provided basic food commodities, scholarships and cash handouts, and sponsored mass circumcisions. Local activists claim the Novanto Center facilitated the entry of an iron ore mining company, PT Laki Tangguh, which was in 2013 reported to police for alleged fraud and crimes. In 2014, the director of the Novanto Center in Kupang, Muhammad Ansor, allegedly threatened a Tempo reporter, Yohanes Seo, for writing an article that listed some of Setya‚Äôs business investments in East Nusa Tenggara (NTT). After interviewing Ansor, who is a local legislator for Golkar Party, Seo wrote an article headlined ‚ÄòThe Business Octopus of Setya Novanto in NTT‚Äô. The reporter says he then received a phone call from Ansor, warning him that his family would come looking for him. Ansor denied making any threats, but complained the reporter had twisted his information. In 2015, the Novanto Center established a weaving, poultry breeding and cattle fattening business in Manusak village. Locals say Setya stopped visiting the project in 2015, so all of the livestock and weaving looms were stolen or sold, leaving the buildings empty. Personal life Setya was married to Luciana Lily Herliyanti, the daughter of former West Java Police chief Brigadier General Sudharsono. The couple had two children, Rheza Herwindo and Dwina Michaella. Setya and Lily later divorced. Setya is now married to Deisti Astriani and they have two children, Gavriel Putranto and Giovanno Farell.

Police in riot gear responded with smoke grenades and pepper spray. Incident Donald Trump held a rally that attracted over 7,000 supporters in Albuquerque on May 24. Organized counter protests occurred the same day, and included a rally with local speakers, a march, the display of anti-Trump signs, and musical performances. While the event began peacefully, it descended into violence later that night after the majority of protestors had left the area. The remaining protestors gathered at the Albuquerque Convention Center, the venue hosting the Trump campaign rally. Demonstrators burned signs and pro-Trump t-shirts, and threw rocks and plastic bottles at police. The Albuquerque Police Department later characterized the incident as a riot. The clash with police continued until 11:00 p.m. Three rioters were arrested in the chaos and several police officers sustained minor injuries from thrown rocks. Reactions Donald Trump tweeted on the event and surrounding chaos after the unrest. \\"Great rally in New Mexico, amazing crowd!\\" He also tweeted, \\"The protesters in New Mexico were thugs who were flying the Mexican flag.

Biography  Friedrich Otto Aristides von Weech was born in Munich. By this time his father, the army officer Friedrich Joseph von Weech (1794-1837), had died in Athens during the summer, while serving in the army of young King Otto. The boy attended school in Munich, then spending several years taught by monks at Metten Abbey in Lower Bavaria, before returning to Munich where he spent the final two years of his schooling at the prestigious (secondary school). He attended University of Munich (1956) and, for a couple of terms, Heidelberg (1957). He received his doctorate from Munich in June 1860. His doctoral dissertation was entitled \\"Kaiser Ludwig der Bayer und K√∂nig Johann von B√∂hmen, mit Urkundlichen Beitr√§gen\\" (\\"Emperor Ludwig the Bavarian and King John of Bohemia, [illustrated] with original sources\\". After this the young doctor joined Karl von Hegel's, team working on the (ultimately) 27 volume compilation, \\"\\" (\\"The Chronicles of the German cities\\"), under the auspices of the ' (Historical Commission of the Bavarian Academy of Sciences).Marion Kreis: Karl Hegel. Geschichtswissenschaftliche Bedeutung und wissenschaftsgeschichtlicher Standort. G√∂ttingen 2012 u.a., p. 226ff. Von Weech applied himself to the second volume, working on the fifteenth century reports by Erhart Sch√ºrstab (\\"Kriegsbericht und Ordnung\\") concerning Nuremberg's war against Albrecht Achilles, Margrave of Brandenburg during 1449 and 1450. He also made other albeit lesser contributions to the compilation. After this he decided to switch from authorship to a university based academic career, and made plans to move to University of T√ºbingen, but in the end he moved instead to University of Freiburg, where he may have had his eye on a still unfilled teaching chair. He received his habilitation (higher academic qualification) from Freiburg in April 1862 for work \\"On the character and politics of Emperor Maximilian I\\". His contribution at Freiburg was energetic, and he also took part in public life more widely. During 1863 Freiburg followed the example of other German towns and cities in setting up its own committee to consider the Schleswig-Holstein Question. As secretary to the committee in Freiburg von Weech convened and chaired a large meeting of the city folk on 29 November 1863, also producing leaflets in support of the \\"patriotic\\" view of \\"The Question\\". Germany had a vigorous regional press at the time, and during the early 1860s von Weech embarked on a part-time parallel career as a part-time journalist. Articles that he wrote on political and literary issues were printed by newspapers published in Augsburg, Munich, Cologne and Karlsruhe. It is possible that it was on account of his resulting high-profile that at the end of 1864 he was able to accept a job offer from the Royal National Library in Karlsruhe as court librarian. He retained this post till 1867, but continued to work in Karlsruhe for the rest of his life. There is a suggestion that having now made his mark with the royal court of Baden, he hoped to move on to a career in the diplomatic service, but this came to nothing. The year after taking the librarianship, 1865, he married Therese Seuffert, to whom he had been engaged since 1862. She was the daughter of the late Munich based jurist and writer Josef Adam Seuffert. The marriage would produce three recorded daughters. In 1867 he transferred to the national archives department, as ' (Senior Archivist) in succession to Joseph Bader. He was promoted to the top job - Director of the National Archive - in 1985. He was still in post twenty years later when he fell ill and died. The second half of the nineteenth century saw massive investment in museums and libraries, reflecting rapid growth in middle class wealth and a surge in national consciousness and education investment across Europe. During von Weech's time in office the (National Archive in Karlsruhe) was raised to the status of an Academic Institution. A new prestigious building (see ), alongside the \\"Hildapromenade\\", set new standards. In 1888 he was appointed a member of the city's recently established \\"City Archives Commission\\" (\\"st√§dtische Archivkommission\\"), and it was on behalf of the commission that between 1895 and 1904 he published a three volume history of the city, in the process cementing his reputation as a formidable historian of the region.  Honours  Titles awarded to Friedrich von Weech included \\"Gentleman of the Chamber of the Grand Duchy of Baden\\" (\\"Gro√üherzoglich Badischer Kammerherrn\\") and \\"Privy Councillor\\" (\\"Geheimrat\\"). In 1872 he was a recipient of the newly created \\"Order of Olga\\" (W√ºrttemberg). In 1960 the street \\"Weechstra√üe\\" in Karksruhe's new \\"East City\\" development was named after him.

Early life Born in Liverpool, England, to parents William and Wilhelmina Clarke, Emma, along with her sister Jane, who was also one of the earliest known black women footballers in Britain, grew up in Bootle. She worked as a confectioner's apprentice from the age of 15, and received her formative sporting education playing the game in her neighbourhood streets, in an area very close to where the suffragist Helen Graham Matthews lived. Matthews later gave her name to the team for which Clarke played at the beginning of the twentieth century, Mrs Graham's XI. Football career Clarke normally played as an outfield player, described by the South Wales Daily News as \\"the fleet footed dark girl on the right wing\\". Her club football career began in 1895, when she made her debut for the British Ladies, not an international team, but an early all women's football club patronized by Lady Florence Dixie. A number of individuals named \\"Clarke\\" make it difficult to provide precise details as to Clarke's career with the British Ladies, however, photographic evidence shows her lined up in the official team photo for the \\"South\\" team of the British Ladies in their inaugural exhibition match,For their exhibition games, the British Ladies would often field two teams from the club, named either \\"North\\" and \\"South\\" or \\"Red\\" and \\"Blue\\" a game watched by more than 10,000Variously reported in newspapers at the time as up to 11,000 people at Crouch End, London, a game that Clarke's \\"South\\" team lost 7‚Äì1. Although the first record of a woman's team coming together to play football occurred on 7 May 1881, at Edinburgh's Easter Road Stadium in a match, billed as a Scotland v England international (though it was not a full international in the modern sense of the word),Domeneghetti, R. (2014), From the Back Page to the Front Room: Football's journey through the English media, p. 155 Ockley Books. . Retrieved February 2015. this match is generally recognized as the first women's football match played under association rules in front of such a crowd and at what was then a notable ground and is thus generally considered to be the first organized game of women's football. The following year, Clarke made her debut for Mrs Graham's XI, selected as part of the team which toured Scotland that year. Interest in the tour was substantial and their matches regularly attracted crowds numbering in the thousands. As well as receiving payment for expenses, it is estimated that Clarke would have been paid approximately a shilling a week while on the tour. In 1897, she made an appearance for a team described as \\"The New Woman and Ten of Her Lady Friends\\" against \\"Eleven Gentlemen\\". The ladies team were victorious 3‚Äì1, although the report at the time made it clear the feelings about the women's game at the time, describing the game as a grotesque, although conceding that \\"in the second half the ladies distinguished themselves\\". It is also thought that her sister played in this match. Clarke's career as a footballer continued until at least 1903. Legacy For decades, Clarke and her contribution to the game was mistaken for goalkeeper Carrie Boustead, once described by a journalist as \\"a coloured lady of Dutch build\\", who was later confirmed to be white. Clarke was rediscovered by artist Stuart Gibbs only when a photo of the team that toured Scotland was discovered. He then identified that the player in question was Clarke, not Boustead. Theatre company, Futures Theatre, wrote a play called Offside, which celebrates the contribution women have made to the game and which dramatizes the story of Clarke.

He gained the gold medal there in 1803, for an original group of The Death of Meleager. In 1807 Hay was a competitor for the Pitt and Nelson memorials in the London Guildhall. He developed a line of plaster figures designed to hold lamps, working with architects who designed niches for them, such as Lewis Wyatt.

Since 2010, he has been chairman of the Iloilo City Trade and Investment Board (ICTIPB) and the CEO and founder of Eon Group of Companies which holds the first waterpark in Visayas, and the first to run solar-powered in the Philippines, Waterworld Iloilo. Beneath the corporation, are varying establishments such as a tourism agency, multiple hospitality businesses, food establishments, candy, juice and noodle manufacturing, and developments of housing and property. The Eon Group of Companies is known as \\"one of the top developers in Iloilo. \\" Tiu has been awarded the Golden Salakot Award, which is \\"the highest honor in recognition for outstanding achievements defined by personal or institutional success and philanthropic involvement\\", by the Iloilo City mayor, Jed Patrick Mabilog in 2012. Tiu has been the centre of interviews from high-profile meda outlets such as Rappler.com and ABS-CBN. Announced in late 2017, Tiu invested 350 million pesos into another branch of Waterworld in Mandaue, Cebu, making it one of the most expensive waterparks in the Philippines. Not only will it be one of the largest waterparks in the Philippines, the 3-hectare project will boast as a major entertainment complex, housing a large amusement park, and resort.  Early life  Tiu was born in Iloilo City, Iloilo, Philippines to Luz Tiu (n√©e Hupan) and Fernando Tiu, a wealthy family of Chinese descent, who were successful, self-made traders who operated a candy store in Iloilo, throughout the 1950s. Felix's grandparents were Chinese immigrants, with ancestral ties from the Fujian province, who migrated to the Philippines due to business opportunities in the 1900s. He finished his high school education at Central Philippine University. Tiu's father's business shut down because of mismanagement due to overexpansion, resulting in Felix, the eldest of four, to drop out of private school in 1974 to assist in the re-enterprising of his father's business. In 1979, at 23, he married Bernadette Tiu, (n√©e Chavez) and a fast growing family did not come far after: by 1987, Felix and Bernadette already had 4 children. During the early years of assistance in the restoration of his father's business, Felix and his wife, Bernadette, having to provide for their young family, sold homemade tamarind balls, halo halo and other local sweets on the streets of Iloilo City, to cope with financial struggles after the disperse of his father's fortune.  Career  = 1980s-2000s: Early Career = Upon the aftermath of the failed reestablishment of his father's confectionery business, Tiu and his wife founded their own trading company, in 1985, Goldstar Philippine Traders, selling oil, flour, margarine, and other baking goods using his savings of 10,000‚Ç± from previous business ventures. Felix opened Eon Philippines Industries Corporation, in 1995, which manufactured various local staples like bihon and sotanghon as well as flavoured juices, with lollipops being the main product. This venture was established as a reminiscent to Felix's father's business, then in 1998, Felix opened a travel and tourism agency called Eon Travel and Tours in SM City Iloilo. In 1991, with a vision to provide \\"market vendors a chance at their businesses\\" and to support other local businesses, Tiu ventured into low interest lending and in 5 years has created a \\"very modest lending portfolio\\". = 2000s-2010s: Eon Group of Companies and Local Ventures = At the turn of the millennium, in 2000, Tiu purchased a property and constructed the Eon Centennial Plaza Hotel, which is now known as \\"one of the leading business hotels in the heart of Iloilo\\", accommodating multiple restaurants over the years such as Frances, Joaqui‚Äôs, Cups n‚Äô Saucers, and more recently, The Leaf. Eon Realty Development Corporation started in 2001 and has built over 4,500 homes to date, with families in the low-medium income bracket as their target market. As of 2017, they encompass over 12 housing and subdivision projects and became the first company to build on townhouses in Iloilo. In 2004, Eon Group of Companies branched out into developing neighboring islands, launching Guimaras Memorial Park in Guimaras, Philippines. In 2006, Eon Centennial Resort Hotel and Convention Center was erected in Jaro, Iloilo City, which housed a convention center to hold up to 3,000 people. Exploreiloilo.com has named Centennial Resort Hotel and Convention Center \\"a first class year-round family destination\\". In 2015, the announcement of Waterworld Iloilo resulted in the revision of the convention center, leading the enterprise to change its name to Eon Centennial Resort Hotel and Waterpark. = 2010s-present: Waterworld Franchise and Nation-wide Ventures = In 2013, Felix opened the first paninda and paluto style restaurant in Iloilo, Merkado Seafood Restaurant, where an inclusive wet market allows fresh seafood, meat and vegetables to be purchased, with the customer deciding how it is to be cooked. Due to Typhoon Yolanda's impact on Panay's fresh seafood supply, infection led to the restaurant closing its doors on November that year. Waterworld Iloilo was announced in 2015, to replace the convention center constructed under the then-named, Centennial Resort Hotel and Convention Center in Jaro, Iloilo City. It opened on December 16, 2017 and became Philippines' first solar- powered waterpark . It comprises over 20 different slides and rides, 2 pools, 8 luxury cabanas, 3 restaurants, a souvenir and novelty shop, and a lazy river which surrounds the perimeter of the park. Waterworld Iloilo has been featured in various media outlets such as Panay News, The Guardian, The Iloilo Metropolitan Times, Island Living and Hugging Horizons. Due to the overwhelming success of Waterworld Iloilo, Felix Tiu announced that the Eon Group of Companies will expand the Waterworld franchise into Mandaue, Cebu. The project, known as Waterworld Cebu, will be valued at over 350 million pesos, making it one of the most expensive waterparks in the Philippines. Not only will it be one of the largest waterparks in the Philippines, but the 3-hectare project will boast as a major entertainment complex, housing a large amusement park, and resort as well. It is set to open late 2019.

He made his first appearance in the main show during the episode broadcast on 21 September 2016. The character was introduced alongside his twin brother Leo Tanaka (Tim Kano), and they arrive in Erinsborough to find their long-lost biological father. The show's producer had planned their stories out six months in advance and was excited about the prospect of them joining the series. Both Honda and Kano auditioned for both roles and were later awarded their respective parts. David is characterised as the more self-conscious and socially awkward of the Tanaka twins, but he is career minded and confident in his role as a doctor. Writers developed an issue lead storyline for David which saw him struggling to come to terms with his sexuality. Having been pressured by his great-grandmother Kazuko Sano (Linda Chin) to settle down with a woman, David finds it difficult to deal with his attraction to the openly gay character Aaron Brennan (Matt Wilson). The mystery of David and Leo's paternity served as the character's most prominent story during their first year in the show. Long established character Paul Robinson (Stefan Dennis) was later revealed to be their father, linking the characters to one of the show's original families. Other storylines include posing as the father of Paige Smith's (Olympia Valance) unborn child and being homophobic towards Aaron to conceal his own sexuality. David's gay storyline proved to be rather divisive among some critics of the genre. Casting The character and Honda's casting was announced on 22 August 2016, along with Tim Kano who plays David's twin brother Leo Tanaka. Of his casting, Honda said, \\"I feel so privileged to have the opportunity to join the regular cast of Neighbours. To learn from such prominent and longstanding Australian talent is truly seeing my dreams fulfilled.\\" David and Leo come to Erinsborough in the hope of solving \\"a family mystery\\". David is a doctor, who has \\"a social conscience\\". The show held a lengthy casting process for the characters because they wanted to find similar looking actors. Honda described it as a \\"strange\\" process with numerous call backs. He and Kano auditioned for both David and Leo to discover who was better suited to each role. Kano's first audition required him to switch from playing either character in a matter of seconds. Honda added that it was \\"tough\\" audition because the characters are completely different. Development =Webisodes and introduction= Neighbours' executive producer Jason Herbison had planned the duo's storyline six months in advance. He was \\"delighted\\" to hire Honda and Kano and described watching them play the characters he had envisioned a \\"very thrilling\\" experience. Ahead of his first appearance in the main show, the character was featured in a series of webisodes titled Road Trip. The series focuses on the brothers' road trip on the way to Erinsborough, where they were joined by Leo's love interest Milly (Eliza Charley). The webisodes were designed to give viewers a chance to watch the \\"brotherly dynamic\\" the Tanaka twins share. In addition they could witness the different personalities the two characters have. David and Leo made their first screen appearance in the main show during the episode broadcast on 21 September 2016. They arrive to look after their great-grandmother Kazuko Sano (Linda Chin), who has been admitted to the local hospital. Kano revealed that the twins had another motive for being in the area as they were searching for lost relative. When David and Leo spend more time in Erinsborough they befriend Aaron Brennan (Matt Wilson), Amy Williams (Zoe Cramond) and Elly Conway (Jodi Anasta), setting the characters up to become intertwined in one another's storylines. =Characterisation= David is characterised as kind and intelligent doctor who was born in Parramatta to an ambitious mother. Her influence taught David the importance of excelling in his medical career. His backstory details his teenage years spent focusing on studying instead of socialising. This meant the character had missed out on \\"normal teenage rites of passage\\" which resulted in him being socially awkward and self-conscious. Honda told a reporter from Tenplay that David had preferred to concentrate on his career rather than pursue romance. David been unable to understand how relationships work and coming to Erinsborough begins to change that. Playing a medic on the show requires Honda to research specific medical scenarios for hospital scenes. The production team also hired a medical adviser on-set to ensure factual accuracy. The actor told All About Soap's Claire Crick that his character was born to be a doctor. Despite it lacking in social scenarios, David's confidence excels in his work because it is a job he loves. Honda assessed that \\"when it comes to medicine David knows where he is and that he's good at it.\\" Despite being twins, David and Leo have different personalities. David is \\"more serious and conscientious\\" planning out his career path, in comparison to his impulsive entrepreneurial brother Leo. Honda believes that the two characters do share similarities ranging from a strong work ethic and sense of discipline. Though he noted that their methods of achieving their goals are completely different. They also have conflicting morals but both believe they do things for the right reasons. Honda has described the pair as having an unspoken and \\"innate brotherly twin\\" connection which is apparent on-screen. The actor said: \\"it's underlying every line of dialogue and I think that Tim and I are pulling that off.\\" Honda and Kano had natural chemistry off-set which helped them to play twins. They are both half Japanese with Caucasian mothers, which they thought was a \\"crazy\\" coincidence that helped them bond. =Paternity mystery= David's main story following his introduction to the show was his desire to find his biological father. David's initial findings lead him to a homeless man named Bradley Satchwell (Alfred Nicdao). He had been banned from visiting their mother in hospital when she gave birth. Various scenes are played out to suggest Bradley is their father. But the character is reluctant to reveal details and run away. Months later Leo finds Bradley and bribes him with money to spend time with David. Bradley goes for a medical check up and is again reluctant to talk about his past. Writers introduced a \\"new twist\\" into their mystery story by ruling out Bradley as the twins father. David runs a blood test which reveals Bradley cannot be related to them. Writers developed the story further with the introduction of Jasmine Udagawa (Kaori Maeda-Judge), an investor in the local hotel Lassiters. She has a vendetta against Leo and keeps a secret file titled \\"Tanaka\\". Amy over hears Jasmine telling Terese Willis (Rebekah Elmaloglou) that Leo could potentially inherit Lassiters and she informs him about the news. This leads Leo to believe he is related to the Udagawa family, who are also Japanese. Jasmine offers the Tanakas ten thousand dollars to leave Erinsborough. He refuses and it leads Leo to suspect that Jasmine's uncle Hiro Udagawa is their father. Amy joins Leo in his search to track down Hiro to his last known address. But their search is shortened when they discover Hiro died the previous year. The show introduced a further red herring by releasing information suggesting that historic character Scott Robinson was the father of the twins. Producers rehired actress Jenny Young to reprise her role as Kim Taylor (now Tanaka) after a thirty-two year absence. She is revealed to be David and Leo's mother, having been pregnant during her last appearance in 1985. Kim had been romantically involved with Scott, suggesting him as a possible father. The 2017 storyline develops as David discovers Kim's connection to Scott, and confronts his mother. Kim denies Scott is the twins' father but is shocked to learn Leo has taken Amy away for a romantic weekend. She rushes to prevent the pair from sleeping together. This makes David think his theory is correct because Kim would not want Amy, who is Scott's relative, to sleep with Leo. This episode brought about the culmination of the mystery storyline as the Tanaka's biological father was revealed. In one final \\"twist\\" in the storyline, Scott's brother Paul Robinson (Stefan Dennis) was revealed to be their father. This meant that Amy is David and Leo's half-sister, which shocks the latter having fallen in love with her. The actors knew about the outcome of the story when it began but were forced to be secretive. Kano told Sarah Ellis from Inside Soap that Kim was not certain Paul was their father but knew he could be. He added that could not wait for the audiences reaction to the shock revelation. Honda later explained that his character was nervous about forming a relationship with Paul because he is a \\"conservative businessman\\". But unlike Leo, he accepts the news that Paul is their father. He also researched the Robinson family's history within the show to provide realism. Honda added \\"There has been a lot of thought in terms of history and trying to stay true to everything. We wanted to make sure that it didn't come across as just a random thing that was thrown together. We thought a lot about it.\\" =Sexuality= David has been portrayed as struggling to come to terms with his sexuality. When he arrives in Erinsborough it becomes apparent that he is attracted to men but David ignores these feelings. Honda said that David struggles and feels pressured by those around him to make a decision. He decides to focus on work until he can make sense of his feelings. The actor explained that \\"he doesn't quite understand who he is or what he is attracted to. He thinks he's meant to fancy girls, but it's never really worked out with them in the past.\\" Honda felt pressured portraying a sensitive subject that real people experience. He wanted to make David's story \\"respectful and understanding\\" for the show's audience. On-screen Kazuko pesters David to find himself a girlfriend to settle down with. Honda said that because of Kazuko's interference David presumes he may have not met a compatible female and even questions if there is something \\"wrong\\" with himself. When David spends time with Amy, the pair share a kiss but David knows he is not attracted to her. The actor told Rachael Gavin from TV Soap that Amy is \\"an almost perfect person\\" for David but there is no \\"chemistry\\" between them when they kiss. He then begins to spend more time with Aaron and there is an attraction between them. Assessing David's situation Honda explained that \\"It tortures him because he can't understand it. He's always tried to intellectualise it and once stuff develops with Aaron he comes to more of an understanding of what is going on and then he start to break down some of the barriers.\\" Aaron believes that David is gay following an intense moment the pair share. He warns Amy of his suspicions and confronts David, who then denies it claiming to be heterosexual. Aaron organises a day out for Kazuko and he urges David to question her about his father. She does not react well and David blames Aaron. He apologises to David, who thinks Aaron is trying to seduce him. He insults Aaron in an homophobic manner. David later apologises for his behaviour which leads to their \\"most intense\\" and \\"charged\\" moment together - but David stops himself from kissing Aaron and runs away. The storyline reached a turning point as David decides to confide his fears about being gay to the local priest Father Jack Callahan (Andrew James Morley). But writers were quick to add more turmoil to David's sexuality struggle. His great-grandmother's health begins to deteriorate in hospital. David visits Kazuko and she orders him to not pursue his homosexual feelings any further. She then dies which leaves David feeling as though he has to adhere to her dying wish. David receives encouragement from Paige to accept his feelings for men. David then realises he should be honest about both his sexuality and the baby. A promotional trailer released by Neighbours teased David paying a late night visit to Aaron's home to confess his feelings. But in a story twist as the scenes aired Aaron reveals he has just slept with another man forcing David to hide his feelings once again. When David comes out to his family and friends he tries to kiss Aaron. Wilson told Tenplay that David acts on impulse and wants to explore his sexuality after being honest about it. He explained that Aaron wants David to have fun with other men to fully understand his sexuality. Although David interprets Aaron's advise a rejection, Honda believed that David wasn't ready to be with anyone. =Relationship with Aaron Brennan= David and Aaron later begin a relationship, viewer reaction had been positive with many hoping they would get together, even earning them the portmanteau \\"daaron\\". Honda compared the pairing as a traditional soap opera on/off relationship. He noted that \\"everything that's happened with Aaron and David has been justified and there is a reality to it, which I quite like.\\" Wilson branded their relationship as an \\"emotional rollercoaster\\", adding that they get along well with much chemistry but can suddenly become estranged because of a miscommunication. Aaron had spent many episodes pondering whether or not to be with David. Wilson believed his character was wary of David having only recently been accepting of his own sexuality. He thought it best to let David explore and not trap him in a relationship. Ultimately Aaron found his love for David to difficult to ignore. Wilson described the character's personalities stating that \\"David‚Äôs everything Aaron wants to be ‚Äì a smart, successful, really nice guy with no enemies. Meanwhile, Aaron is everything David would like to be ‚Äì open, free-spirited and enthusiastic about everything. They‚Äôre very different, but opposites attract.\\" Writers later devised another break up for the characters. They began by planning a \\"disastrous proposal\\" of marriage, which has David asking Aaron to be his husband. Shocked by his proposal Aaron rejects him. The storyline coincided with the legalisation of same-sex marriage in Australia. Neighbours executive producer Jason Herbison has delighted with the change. Though he believed that the characters should be like all soap couple and face challenges before marrying. This was followed by the introduction of Aaron's ex-boyfriend Rory Zemiro (Ash Williams) who comes between them. Aaron met up with Rory in Paris but never told David. Rory tells David about his encounter with Aaron but fails to mention Aaron remained faithful. David ends his relationship with Aaron who reacts by seeking solace in Rory. The break-up shocked fans and some even yelled at Honda over it. The actor added that the fans believed David had done wrong and should forgive Aaron. David and Aaron get back together following his relationship with Rafael (see below). Honda told Sasha Morris from the Daily Star that \\"the audience like to see a couple fight for their romance and fight to be with each other, and David definitely needs to grow from what has happened in the past.\\" He also hoped that David and Aaron would be more intimate on-screen. Honda told Katie Baillie from Metro that Aaron wanted David back the entire time they were apart. David feels more confident to take charge of their relationship, which the actor thought was \\"a nice full circle\\" for the story. Their relationship is soon strengthened by a proposal of marriage to which they both agree. Producers planned the wedding storyline following the legalisation of same-sex marriage in Australia which occurred in December 2017, following a public referendum. They then hired LGBTQ+ rights activist Magda Szubanski to play a marriage celebrant to officiate their wedding. To celebrate the event promotional photographs were released of the actors holding a Ramsay Street sign decorated in the colours of the pride flag. They also revealed that the wedding would air in September 2018. Neighbours executive producer Jason Herbison revealed that his team had been working on the storyline during the referendum. They worried that the story about \\"love and equality\\" may not have been legal when it needed to air. He added that he was delighted when it was legalised because viewers would witness an \\"iconic moment come to life on screen\\". Wilson said that many people he knew believed that Australia's previous stance on gay marriage was outdated. He expressed his delight that David and Aaron would become the first gay couple to legally marry on Australian television. Honda branded it a \\"historic moment in Australian television.\\" =Relationship with Rafael Humphreys= Ryan Thomas plays David's love interest Rafael HumphreysWhen David and Aaron ended their relationship for a brief period in early 2018, writers created a new romance between David and Rafael Humphreys (Ryan Thomas). Rafael is introduced into the series as a \\"troubled\\" and \\"secretive\\" character. In addition he also has a vendetta against David's father Paul. His romance with David is unexpected and not part of his plans. Thomas told Baillie from Metro that Rafael's feelings for David \\"caught him off guard\\" and the emotions he feels cause him added stress. When the pair decide to become intimate David discovers that Rafael has substantial scarring on his back. Rafael feels insecure and thinks David will not be attracted to him once he sees his scars. David reacts positively and caring and the two have sex. Honda told Daniel Kilkelly from Digital Spy that his character dealt with the situation well. He explained that \\"I think the scene is a true expos√© for both characters. David is so happy because he feels that Rafael has finally opened up to him.\\" Writers created the scene but the director of the episode allowed Honda and Thomas to change the scene. They wanted to make it as \\"powerful as possible\\". Neighbours is a G-Rated programme but the scene was more intense and intimate than previous depictions of same-sex intimacy. It received praise from viewers and was acknowledged by various media outlets including Gay Times and the Evening Standard. Rafael begins to scheme with Sue Parker (Kate Gorman) to destroy Paul's life. When David introduces Rafael to Aaron, the latter becomes suspicious and suspects his involvement with David is not genuine. Aaron sneaks into Rafael's room and finds evidence of his association with Sue. Aaron clashes with Rafael and rips his shirt off and publicly exposes his scars. Rafael admits to sabotaging Paul's business and causing the accident which harmed Leo. He reveals that he believes Paul was directly involved in a fire which killed his mother while she was working inside Paul's factory. However, Paul is forgiving and decides to help Rafael get answers about his mother's death. Paul manages to prove his innocence and they learn Dakota Davies (Sheree Murphy) was involved. As Rafael was only a guest character his departure story was created around the discovery about Dakota. David wants to resume his relationship with Rafael, deciding that he can forgive his deceit. But Rafael decides to go to the United Kingdom in search of Dakota and breaks-up with David. Honda decided that David and Rafael's relationship was completely different to the one he shared with Aaron. He believed that David had \\"more passion\\" and \\"lustful\\" scenes with Rafael, adding \\"those scenes were powerful because they were intimate.\\" Storylines While visiting his great-grandmother at Erinsborough Hospital, David befriends Paige Smith (Olympia Valance), who tells him about Angelina Jackson (Sarah Howett), a patient who has a brain tumour. When Karl Kennedy (Alan Fletcher) comes to check on Paige, David introduces himself and reveals that he is a first-year resident at a hospital in Sydney. He offers to contact renowned neurosurgeon Dr. Anward Adisa (Yasmin Bushby) about Angelina, earning Paige's gratitude. While talking to Karl about his residency, David memorises Karl's hospital system password. Aaron asks David and Leo about volunteering for the Blaze Outreach program and David drops off a first aid kit to Amy. She later catches him logging onto a computer using Karl's details. He admits to her and Karl that he is looking for his father, and Karl later finds information about a man named Bradley, who was banned from seeing David and Leo's mother in the hospital. Aaron sets David and Amy up on a date. David asks Kazuko about his father but she cannot remember. David takes Kazuko out for the day. His friend Aaron Brennan brings a golf cart to them, so Kazuko does not have to walk. David shows Kazuko a picture of Bradley Satchwell, but she denies knowing him. She refuses to tell David who his father is and asks to be taken back to the hospital. David confides in Father Jack that he likes men. In hospital Kazuko's condition worsens and she tells David to renounce homosexuality, just before she dies. David tells Aaron to never speak to him again and tells Jack he was just confused about his sexuality. David supports Paige when she learns she is pregnant, and he helps her when she suffers a miscarriage scare. They later agree to tell everyone that he is the father of her baby, as Paige feels she is unable to reveal who the real father is. Paige's ex-boyfriend, Father Jack is jealous of David and Paige's friendship, and that David is being named as the father of his baby. David and Leo want to know about their father. At first they think it may be a homeless man named Bradley Satchwell, who is taken to the hospital, where a blood test proves that he is not. Then new evidence indicates that their father may be a man named Hiro, who died a year ago, and was related to the Udagawas. His relative Jasmine tries to prevent David and Leo from investigating the family link. Clive Gibbons (Geoff Paine) investigates an old lead but can find no evidence of Hiro being related to the Tanakas. Kim denies that Hiro is the father. When Leo and Amy go on a weekend break together intending to sleep together, Kim confesses that Amy's father Paul is the twin's father. David spends time with Paul and they begin to bond. He then decides to tell Leo, Paul and Amy that he is gay. David kisses Aaron, but feels rejected when Aaron tells him that he needs to date other men first to understand who he is. David is involved in an accident, when Amy's Ute crashes into the backpackers injuring both Piper Willis (Mavournee Hazel) and himself. The doctors' fear he may have brain damage and may have problems with his memory and speech, leaving Paul and Leo worried. While he is recovering, David flirts with his nurse Will Dempier (Christian Heath). Will later accuses David of reporting him for inappropriate behaviour, but Paul admits that he made the complaint. David invites Will out for a drink, and explains that he has only just come out and is nervous. Will walks David home and they kiss, but Will later declines to go on another date. David then dates Aaron's former partner Tom Quill (Kane Felsinger), but Tom ends their relationship when he realises David is more invested in it than he is. David then suspects that Tom broke up with him to rekindle his relationship with Aaron, leading to him falling out with Aaron. David risks his job to treat Leo's friend Mannix Foster (Sam Webb), who has been stabbed. He steals painkillers from the hospital and tells Leo their sibling relationship is over. When Xanthe Canning (Lilly Van der Meer) is accused of taking the painkillers, David confesses his guilt to Clive Gibbons (Geoff Paine). Aaron and David make up and begin a relationship. When David and Leo receive an eviction notice, Aaron invites him to move in with him. But Paul buys the apartment next door to his and joins them together, so David chooses to stay with his family. He decides to propose to Aaron, who does not accept and walks off. He later explains to David that he felt overwhelmed, and also distracted by his brothers' problems. David admits it was intended as more of a gesture to show he was serious about their relationship. After David learns Aaron has kept Ned Willis's (Ben Hall) involvement in an illegal fight club from him, they argue and David goes out for a bike ride. He is struck by Amy's ute, which is being driven by a tired Kyle Canning (Chris Milligan). Terese finds David and he is rushed to hospital, where he has to undergo surgery to remove a kidney. When the other kidney starts to fail, David is put on dialysis and a donor is sought. David's condition worsens when he gets an infection and his other organs start to shut down. Leo flies back to Erinsborough to get tested, but he is not a match. Harlow Robinson (Jemma Donovan) asks her father Robert Robinson (Adam Hunter) to get tested and when he is found to be a match, he agrees to donate his kidney. Shortly before the surgery, Robert escapes from the hospital. Harlow persuades him to return and he goes through with the transplant. As he recovers, David reads his medical file and learns Roxy Willis (Zima Anderson) was also a match. She apologises for not telling anyone, as she was scared, and David forgives her. In 2020, David and Aaron plans on having a child, via surrogate and ask Pierce's former partner Lisa Rowsthorn (Jane Allsop) to be their surrogate, but Lisa declines as she's pregnant with someone else's child. When Finn's memories returned and terrorise their family and friends, David blames himself for not noticing anything suspicious about Finn. David is not happy when Aaron was late for their foster parent meeting with a social worker, and learn that Paul made Aaron hide stolen goods that Mannix stole, and confronts Paul at the Waterhole, blaming him for nearly ruining their chances at becoming foster parents, leaving his relationship with Paul strained. Reception David and Aaron's partnership was nominated for Best Soap Couple at the 2018 Digital Spy Reader Awards; they came in seventh place with 5.3% of the total votes. Daniel Kilkelly (Digital Spy) viewed the Road Trip webisodes and observed David as \\"less confident and a whole lot more insecure\\" than Leo. He added that the character appeared to have a bigger conscience than his twin. Annabel Ross of The Canberra Times said that Neighbours used \\"some refreshingly real terminology\\" when David and Paige discussed his sexuality. She added that she could never imagine the same conversation being screened on rival soap opera Home and Away. Lewis Corner (Gay Times) said that \\"our temperature has suddenly soared\\" following David's introduction to the show. The character's sexuality storyline also re-engaged his attention to the show. Sandra Powell writing for What's on TV believed that David had been \\"a man on a mission\\" from the beginning in his quest to find his father. Writing for Stuff.co.nz, Kerry Harvey said \\"the twins are starkly different in personality with David a doctor with a social conscience, while Kano's Leo is a shameful opportunist.\\" A writer from Soap World said \\"ever since the mysterious Tanaka brothers arrived in Erinsborough questions about David‚Äôs love life have been swirling.\\" They added that David and Aaron's scenes were \\"fraught with tension\\". Anthony D. Langford often scrutinised the character in his weekly TVSource Magazine column. He leveled criticism at Neighbours slow writing and development of David's paternity mystery, personality and relationships. He believed that David's sexuality story was too long-winded. When David began to regret posing as the father to Paige's child, the critic commented, \\"I'm glad as this story has dragged on long enough.\\" Of David's paternity, the columnist opined that it was a story that became \\"bigger\\" as it progressed and appeared to be linked to the show's history. He added his hopes of the Tanaka's father being an important character to the show or it risked the storyline being aired for no reason. He also took issue with David's possible romance with Aaron, opining that the two did not share enough screen-time to form a relationship. In addition he accused the show of missing out important scenes the two could have shared. Langford grew so tired of waiting that he later scathed \\"this show is dragging out Aaron and David getting together to the point of it being ridiculous.\\" He also pondered whether Neighbours were intentionally avoiding the portrayal of gay male intimacy. Langford was also unsure David and Aaron were well matched. He branded David as an \\"okay\\" character lacking personality. He did not believe Aaron should be partnered with yet another \\"bland nice guy\\" such as David, as it risked writers being unable to create stories for the \\"dull coupling\\".

In the summer of 1634 the Jin attacked and conquered the port city of L√ºshun from Ming. Background The city of L√ºshun had been briefly taken once before by the Jin in 1622, but was retaken soon after. In the spring of 1633 the ex-Ming commanders Kong Youde and Geng Zhongming defected to the Jin after their rebellion was suppressed by Ming forces. They offered their expertise in naval warfare to take L√ºshun. Course of battle In the summer of 1634 a Jin army attacked L√ºshun. After six days the Jin had lost 4,000 men and were still unable to take the city. However the garrison was suffering from dwindling ammunition. Seeing that defeat was imminent, its commander Huang Long sent a messenger with his seals of office back to Beijing. The Jin attacked from both sea and land on the seventh day. Although the Ming managed to fend off the naval invasion, the land assault managed to take the walls and brought the fight into the city. Huang and the city garrisons fought until they were surrounded, at which point Huang committed suicide and all his troops were butchered. In total, 5,000 Ming soldiers died in the siege. Aftermath The Jin left 2,500 men to garrison L√ºshun and it was used as the base of operations for mopping up Ming remnants in the Bohai Sea. References Bibliography .  (alk. paper)  * .

Description  The Winzererstra√üe starts at the Hessstra√üe at the Massmannspark and runs almost parallel to Schleissheimer Stra√üe, the road ends today in the North, after crossing the Ackermannstra√üe, southeast of the Olympiaberg. There are 11 architectural monuments, such as, the barracks building of the Prinz-Leopold-Barracks or the Obelisk in the triangle Winzererstra√üe / Lothstra√üe / Georgenstra√üe. The Bavarian Ministry of Labor, Social Affairs, Family and Integration is located on Winzererstra√üe 9, the Munich Wood Research (TU M√ºnchen) is located on Winzererstra√üe 45, the Munich Department of Finance is located at Winzererstra√üe 47a, the City Archive is located at Winzererstra√üe 68, an outside office of the Federal Office of Freight Transport can be found in house number 52, and the Higher Labor Court and the Munich Labor Court are located at Winzererstra√üe 106.  History  Aerial photo from 1900 The street is named after the knight and Landsknecht leader Winzerer, which in 1525 prevented the encroaching of the peasant wars on Bavaria. It runs on a part of the Oberwiesenfeld. Starting in 1902, the Bavarian army occupied the Prinz-Leopold-Kaserne. The casino (\\"Offizierspeiseanstalt\\") at Winzererstra√üe 41 - in the 1980s, until a fire, was temporarily used as a chemical factory - was later a popular film site, for example by director Rainer Werner Fassbinder or for Schimanski-Tatorts. At that time, the filmmakers had simply completed the arduous walls for the shooting with papier-m√¢ch√© and the like. Around 1905, it found itself, between the Lothstra√üe and the Elisabethstrasse, which had not yet been fully developed, along the Winzererstra√üe existing building portion so the 1. Pionier battalions barracks, in which part of the Oberwiesenfeld barracks was found east of the Infanteriestra√üe. At that time, Winzererstra√üe had already been extended to Herzogstra√üe, but not asphalted. North of Herzogstra√üe, in 1941, just south of the later amassed Schuttberg, which later became the Olympiaberg, the diary Nordmolkerei Deller KG was founded, and until the end of the 1990s was still in operation. In the year 2000, the diary was demolished and the residential complex at the Olympiapark was built. After 1946 to 1992, the Winzererstra√üe formed, between Lerchenauer Stra√üe and Lothstra√üe, the border between the municipalities of Schwabing-West and Neuhausen-Oberwiesenfeld. It was only with the construction of Ackermannstra√üe in the late 1960s, that the northern part of Winzererstra√üe (from the height of house number 89) to the Lerchenauer Stra√üe was paved, as part of the construction measures for the 1972 Summer Olympics. In the 1970s, the access road from Lerchenauer Stra√üe to the Winzererstra√üe was closed for cars. Later, the sub-area below the Olympiaberg was converted, from the present residential complex at the Olympiapark to the Lerchenauer Stra√üe, so that the road ends at the level of the residential complex. 1980 until 1981, an 11-meter-long tree trunk section from Africa was set up for research purposes at the Wood Institute on Winzererstra√üe 45. Since 1996, the Winzererstra√üe between Lerchenauer Stra√üe and Ackermannstra√üe forms the border between the municipalities of Schwabing-West and Milbertshofen-Am Hart.

Le Juif et la France (Jews and France) was an anti-Semitic propaganda exhibition that took place in Paris from 5 September 1941 to 15 January 1942 during the German occupation of France in the Second World War. A film version of the exhibition came out in French cinemas in October 1941. It was organized and financed by the propaganda arm of the German military administration in France via the Institut d'√©tude des questions juives (IEQJ) (Institute for the Study of Jewish Questions) under regulation by the Gestapo and attracted around half a million visitors. This exhibition was based on the work of Professor at the School of Anthropology in Paris, author of the book Comment reconna√Ætre le Juif? (How to recognize a Jew?) published in November 1940. It had pretensions of being \\"scientific\\". It was opened by Carltheo Zeitschel and Theodor Dannecker on 5 September 1941 at the Palais Berlitz. Le Juif et la France was a multi-media exhibition with large panels, photographs, texts, and sculptures. As its focal point, it included a huge sculpture of an old, bearded Jew with exaggerated features, clutching a globe as if intent on world domination. The intent was to portray Jews as a polluting element on French society, intent on financial and political control of France and the world, in control of the media, and responsible for Marxism, Communism, and most of the ills of society. A large sculpture of a female athlete symbolizing France shown defeating two repulsive, old stereotypically Jewish figures dominated the hall; it was named \\"France Liberating Itself from the Jews.\\" The exhibition opened two weeks after the second large Paris roundup of JewsAugust 20‚Äì25, 1941, 4232 men arrested: Michel Laffitte, Juif dans la France allemande : institutions, dirigeants et communaut√©s au temps de la Shoah, √©d.

In reality the financial supporters of the exhibition were the Paris office of the German Security Service (Sicherheitsienst?) and the information section of the German Embassy.Philippe Bourdrel, Histoire des juifs de France, volume II, √©d. Among other things, a spider symbolized \\"Jewry feasting on the blood of Our France\\", and as mentioned, a sculpture of a hideous wandering Jew seizing the world in his talons at the feet of \\"New France\\" ... Besides that, the exhibition also stigmatized a number of personalities from various professions, and in particular the then-famous furniture merchant Wolff Levitan, radio journalist Jean-Michel Grunebaum, journalist , playwright Henri Bernstein, producer Bernard Natan and politician L√©on Blum. Attendance figures differ according to the source consulted. Some spoke of 155,000 visitors,Alan Riding, Et la f√™te continue : La vie culturelle √† Paris sous l'Occupation, √©d. others claimed 500,000 paid entrants, with as many free and half-off tickets, as claimed by the collaborationist authorities for the Paris region.Philippe Bourdrel, Histoire des juifs de France [History of the Jews of France], volume II, ed.

The New Indian Express also labelled the film as \\"promising work\\" stating \\"lending a realistic tone to his story telling, the director avoids the clich√©d approach to such themes\\" and that \\"it's more an emotional take on the subject as seen from the perspective of the victim and her parents, than a suspenseful, investigative mode of treatment\\". The Times of India wrote \\"There are two ways to look at Nisabdham. If you are the glass-half-full type, you would agree that the tone wildly swings between somewhat tactful and full- blown melodrama; the staging feels TV serial-ish; the acting is ineffective; the court scenes are so dated\\" but \\"still, you might be able to brush aside many of the film's failures under the carpet because the film's intentions are noble and some of the moments bring a lump to your throat\\". Likewise, Sify.com concluded that \\"Nisabdham is indeed an honest attempt and it can be watchable for the message delivered but we only wish the director could've have taken more care with dialogues and execution.\\" A critic from The Hindu also noted \\"a genuine endeavour to make a socially-relevant film goes awry and Nisabdham is barely watchable\\".

Early life  Geoffrey Rothe Clarke was born in Midnapore, Bengal, on 1 July 1871. His father, George Richard Clarke of Waterford, Ireland, managed indigo plantations in West Bengal, while his schoolteacher mother, Margaret Elizabeth n√©e Brunskill of Mountmellick, Ireland, a keen artist, became headmistress of the Cainesville school at Mussoorie, India. Clarke completed his secondary education at the Corrig School, Kingstown, Ireland, that was run by an uncle. At the age of 19, Clarke entered Trinity College Dublin, commencing a four-year course in Classics and French on 10 October 1890. Clarke was the third of five children; his older sister Letitia Marion Dallas (alias Miss Darragh) became a well-known stage actress in Dublin, Manchester and London, while his younger brother Reginald joined the Indian Police in 1900, rising to become Chief Commissioner of Calcutta and receiving a Knighthood in 1922. Geoffrey and Reginald were among the few civil servants of that time who reached the top of the Indian bureaucracy without an English public school education.  Career in the Indian Civil Service  Clarke was accepted into the Indian Civil Service (ICS) in 1895 after passing the ICS competitive entrance examination. His first posting was to the Province of Bihar and Orissa as a District Magistrate. In 1903, he was transferred on promotion to the Indian Posts and Telegraphs Department as Director General for the Punjab Province, followed by similar and higher grade posts in Madras, Allahabad, Simla and Calcutta. He became involved in the amalgamation and rapid expansion of India's post and telephone services. First Official Airmail Flight by Humber-Sommer biplane India 1911 In February 1911, he authorised the world's first official aerial post, flying 6500 mail items five miles from Allahabad across the confluence of the Ganges and Yamuna rivers to Naini railway junction for onward transit. The aircraft was a biplane flown by the French pilot, Henri Pequet. The flight was one of a number of demonstrations given by the Humber Company at The United Provinces Exhibition. A surcharge of six Annas per item raised charitable funds in aid of Holy Trinity Church Allahabad constructing a hostel for Indian students. The Indian Post Office issued special stamps commemorating the event in 1961, 1986, and 2011. Clarke was recalled to London in 1916 to serve under David Lloyd George in the Ministry of Munitions in order to advise on overcoming the weapons supply crisis in Britain during World War I. He was sent on a special deputation to the United States and Canada to negotiate procurement contracts, and was awarded the Order of the British Empire in 1918 for this service. On return to India in March 1917, Clarke was appointed Postmaster General of Bengal and Assam. A year later, he was promoted to Director General of Posts and Telegraphs for British India (including Aden, Burma and Ceylon) as well as a member of the Legislative Council of the Governor-General of India. Over his seven-year tenure of the Post Office, he oversaw an increase in postal, telephone and telegraph traffic. By obtaining additional investment funding, wireless and telephone infrastructure were installed and usage, especially long distance, grew rapidly. For employees, no distinction of race was made in promotion or pay, such that by the end of his tenure, most higher appointments in the Post Office were held by Indian nationals, including his successor, GP Roy. Geoffrey Clarke (second left) with HK Raha and PW Mukerji, Indian delegates to the 1924 Stockholm International Postal Congress Under his guidance, the Postal Department was the first government department in India to grant official recognition to the organisation of its workers in independent trade unions. By 1925, the All India Postal Staff union had 70,000 members, and its elected President for that year, Muhammad Ali Jinnah, played a key role in the enactment of the Trade Union Act of 1926, whereby the trade union movement of the subcontinent, for the first time, acquired legal cover for unionising unorganised workers. Clarke represented the Government of India at the International Postal Congresses held in Madrid (1920), Stockholm (1924), and Paris (1925). At Stockholm he defeated a resolution to deprive India of its separate vote as a member of the International Postal Union. He was knighted in 1925.  Career in British Industry and during World War II  After retirement from Imperial Service in 1926, Clarke became a director on the boards of P&O;, British-India Steam Navigation Company and the Anglo-Iranian oil companies, and in 1934 became chairman of The Calcutta Tramways Company. On 1 January 1926, Clarke was employed by the Telegraph Construction and Maintenance Company (Telcon) as joint managing director. Although the firm had just received a large order to manufacture and lay a new 3500 nautical mile telegraph cable under the Pacific Ocean, its future was challenged by competition from short-wave radio and the economic depression of the early 1930s. In 1932, he was appointed sole Managing Director, reorganising and concentrating production facilities. Commercial prospects for the company improved when the product base was broadened to include the manufacture of power cables, high frequency cables and magnetic alloys. Clarke was largely responsible for the decision in 1935 to lay the first transatlantic telephone cable. In the same year, the Company's submarine interests were amalgamated with Siemens Brothers on an equal basis by the formation of Submarine Cables Ltd. As president of the Association of British Chambers of Commerce from 1936, Clarke made an analysis of the effect of the newly started rearmament program on the structure of British Industry. In 1938, he became a member of the Commonwealth Economic Committee, and of Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain's Advisory Panel of Industrialists on Rearmament. None of the members received payment for their services, but they caused considerable interest from the Americans who anticipated large contracts. Clarke was deputy chairman (1929‚Äì31), chairman (1931-1934), and president of the London Chamber of Commerce (1940-1943). He was President of the Associated Chambers of Commerce of Great Britain (1936-1939) and a member of The Council of Foreign Bondholders. A section of Pluto pipe successively stripped away to reveal the series of layers A ‚ÄòConundrum‚Äô being prepared for winding pipe With his background knowledge of underwater cabling manufacture, Clarke become a member of a British government committee charged with solving the problem of supplying the advancing Allied forces with petrol, while avoiding enemy attack and adverse weather. The answer was the Operation Pluto project, initiated by Lord Mountbatten in 1942. In great secrecy, the committee coordinated the design and manufacture of several hundred miles of flexible pressure resistant piping, through which petrol could be pumped and transported across the English Channel. The pipes were wound in enormous coils called \\"Conundrums\\" after their shape, and laid by specially adapted ships. Between August 1944 and May 1945, over 172 million gallons of petrol were delivered to allied forces in France through the PLUTO pipes. Clarke, who rarely took holidays, retired from his business activities and other interests when forced to do by ill health shortly before his death.Comment by Michael John Clarke, grandson to Geoffrey Rothe Clarke, November 2017  Personal life  Clarke married Hilda Geraldine Seymour on 3 February 1899 at St Peter's Church, Fort William, Calcutta. She was the eldest daughter of Colonel Dr. Charles Seymour of the Royal Army Medical Corps. They outlived three of their five children, and three of their nine grandchildren. As passengers on BOAC Flight 777, Clarke's only daughter Rotha (Hutcheon) and her two young daughters were killed by enemy action over the Bay of Biscay on 1 June 1943. Other passengers included the actor Leslie Howard. Clarke subsequently commissioned a stained glass window at St. Michael's church, Llan Ffestiniog, Wales, to remember the women and children killed during World War II. Detail of memorial window commissioned by Geoffrey Rothe Clarke in 1944 for St Michael's church, Llan Ffestiniog, to commemorate the civilian casualties of World War 2. The window erroneously depicts a De Havilland DH.95 Flamingo, rather than the DC3 of Flight 777 Clarke died of cancer on 1 October 1950 at his home in Hove, Sussex, UK, aged 79. A memorial service was held at St Mary le Strand.

The chapel was first built in 1692 by Protestant dissenters, becoming Unitarian in the late 18th century. It is a member of the General Assembly of Unitarian and Free Christian Churches, the umbrella body for British Unitarians. Gellionnen Chapel is the oldest Dissenting chapel in the Swansea Valley, is one of the oldest surviving chapels in the region and is a Grade II* listed building.  History  = Pre-1692 = Near to the location of the present-day chapel stood a Celtic Church, Llan Eithrim, close to an ancient well of religious significance, Fynnon Wen. Llan Eithrim was consecrated by the Saxon Bishop Herewald in 1060AD. A Welsh priest named Gwidyr was in charge of the church. Llan Eithrim is believed to have been destroyed during the Reformation. A stone tablet known as the Gellionnen Stone survived from the old Llan Eithrim church and was incorporated into the wall of Gellionnen Chapel. The Gellionnen Stone, dated c. 900AD, was donated by the congregation to Swansea Museum in 1965. In the 1650s, dissenting Protestant preachers visited the area, speaking at local farms. Among them apparently was Jenkin Jones, Catabaptist and Presbyterian Minister and veteran of Oliver Cromwell's parliamentarian army in the English Civil War. In 1662, Reverend Robert Thomas was ejected from Cadoxton Church and established a congregation at Gellionnen, meeting at first in local homes and farms. = 17th and 18th centuries = The plaque on the exterior wall of Gellionnen Chapel commemorating its founding in 1692  Early years  Gellionnen Chapel was first built in 1692 by Protestant dissenters on Mynydd Gellionnen (Gellionnen Mountain), who had apparently previously met in local houses and farms. The land was donated by Bussy Mansell, a landowner, Member of Parliament, and veteran of the English Civil War. Gellionnen was one of five Dissenting chapels established under the leadership of Reverend Robert Thomas after his expulsion from the Church of England. The other places of worship in this group included Maesyrhaf, Mynyddbach (Tyrdwncyn), Cwmllynfell, and Blaengwrach, the latter of which also later became Unitarian. In the late 1690s and early 1700s, Reverend Lewis Davies, who came from Llanedi in Carmarthenshire, is thought to have established a Sunday School at Gellionnen Chapel, which existed for around forty years. His co-minister from 1701, Llewellyn Bevan, was a moderate Calvinist, considered evangelical in his views and democratic in his views. The minister from 1712‚Äì42 was Roger Howell, a blacksmith renowned for his knowledge of the scriptures. Howell led the congregation towards Arminianism, preparing the way for the future of development of the chapel towards Unitarianism. In 1715, Gellionnen and its sister chapel, Gwynfe Chapel (10 miles north), had a congregation of around 550. Howell's successor as minister, Joseph Simmonds, ran a school in Llansamlet, Swansea, where the radical preacher, philosopher and mathematician Richard Price was educated. In the 1740s and 1750s, Arminianism and Unitarianism began to develop among the Gellionnen congregation.  Josiah Rees and Iolo Morganwg  Iolo Morganwg, who had close connections to Gellionnen Chapel In 1764, Reverend Josiah Rees became minister at Gellionnen Chapel and oversaw its transition towards Unitarianism and the re-building of the chapel in 1801‚Äì02. Josiah was the son of Reverend Owen Rees of Hen dy Cwrdd Trecynon (The Old Meeting House, Trecynon) in Aberdare. Josiah was a progressive thinker and studied under Solomon Harries in Swansea and Samuel Thomas, a liberal tutor at Carmarthen. Around 1785, Josiah Rees opened a school, having declined the position of principal of the Presbyterian College, Swansea. Rees was the editor of the second-ever Welsh language magazine, Trysorfa Gwybodaeth or Yr Eurgrawn (1776), and was a respected scholar, writing many booklets on his faith. He worked with Iolo Morganwg and Tomos Glyn Cothi (Thomas Evans), Rees studied, collected and copied rare Welsh manuscripts, building an impressive library at his home at Gelligron. Under Rees' influence, Gellionnen's congregation became 'Arminian, Arian and Semi- Unitarian'. In 1802, the Welsh Unitarian Society was founded during a meeting at Gellionnen Chapel, attended by Iolo Morganwg. That year, the chapel was opened after being re-built. Josiah Rees travelled to London to raise funds for the chapel and died shortly after returning from one such trip in 1804. In one of his final letters, Rees praised the congregation for fundraising and claimed (perhaps with exaggeration) that 700 people had attended a recent service. As a result of Gellionnen's move towards Unitarianism, a schism took place and a section of the congregation left. Those who left went on to build Baran Chapel in 1805 a few miles away. Nevertheless, Gellionnen attracted worshippers from as far away as Swansea, Neath, Cwmllynfell and Bettws. Josiah Rees was succeeded by his son, Dr Thomas Rees (1805‚Äì06). Thomas Rees wrote a history of Unitarianism and translated the Racovian Catechism and was an important Unitarian minister in London. His brother, Owen Rees, was a co- founder of Longman's publishing firm. Reverend Thomas Morgan (1737‚Äì1813) of Blaengwrach, who lived with the Rees family and is buried in their family plot at Gellionnen Chapel, is believed to have pioneered the use of a cowpox vaccine to combat smallpox on hundreds of local children, before the work of the famous Edward Jenner. Inside the chapel is a memorial to Thomas Morgan, reputedly carved by Iolo Morganwg. = 19th century = After Thomas Rees' departure David Oliver, a General Baptist from Aberdare, minister from 1806‚Äì14. His ministry was relatively conservative and there was unrest among the congregation. During this period, Independents led by the minister from Mynyddbach Chapel, attempted to seize control of Gellionnen. The power struggle between the Independents and the Arminian/Unitarians was settled \\"after a battle of words and fists\\" outside the chapel, with the Arminian/Unitarian faction victorious. It was only during the ministry of Reverend John James (1815‚Äì64) that Gellionnen became fully Unitarian. Reverend James came to Gellionnen from Cardiganshire at the urging of Iolo Morganwg, who was keen for Gellionnen to be strengthened as a centre of Unitarianism and liberal religion. In his long ministry of Gellionnen Chapel, the scholarly Reverend James ran a famous secondary boarding school at his home at Vardre, Clydach. He also translated into Welsh Joseph Priestley's A Catechism for Children and Young People in 1805 and Thomas Belsham's A Calm Inquiry. Reverend James was close to Iolo Morganwg and the two corresponded on a range of topics. According to tradition, because of his knowledge of ancient Greek Reverend James was once called to Llangrannog to speak to shipwrecked Greek sailors. In 1873, the chapel was completely overhauled and renovated during the ministry of Reverend John Evans. The stone roof tiles came from Bettws church, while the floor was replaced and the old stone slabs moved outside. At the same time, the land on which the chapel was built was purchased by the congregation. Like his predecessor Reverend John James, Reverend Evans ran a school at his home at Trebanos House, Trebanos. John Evans was succeeded by W. J. Davies (1887‚Äì89), an author and chemist, who formed an orchestra and choir at the chapel. Davies left Gellionnen for Llandysul, where he published Hanes Plwyf Llandysul (1894) - the first book published by Cambrian Press. Davies was in turn succeeded by J. Fisher Jones (1889‚Äì92). Under the latter, in 1894, Gellionnen's sister chapel ‚Äì the Graig Chapel ‚Äì was opened in nearby Trebanos. In 1895, a thousand people gathered on the mountain for a summer festival to raise funds, with performances from the chapel's brass band. = 20th century = In the 20th century, Gellionnen Chapel was a lively centre of religious, social and cultural life. The minister from 1895 until 1905 was T. J. Jenkins, a popular preacher, who was followed by Alfa Richards (1906‚Äì1910). Reverend Richards was a poet and preacher who drew crowds into the chapels and wrote beautiful hymns. Many young men from the congregation served and were killed during the First World War. The minister during that time was D. G. Rees, who served from 1912 to 1930. Rees wrote letters to the men at the front, organised soup kitchens and organised fundraising activities. He visited Palestine and gave lectures on the subject when he returned. The Graig Chapel was renowned for having one of the area's finest organs installed. D. Elwyn Davies wrote: > \\"In 1925, on the eve of the 'Big Strike', these restless people could > genuinely boast that they had installed in the Graig the 'Valley's best > pipe-organ' and although it had the price-tag of ¬£1,179 it was soon paid; > the music of oratorios and recitals, with ordinary folk contributing > according to their means, ranging from the fortune of ¬£27 to the sacrifice > of a shilling and sixpence, a woman's wage at the steel furnace in > Pontardawe.\\" During the Great Depression, local unemployed men volunteered their time to clean and decorate Gellionnen and Graig chapels, between 1921 and 1926. In the interwar years, Gellionnen and Graig chapels had an 'orchestra and choir, operatic and dramatic groups, concerts and penny-reading lectures and social functions of all kinds'. During the Second World War, the minister was Reverend J. D. Jones (1932‚Äì1948), who went on to become Principal of the College at Carmarthen. In the early 1950s, R. I. Pritchard was Gellionnen's minister and he published a book of hymns, Salmau'r Mynydd, which were written and composed by the congregation. Reverend Pritchard had a North Walian Methodist background and invigorated the chapel's radical conscience and youth movement. In the postwar period, Reverend Pritchard arranged exchange visits between young people from the congregation and young Germans. Reverend D. Elwyn Davies was minister from 1957 until 1988/89 and was renowned as a hymn writer. Reverend Davies was the editor of the Welsh Unitarian newspaper, Yr Ymofynnydd, and became Greek and New Testament Professor at Memorial College, Swansea and Aberystwyth. During his ministry, Gellionnen was repaired and decorated twice and the Gellionnen Stone transferred to Swansea Museum.  The chapel today  The congregation of Gellionnen Chapel marking Holocaust Memorial Day in January 2017 Today, Gellionnen Chapel holds weekly services every Sunday. The chapel is part of the Unitarian movement, which: > \\"is an open-minded and welcoming approach to faith that encourages > individual freedom, equality for all and rational thought. There is no list > of things that Unitarians must believe: instead we think everyone has the > right to reach their own conclusions.\\" According to the chapel's website: > \\"We aspire to create a loving, caring religious community within which we: > Value people in their diversity and uniqueness, Encourage freedom of thought > and speech, Support spiritual exploration, Create celebratory worship, > Advocate justice, liberty, honesty, integrity, peace and love. Hence we > strive to: Make the best of the life we have, Be democratic in our practice, > Celebrate life in its many forms, Respect people whose beliefs and attitudes > are different from our own.\\" The chapel attracts large audiences for its annual Summer Folk Festival, the Plygain service on Christmas Eve, and the Mari Llwyd service in the New Year. In 2008, the chapel was broken into and badly vandalised by youths. The chapel was fully restored after fundraising efforts. The chapel made headlines in 2016 for holding the first religious same-sex marriage ceremony in the area.

Member committee on INEC Member committee on police affairs  Race for speaker  In 2019 Onyejocha ran for the speaker of 9th assembly of the Nigeria Federal House of Representatives after winning a return ticket to the house for a fourth term. She was the only female candidate in the race. With her experience as a ranking member of the house, Onyejocha was a front runner candidate with huge supports from her zone ‚Äì the south-east of the country being the only candidate running for the position from the region. Onyejocha campaign was also boosted by supports from various civil society groups especially of women across the country who clamoured for a female speaker for gender equity. Onyejocha major campaign issues in the speakership race were tied to two points. First was for a south- eastern person to occupy the speakership position against south-west it was zoned to by the party leaders for balance of federal powers among the six regions of Nigeria. The south-east - a key component of the Nigeria federation did not occupy any of the high five political offices. The second point of her campaign issues was ‚Äúto improve the legislative framework for inclusive growth and social justice in Nigeria, especially for a marginalised group like poor women and the youth, who have been clamouring for more participation in the Nigerian economy and the state of affairs in recent times‚Äù In the heat of the campaign, Onyejocha repeatedly called on her main challenger Femi Gbajabiamila favoured to take the speakership position by their party to back out of the race and support her campaign. But Onyejocha instead stepped down for her main challenger less than 24 hours to the inauguration and election of the speaker of the house. Her resignation from the race was to allow the interest of the party to supersede and prevail individual interests. Onyejocha is known as a loyal party member.

Built in the mid-18th century or possibly earlier, it is a well-preserved example of a Colonial era brick house. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979. Description and history The Allyn House stands on the west side of Deerfield Road, historically the main road along the west bank of the Connecticut River, in southern Windsor. It is 2-1/2 stories in height, with a side gable roof. Its walls are built out of brick laid in common bond, with differing shapes indicating different periods of construction. Ground-floor openings in the five-bay facade have segmented-arch headers, with the entrance at the center, while second-floor windows are in rectangular openings butting against the eave. The interior has a center-hall plan, with parlors on either side and a kitchen and small extra chamber in the rear. Period woodwork is found in each of these rooms, and floors are wide pine. The house's construction date is traditionally given as 1670, based on a partial carving (of which only the \\"1\\" and \\"0\\" survive legibly) on its main beams. It is possible that the house was built at this early date, but a date of 1760 is also plausible. Documentary records for the property are unclear whether this house or another was standing at the earlier date. The house was originally built as a saltbox, and was only raised to have a full second floor at a later date, evidenced by changes in the brick used. Even with a 1760 construction date, this house stylistically prefigures the later Federal period brick houses that are more numerous in Windsor.

Built about 1825, it is a well-preserved local example of a transitional Federal-Greek Revival brick house. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1988. Description and history The Giles Barber House stands in southern Windsor, on the west side of Windsor Street (Connecticut Route 159), a major north-south roadway, between Barber and Allen Streets. It is a masonry structure, with a 2-1/2 story main block that is covered by front-facing gabled roof. Behind this is a two-story ell, from which a single-story ell extends to the left (south) from its rear. The main facade is three bays wide, with the entrance in the leftmost bay. Windows are set in rectangular openings with brownstone lintels and sills. The gable above is fully pedimented, with a Federal style semi-oval window at its center. The house was built about 1825 by Giles Barber, using bricks made from brickyards the operated on the other side of Windsor Avenue. The L-shaped plan is typical of the early Greek Revival, but its simpler styling and pediment window are more typical of the Federal period. This house is one of a number of early 19th-century brick houses to survive in southern Windsor.

He gathered and preserved Thembu history and lore from his base at the court of Chief Falo Mgudlwa in Ngcobo and he stewarded the different Thembu royal clans during a fractious and dangerous time. Youth Mbombini's father Sihele was powerful warrior of the Thembu nation, who chose to go to war against the British at a time when most other Thembu leaders would not. At his final departure to war, knowing he would not return, he left his children in the hands of Nowisile, the wife of the young Falo Mgudlwa and the daughter of the Gcaleka King Sarili kaHintsa. He instructed that his one son Pafulu was to receive a full European education and that his other son Mbombini was to receive a purely Thembu up-bringing. He explained on his departure that this was to ensure that Mbombini never left his home and his people. After his father's death Mbombini therefore became a servant of Chief Falo Mgudlwa. Councillor From his youngest years, the boy was very loyal to his guardian and he became the Chief's most trusted servant. His intelligence and charisma caused him to rise to position of Councillor and his influence then expanded across Thembuland and further. He was a giant in physical stature and he was famous for bravery and fierceness in war. Nonetheless he could also use great tact and gentleness in order to achieve an important aim. In his private life he used the name Mbombini while in his capacity as Thembu Councillor he used his second name Molteno. Sihele was his father's name and so he also took the patronym \\"kaSihele\\" (\\"son of Sihele\\"). Molteno believed that divisions and disagreements made the Xhosa speaking nations vulnerable, and his main policies were to use traditional structures and diplomacy to unite the different Chiefs, at a dangerous time when Thembuland was under constant threat from British aggression.MS18534, Tisani, N.C., Sihele, E.G., Thembu Royal Council. 1933, Who are the AbaThembu and where do the come from? Cory Library, Grahamstown. During times when the elderly Chief Falo was suffering from alcoholism and could not lead personally, Molteno took instruction from the Chief and commanded the people in the Chief's name. He implemented the incapacitated leader's instructions during the Anglo-Boer War and he publicly protected and honoured the Chief's name. On his death bed, Chief Falo instructed Molteno to look after his descendants. The \\"death-charge\\" was that Molteno and his descendants would always protect Falo's descendants and their people. Indeed Falo's children quarreled and disputed succession, but Molteno worked for the remainder of his life at resolving these disputes and others. He also spent his life protecting and fighting for Falo's young adopted son Qaqawuli as he was instructed to. The internal and external conflicts called for Molteno's constant work, for the rest of his long life, up until his death.PR 1147, Umthetheli: \\"Chief Falo Mgudlwa of Qumanco Location, St Marks\\". Cory Library, Grahamstown He died of pneumonia that he contracted in his old age, while riding horseback over great distances in extreme cold still to arrange meetings between local leaders. Even on his deathbed he summoned his children and instructed them to continue the task of uniting the Xhosa-speaking peoples, because he believed that harder times were still to come. He was later honoured as a lifelong guardian and servant of the Thembu and of other people of the region. National poet Mbombini Sihele studied old Thembu oral history and lore. He became the \\"imbongi\\" (national poet) and spokesperson of the Thembu nation. He assembled and preserved the traditions and history of the Thembu and other Xhosa people. Through this he made the court of Chief Falo into the major repository of history for the Thembu and Qwathi nations. Later chroniclers would spend time there to study this history.PR 1148, Imvo Zabantsundu: \\"Late Chief Matsolo Mgudlwa\\". Cory Library, GrahamstownPR 1388, Mdolomba, E., \\"Inkosi uFalo Mgudlwa\\".

An example was the history: \\"Thembu History per Chief Falo Mgudlwa at Qumanco\\" (18/06/35. McLaughlin Papers, Cory Library, Grahamstown). He is honoured by the later imbongi, the poet Melikhaya Mbutuma, in his 1963 poem against the Apartheid government and its puppet ruler Kaiser Matanzima: I remember Mbombini Sihele, a giant with a husky chest, I remember him calling for his deadly assegai, I remember him calling for his murderous panga.

(14 November 1851 ‚Äì 8 June 1928) was an antiquary, musician, author, and lecturer. Personal life Charles Tindal Gatty was the son of the Rev. Alfred Gatty, D.D. vicar of Ecclesfield; his mother Margaret Gatty was the daughter of the Rev. Alexander John Scott a chaplain in the Royal Navy who served under and was a friend of Lord Nelson on board during the Battle of Trafalgar.\\" Charles Tindal Gatty was educated at the Charterhouse School until he was 13 and from then on by a private tutor. Gatty converted to Catholicism and became a well known political spokesman for his adopted faith. Early career Gatty was appointed Curator at the Mayer Museum in Liverpool, where he worked from 1873 to 1885. During his time at the Museum he worked on a catalogue of the Mayer collection, which had been presented in 1867 by Joseph Mayer (antiquary). In 1875 Gatty became a member of the Historic Society of Lancashire and Cheshire, in 1881-2 he was the Hon. Secretary, whilst Mayer is listed as one of the Vice-Presidents alongside John Ruskin. He was next, for two years, private secretary to Catholic convert John Crichton-Stuart, 3rd Marquess of Bute. In April 1887 Gatty moved to Yeovil where he became editor of the Western Chronicle (a newspaper with Liberal interests started by Lord Wolverton). Controversies While working as an editor in Yeovil Gatty convinced the Bishop to allow the celebration of Mass to resume in the town. The first Mass celebrated in Yeovil since the Reformation 350 years previously was held on Sunday 13 November 1887 in Gatty's drawing room at 137 Hendford Hill. It had taken six months to convert the room into a chapel and 16 people attended. The congregation quickly grew and by 24 June Gatty was renting a pre-Reformation Chantry in the town centre. A year later religious intolerance led to a \\"great and bitter\\" anti-Catholic demonstration at the Town Hall; following this the Chantry windows were broken and the Carmelite Fathers were intimidated by \\"the rough element\\". Gatty used the Western Chronicle as a platform for debate and also published a 50-page pamphlet to explain \\"what the Church really is\\" and \\"what she teaches\\". His opponents included author and publisher Sampson Low who wrote a book aimed at Gatty and defending the English Church. Gatty's opponents refused to openly debate with him at the Town Hall and eventually religious discord in the town abated. In the 1892 General Election Gatty ran for parliament as a Home Rule candidate, as the nominee for the West Dorset riding. In March that year his opponent Henry Richard Farquharson began a 'drirty tricks' campaign and told St John Brodrick in the House of Commons that Gatty had been expelled from Charterhouse aged 13. Brodderick repeated this to Conservative politician George Wyndham, a close friend of Gatty's, who immediately informed him. Gatty sued Farquarson for libel and slander. During the course of the trial it emerged that Gatty had been the victim of bullying and abuse at the hands of older boys that \\"went on \\" at public schools. His father the Rev. Gatty called the slander \\"an infamous lie\\" and confirmed he had removed his son from the school and \\" sent him to a private tutor\\". The Lord Chief Justice said Gatty had been \\"dragged to the stake\\" for something that had happened \\"30 years ago\\". Farquarson was ordered to pay ¬£5,000 damages, reduced on appeal to ¬£2,500 a year later. The jury reached their decision \\"without leaving the box\\" and the verdict \\"was received with applause\\" The Irish Art Companions Shortly after the trial Gatty served as secretary to the Chief Ministerial Whip, T. E. Ellis. Between 1898 and 1905 Gatty was joint editor, with the Henry Fitzalan-Howard, 15th Duke of Norfolk, of the hymnal Arundel Hymns, to which Pope Leo XIII contributed a preface in form of a personal letter. When George Wyndham served as Chief Secretary for Ireland between November 1900 and March 1905, art dealer and collector Hugh Lane corresponded with Gatty about meeting with Wyndham; Gatty's reply in 1903 \\"advising patience\\" survives. That same year Gatty was invited by Wyndham to stay at the Chief Secretary's Lodge. In 1904 he returned to Dublin and founded the Irish Art Companions with the involvement of the wealthy Irish American nationalist Thomas Hughes Kelly. The Irish Art Companions was run by Gatty, a member of the Conradh na Gaeilge (Gaelic League) that sponsored the 'Industrial Conference' in November 1905, at which Gatty delivered a speech on 'Industrial Development'. The Art Companions aligned themselves with the cultural nationalism of the League and played an active part in the artistic life of Dublin, in 1906 Gatty stated that the Art Companions wanted \\"a re-evaluation of this country in the estimation of its own children\\". On 4 May 1906 he gave a lecture at Westminster Hall on \\"the revival of sacred and other Arts in Ireland\\". The Art Companions opened a sales depot to store and exhibit works in adjoining 18th Century houses at 27-28 Clare Street, not far from the School of Art; the building also housed a plaster mill. By 1907 this was described as \\"a manufactory, technical college, art school and shop all in one\\". Between 4 May and 9 November 1907 members of the Irish Arts Companions exhibited at the Irish International Exhibition. A branch was then opened in London in 1908, which was managed by Charles H Cochrane. Among those associated with the Art Companions were the Irish republican sculptor Willie Pearse, sculptor and portrait painter Lilla Vanston, sculptor, medallist Gwendolen Herbert and sculptor, painter Mervyn Lawrence whose work was owned by Lady Fingal Elizabeth Burke-Plunkett who knew Gatty and was an activist in Irish industrial, cultural and charitable groups. A factory was also set up at Ringsend to manufacture plaster from Irish gypsum. The Art Companions also helped provide an alternative to imported ecclesiastical statues. A letter exists from the Irish Art Companions to Patrick Pearse dated 7 March 1910 asking him to \\"give bearer cheque as promised\\". The letter is written on headed paper : Irish Art Companions Everything Sold in this Shop has been made in Ireland by Irish hands. The Irish Art Companions also sold clothing and advertised 'Irish Costume Material' on the front page of Bean na h√âireann (The Women of Ireland) a magazine run by the Inghinidhe na h√âireann the Irish radical women's movement founded by Maud Gonne; and in January 1912 in the An Claidheamh Soluis an advert promoting \\"Irish Linens, Dress Materials, Colleen Cloaks and Underwear\\". Later life In 1913 George Wyndham died suddenly and Gatty wrote a warm and moving tribute to his friend, George Wyndham, Recognita published in 1917 which gives an account of their shared interests and time spent at Clouds House as well as in Ireland and elsewhere. In 1921 Gatty published the two-volume work Mary Davies and the Manor of Ebury. Death Gatty died on 8 June 1928 in a London Nursing Home and was buried at St. Mary's Church, Eccleston Cheshire.Find-a-Grave: Charles Tindal Gatty, accessed February 2019. The day before his burial a requiem Mass was celebrated at St James's, Spanish Place. His obituary stated \\"By his death there is removed a cultured and interesting personality, a man with a great number of friends both in this country, and in Ireland\\" Among the bequests in his will was \\"a framed page of fourteenth-century Liturgical MS. \\"given me by John Ruskin\\".

Examples of these activities include free panels where writers, poets and theater actors answer questions, and festivals such as the \\"International Istanbul Venue-Theater Festival\\".  History  = Foundation of Dar√ºlbedayi =  1910s  The founding story of Dar√ºlbedayi first started as a conservatory. In that period, Istanbul Mayor Cemil Topuzlu wanted to build a conservatory worthy of Istanbul. He offered the project to the parliament and it was accepted. Then, to start the project, on 28 June 1914, important French theater man of the time Andr√© Antoine was invited and made an agreement for this project.New Theatre Quarterly (Cambridge University Press), ; ISSN 0266-464X He participated in the founding of Dar√ºlbedayi, and he has chosen students. He left Istanbul in the first world war. Some of the first actors of Dar√ºlbedayi worked in various stages before installation (Behzat Butak, Nurettin ≈ûefkati, Rƒ±za Fadƒ±l, Fikret Sadi, Ahmet Muvahhit, Muhsin Ertuƒürul, Ra≈üit Rƒ±za, ƒ∞.Garip Arcan) (Hazƒ±m K√∂rm√ºk√ß√º-1915, Vasfi Rƒ±za Zobu-1917, H√ºseyin Kemal G√ºrmen-1918). Some others (M. Kemal K√º√ß√ºk ‚Äì 1920, Emin Beliƒü Belli ‚Äì 1920, Mahmut Moralƒ± ‚Äì 1923) theater studies began in various communities, and later involved in Dar√ºlbedayi. Upon the announcement for student candidacy, 197 people applied to Dar√ºlbedayi. 63of them was successful at first. Only eight Christians applied as women. So, finding a female actress has remained an important issue for a long time. The Muslim women's first taking part in Dar√ºlbedayi was in November 1918. They were young Turkish girls named Behire, Memduha, Beyza, Refika and Afife. The first actress to stage was Afife (1919, H√ºseyin Suat Yal√ßƒ±n's \\"Yamalar\\" game). With the interest of Mustafa Kemal Atat√ºrk, Turkish women took place of Armenian women and after 1923, Bedia Muvahhit and Neyyire Neyir were taken to the stage life.C.C.Barfoot, Cobi Bordewijk.. Theatre Intercontinental: Forms, Functions, Correspondences , After Antoine went, Re≈üad Rƒ±dvan organized an opening ceremony (November 1914) not to be forgotten of Dar√ºlbedayi project. After a while, this art institution faced the danger of closing. At the time, Mayor Ismail Canbulat, requested a regulation. The work that started in November 1914 ended in January 1915. The first regulation prepared for Dar√ºlbedayi consists of thirty-seven substances. Dar√ºlbedayi was not only a school with this arrangement, but also a community that staged professional plays at the same time. The name \\"House of Beauty\\" came from Ali Ekrem Bolayƒ±r.Nutku, √ñzdemir. Dar√ºlbedayi'den ≈ûehir Tiyatrosu'na 100. Yƒ±l (100th year of City Theatres from Dar√ºlbedayi), Dar√ºlbedayi started the stage life with √á√ºr√ºk Temel play, whom H√ºseyin Suat had adapted from French writer Emile Fabre. The first plays have been staged at the wooden building in Tepeba≈üƒ±, built by Rƒ±dvan Pa≈üa in 1890; Then the Ferah Theater and others in ≈ûehzadeba≈üƒ± were used. Premier representation of Dar√ºlbedayi was \\"√á√ºr√ºk Temel\\" at Tepeba≈üƒ± Stage in 1916. On Thursday, January 20, 1916, matinee performance was for women, soiree was for men. Shortly after this representation, Dar√ºlbedayi, who fell into trouble with money, closed the music section on 14 March 1916. In 1917, 3000 lira of aid was reduced to 1000 lira. In the meantime, Dar√ºlbedayi staged the first indigenous play \\"Bayku≈ü\\" written by Halit Fahri Ozansoy (2 March 1917), and Muhsin Ertuƒürul put on the stage this play which was approved by audiences. The second indigenous play was Yusuf Ziya Orta√ß's \\"Binnaz\\" (1919). In the meantime, the school section, which was closed economic reasons, started to work again and moved to a house in Hamalba≈üƒ± (Beyoƒülu) from Letafet Apartment in ≈ûehzadeba≈üƒ±.  1920s  Despite the representations were in a regular situation starting from 1918, uneasiness in the institution increased. The second regulation, which was prepared by the mayor on March 31, 1920, was thirty-three clause, and by this regulation, Dar√ºlbedayi became a theater that only represents plays. On the dispute between the artists and the board, a significant part of the artists left and set up a special theater (New Stage). The work of this community did not last long, and when the founder Ismail Faik Bey went bankrupt, the community also disintegrated. Another private theater (Turkish theater) established in 1922 brought together artists from here and from Dar√ºlbedayi. These confusion lasted until 1923. Because of the poverty, irregularity, and impossibility, the representations of that year could only start in the spring of the season. On the other hand, the revenue office wanted taxes from the income of represented plays. After the proclamation of the Republic, it was decided in 1924 to prepare a proposal for Dar√ºlbedayi. Until the first regular season of 1927‚Äì28, artists worked in various communities. The most important ones are the National Stage communities, established by Muhsin Ertuƒürul in ≈ûehzadeba≈üƒ± Ferah Sahnesi, founded by Ra≈üit Rƒ±za at the Aleppo Bazaar Variety Theater and organized by Fikret ≈ûadi in Anatolian Tours. Muhsin Ertuƒürul was put to the head of Dar√ºlbedayi during the theater period of 1927‚Äì1928. The representatives became disciplined, organized and the play choices got better. The importance given to indigenous people increased; Five local artifacts were played during the period 1928‚Äì1929, and seven local artifacts were played during the period 1932‚Äì1933. In the following years, the number of Turkish plays staged increased continuously. The 59th clause of article 5 of the Municipal Code, which was adapted in the Turkish Grand National Assembly in 1930, gave the municipalities a \\"voluntary\\" duty to build a theater building and establish a theater society. Thus, this institution was directly connected to the municipality. In 1924, the commission decided that Dar√ºlbedayi would be called \\"Istanbul City Theater\\". After being attached to the municipality, the institution was referred to in the name of City Theater by the press and public, but the institution received the name of City Theater in 1934. = From Dar√ºlbedayi to ƒ∞stanbul City Theaters =  1930s  Having helped from the funding allocated to the charities of Istanbul Municipality, Dar√ºlbedayi first saw the close interest of the municipality during the governor Muhiddin √úst√ºndaƒü in 1926; The management of the theater was given to Celal Esat Arseven. Muhsin Ertuƒürul was chosen as the art director, who returned to his homeland after studying theater at Soviet Union. The artists are also started to be paid salary. In 1930 the theater was expected to receive a certain allowance from the municipal budget. In 1934, the institution officially began to be referred to as the Istanbul City Theater. It was also the years when City Theater's children's plays began to be regular and constantly staged. The practices of Ferih Egemen and Kemal K√º√ß√ºk in the field of Children's Theater, which was started in 1935, have historical characteristics in the name of national children's theater.  1950s  In the beginning, Muhsin Ertuƒürul, who was at the head of the theater, went on a campaign to increase the number of spectators and representatives for each play. The slogan was \\"increase from 3 times to 100 times\\" In 1926 \\"Hamlet\\" was represented at most 7 consecutive times; This number increased to 170 in 1959 with the same play scene. One of the reasons that accelerate this success is to play operettas, a new art scene in Tepeba≈üƒ± Sahnesi. In the early years, the operettas written and composed by Ekrem Re≈üid Rey and Cemal Re≈üit Rey increased the interest and number of the spectators.  1970s  In the season of 1971‚Äì1972, the number of spectators in five scenes of Istanbul City Theater was 310.000. And Average audience for the per play was 270. In 1935, the Istanbul City Theater performed in three different stages: drama and comedy in Tepeba≈üƒ± Theater, operetta in French Theater, children's theater again in Tepeba≈üƒ± at Asri Cinema. In those days, opening the Tepeba≈üƒ± Theater with a Shakespeare play every season was becoming traditional. In addition to classics such as Moli√®re, Goldoni, Schiller, as well as contemporary writers from Pirandello, Chekhov, Bernard Shaw, Dostoyevsky, Tolstoy, Ibsen, Gorki, many works of the western world were being publicly displayed. After a while, operettas and musical works were put to an end; Their place was lightly comedies and vaudevilles. In 1952, Max Meinecke was brought from Austria to direct the art works. In these years, plays were also staged at the Emin√∂n√º Public Hall in Istanbul. In 1959, Muhsin Ertuƒürul was brought back to the foundation and the new working period lasted until 1966. Muhsin Ertuƒürul opened Kadƒ±k√∂y, √úsk√ºdar, Fatih and Zeytinburnu theater stages in order to take bring the theater to the people. Fatih (Re≈üat Nuri) Theater [1960] at the beginning of Sara√ßhane and √úsk√ºdar (M√ºsahipzade Celal) Theater [1961] at Doƒüancƒ±lar district have been continuing represents until today; Zeytinburnu representatives were given up after a few seasons. ƒ∞pek Cinema in Beyoƒülu started to work under the direction of City Theater in the name of New Comedy Theater. The Kadƒ±k√∂y Theater was also replaced and settled in the large hall of the Public Education Center. The Tepeba≈üƒ± Theater, which has a historical value, had been closed to representations shortly before burning (1970) because it could not carry the burden of spectators due to it was wore off. On top of that, a large theater was built in a pavilion built during the Istanbul exhibition in Harbiye and the administration part moved here (1970). Re≈üat Nuri G√ºntekin's Yaprak D√∂k√ºm√º play, which was played in the 1943‚Äì44 season, was the first domestic play to reach 100 representations. In the 1945‚Äì46 season, Edmond Rostand's Cyrano de Bergerac was the first translation play to reach 105 representations. Dar√ºlbedayi, which is called as Istanbul City Theater in the present, has launched the tradition of theater magazines in the country. The City Theater, which published 25 episodes of the theater magazine \\"Tema≈üa\\" between 1918 and 1920, is one of the longest theatrical magazines in the world and has been publishing in the name of \\"Dar√ºlbedayi\\", \\"Turkish Theater\\" and \\"City Theater\\" since 1930 until today. Taking into consideration the change and audience orientation of the Turkish theater in recent years, the City Theaters opens its curtains to the Istanbul audience and the theater lovers in other cities with a large repertoire of local and foreign writers. In addition, by inviting foreign directors and theater men, they bring the plays and put on the stage for the Turkish audience. The first work of many playwrights was staged at City Theaters for the first time and the new playwrights were brought in to the Turkish Theater.  2000s  The City Theaters, which has the ten stage of today (2017), opens the curtains for the around 2000 audience every day in Istanbul. The \\"City Theater\\", which continues its art works and plays as an attached budget directorate attached to the ƒ∞stanbul Metropolitan Municipality, has been taken to the General Budget since 1 January 2006. Some of the valuable theatricians who have undertaken the duty of General Art Director of Istanbul City Theater since its establishment are: Muhsin Ertuƒürul, Vasfi Rƒ±za Zobu, Gencay G√ºr√ºn, Erol Keskin, Kenan I≈üƒ±k, ≈û√ºkr√º T√ºren, Nurullah Tuncer, Mazlum Kiper, Orhan Alkaya, Ay≈üenil ≈ûamlƒ±oƒülu. Finally, Erhan Yazƒ±cƒ±oƒülu was appointed as General Art Director of City Theater in 2014. Theater stages City Theaters', stages spread over Istanbul, with the low price application allows city people to watch the theater plays.

In addition, Cemil Topuzlu Open-Air Theater with 3.996 seats serves national and international events during the summer season. Apart from these, the Old Galata Bridge was also transferred to the City Theaters. National and international events are being held here with the participation of 5 thousand spectators.

Viktor, P. √Å. L. \\"The Environmental Consequences of Industrialization in Western European Core Countries and the Borsod Basin of Hungary, 1850‚Äì1945: A ComparativeOutline.\\" He lived in the city of Eger for some years, during which period he created his most famous wrought iron works. Furthermore, he found iron in the B√ºkk Mountains and built the first iron furnace in the area, establishing the basis of metallurgy in the region.A Fazola csal√°dA di√≥sgy≈ëri m. kir. vas- √©s ac√©lgy√°rt√°s t√∂rt√©nete 1765-1910  Life  one gate of the set of Fazola gates in Eger Henrik Fazola was born in 1730 to a wealthy family in W√ºrzburg where he became an acknowledged smith with his younger brother, L√©nart Fazola. They visited some Western-European countries in order to learn more about their profession and improve themselves to a higher level. In 1741, Maria Theresa, the Queen of Hungary nominated Ferenc Bark√≥czy as the bishop of Eger who invited a lot of foreign masters for his developer constructions in the city, inter alia the avowed smith, Henrik Fazola from W√ºrzburg, in 1758. As he did the orders of the bishop at the highest artistic quality, he got more and major errands from the Church official and became a well-off citizen of Eger. That was the time when he made his probably most famous works, the wrought iron gates and lunette of the County Hall of Eger with grapes and crests. Hungary: A Cultural and Historical Guide, Nicholas T. Parsons, 1990, pages 356-357 Henrik Fazola started the search for iron, the commodity of his job in the area of Eger and found it in the B√ºkk Mountains. He began to invest his money, gained from his works, in mining; however, he did not want to give up fulfilling the smith orders, so he called for his brother, L√©n√°rt in 1768 to take over his locksmith workshop. Their mother had already lived with Henrik in Royal Hungary. Henrik Fazola took a widow, Anna M√°ria Linczin to wife in 1767 whose fortune gave stability to him, but she died soon, in 1772. Then he married the maiden Tekla Karl who became the mother of his two children: Frigyes and Borb√°la. The second wife had considerable financial background too which helped the dreams of the husband come true. The constructor used all of his money to utilize the founded iron in the B√ºkk Mountains; moreover, to be able to start iron production with the planned iron furnace and iron foundries in Garadna and in the dale of the Szinva stream. The Queens Announcement in 1770 let him built a smelter with the help of professional Styrian and Hungarian metallurgists who were the first inhabitants of the new settlements of √ìmassa and H√°mor. The smelter began to work in 1772 and in a few years it gained fame across the country. This success of iron production in the region demanded Henrik Fazolas health declension because he had to work a lot since he did not have the financial support of the state. He died on 16 April 1779 in H√°mor, his ashes are somewhere in the cemetery of the village.  Legacy  Fazola tomb in Miskolc After the death of Henrik Fazola, with the strong help of his mother, Tekla Karl, by using all his sources and power to improve the iron production, Frigyes Fazola became a worthy successor of his father. Henrik Fazola gave a new industrial territory to the country by finding and producing iron what later became the basis of the territory during the railway constructions of Austria-Hungary in the 19th century and after the Treaty of Trianon when most of the mines were disannexed from Hungary and the city of Miskolc emerged as the leader industrial settlement of the region.

Ban Zu is likely a settlement located within the boundary of the Old lines of Singapore (ruins of an old wall still visible in 1825 and marked on this map) and Singapore River Ban Zu or Banzu (; Malay: Pancur) was a port settlement believed to have thrived in Singapore during the 14th century. It is thought to be located on Fort Canning Hill and the area on the north bank of the Singapore River basin between the hill and the sea. It was mentioned by the Chinese traveller Wang Dayuan in his work Daoyi Zhil√ºe together with Long Ya Men as the two settlements that made up Temasek. It may have been abandoned before 1400 after an attack by either the Siamese or the Majapahit. Name Ban Zu is likely a Chinese transcription of the Malay word pancur meaning \\"spring of water\\". Pancur is a common placename in the region. Fansur (Pansur) in Sumatra was known to the Arabs in the 10th century, and Fansur was also the name of a capital of Johor in the 16th century. A spring used to exist on the west side of Fort Canning Hill, called pancur larangan or \\"forbidden spring\\" in Malay, where the women of the royal household in old Singapura were said to bathe in. Historical accounts Historical information on Ban Zu comes from the Yuan dynasty work Daoyi Zhil√ºe written by Wang Dayuan. Ban Zu was described as being located behind on a hill behind Long Ya Men of Temasek. Its relationship with Long Ya Men is uncertain, and the descriptions of the people in Banzu and Long Ya Men are different, including their clothing. While the people of Long Ya Men were said to be prone to acts of piracy, the people of Ban Zu were described as honest. Wang reported that the local produce of Ban Zu were hornbill casques, lakawood of medium quality, and cotton. They traded in silk cloths, iron bars, local cotton prints, red gold, porcelain, and iron utensils. Wang's accounts suggest that the city of Temasek was moated and gated, and that the Siamese attacked the city moat of Temasek with around 70 ships a few years before he visited. The city however successfully resisted the attack for a month until the Siamese left when Javanese envoys happened to pass by.

The plaque on the armlet features a Javanese Kala head. Ban Zu is believed by some scholars to be located on today's Fort Canning Hill and its nearby areas. Ruins of an old city in Singapore were still visible by the early 19th century, but have since been obliterated by the development of Singapore. Stamford Raffles mentioned the lines of the old city and its defences, and the British Resident John Crawfurd wrote about the ruins in some details. Crawfurd described in 1822 the ancient city as being roughly triangular in shape with a base of around a mile in length. It was bounded to the north by remnants of a wall nearly a mile long, around wide and about 8‚Äì high along present day Stamford Road, the east by the sea, and the west by a salt creek that would overflow at high water. A fresh water rivulet formed a kind of a moat alongside the wall. Although Wang Dayuan mentioned that Ban Zu was gated, no opening was apparent along this wall according to Crawfurd. Crawfurd also noted the remains of buildings, some of brick foundation, on the west and northern side of Fort Canning Hill. Among these are ruins of a terrace square near the top of the hill that he took to be a temple, with another terrace almost as big on the northern slope of the hill that local Malays believed to be the tomb of Iskandar Shah (who actually died in Malacca). Crawfurd also mentioned ancient fruit trees cultivated in the gardens, and found pottery fragments and Chinese coins, the earliest of which dating to 10th century Song Dynasty. In 1928, a cache of Javanese-styled gold ornaments dating to the mid-14th century were discovered at Fort Canning Hill while the Fort Canning reservoir was being excavate. These include a pair of near-identical flexible armlets, a ring, three pairs of rings (perhaps earrings), an ornament, and a jewelled clasp. Some of these including the clasp were lost during the Japanese occupation of Singapore in the Second World War. Archaeological excavations were conducted on Fort Canning by John Miksic in 1984, later expanded to nearby area bounded by the hill, the banks of the Singapore River and the sea, such as the Parliament House Complex, Empress Place and other locations. The excavations confirmed the presence of a thriving settlement and a trade port here during the 14th century. The artefacts found show that Fort Canning Hill was occupied by the elites, with perhaps a royal palace. It was also the location of artisanal workshops where glass may be recycled, as well as religious activities, although it was not a major ceremonial center. The entire Fort Canning Hill area therefore may have been once occupied with various buildings of political, religious and commercial significance. In areas near the hill, evidence of commercial activities and metal working have been found. Analyses of Chinese porcelain found indicate occupation of the site from the late 13th to mid-15th century, while evidence of earthenware manufacture may date the existence of a settlement to the 12th century. The royal centre on Fort Canning Hill may have been abandoned before 1400 after the attacks by either the Siamese or the Majapahit as suggested by historical accounts.

On November 20, 1902, the Fidelity and Deposit Company agreed along with two other major Baltimore bonding surety companies, the United States Fidelity and Guaranty Company and the American Bonding and Trust Company, to \\"end rate cutting in taking bonds.\\" The New York Times estimated that the agreement would implemented in other cities as well. The Fidelity and Deposit Company of Baltimore was founded in 1892. =Fidelity Building= Close-up of the building The Fidelity and Deposit Company was headquartered in 1894 in the Fidelity Building, a landmark granite skyscraper at North Charles and West Lexington Streets in Baltimore. Completed in 1894, the building is a 15-story, skyscraper in the central business district of Baltimore. The building was designed by the prominent local architectural firm of Baldwin & Pennington, composed of leading regional designers Ephraim Francis Baldwin and Josias Pennington - main \\"house architects\\" for stations and structures of the dominant Baltimore and Ohio Railroad. The building originally contained eight floors with a fa√ßade of grey granite, corner cupola tower and mansard roof. It survived the February 1904 Great Baltimore Fire, as it stood on the northwestern edge of the famous \\"burnt district\\" of the February 1904 fire which destroyed numerous downtown and waterfront buildings and skyscrapers up to across the street. Following the initial reconstruction phase of 1905‚Äì1910, when several recently built downtown towers were burned out, but their steel skeletons and concrete foundations/floors and floors survived structurally sound and were rebuilt with new interiors and masonry facades. So F. & D. under the leadership of founder and president Warfield made arrangements between 1912 and 1915, reflecting the continued growth of the company to add seven more floors were added to the top of the building, increasing the number of floors to fifteen, with the upper storied covered with a surface of terra- cotta, matching the style of the original architecture below. =Recent= The Broad museum's unorthodox facade in the Los Angeles, which the architects refer to as the \\"veil,\\" has proved very tricky to fabricate, leading to delays in the construction schedule.Christopher Hawthorne (February 10, 2014), Broad museum plaza is welcome, but who will own it?

Early career Huang earned bachelor's and master's degrees in political science from National Taiwan University. He later worked as a lawyer. Political career Huang was first elected to the first Legislative Yuan in 1980, only to lose reelection in 1983. He won in the next election cycle, 1986, and served until 1990. Huang then ran in the National Assembly elections of December 1991, and sat in the assembly until 1993 when he returned to the Legislative Yuan. He left the Legislative Yuan in 1996 after losing reelection and was appointed to the Control Yuan by President Lee Teng-hui in 1999. In his first Control Yuan stint, Huang began investigating the assets of the Kuomintang. The inquiry lasted fourteen years, by which time Huang had been nominated for a second term on the Control Yuan by Ma Ying-jeou. Huang did not receive a third nomination, and stepped down from the Control Yuan in July 2014. Besides his long-running inquiry into the Kuomintang, undertaken during his first Control Yuan term, Huang also looked into the status of social welfare in Taiwan, and the actions of the Ministries of Justice and Finance in regards to financial crime prevention. He and fellow Control Yuan member Ma Yi-kung were credited with persuading the government to rebuild the Wufeng Lin Family Mansion and Garden, which had been damaged in the 1999 Jiji earthquake. Huang next served on the Control Yuan starting in 2008. After an October visit to Taiwan by Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait chairman Chen Yunlin, he launched an inquest into allegations of civil liberties violations by the National Police Agency and National Security Bureau while providing security for the visit. An investigation into corruption headed by Huang and Chien Lin Hui-chun ended in December, resulting in the impeachments of four officials who had worked for the Third River Management Office of the Water Resources Agency. In June 2009, Huang found that Examination Yuan presidential candidate Chang Chun-yen did not solicit donations from Wayne Pai. Three months later, a Control Yuan report publicized by Huang showed that the Public Construction Commission had wrongly ignored Taipei City Government in a drawn- out dispute over the construction of the Taipei Dome. Huang led a 2011 probe into the construction of the Lungmen Nuclear Power Plant, the findings of which revealed that Taipower had not adequately considered safety concerns in the plant's design. In April 2012, the Control Yuan simultaneously impeached eight customs officials on charges of corruption, which Huang stated was one of the largest such cases involving customs to be tried by the Control Yuan. Near the end of 2013, Huang began another land use investigation into the Taoyuan Aerotropolis urban development. Soon after, Huang and Chao Chang-ping announced the end of a review into the Republic of China Armed Forces. The pair stated that transitioning to an entirely volunteer-based force by 2017 would be difficult. The earliest plans to phase out conscription called for a volunteer military by 2015, a date that has been repeatedly postponed. In March 2018, William Lai appointed Huang to lead the Transitional Justice Commission. Huang resigned the position on 6 October 2018. Activism Huang founded the Taiwan Research Foundation in 1988, an organization credited with helping spread Taiwan studies worldwide, and is domestically recognized for its contribution to Taiwan's democratization up to the first direct presidential election in 1996. He is also known for his comprehensive research into Taiwan's National Health Insurance program while serving on the Control Yuan and is a proponent of health care reform. Huang has also served as president of the Chiang Wei-shui Foundation. He chaired the Taipei School of Economics and Political Science Foundation, which proposed the founding of the Taipei School of Economics and Political Science as National Tsing Hua University's eleventh college in 2020.

Its binding affinity (Ki value) to TSPO is comparable with PK11195. GML-1 is selective for TSPO versus the central benzodiazepine receptor (CBR, GABAA receptor). The compound GML-1 was the most active of a series of 1-arylpyrrolo[1,2-a]pyrazine-3-carboxamides, and its anxiolytic effects were examined using the open field test (OFT) and the elevated plus maze (EPM) test. The EPM test is a general anxiety test measuring the time spent by animals in the open or the enclosed arms. When compound was administered to CD-1 mice at the dose of 1.0 mg/kg, it significantly increased the percentage of open arm entries and the time spent in the open arms. GML-1 is a potential antianxiety agent. The TSPO-mechanism of anxiolytic action of GML-1 was proved by inhibitor analysis with TSPO antagonist PK11195 that blocks effect of GML-1. The involvement of neurosteroids in the mechanism of action of GML-1 was confirmed by co-administration of GML-1 with neurosteroid synthesis inhibitors. The anxiolytic effect of GML-1 in elevated plus-maze tests was completely blocked by the neurosteroidogenic-enzyme inhibitors trilostane and finasteride. The tablet dosage form of GML-1 was developed and showed pronounced anxiolytic activity after intragastric administration in rats in a wide range of doses.

Bosworth works primarily with a large-format, 8x10 view camera and focuses on the relationship between humans and nature. Her works have been included in magazines, journals, books and permanent collections, and shown in solo exhibits nationally and internationally.  Life and career  Bosworth was born in 1953 in Cleveland, Ohio and grew up in Novelty, Ohio. She studied at Bowling Green State University, where she received her B.A. in Fine Arts in 1975. She earned an M.F.A. in photography at Rochester Institute of Technology in 1983. Bosworth worked briefly as a visiting instructor at Ohio University in Athens, Ohio, before joining the photography faculty at the Massachusetts College of Art and Design in Boston, Massachusetts in 1984. In 1985, Bosworth won a Guggenheim fellowship for her photographic work. She has been professor and Chair of the Photography Department at Massachusetts College of Art. Bosworth grew up surrounded by trees, plants, and the outdoors. She creates her views of the natural world using a large-format film camera, exploring subtle relations between humans and landscapes, \\"unfolding a personal and spiritual connection to the world around us.\\" According to Andy Grundberg, writing in Grand Street, her peers in landscape photography include Laura McPhee, Lois Connor, Terry Evans, Linda Halverson, and Mary Peck, among others.  Work  Much of Barbara Bosworth's photographic work focuses on landscapes and trees. She spent several months intensively photographing the New England Trail, and over fourteen years visiting and photographing large trees from the National Register. In other photographs such as Indigo Bunting she captures fleeting moments of connection between birds and humans, \\"incredibly intimate moment[s] of contact\\" with the tiny creatures appearing \\"exceptionally vulnerable.\\" Bosworth documents the American landscape and how it is affected by humans. Bosworth captures details using a view camera, and she often creates diptychs and triptychs from a set of exposures, expanding the area of her images. In her series Birds and Other Angels, the triptych format places her photographs of birds and humans within the wider scope of the forest surrounding them. Although Bosworth works in color, she also frequently shoots in black and white, intentionally limiting the image to forms shown in tones of grey, undistracted by color. In her twenty-year retrospective Natural Histories: Photographs by Barbara Bosworth, about three quarters of the photographs are in black and white and one quarter were in color. In a San Francisco MoMA interview, Bosworth asserts that her processes are slowed down due to the use of film, and that the care and thoughtfulness put into her work increases with that time. She takes her time carefully studying the landscapes, which primarily consists of forests, birds, and the people her work has crossed paths with. Like other landscape photographers, Bosworth's asserted interest is in exploring the world at her own pace and appreciating what nature puts in front of her. She believes that observation is necessary to the artistic process and end product. Although she examines what appears before her in the natural world, Bosworth's chosen subject matter remains very personal and depicts specific moments that she has experienced. Her first photographs in and around her home in Ohio were taken from her rectangular living room window, looking out into the Ohio forest. Although her earliest photographs rarely included humans, she increasingly focused on people's connection to and effects on the surrounding environment, and she often mentions her parents and her upbringing as influences. Bosworth's mother developed Parkinson's disease and dementia, while her father passed away from old age. Bosworth was able to channel these experiences into her work, drawing on them as an inspiration for her book Behold (2014): \\"Photography is our validation that we were there.\\" = Behold = Bosworth's work was exhibited in the fall of 2014 at the Datz Museum in SinSeong Gol, Gwangju, Gyeonggi Province, South Korea. This work was collected and bound by the museum's Datz Press, into the book Behold. Bosworth's photographs connected tall, ancient tree stands with people, animals, streams that seem to flow through nature with time. The exhibition had its opening reception on October 11, 2014. About Behold, Bosworth states: = New England Trail = In the fall of 2012, the New England National Park Service hired Bosworth as Artist-in-Residence to take pictures along the New England Trail. Her photos were shown at the exhibition To Be at the Farther Edge: Photographs along the New England Trail at Amherst College in Massachusetts and later throughout New England. This work is her tribute to the genre of Hudson River School style paintings, which have inspired her, and her piece View of the Oxbow from Dry Knob (2012) is a particular tribute to Thomas Cole‚Äôs famous painting The Oxbow. = Trees : national champions = Many of Barbara Bosworth‚Äôs photographs focus on the landscapes of trees. She explored Holden Arboretum as a child and as an adult with her family. Bosworth says trees \\"are rooted solidly in the earth but point ethereally toward the sky.\\" \\"Champion trees\\" are notably the largest trees of each species according to the National Register of Big Trees, and are found in many different locations including backyards, street sides, mountains, and forests. In Trees: national champions, Bosworth documents the genera of the trees and also shows how their landscape changes from place to place. = Voyage of the Charles W. Morgan = In the summer of 2014, eighty- five people from various backgrounds were invited to sail on the Charles W. Morgan ship from Mystic Seaport in Mystic, CT, to produce creative projects for Mystic Seaport. Bosworth was chosen because, \\"While all of her projects remind viewers that we shape nature, but nature also shapes us.\\" The trip was one day and one night long. During that evening, Bosworth created Nocturnal Voyage: The Morgan Series, which consists of five images of the dark sea. = The Meadow = In 2015, Bosworth collaborated with photographer Margot Anne Kelley to photograph an area of land in Carlisle, Massachusetts, situated among a variety of landscapes with pathways and abandoned areas. The resulting book The Meadow includes a log documenting the daily life of the previous landowner to reinforce the connection between humans and the land, and incorporates photographs in scrap-book form with fold-out booklets and embellishments. The project has been described as \\"a meditation on the shifting perspective that occurs when one repeatedly sees the same place through new eyes.\\"  Notable exhibitions  = Solo exhibitions = * Heaven, Wind, Stars and Poems: Photographs by Barbara Bosworth, Datz Museum, South Korea, 2017 * Barbara Bosworth: Quiet Wonder, Denver Art Museum, March 13, 2015 - September 20, 2015 * Flow, Datz Museum, October 11, 2014 to February 5, 2015 * Natural Histories, Photographs by Barbara Bosworth (twenty- year retrospective), Peabody Essex Museum, April 14, 2012 to May 27, 2013 * Earth and Sky: Photographs by Barbara Bosworth, Smithsonian American Art Museum, Renwick Gallery, June 20, 2008 - November 20, 2008, donated by Haluk Soykan and Elisa Frederickson and supported by Bernie Stadiem Endowment Fund * Human Nature: the Photographs of Barbara Bosworth, Phoenix Art Museum, April 19, 2008- July 27, 2008 * Photographs by Barbara Bosworth (ten-year retrospective), The Art Museum, Princeton University, March 14 through June 18, 2000 * Meeting Places: Photographs by Barbara Bosworth, Missoula Museum of Art, Missoula, MT, 1996 * Centric 29: Barbara Bosworth, University Art Museum, California State University, Long Beach, CA, 1987 = Group exhibitions = * The Singing and the Silence: Birds in Contemporary Art, October 31, 2014 ‚Äì February 22, 2015, Smithsonian American Art Museum, Washington, DC: Show included twelve \\"major contemporary American artists\\" * America's Uncommon Places: Sites from the National Register of Historic Places: Seventeen photographers were selected for an exhibition sponsored by the National Trust for Historic Preservation. * Crossing the Frontier, organized by the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, traveling exhibition * The Altered Landscape, organized by the Reno Museum of Art, traveling exhibition; Bosworth is one of the artists included in the accompanying book.

It premiered in the United Kingdom on CBBC on 31 October 2017 (Halloween), and in Canada on the Family Channel on 5 October 2018. In the United States, the show was announced as a Netflix original series. Each episode has an individual story and all are linked together by 'The Curious', a mysterious story collector who appears at the beginning and end of each episode. According to the creators Bede Blake and Robert Butler, inspiration was drawn from Steven Spielberg and Amazing Stories in particular. Format Creeped Out is an anthology, with each episode featuring a new setting, story and new characters, although some details connect the stories together. This concept is quite similar to the American television show \\"Amazing Stories\\", in the sense that almost every episode, major details will shift and change. Each episode begins and ends with an appearance from The Curious (played by William Romain), a mysterious man whose face is always concealed by a mask. His self-stated purpose is to be a collecter of stories. The setting of Karter Bay appears in the episodes \\"Slapstick\\" and \\"The Call\\", and Zucco's Pizzeria is mentioned in \\"Trolled\\", ‚Äú‚Äò‚ÄôNo Filter‚Äù‚Äô‚Äô, \\"Marti\\" and \\"Kindlesticks\\". Talking about The Curious, co-creator Bede Blake said: \\"It's designed to be an evolving urban legend. You don't know what's under that mask... Story-wise, he's not a threat to the children. He has his name because he is naturally curious. He's not somebody out to do harm. He's an observer.\\" Production Creeped Out was first announced by the BBC on 28 March 2017, saying \\"the stories combine sci-fi, horror, adventure, suspense, fantasy and mystery to thrill young viewers.\\" Talking about the show for a Den of Geek interview, co-creator Robert Butler said that both CBBC and DHX gave the creators a long leash and \\"freedom to pitch whatever the hell we liked,\\" but also provided buffers and steering when required. According to Syfy Wire, this was a great plan, and said Blake and Butler's plan was to make Amazing Stories mixed in with The Twilight Zone, but aimed at a younger, modernized audience. After the airing of \\"The Call\\", \\"Creeped Out\\" took a month-long hiatus. The first episode airing after the hiatus was \\"Bravery Badge\\". On 9 August 2018, it was announced that \\"Creeped Out\\" had been commissioned for a second series by two channels, CBBC and Family Channel. The second series was released on 24 April 2019.

The site's history extends back over two thousand years and includes Iberian, Roman and medieval remains. During the Islamic period, the castle was known as Murbƒ©tar and Morvedre.Franco S√°nchez, 2006, p. 47. The castle was declared a National Monument in 1931.Ag√®ncia Valenciana del Turisme 2016. The sacking of the Iberian settlement by Hannibal in 219 BC led to the outbreak of the Second Punic War. The visible walls are largely Islamic in origin, with substantial modifications taking place after the end of Islamic rule, with the defences being strengthened and modernised. In 1811, during the Napoleonic Wars, the French laid siege to the castle, and were ultimately successful in taking it, after which the defences were repaired. Location Sagunto Castle occupies a prominent hilltop The castle is located north of Valencia, upon a flat-topped hill.Collins 1998, p. 229. The hill is the last upthrust of the Sierra Calderona mountains, reaching an altitude of above mean sea level.Tourist Info Sagunto. Etymology The original Iberian name for the city was Arse.Baixauli i Bach 2013, p. 4. Sagunto was originally recorded as a Roman municipium in the middle of the 1st century BC, as the Municipium Saguntinum,Mateu y Llopis p. 23/361. or simply Saguntum. During the reign of Wamba, king of the Visigoths, the old Roman municipium became referred to as Sagunto, and it continued under this name until 711 AD, and the end of the Visigoth kingdom.Mateu y Llopis pp. 24-25/362-363. During the Muslim domination of Spain, the Mozarabs referred to the town as Murum Veterum, the \\"old wall\\", a name already in use by the 11th century. In time this form was contracted and corrupted into forms such as Murvetrum, Morvedre, and Molvedre,Mateu y Llopis p. 25/363. and the Muslims modified this into Murbiter. Christian documents from the 11th century use the form Murus Vetulus.Mateu y Llopis p. 26/364. Description The site occupies a hilltop overlooking the Mediterranean Sea, and is surrounded by defensive walls. The castle is divided into seven main sections or plazas. The principal divisions are the Plaza de Armas, Plaza de Almenara, Plaza de los Nueve Pilares, Plaza de San Fernando, Plaza de los Estudiantes, Plaza de la Ciudadela and Plaza del Espol√≥n.Centro Arqueol√≥gico Saguntino 1972, p. 35/67. The visible ruins are essentially those of the Muslim citadel, with later modifications under Christian rule, and finally by French engineers during the Peninsular War. =Curtain wall= The curtain wall mostly dates to the Islamic period; it descended from the castle to connect to a series of fortifications laid out around the town below. It underwent substantial modifications from the Christian period through to the Peninsular War, with Gothic and Renaissance reworking of Muslim fortifications. A number of towers and bastions survive, mostly dating to the 18th century.Baixauli i Bach 2013, p. 8. =Plaza del Refectorio= The Plaza del Refectorio is the smallest of the plazas, situated in the centre of the castle upon an elevation that also supports the Reina Gobernadora battery. The Plaza del Refectorio takes its name from a number of vaulted arcades that were used as refectories. Its east side is formed by the refectory building; it is bordered on the south side by the curtain wall, on the west by a ruined double wall and a Roman tower, and on the north by a fortified wall. A corridor running between the Plaza del Refectorio and the battery links the Plaza de Armas with the Plaza de San Fernando.Carruana Mart√≠nez and Civera i G√≥mez 2000, pp. 17‚Äì18. =Roman remains= The Almenara Gate overlooks the foundations of the Roman forum The Plaza de Armas is accessed via an Islamic arch. Remains of the Iberian defensive wall are visible on the east side of the castle. The foundations of the Roman forum, together with those of some Iberian buildings, and those of a Roman temple or capitolium, are all located in the forum area of the castle, upon the hilltop.Collins 1998, p. 230. The ruins of the Roman buildings are laid out around a square measuring . The plaza was fronted on the west side by a basilica that measured . The east side of the square was lined by a row of tabernae (shops). To the south of the plaza is a well-preserved cistern, and the base of the temple or capitolium are on the north side. The temple measured . A complex building was situated on the northeast side of the plaza; it has not been securely identified but it may have been a curia (assembly or court building) or a temple of Augustus. Since it possessed two large parallel chambers, it may have served both functions. The remains of a Roman theatre stand some down the hillside to the northwest of the forum. The cistern is likely to have been built when the city was rebuilt after the Second Punic War. The Roman forum was excavated in 1985. The original forum dated to the Late Republican period, and was largely demolished in the Early Imperial period in order to build a new forum. The replacement was built during the reign of Augustus, and paid for by Gnaeus Baebius Geminus, a local aristocrat. The hilltop was levelled, and retaining walls reinforced by buttresses supported the artificial platform that served as a foundation for the forum. On the north side of the forum, the retaining walls and buttressing are still visible. History Illustration of Sagunto Castle produced in 1563 by Anton van den Wyngaerde The site was apparently first settled by the Iberians in the early Iron Age. These early inhabitants belonged to the Edetani tribe. As the Carthaginian Empire expanded, the inhabitants formed a defensive alliance with Rome. The Carthaginian general Hannibal sacked the Iberian settlement in 219 BC, an action that led to the outbreak of the Second Punic War. In 214 BC, the Romans took Sargunto from the Carthaginians. Between 175 and 100 BC, the Romans built a temple or capitolium on the hill. A water cistern was built close to the temple, and was later incorporated into the Imperial forum, in the 1st century AD. The history of the castle during the Islamic period is poorly studied, with Sagunto being overshadowed by Valencia during that time. It was during the Islamic period that the Albacar portion of the castle was built, as well as most of the outer wall.Baixauli i Bach 2013, p. 6. 8th century Arab records from the reign of Abd al-Rahman I (ruled 755‚Äì788 AD) indicate that Sagunto fell within the jurisdiction of Tortosa at that time, rather than that of Valencia.Franco S√°nchez, 2006, pp. 47‚Äì48. Muslim historian Ibn Hayyan recorded that the castle was taken by force in 929‚Äì930, and mentions it again, under its Arab name, as submitting to the sultan Abd-ar- Rahman III in 933 AD.Franco S√°nchez, 2006, pp. 50‚Äì51. Sagunto Castle was used as a fortress by the Muslims to defend the regions of Catalonia and Valencia. It was seized and occupied by El Cid from 1098 to 1102, and was definitively removed from Muslim rule by Christian king Jaume I in 1238,Baixauli i Bach 2013, p. 5. Meyerson 2004, p. 10. who incorporated it into the Kingdom of Valencia.Baixauli i Bach 2013, p. 5. By the mid-13th century, the castle was garrisoned by Christians, although the majority of the town's inhabitants were still Muslims.Meyerson 2004, p. 10. Jewish tombs under the walls of Sagunto Castle By the early 14th century, Sagunto (still known as Morvedre) had a growing Jewish population, resulting in the establishment of a Jewish cemetery under the castle walls in 1328.Meyerson 2004, pp. 35‚Äì36. Peter IV of Aragon reinforced the castle defences in the 14th century. In 1363, King Peter of Castile took the castle after laying siege to it. In 1562, Juan Bautista Antonelli was commissioned by King Philip II of Spain to improve and modernise the castle's defences; it was at this time that the castle precinct was divided into seven plazas. During the Spanish War of Succession, in the early 18th century, the castle was surrendered to the Archduke of Austria, but soon afterwards it passed under the control of King Philip V of Spain. In 1811, during the Peninsular War, Brigadier Andriani defended the castle against French troops commanded by General Suchet, who laid siege to the fortress on 23 September of that year.Gates 1986, 2001, p. 472. Andriani withstood the siege and several assaults,Chabret 1901, 2008, p. 24. although Suchet was ultimately victorious.Gates 1986, 2001, p. 326. After taking the castle, Suchet ordered it to be repaired and strengthened the defences. These modifications were overseen by Andriani. In 1932, M. Gonz√°lez Simancas excavated the general area of the Roman remains in the Plaza de Armas,Aranegui Gasc√≥ 1984, p. 195. but left few records of his investigations.Aranegui Gasc√≥ 1984, p. 202.

She completed both her BFA (1963) and MFA (1966) at Indiana University. Initially, Hahn worked in other two-dimensional art mediums before focusing on photography in graduate school. She is well-recognized due to her experimentation with experimental photographic methods which incorporate different forms of media. By transcending traditional concepts of photography, Hahn challenges the viewer not only to assess the content of the image, but also to contemplate the photographic object itself. Biography Betty Hahn was born on October 11, 1940 in Chicago, Illinois where she also grew up. At the age of ten, Hahn was given her first camera by an aunt. Hahn later on went to graduate from Scecina Memorial Catholic High School. Soon after, she enrolled at Indiana University with a full scholarship where she furthered her studies in Fine Arts, receiving both her BFA (1963) and her MFA (1966). Throughout her undergraduate years, she concentrated in drawing and painting; however, as she entered graduate study, she worked in photography. During this important developmental period, Hahn studied under one of the most well-known photography teachers of the time, Henry Holmes Smith, who encouraged Hahn's work in alternative processes. Once she graduated, Hahn moved to Rochester where she taught at the Rochester Institute of Technology until 1975. Hahn then relocated to Albuquerque where she was professor at University of New Mexico until her retirement in 1997. Work Hahn is best known for her explorations of alternative processes in photography, using both older methods of darkroom developing such as gum-bichromate and cyanotypes, with other art mediums, including hand-painting and even embroidery. She is noted as one of the first photographers to successfully integrate such a variety of art mediums. Hahn encourages the viewer to think more deeply through not only the use of different physical processes in her artwork, but also through the multiplicity of meanings in her photographs. In most of her work, Hahn integrates humor and irony as she explores the meanings generated by formal combinations. Some of her prints include the sprocket holes of the 35mm negative, which allude to its 35mm film origins: but by hand coloring with bright paints, she draws attention to the mixture of craft with industrial mediums. Once she started experimenting with the gum-bichromate process, Hahn started stitching into her photographs. Printing onto canvas and other fabrics allowed her to use thread to highlight certain aspects of the photograph. In combining her photographs with conventional practices, Hahn successfully intertwines formal and conceptual aspects. Not only does she speak to the mundane tasks of everyday life, but also about routine and normativity. In highlighting the ordinary in her work, Hahn elevates and revives that which has been lost in the practice of daily life. Embroidery references femininity, as Hahn underlines the feminist issue of the anonymity of women's handicraft. Her embroidery often emphasized flowers with its three-dimensionality, furthering the idea of femininity; she later on pursued this as a symbol and incorporated it in several of her other series.  Art and Feminism  In her work, Hahn delivers a powerful message in regards to women and embroidery. It is quite evident through time that women's labor is needlework, and that their labor is frequently undervalued as craft both when dissimilar and alike to men's work. In a time period where men overshadowed women in the traditional art, such as painting and sculpture, women oftentimes reverted to other mediums like textiles. It has been suggested that women's work, especially in embroidery, is of little value in the art field since it is considered a craft. Since \\"arts and crafts\\" are more often than not paired together, it is obvious they are in the same category; however, there is a clear distinction. For three- hundred years, women have been taught needlework through practice and tradition, and in inadvertently, promoted obedience and household effeminate behavior. As a result, instead of regarding stitching as an art, many viewed it as a thoughtless skill, lacking originality. On the contrary, however, it is far more than evident that the hand of woman is more than a mindless and conforming thing, it is one of sensitivity, thought, patience, perseverance, and strength. By incorporating embroidery and stitching, Betty Hahn pushes the audience to acknowledge the work of women not as craft or tradition, but as meticulous, creative and unique, Exhibitions The Division of Photographic History at the Smithsonian Institution exhibited Hahn's work in a group exhibit in the 1960s as a part of a developing series of displaying the works of women photographers. Afterwards her work was featured in multiple thematic exhibitions at the Smithsonian. Hahn's first solo show exhibiting her work was in 1973 at the Witkin Gallery in New York City. Thereafter, she received several grants from the National Endowment for the Arts in 1974, 1978, and 1983 to continue her work in explorative photography.

She is one of the leaders of the Yen Bai mutiny.  Biography  She was born in 1908 in Tho Xuong Street in Lang Thuong (now Bac Giang City, Bac Giang Province). Her parents are Nguyen Van Cao and Nguyen Thi Luu. Cao was involved in the movement of ƒê√¥ng Kinh Nghƒ©a Th·ª•c (Tonkin Free School), and was exiled to C√¥n ƒê·∫£o by the French colonial empire. Under the influence of her father, at the age of 18, she and her biological sister, Nguyen Thi Giang (C√¥ Giang), joined Nguyen Khac Nhu's H·ªôi Qu·ªëc d√¢n d·ª•c t√†i, and later Vi·ªát Nam Qu·ªëc D√¢n ƒê·∫£ng, working toward the goal of national independence. In the Y√™n B√°i mutiny, she was assigned by the head of the Communist Party Nguyen Thai Giao to be in charge of propaganda, military logistics and delivery. It was she and other women who delivered bombs from Xuan Lung village (Lam Thao district, Phu Tho province) to the train to Yen Bai to prepare for the February 1930 uprising. The Yen Bai insurrection was unsuccessful, and C√¥ B·∫Øc and her comrades were arrested and sentenced to five years of probation on 28 March 1930 in Yen Bai. In 1936, she was freed, and with her husband Pham Quang Sau, who was also a member of the Vi·ªát Nam Qu·ªëc D√¢n ƒê·∫£ng, opened a shop named B√¥v√¥ in Bac Ninh town to make contact with patriots. However, she died early in 1943, at the age of 35.
