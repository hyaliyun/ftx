Among human foragers, males and females target different types of foods and share them with each other for a mutual or familial benefit.Marlowe, Frank. \\"Hunting and Gathering: The Human Sexual Division of Foraging Labor.\\" Cross-Cultural Research. 41.2 (2007): 170-95. Web. In some species, males and females eat slightly different foods, while in other species, males and females will routinely share food; but only in humans are these two attributes combined.Zihlman, A., and NM Tanner. \\"Gathering and the hominid adaptation.\\" Anthropology Origins. 10.99 (2001): 163-194. Web. The few remaining hunter-gatherer populations in the world serve as evolutionary models that can help explain the origin of the sexual division of labor. Many studies on the sexual division of labor have been conducted on hunter-gatherer populations, such as the Hadza, a hunter-gatherer population of Tanzania.Marlowe, Frank. (2010). The Hadza: the Hunter-Gatherers of Tanzania. University of California Press.  Behavioral ecological perspective  = Man the hunter vs. woman the gatherer = Both men and women have the option of investing resources either to provision children or to have additional offspring. According to life history theory males and females monitor costs and benefits of each alternative to maximize reproductive fitness;Bird, R. \\"Cooperation and conflict: the behavioral ecology of the sexual division of labor.\\" Evolutionary Anthropology. 8.2 (1999): 65-75. however, trade-off differences do exist between sexes. Females are likely to benefit most from parental care effort because they are certain which offspring are theirs and have relatively few reproductive opportunities, each of which is relatively costly and risky. In contrast, males are less certain of paternity, but may have many more mating opportunities bearing relatively low costs and risks. Though not every hunter-gatherer population pinpoints females to gathering and males to hunting (most notably the Aeta and Ju'/hoansiBiesele, Megan; Barclay, Steve (March 2001). \\"Ju/'Hoan Women's Tracking Knowledge And Its Contribution To Their Husbands' Hunting Success\\". African Study Monographs Suppl.26: 67‚Äì84), the norm of most current populations divide the roles of labor in this manner. Natural selection is more likely to favor male reproductive strategies that stress mating effort and female strategies that emphasize parental investment. As a result, women do the low-risk task of gathering vegetation and underground storage organs that are rich in energy to provide for themselves and offspring. Since women provide a reliable source of caloric intake, men are able to afford a higher risk of failure by hunting animals. This classic theory of natural selection positing a difference in male and female reproductive strategies has recently been reexamined, with an alternate theory being proposed that promiscuity was encouraged among women and men alike, causing uncertainty among males of the paternity of their offspring, allowing for group cooperation in raising all offspring due to the possibility that any child could be the descendant of a male, similar to observations of the closest relative of humans, the bonobo. Moreover, recent archaeological research done by the anthropologist and archaeologist Steven Kuhn from the University of Arizona suggests that the sexual division of labor did not exist prior to the Upper Paleolithic (50,000 and 10,000 years ago) and developed relatively recently in human history. The sexual division of labor may have arisen to allow humans to acquire food and other resources more efficiently.Stefan Lovgren. \\"Sex-Based Roles Gave Modern Humans an Edge, Study Says\\". National Geographic News. Retrieved 2008-02-03. http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2006/12/061207-sex-humans.html  Hypotheses for evolutionary origins  = Provisioning household = The traditional explanation of the sexual division of labour finds that males and females cooperate within pair bonds by targeting different foods so that everyone in the household benefits.Lee and I. Devore, \\"What hunters do for a living, or How to make out on scare resources,\\" in Man the Hunter. pp. 30-48. Chicago:Aldine Females may target foods that do not conflict with reproduction and child care, while males will target foods that females do not gather, which increases variance in daily consumption and provides a broader diet for the family. Foraging specialization in particular food groups should increase skill level and thus foraging success rates for targeted foods. = Show-Off / Signaling hypothesis = The \\"show‚Äêoff\\" hypothesis proposes that men hunt to gain social attention and mating benefits by widely sharing game. This model proposes that hunting functions mainly to provide an honest signal of the underlying genetic quality of hunters, which later yields a mating advantage or social deference.Hawkes, K, and Bird Bliege. \\"Showing off, handicap signaling, and the evolution of men's work.\\" Evolutionary Anthropology. 11. (2002): 58-67. Web. Females tend to target the foods that are most reliable, while men tend to target difficult-to-acquire foods to \\"signal\\" their abilities and genetic quality. Hunting is thus viewed as a form of mating or male-male status competition, not familial provisioning.Hawkes, K. \\"Why do men hunt? Some benefits for risky strategies..\\" E. Cashdan. (1990): 145-166. Web. Recent studies on the Hadza have revealed that men hunt mainly to distribute food to their own families rather than sharing with other members of the community.Wood, B., and K Hill. \\"A Test of the \\"Showing-Off\\" Hypothesis with Ache Hunters.\\" Current Anthropology. 10.99 (2000): 124-25. Web. This conclusion suggests evidence against hunting for signaling purposes. = The Victorian Period = The Victorian era has been closely examined by Sally Shuttleworth and company. Women played dual roles and were expected to deliver with conviction in the aspects in which they were required to perform duties in and outside of the household. She states, \\"Two traditional tropes are here combined: Victorian medical textbooks demonstrated not only woman's biological fitness and adaptation to the sacred role of homemaker, but also her terrifying subjection to the forces of the body. At once angel and demon, woman came to represent both the civilizing power that would cleanse the male from contamination in the brutal world of the economic market and also the rampant, uncontrolled excesses of the material economy.\\"  SDL and optimal foraging theory  Optimal foraging theory (OFT) states that organisms forage in such a way as to maximize their energy intake per unit time.Marlowe, F. \\"Hunting and Gathering: The Human Sexual Division of Foraging Labor.\\" Cross- Cultural Research. 41.2 (2007): 170-95. Web. In other words, animals behave in such a way as to find, capture, and consume food containing the most calories while expending the least amount of time possible in doing so. The sexual division of labor provides an appropriate explanation as to why males forgo the opportunity to gather any items with caloric value- a strategy that would seem suboptimal from an energetic standpoint. The OFT suggests that the sexual division of labor is an adaptation that benefits the household; thus, foraging behavior of males will appear optimal at the level of the family.Marlowe, F. \\"A critical period for provisioning by Hadza men: Implications for pair bonding.\\" Evolution and Human Behavior. 24. (2003): 217-29. Web. If a hunter- gatherer man does not rely on resources from others and passes up a food item with caloric value, it can be assumed that he is foraging at an optimal level. But, if he passes up the opportunity because it is a food that women routinely gather, then as long as men and women share their spoils, it will be optimal for men to forgo the collection and continue searching for different resources to complement the resources gathered by women.Porter, C. (2007). \\"How Marginal are forager habitats?.\\" Journal of Archeological. 34. (2007): 59-68. Web.  Cooking and the sexual division of labor  The emergence of cooking in early Homo may have created problems of food theft from women while food was being cooked.Wrangham, R, J.D. Jones, G Laden, and D Pilbeam. \\"The Raw and the Stolen.\\" Current Anthropology 40.5 (1999): 567-94. As a result, females would recruit male partners to protect them and their resources from others. This concept, known as the theft hypothesis, accommodates an explanation as to why the labor of cooking is strongly associated with the status of women. Women are forced to gather and cook foods because they will not acquire food otherwise and access to resources is critical for their reproductive success. On the contrary, men do not gather because their physical dominance allows them to scrounge cooked foods from women. Thus, women's foraging and food preparation efforts allow men to participate in the high-risk, high-reward activities of hunting. Females, in turn, become increasingly sexually attractive as a means to exploit male interest in investing in her protection.  Evolution of sex differences  Many studies investigating the spatial abilities of men and women have found no significant differences,Corley, DeFries, Kuse, Vandenberg. 1980. Familial Resemblance for the Identical Blocks Test of Spatial Ability: No Evidence of X Linkage. Behavior Genetics.Julia A. Sherman. 1978. Sex-Related Cognitive Differences: An Essay on Theory and Evidence Springfield. though metastudies show a male advantage in mental rotation and assessing horizontality and verticality,Intelligence: Knowns and Unknowns and a female advantage in spatial memory. Ellis, Lee, Sex differences: summarizing more than a century of scientific research, CRC Press, 2008, , Halpern, Diane F., Sex differences in cognitive abilities, Psychology Press, 2000, , The sexual division of labor has been proposed as an explanation for these cognitive differences. Those differences disappear with a short training or when given a favorable image of woman ability. Furthermore, the individual differences are greater than the average differences, which isn't therefore a valid prediction of a man or woman cognitive ability. This hypothesis argues that males needed the ability to follow prey over long distances and to accurately target their game with projectile technology, and, as a result, male specialization in hunting prowess would have spurred the selection for increased spatial and navigational ability. Similarly, the ability to remember the locations of underground storage organs and other vegetation would have led to an increase in overall efficiency and decrease in total energy expenditure since the time spent searching for food would decrease.David C. Geary. Sexual selection, the division of labor, and the evolution of sex differences. Behavioral and Brain Sciences. 21. (1998): 444-447. Web. Natural selection based on behaviors that increase hunting success and energetic efficiency would bear a positive influence on reproductive success. However, recent research suggests that the sexual division of labor developed relatively recently and that gender roles were not always the same in early-human cultures, contradicting the theory that each sex is naturally predisposed to different types of work. The discussion of the division of gender roles have been an ongoing debate and Gerda Lerner quotes the philosopher Socrates to demonstrate that the idea of defined gender roles is patriarchal. It also identifies how men and women are capable of performing the same job descriptions with the exception of when it calls for anatomical differences, such as giving birth. \\"In Book V of the Republic, Plato‚Äîin the voice of Socrates‚Äîsets down the conditions for the training of the guardians, his elite leadership group. Socrates proposes that women should have the same opportunity as men to be trained as guardians. In support of this he offers a strong statement against making sex differences the basis for discrimination: if the difference [between men and women] consists only in women bearing and men begetting children, this does not amount to proof that a woman differs from a man in respect to the sort of education she should receive; and we shall therefore continue to maintain that our guardians and their wives ought to have the same pursuits. He continues to add that with the same set of established resources such as education, training and teaching, it creates an atmosphere of equity which helps to further the cause of gender equality. \\"Socrates proposes the same education for boys and girls, freeing guardian women from housework and child-care. But this female equality of opportunity will serve a larger purpose: the destruction of the family. Plato's aim is to abolish private property, the private family, and with it self-interest in his leadership group, for he sees clearly that private property engenders class antagonism and disharmony. Therefore \\"men and women are to have a common way of life. . . ‚Äîcommon education, common children; and they are to watch over the citizens in common.\\" Some researchers, such as Cordelia Fine, argue that available evidence does not support a biological basis for gender roles. = Evolutionary perspective = Based on the current theories and research on the sexual division of labor, four critical aspects of hunter‚Äêgatherer socioecology led to the evolutionary origin of the SDL in humans: (1) long‚Äêterm dependency on high‚Äêcost offspring,Halperin, R. \\"Ecology and Mode of Production: Seasonal Variation and the Division of Labor by Sex Among Hunter- Gatherers.\\" Journal of Anthropological Research. 36 (1980): 379-399. Web. (2) optimal dietary mix of mutually exclusive foods,Wrangham, R, J.D. Jones, G Laden, and D Pilbeam. \\"The Raw and the Stolen.\\" Current Anthropology 40.5 (1999): 567-94. Web. (3) efficient foraging based on specialized skill, and (4) sex‚Äêdifferentiated comparative advantage in tasks.Hurtado, A. M., Hill, K., Kaplan, H., & Hurtado, I. (1992). Trade-offs between female food acquisition and child care among Hiwi and Ache foragers. Human Nature. 3.3. (1992): 185 ‚Äì 216. These combined conditions are rare in nonhuman vertebrates but common to currently-existing populations of human foragers, which, thus, gives rise to a potential factor for the evolutionary divergence of social behaviors in Homo.

Says Wynton Marsalis in his introduction to Waldo's book: \\"He teaches Ragtime, he talks about Ragtime, he plays it, he embodies it, he lives it, and he keeps Ragtime alive.\\" Marsalis \\"Introduction\\" This Is Ragtime xx. The book, This is Ragtime, published in 1976, grew out of the series of the same title that Waldo produced for NPR in 1974. Waldo is also a theatrical music director, producer, vocalist, and teacher. He is noted for his wit and humor in performance, as \\"a monologist in the dry, Middle Western tradition.\\"Wilson \\"Waldo Plays Ragtime\\" New York Times July 1, 1984. Eubie Blake describes his first impression of Waldo's performance thus: \\"I died laughing...that's one of the hardest things to do‚Äîmake people laugh. Terry's ability to do this, combined with his musicianship, actually reminds me of Fats Waller.\\"Blake \\"Foreword\\" This is Ragtime xxiii.  Early life  The Waldo family moved to Columbus, Ohio, when he was about five years old. His neighbor, John Baker, owned a large collection of jazz recordings, piano rolls, and jazz films. Baker's film collection was eventually acquired by the American Jazz Museum in Kansas City, Missouri, and is considered one of the most extensive in the world. As a child, Waldo listened to Spike Jones and Dixieland records, and became a record collector himself. At around the age of eight he began studying classical piano. The formal lessons continued for three years; in a short time he moved from classical to jazz and ragtime. He also learned how to play trumpet, tuba, string bass, cello, tympani drums, banjo, and organ. By 1961, he had organized his first band: The Fungus Five Plus Two (\\"our music grows on you\\"), which appeared on Ted Mack's Original Amateur Hour in 1963 after Waldo graduated from high school. In 1969 Waldo met Eubie Blake at the St. Louis Ragtime Festival. Blake became his mentor and lifelong friend. Waldo studied piano with Blake from 1971 through 1983, although Blake qualifies their arrangement: \\"Now, I'm not going to say I taught Terry how to play, because he already knew his stuff when I met him...He has become not only a fine musician, but an excellent entertainer.\\" Blake xxiii. Waldo also studied piano with Roland Hanna, Dick Wellstood, Jaki Byard, and Peter Howard. Career In 1963, Waldo began playing with Gene Mayl's Dixieland Rhythm Kings from Dayton, Ohio. Mayl's band was one of a few select hold-outs dotting the country from the traditional jazz revival of the 1940s. The twenty-year-old Waldo then appeared in New Orleans in 1964, playing with such notables as Kid Valentine and Johnny Wiggs. The Red Garter, home to various banjo bands, was one of his venues. In 1965 and 1966 he played in San Francisco at another Red Garter and at Earthquake Mcgoon's with West Coast jazz revival musicians. Waldo played with Turk Murphy's Jazz Band and studied with other prominent jazz musicians such as Pops Foster, Lu Watters, Wally Rose, and Clancy Hayes, while living in a room above Mcgoon's for one dollar per day. Returning to Ohio, Waldo formed the Gutbucket Syncopators in 1969. This traditional jazz group included Frank Powers, Roy Tate, and Jim Snyder, among others. The Syncopators performed at festivals and clubs and made a number of recordings. This band attracted top musicians from Chicago and New York and featured such notable guest performers as George Rock (of Spike Jones fame), Ruth Brisbane, and Edith Wilson. Waldo's twenty-six part NPR series, This is Ragtime, aired in 1974 and helped fuel the 1970s ragtime revival. The book of the same title grew out of that series: first published in 1976, and subsequently republished in 1991 and 2009. Eubie Blake, who wrote the introduction, credits his prot√©g√©: \\"Terry's love of Ragtime goes back a long way, long before its 'rediscovery.' People then were always trying to talk him out of playing that 'corny old stuff.'\\" In 1975, Waldo met vocalist Susan LaMarche, who would be his performing partner for twelve years. \\"She's still be best,\\" Waldo claims. Together they performed at the 92nd Street Y, The Jazz Church in NYC, Jacob's Pillow, The Rahway Theatre, and Carnegie Hall, and countless clubs, concerts, and festivals. Waldo relocated to New York City in the late 1980s, where he began playing at jazz clubs including The Cookery, The Village Gate, Hanratty's, and The Knickerbocker. Blake xxiv. Waldo continued to support the music scene of his native Ohio, forming Waldo's Ragtime Orchestra in 1980. This group, composed largely of members of Columbus Jazz Arts Group, performed concerts and recorded two albums for Stomp Off Records, which were later reissued by the classical record labels Musical Heritage Society and Sine Qua Non. In 1984, The Gotham City Jazz Band was born. The band remains active through the present day, having recorded several albums, and headlining regularly at festivals, concerts, and venues in New York City, including Michael's Pub, Symphony Space and The Museum of Modern Art. Peter Ecklund, Dan Barrett, Howard Alden, Eddy Davis, Brian Nalepka, Chuck Wilson, and Arnie Kinsella, longtime associates, are but a few of the many superlative jazz and ragtime musicians who have been part of the group in its many incarnations over the years. Notable guests of the band include Odetta, Leon Redbone, Maurice Hines, Susan La Marche, and Colleen Hawks. To date, Waldo has produced and arranged more than 40 albums for many labels including Sony BMG, Blackbird, GHB, Stomp Off, Musical Heritage Society, Sine Qua Non, Metronome, and Delmark. Television and film work include performances and compositions on The Tonight Show, the PBS documentary Storyville: The Naked Dance, and Ken Burns's PBS documentary, Unforgivable Blackness: The Rise and Fall of Jack Johnson. Waldo has also worked as a composer for a number of his own albums as well as others, including Leon Redbone. His TV work has included a year as music director, talent and producer for the two-way television operation Warner Qube in 1978. His work in New York City theatre includes credits as Music Director for shows such as Mr. Jelly Lord (directed by Vernel Bagneris), Playwrights Horizons production of Heliotrope Bouquet (directed by Joe Morton), Ambassador Satch (directed by Andr√© DeShields), and Warren G (directed by Tom O'Horgan), the Off-Broadway production of Shake That Thing! and Waldo's 1927 Revue.

Over the years, Brewer‚Äôs Bluff passed through several owners and became known as Rice‚Äôs Bluff, where a turpentine still operated just before the American Civil War. In the late 19th century, Brewton prospered as a sawmill town, where trees were harvested from the virgin pine forests and processed into lumber. Besides the sawmill, Brewton had houses, a church, a school, a hotel, and a post office. Owners of the sawmill selected the name Klondike in hopes of improving their fortune, but the name did not stick. Ownership of the sawmill changed several times, but bad luck plagued the mill and it burned twice. Once the virgin timber was gone, residents of Brewton had no reason to stay. Early in the 20th century, the L.N. Dantzler Lumber Company acquired the property. It abandoned the other structures, which had been part of Brewton, and they collapsed from disrepair.

The castle was first mentioned around the year 1000. In 1119, Otto IV, Count of Scheyern moved into the castle of Wittelsbach and converted his previous seat into Scheyern Abbey. The castle's name, \\"Witilinesbac\\", is however already mentioned as the place of origin of Otto IV in a document by Henry V dating from 1115. From 1120, the Counts of Scheyern were Counts Palatine of Wittelsbach. The castle thus became the ancestral seat of the House of Wittelsbach, the later Electors and Kings of Bavaria and Electors of the Palatinate. According to local tradition, the castle was destroyed in 1209 after Count Otto of Wittelsbach murdered King Philip of Swabia, and it was not rebuilt. An archaeological excavation undertaken from 1978 to 1980 found no evidence of a sudden destruction of the castle, however. From the archaeological evidence, it appears the castle's walls were used as a quarry after the castle itself was abandoned. Memorial stone on the former site of Wittelsbach Castle In the 15th century, the Gothic church Beatae Mariae Virginis was built on the former castle site. The church, still standing today, became the nucleus of the village of Oberwittelsbach (Upper Wittelsbach). In 1834, the Wittelsbach family erected a monument on the site of their former castle. In memory of the castle, parts of the district Aichach-Friedberg are today called Wittelsbacher country. In 1838 Duke Maximilian Joseph in Bavaria, the father of Empress Elisabeth of Austria, acquired a castle in the nearby village of Unterwittelsbach (Lower Wittelsbach), built in 1537 on the site of another, older castle dating from the Middle Ages; it remained in the possession of the junior ducal branch (named Dukes in Bavaria) of the royal House of Wittelsbach until 1955 and now houses a museum devoted to Empress Elisabeth.

The concept started as the TX (Transformer) in 2009 for a terrain- independent transportation system centered on a ground vehicle that could be configured into a VTOL air vehicle and carry four troops. ARES' primary function was the same as TX, to use flight to avoid ground-based transportation threats like ambushes and IEDs for units that don't have helicopters for those missions. It was to be powered by twin tilting ducted fans and have its own power system, fuel, digital flight controls, and remote command-and-control interfaces. The flight module would have different detachable mission modules for specific purposes including cargo delivery, CASEVAC, and ISR.

The objective of the Transformer (TX) program was to demonstrate a four-person vehicle that provided enhanced logistics and mobility though hybrid flyable/roadable capabilities. This presented an unprecedented capability to avoid traditional and asymmetrical threats while avoiding road obstructions. TX would enable enhanced company operations of future missions with applicable use in strike and raid, intervention, interdiction, insurgency/counterinsurgency, reconnaissance, medical evacuation, and logistical supply. The TX vehicles were to have Vertical Takeoff and Landing (VTOL) capability with a minimum combat range of 250 nautical miles on a single tank of fuel. The primary focus of the TX program was the development and demonstration of an integrated suite of critical technologies to enable dual-mode transportation, VTOL capability, efficient flight performance, and a combat range comparable to present day rotorcraft. It was envisioned that the program would, at a minimum, demonstrate the ability to build a ground vehicle that was capable of configuring into a VTOL air vehicle that provided sufficient flight performance and range, while carrying a payload that was representative of four troops with gear. Key performance parameters were specified to show specific operational utility. The program was divided into two separate tasks; Task A would develop and integrate a full vehicle and Task B would develop individual critical technologies components for the full vehicle. =Function= The Marines, Air Force, special forces and National GuardMartin, Bob.

Accessed: 31 December 2010. ;Phase II ‚Äî Design In 2011, AAI and Lockheed were chosen to proceed with Phase II of the project. The 7,500 lb AAI vehicle was proposed to be equipped with a 1,200 shp Honeywell HTS900 turboshaft engine to power four electric wheel motors or the 56-inch ducted fan, and spin up the 50-foot rotor. Ground speed was up to 80 mph; flight speed range was 50 to 155 kt; maximum altitude was 10,000 ft. The 7,000 lb Lockheed vehicle had two turboshaft engines in a 41 ft wing with tilting 8.5 ft ducted fans, giving a flight speed of 130 kt, while a Pratt & Whitney EnduroCore heavy-fuel rotary engine powers the four electric wheel motors for ground motion. At AUVSI 2012, Lockheed Martin spoke openly about their status on the project. AAI Corporation was silent about their involvement details, but confirmed they were still in the competition. At the time of expo, neither company had prototype vehicles, but had designs and scale models of their concept vehicles. Previously, both passed DARPA's preliminary design review, which involved computer modeling. Lockheed's vehicle relied on two huge turbo-shaft fans and folding wings fixed to a turret above the cab to provide lift and thrust during flight. A key component is computerized flight. Because it will be used by soldiers rather than trained pilots, vehicle operation will be mostly automated. One idea is to have a computer screen to simply plot GPS points to chart a flight path. The fans rotate 90 degrees on the turret from their stowed positions just in front of and behind the cab to their in-flight positions on both sides of it. Control of takeoff, landing, and flight is controlled by the computer, although soldiers onboard would be able to alter their course or perform an emergency landing. The automated flight technology will be similar to the kind used by the F-35 Lightning II. The lift fans of Lockheed's vehicle provide hover while AAI's did not. AAI's vehicle could be made lighter, which gave greater ability to up-armor.Dillow, Clay. \\"Concept Gets a Lift from the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter\\" Popular Science, 10 August 2012.

Optimum speed will be , with a maximum speed of , faster than a helicopter with a sling-load. A similar class of helicopter would require a -wide landing zone, double that of ARES, making 10 times more landing locations usable; the ARES would however be less fuel-efficient than a helicopter while hovering.

He is mentioned in the histories of Herodotus as having been an admirer of Greek culture and traditions, which led to his falling out of favor with his people and being executed by his brother. Coins from Niconium bearing the name of Scyles  Life  Scyles was the heir and son of the king Ariapeithes and a Greek woman from Istria. His mother taught him to read and speak the Greek language, which distinguished him from other Scythians, who were illiterate. Because of his mixed heritage, he was ambivalent toward the culture of his father and displayed many Hellenic traits. For example, he built a large house in Pontic Olbia and married a Greek woman, both unheard of practices because the Scythians were largely nomadic and polygamous. He also publicly took part in Bacchic rites, to the anger of other Scythian chiefs. According to Herodotus, it was because of these unconventional traits that the Scythians rebelled against Scyles, and he was forced to flee from his homeland. He escaped to the Thracian king Sitalces. However, he was pursued by his brother Octamasadas, who raised an army and marched on Thrace. In the midst of the war between the Scythians and Thracians, it was agreed upon by Sitalces and Octamasedes that Scyles would be given over to his brother, in exchange for the release of Sitalces' brother, who was being held prisoner by the Scythians. Scyles was handed over and executed. Coins bearing the name of Scyles have been found in Niconium, where it is thought that Scyles was buried.

It originally aired on May 20, 2010 on NBC. The series‚Äîpresented as if it were a real documentary‚Äîdepicts the everyday lives of office employees in the Scranton, Pennsylvania, branch of the fictional Dunder Mifflin Paper Company. In the episode, the press learns that Sabre printers catch on fire and Jo (Kathy Bates), suspecting that someone within the Scranton branch leaked the information, sets out to discover who the whistleblower is. It was written by Warren Lieberstein and Halsted Sullivan and directed by Paul Lieberstein. The episode received mixed reviews from critics and was watched in 6.60 million households. Synopsis The press finds out that Sabre's printers catch on fire, and CEO Jo Bennett (Kathy Bates) shows up to the office in hopes of finding out who the whistleblower is. Everyone suspects Andy Bernard (Ed Helms), who adamantly denies he leaked the information, even though he was the first in the office to learn of it. Jo has Nick (Nelson Franklin), the IT guy, check everyone's computer to find evidence for a potential leak, and he is constantly harassed while trying to do so. Jo and Gabe Lewis (Zach Woods) interview everyone as well to find the potential leak, starting with Michael Scott (Steve Carell). Although Michael suggests some very harsh treatment of the offender, which proves his innocence to Jo, he insists that no one in the office would have leaked the information. During the interviews, Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) comes in and offers Jo a long list of people she should fire to convince her it was not him. Jo believes him and recommends that he invest the money he made this year in real estate. After a lot of consideration, Dwight decides to attempt to buy the Scranton Business Park, and suggests in a conversation with Hank (Hugh Dane) the security guard that he will implement sweeping changes to the place. Meanwhile Michael tries to get Andy to confess he told the press. When Andy suggests that Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson) could be the whistleblower, Michael confronts him. Darryl admits he told a female reporter at a bar after work about the videotaped printer catching on fire. Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) voluntarily confesses to Michael that she told another mother at the day-care center whose husband is a reporter. He asks her and Darryl to meet him in the parking lot. Kelly Kapoor (Mindy Kaling) joins them as she had revealed the news on her various social networking sites. The three suggest to Michael that he should try to talk to Jo about the situation so that they can confess but keep their jobs. Michael tries to convince Jo to let the offenders off lightly which causes her to suspect that he knows the identity of the leak. Michael refuses to say anything, so Jo takes him to the hangar with her private jet to talk with him about his problems. Michael admits many of the stresses he has had throughout the year, including missing Holly Flax. Jo says that even though she will have to do a recall on the printers, she loathes the thought of having to make a public apology, fearing that is all she will be remembered for after she dies. Michael, who has already been enjoying the media attention over the printers so much that he enlisted the other employees to artificially raise the web counter on TV spots of him, offers to make the public apology for her. Gabe finishes interviewing everyone and deduces that Andy is the one who talked with the press. Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) defends Andy, and the office descends into haphazard speculations on the whistleblower's identity. Former CFO David Wallace (Andy Buckley) reveals himself as another leak as he heard about it from a former client and then told other former clients and potential clients out of spite. Nick announces that he is quitting to go teach inner city children in Detroit how to use computers. When Dwight and others mock him, Nick explodes and reveals personal computer information about many of the employees, including Andy's QuickTime video he shot with Darryl and a letter/email he sent to a local newspaper. The few employees who did not leak information to the press proceed to jeer at Andy for the rest of the day. However, Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) commends Andy's bravery, and he leaves smiling. Michael gives a public apology to a news crew, after which Jo tells him to let her know if she can help with any of his problems. When Michael half-jokingly asks to bring Holly back to Scranton, Jo sincerely tells him she will look into it, leaving him at a loss for words as the episode ends.

Cultural references While talking with his real estate agent on his cellphone, Dwight states that the office park is 1725 Slough Avenue. \\"Slough\\" is a reference to the UK edition of The Office which is set in Slough, United Kingdom. Reception In its original American broadcast, \\"Whistleblower\\" was viewed by an estimated 6.60 million viewers with a 3.4 rating/10% share in the 18‚Äì49 demographic coming second in its timeslot after the season finale of Grey's Anatomy, receiving the same rating as last week's episode, \\"The Chump\\" and dropping 3% from last years finale, \\"Company Picnic\\" according to Nielsen Media Research. The episode, \\"Whistleblower\\" ranked 13th in the weekly 18‚Äì49 demographic ratings and ranked becoming the highest rated show on NBC that week. Cindy White of IGN gave the episode a 7.8 saying it was \\"Good\\" and \\"This was probably the weakest finale in the show's history, coming in just below \\"Hot Girl\\", which ended the first six-episode run by at least introducing a new potential love interest for Jim.\\" Nathan Rabin of The A.V. Club gave this episode a B+, stating \\"tonight‚Äôs episode capped off a solid season on a promising note, tantalizing us with the prospect of Holly‚Äôs return.\\" Joel Keller of AOL's TV Squad gave the episode a negative review for not having enough plot twists saying \\"'Whistleblower' was no 'Casino Night.' It wasn't even close. In fact, it sent the season out on a lame note, indicative of how up and down this season has been.\\" Darren Franich of Entertainment Weekly gave the episode a positive review and wrote \\"This was an interesting way for The Office to end its sixth, and least cohesive, season: an admission that not a whole lot happened, followed by a callback to a plotline from last season. Still, there was some real heft to this closing episode‚Äîenough to give me some hope. Will Leitch of New York said \\"The Office's season six was usually funny and always big-hearted, but there was never much at stake.\\" James Poniewozik of Time criticized the show for the lack of stakes during the season, but stated \\"The season finale, 'Whistleblower', in some ways was characteristic of this season, in that some of its best moments came from characters at the periphery of the story. But it was also at best a sign of what this season could have been, and ended on at least a glimmer of hope for the next one.\\" TV Fanatic gave the episode a 3.5/5.0 saying \\"Instead, what shaped up like an seismic confrontation between Michael and Jo turned into a heart-to-heart of sorts. Enjoyable in its own right, yes. Epic finale material? Eh.\\" M. Giant of Television Without Pity gave the episode a B+.

It is an alliance of the Labour Party, Mouvement Socialiste Militant and Parti Mauricien Social D√©mocrate. It was formed by the prime minister Dr. Navin Ramgoolam and is led by three other people, namely Rashid Beebeejaun, Xavier-Luc Duval and Pravind Jugnauth. The party alliance won the general elections held on 5 May 2010 and is the majority alliance and forms the government of Mauritius, where the largest party is the Labour Party, with 27 MPs in all and headed by Prime Minister Navin Ramgoolam and is followed by the Militant Socialist Movement with 14 MPs and is headed by Pravind Jugnauth who became Vice Prime Minister following the alliance. The Mauritian Social Democrat Party has 4 MPs and the leader Xavier-Luc Duval is also Vice Prime Minister. The party has been kept for ethnic representation as alone the labour and MSM have absolute majority by 41 seats on 69. The Labour Party is an aristocratic movement headed by mostly Hindus and the MSM is a Vaish dominant party which competes for the Hindu vote. Having two parties with Hindu majority was not perceived as representing the whole population and ethnic minorities. The Social Democrats, which is a Christian majority party, has therefore paved its way to form part of the government. History The First alliance between the Labour Party, MSM and PMSD was made in 1983 by then Prime Minister Anerood Jugnauth. The main party in parliament was the MMM and it had defected the Labour Party with the 1982 elections with no labour candidate was elected to parliament. After having conflicts with Paul Berenger, Jugnauth resigned as Prime Minister but however dissolved the National Assembly on the same just hours before announcing his resignation . He formed the new party, namely MSM with the help of the Socialist Mauritian Party of Harish Boodhoo and some other members of the MMM who approved of his policies . Seewoosagur Ramgoolam, leader of the Labour Party had reached his 83rd birthday and could not stand as prime minister candidate for Labour. Instead they contracted an alliance with the MSM of Jugnauth obtaining 35 ticket allocation and the Labour 15 tickets. They made an electoral pact with the PMSD and agreed to not put any Labour-MSM candidate for the resting of 60 seats . PMSD eventually got the 12 resting tickets. The results was of MSM having 29 Mps, the Labour having 9 Mps and the PSMD left with 3 Mps . They formed the government with 45 Mps in all with Sir Anerood Jugnauth as Prime Minister, Sir Seewoosagur Ramgoolam as Governor General, Gaetan Duval as Deputy Prime Minister and new leader of the labour, Sir Satcam Boolell became Minister of Foreign Affairs .

It is inspired by the 2000 sinking of the Russian submarine K-141 Kursk from explosions of its own torpedoes during a major naval exercise. The play is set on a British submarine on a covert mission in the Barents Sea at this time. Production history Kursk's first run was at the Young Vic in London in 2009; it had a second run at the same theatre in 2010. The play was directed by Mark Espiner and Dan Jones for the theatre company Sound & Fury. It featured set design by Jon Bausor and starred Tom Espiner and Laurence Mitchell. A split-level set, which the audience were free to walk around, was designed for the play. It was also performed at the Drill Hall in Edinburgh in 2009 at the festival and at the Sydney Opera House in 2011. Background The Kursk, a nuclear submarine, sank in the Barents Sea during a Northern Fleet training exercise in 2000 that involved more than 30 ships. Kursk suffered an accidental explosion, fire and detonation of torpedoes, killing all 118 sailors and officers on board. In order to recreate the experiences of submariners, the directors visited HMNB Devonport, spoke to naval advisers, and spent time on an attack submarine. Overview Kursk tells the story of the sinking of the Kursk from the perspective of the crew of a nearby British submarine. When they hear the explosion of the Kursk on their instruments, the captain of the British vessel is faced with a decision as to whether to go to the Russian ship's aid. The play addresses the question of what would have happened had a British submarine been watching the Kursk, whether its crew would have intervened quickly enough to save some of the twenty-odd crew who survived a few hours, and the accompanying ethical and political dilemmas. In the event, the Russians refused foreign offers of aid for days. Critical reception In 2009 Rafael Behr of The Observer wrote that \\"At times the plot risks submersion in the sound effects and naval jargon, but there is enough emotional engagement to navigate the drama through all the periscope- swivelling simulation.\\" Michael Coveney of The Independent rated the play four stars and praised its recreation of the work of the submariners. Fiona Mountford of the Evening Standard praised Kursk in March 2010, writing that Lavery, Espiner and Jones \\"do so much right that it‚Äôs hard to know where to start.\\" Mountford praised the writer and directors' research, the play's sound design, and \\"the human angle, the sense of frustration and camaraderie as these men try to carve out fragments of personal lives\\". Sam Marlowe of The Times also praised the 2010 production, which he described as \\"thrilling and, thanks to the sensitivity of Lavery's script and the production's deft pacing, deeply affecting and thoughtful too.\\" Lyn Gardner of The Guardian, described Kursk as \\"a remarkable piece of theatre\\" and praised its \\"immersive\\" approach. In 2011 Jason Blake of The Sydney Morning Herald wrote that \\"Kursk's blending of humour and sentiment, with Dan Jones's masterly sound design and convincing technical detail, makes for an enjoyable, rather than deeply involving, ride.\\" Awards Jon Bausor was nominated for an Evening Standard Theatre Award for Best Design in November 2009 for his work on Kursk. The production was nominated for \\"Best Touring Production\\" at the 2010 TMA Awards. Dan Jones won the first ever Special Award for Excellence in Sound Design given by International Jury of the Prague Quadrennial 2011 for his work on Kursk. The award was given jointly to Katherine Sandys for her work Hush House.

The two sides were about to engage in battle when Sitalces sent a message to Octamasadas by a herald. The message said, \\"Why must we make trial of one another in fight? Thou art my sister's son and thou hast in thy power my brother. Do thou give him back to me, and I will deliver to thee thy brother Scylas: and let us not either of us set our armies in peril, either thou or I.\\" Sitalces proposed a trade; Sitalces would surrender Scylas if Octamasadas handed over one of Sitalces brothers, who had taken refuge with the Scythians because he feared Sitalces. Octamasadas accepted the terms and surrendered his own uncle to Sitalces. After the exchange, Sitalces left with his brother while Octamasadas beheaded Scylas as soon as he received him. This rapprochement between the Scythians and the Thracians - though tragic for Scylas - led to the stabilization among these players as regional powers along with the Thracian Spartocids, which resulted to a period of economic prosperity.

It was the builder and operator of the Celle‚ÄìSoltau railway and its branch line from Beckedorf to Munster. The initiative to build a railway to Bergen came from Celle district, who opened the first section from Gar√üen via Beckedorf to Bergen on 23 April 1902. The terminus had to be built at Gar√üen because no agreement could be reached with the town of Celle about the routing of the line within the town limits. With the permission of the Celle‚ÄìWittingen Light Railway a solution was found in the shape of a junction on their line. It was more than two years later, on 13 December 1904, that direct services from Bergen to Celle became possible when the line to Celle-Vorstadt on the Celle‚ÄìWittingen railway was opened. As a result, passenger trains no longer stopped at Gar√üen and goods trains (transferred to the state railway) followed suit on 1 September 1910. The railway facilities in Gar√üen were not dismantled until the 1930s. In 1905 joint operations were agreed with the Celle-Wittingen Light Railway. On 23 April 1910 the railway was extended from Bergen to Soltau and from Beckedorf to Munster. Two years earlier, in 1908 the Celle‚ÄìSoltau, Celle‚ÄìMunster Light Railway had been founded as a GmbH, supported by the district of Celle, the Kingdom of Prussia, the Province of Hanover and the districts of Fallingbostel and Soltau, the town of Celle and several villages along the line. During Germany's re-armament prior to the Second World War several sidings were built to serve military bases (Scheuen, Bergen) which caused a sharp rise in traffic. From 1940 the line was no longer handled as a light railway but as a public railway due to standardisation of the Reich's regulations. This was reflected in the company's new name: the Celle-Soltau, Celle‚ÄìMunster Railway (Eisenbahn Celle-Soltau, Celle‚ÄìMunster). On 1 March 1944 a merger agreement with the Celle-Wittingen Railway went into force to form the new company of Celle Railway Company (Celler Eisenbahn AG); this was merged in turn on 10 July 1944 into the East Hanoverian Railways (Osthannoversche Eisenbahnen). The lines are still working today.  Sources  * Gerd Wolff: Deutsche Klein- und Privatbahnen. Band 10: Niedersachsen 2. Zwischen Weser und Elbe.

Organization and role The White House physician has an office inside the White House. The location of his or her medical unit plays an important role in keeping the President of the United States healthy. He or she also oversees a staff which is typically composed of five military physicians, five physician assistants, five nurses, three paramedics, three administrators and one IT Manager. The White House Physician is metaphorically the \\"shadow of the President\\" because he or she is always close at hand whether the President is at the White House, overseas, on the campaign trail, or aboard presidential plane Air Force One; Daniel Ruge, for example, was nearby during the attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan in 1981, and supervised the president's immediate treatment. The Physician to the President protects the president's health and may also perform emergency surgery. The White House doctor is also responsible for providing comprehensive medical care to the members of the president's immediate family, the Vice President, and the Vice President's family. He or she may also provide medical care and attention to the more than 1.5 million visitors who tour the White House each year, as well as to international dignitaries and other guests of the President. The medical office of the White House doctor is a \\"mini urgent-care center\\" containing a physician's office, private examination rooms, basic medications and medical supplies, and a crash cart for emergency resuscitation. Air Force One is equipped with emergency medical equipment, an operating table, and operating room lights installed at the center of the presidential plane for emergency use by the White House doctor, but does not have an X-ray machine or medical laboratory equipment. Ruge resigned after Reagan's first term and called his job \\"vastly overrated, boring and not medically challenging\\". Ruge could not attend most state dinners due to lack of space. He nonetheless had to be ready for emergencies, and usually waited alone in his office wearing a tuxedo. Ruge stated that an advantage, however, was that because of the position's prestige \\"[a] president's physician can ask for anything, and he will get it. No doctor will refuse a request to consult\\". The White House physician can enter the Oval Office or Executive Residence at any time; Ruge sometimes invited experts visiting Washington to examine the president. =Selection of the physician= The White House Physician is often selected personally by the President, and most White House doctors are active- duty military officers,\\"White House Doctors: The President's Shadow.\\" CNN.com.

Though partial color blindness is considered only a mild disability, it is a condition that affects many people, particularly males. Complete color blindness, or achromatopsia, is very rare but more severe. While never demonstrated in humans, animal studies have shown that it is possible to confer color vision by injecting a gene of the missing photopigment using gene therapy. As of 2018 there is no medical entity offering this treatment, and no clinical trials available for volunteers. Color blindness The retina of the human eye contains photoreceptive cells called cones that allow color vision. A normal trichromat individual possesses three different types of cones to distinguish different colors within the visible spectrum from 380 nm to 740 nm. The three types of cones are designated L, M, and S cones, and each type is sensitive to a certain range of wavelength of light depending on what photopigment it contains. More specifically, the L cone absorbs around 560 nm, the M cone absorbs near 530 nm, and the S cone absorbs near 420 nm. Contrary to popular belief, the peak absorption frequency for L, M, and S cones do not exactly correspond to red, green, and blue wavelength. Rather, the peak frequency for the L cone is orange, yellowish green in M cones, and blue-violet in S cones. These cones transduce the absorbed light into electrical information to be relayed to neurons in the retina such as retinal bipolar cells and retinal ganglion cells, before reaching the brain. The signals from different cones are added or subtracted from each other to process the color of incoming light. For instance, the color red stimulate L cones more than M cones, whereas the color green stimulates the L and M cones more than the S cones. The colors are perceived in an opponent process, such that red and green are perceived in opposition, as are blue and yellow, black and white. The gene loci coding for the photopigments: M-opsin and L-opsin are located in close proximity within the X chromosome and are highly polymorphic. Among the population, some have a deleted gene for the M photopigment in the X chromosome (such as in deuteranopia), whereas others have a mutated form of the gene (such as in deuteranomaly). Individuals who can express only two types of opsins in the cones are called dichromats. Because males have only one copy of the X chromosome, dichromatism is much more prevalent among men. With only two types of cones, dichromats are less capable of distinguishing between two colors. In the most common form of color blindness, deuteranopes have difficulty discriminating between red and green color. This is shown by their poor performance in Ishihara test. Although dichromatism poses little problem for daily life, dichromats may find some color-coded diagrams and maps difficult to read. Less common forms of dichromacy include protoanopia (lack of L-cones), and tritanopia (lack of S-cones). If a person lacks two types of photopigments, they are considered monochromats. People lacking the three types of photopigments are said to have complete color blindness or achromatopsia. Color blindness can also result from damages to the visual cortex in the brain. Theory Experiments using a variety of mammals (including primates) demonstrated that it is possible to confer color vision to animals by introducing an opsin gene that the animal previously lacked. Using a replication-defective recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) as a vector, the cDNA of the opsin gene found in the L or M cones can be delivered to some fraction of the cones within the retina via subretinal injection. Upon gaining the gene, the cone begins to express the new photopigment. The effect of therapy lasts until the cones die or the inserted DNA is lost within the cones. While gene therapy for humans has been ongoing with some success, a gene therapy for humans to gain color vision has not been attempted to date. However, demonstrations using several mammals (including primates such as a squirrel monkey) suggest that the therapy should be feasible for humans as well. It is also theoretically possible for trichromats to be \\"upgraded\\" to tetrachromats by introducing new opsin genes. Motivation The goal of the gene therapy is to make some of the cones in the retina of a dichromat individual to express the missing photopigment. Although partial color blindness is considered to be a mild disability and even an advantage under certain circumstances (such as spotting camouflaged objects), it can pose challenges for many occupational fields such as law enforcement, aviation, railroad, and military service. More generally, color codes in maps and figures may be difficult to read for individuals with color blindness. Because only a single gene codes for a photopigment and the gene is only expressed in the retina, it is a relatively easy condition to treat using gene therapy compared to other genetic diseases. However, there remains the question of whether the therapy is worthwhile, for an individual to undergo an invasive subretinal injection to temporarily treat a condition that is more of an inconvenience than a disorder. However, complete color blindness, or achromatopsia, is very rare but more severe. Indeed, achromats cannot see any color, have a strong photophobia (blindness in full sun), and a reduced visual acuity (generally 20/200 after correction). Moreover, the research may have strong implications toward genetic therapy of other cone diseases. Other cone diseases such as Leber's congenital amaurosis, cone-rod dystrophy, and certain types of maculopathies may be treatable using the same techniques as the gene therapy used for color blindness.  Research  Experimental treatments for Leber's congenital amaurosis, a genetic disorder in photoreceptors that can lead to vision loss and blindness have been performed. These treatments use AAV vector and is delivered in much the same way as the gene therapy for color blindness. Human L-cone photopigment have been introduced into mice. Since the mice possess only S cones and M cones, they are dichromats. M-opsin was replaced with a cDNA of L-opsin in the X chromosome of some mice. By breeding these \\"knock-in\\" transgenic mice, they generated heterozygous females with both an M cone and an L cone. These mice had improved range of color vision and have gained trichromacy, as tested by electroretinogram and behavioral tests. However, this is more difficult to apply in the form of gene therapy. Recombinant AAV vector was to introduce the green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene in the cones of gerbils. The genetic insert was designed to only be expressed in S or M cones, and the expression of GFP in vivo was observed over time. Gene expression could stabilize if a sufficiently high dose of the viral vector is given. Adult dichromat squirrel monkeys was converted into trichromats using gene therapy. New world monkeys such as squirrel monkeys lack the L-opsin gene and are incapable of discriminating between certain shades of red and green. Recombinant AAV vector was used to deliver a human L-opsin gene into the monkey‚Äôs retina. Cones that gained the missing genes began expressing the new photopigment. If the therapy worked ‚Äî the monkeys would either remain dichromatic with greater sensitivity for longer wavelength of light, or they would become trichromats. Electroretinogram recordings demonstrated that they are able to discriminate blue-green from red-violet, and have indeed gained trichromacy. The treated monkeys were also more successful when their color vision was tested with a modified Ishihara test. Gene therapy was to restore some of the sight of mice with achromatopsia. The results were positive for 80% of the mice treated. Gene therapy for a form of achromatopsia was performed in dogs. Cone function and day vision have been restored for at least 33 months in two young dogs with achromatopsia. However, this therapy was less efficient for older dogs. Theoretical questions According to research by David H. Hubel and Torsten Wiesel, suturing shut one eye of monkeys at an early age resulted in an irreversible loss of vision in that eye, even after the suture was removed. The study concluded that the neural circuitry for vision is wired during a \\"critical period\\" in childhood, after which the visual circuitry can no longer be rewired to process new sensory input. Contrary to this finding, Mancuso et al.‚Äôs success in conferring trichromacy to adult squirrel monkeys suggests that it is possible to adapt the preexisting circuit to allow greater acuity in color vision. The researchers concluded that integrating the stimulus from the new photopigment as an adult was not analogous to vision loss following visual deprivation. It is yet unknown how the animals that gain a new photopigment are perceiving the new color. While the article by Mancuso et al. states that the monkey has indeed gained trichromacy and gained the ability to discriminate between red and green, they claim no knowledge of how the animal internally perceives the sensation. While red/green color blindness among deuteranopes can be treated by introducing M-opsin genes, rarer forms of color blindness such as tritanopia can in principle be treated as well. For tritanopia, the S-opsin gene must be introduced instead of M-opsin gene. Challenges Despite the success in animals, there still remain challenges to conducting gene therapy on humans for treating color blindness. =Safety= How to deliver the viral vector into the retina is probably the main obstacle to making gene therapy a practical treatment for color blindness. Because the virus has to be injected directly by using a needle to penetrate the sclera of the eye, the treatment may be highly unpleasant and is a risk for eye infection. Without a way to deliver the virus noninvasively, the treatment is rather risky for the benefit gained. It is not known yet how frequently the gene needs to be injected to maintain trichromacy among congenitally colorblind individuals. At the time of publication, Mancuso et al. reports that the treated squirrel monkeys have maintained 2 years of color vision after the treatment. If repeat injections are needed, there is also the concern of the body developing an immune reaction to the virus. If a body develops sensitivity to the viral vector, the success of the therapy could be jeopardized and/or the body may respond unfavorably. An editorial by J. Bennett points to Mancuso et al.'s use of an \\"unspecified postinjection corticosteroid therapy\\". Bennett suggests that the monkeys may have experienced inflammation due to the injection. However, the AAV virus that is commonly used for this study is non-pathogenic, and the body is less likely to develop an immune reaction. Needless to say, an extensive review of the safety of the treatment must precede any human trials. The subject should first be evaluated to identify which photopigment they need to gain trichromacy. Also, while gene therapy may treat congenital color blindness (such as dichromacy), it is not intended to treat non-retinal forms of color blindness such as damage to the visual cortex of the brain. =Ethics= As a way to introduce new genetic information to change a person‚Äôs phenotype, a gene therapy for color blindness is open to the same ethical questions and criticisms as gene therapy in general. These include issues around the governance of the therapy, whether treatment should be available only to those who can afford it, and whether the availability of treatment creates a stigma for those with color blindness. Given the large number of people with color blindness, there is also the question of whether color blindness is a disorder. Furthermore, even if gene therapy succeeds in converting incomplete colorblind individuals to trichromats, the degree of satisfaction among the subjects is unknown. It is uncertain how the quality of life will improve (or worsen) after the therapy.

As a composer he wrote works mainly for television and the radio, working frequently for the Canadian Broadcasting Company for over three decades. As a pianist he performed in a number of jazz and dance bands in Toronto and played for radio productions at the CBC. For many years he was active as a concert cimbalon player, appearing as a soloist with symphony orchestras in both Canada and the United States. Early life and education Born in Stare Karasnow, Czechoslovakia, Toth was the son of violinist and cimbalom maker Carl Toth and the elder brother of musicians Jerry Toth and Tony Toth. He was the only child in the family not born in Canada as the family emigrated to Windsor, Ontario shortly after his birth. As a child he studied the cimbalom with his father. He studied at The Royal Conservatory of Music (RCM) during the 1940s where his instructors included Boris Berlin (piano), John Weinzweig (harmony), and Ettore Mazzoleni (conducting). He pursued further studies in conducting with Walter Susskind in Toronto and at the Tanglewood Music Center with Leonard Bernstein. In 1950 he went to Paris to study the Piano with Gaby Casadesus. Career Toth began his performance career playing in dance bands in Toronto while studying at the RCM in the early 1940s. He played in bands led by Stan Patton, Ellis McLintock, and Bert Niosi among others. In the late 1940s he began working as a pianist for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, collaborating frequently on radio programs featuring Howard Cable. He soon was employed by CBC Television as a music director for television programs starring Joan Fairfax, Wally Koster, and Denny Vaughan among others. During the late 1950s he played the piano in Phil Nimmons' jazz band \\"Nimmons 'N' Nine\\". He also actively performed as a cimbalom player up until his retirement in 1989, notably appearing as a soloist in works by Bart√≥k, Kod√°ly, and Stravinsky with orchestras like the Buffalo Philharmonic Orchestra, the Ivan Romanoff Orchestra, the Ottawa Symphony Orchestra, and the Toronto Symphony Orchestra. Toth ceased working as a music director at the CBC in 1965, after which he concentrated his efforts on composing jingles and theme music for radio and television. He worked frequently on jingles and theme music with his brother Jerry and with composers Dolores Claman and Richard Morris between 1965‚Äì1970; with the group operating together as Quartet Productions. He and Jerry then formed their own company, Seven-O Productions, with whom he was active composing music for radio and television from 1970-1980. The brother's notably orchestrated the music (with Rudy conducting) for the Emmy Award nominated CBS production of Once Upon the Brothers Grimm. They also collaborated on several CBC TV specials during the 1970s. Toth died in Lisle, Ontario in 2009 at the age of 83. His wife was the violinist and lyricist Josephine Toth (n√©e Chuchman).

She is the founder and Director of Opera Lesvos which she established in 2000. Karvelas as Sappho Biography Karvelas was born and raised in Baltimore, Maryland, USA. She studied voice under Antony Kalaitzakis, a tenor who was a student of the vecchia scuola tenor Nino Piccaluga (who was a contemporary of Giovanni Martinelli and who was often chosen by Toscanini to open the season of La Scala). She has studied with Conrad Osborne in New York and with the renowned dramatic mezzo-soprano, Edna Garabedian, with whom Karvelas has served as assistant of her Artist Agency in Bonn, Germany. She has also studied repertory and performed with the late William Yannuzzi, Music Director of the Baltimore Opera Company. While teaching at the National Conservatory of Athens whose Directrix was Krino Kalomiris, daughter of Manolis Kalomiris, the head of the National School of Composers of Greece, she was chosen to record her interpretation of the role of the mother in Kalomiris's opera, The Mother's Ring. This recording bears the distinction of being the first Greek Opera ever recorded in a digital format. It was recorded in 1983 with the Sofia Philharmonic and the voices of the Obretenov Chorus in Sofia, Bulgaria. Since then Karvelas has come to be known as the ambassador of Greek classical music, always performing along with her theatre engagements concerts which present a wealth of compositions of Greek composers, beginning with the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C., Lincoln Center in New York City as well as in Germany, Austria, Poland, Bulgaria and the Ukraine and the Crimea. In 2009 she starred in \\"A Celebration of Greek Music\\" presented at Sanders Theatre at Harvard University. She specializes in the dramatic roles of Verdi, such as Lady Macbeth, which she has recorded in Poland with the Polish National Radio Orchestra, with Maestro William Yannuzzi conducting, the roles of Abigaille (Nabucco), Elisabetta (Don Carlos), Leonora (Trovatore and Forza del destino), Puccini's Turandot and Tosca, and the Wagnerian heroines. Considered by her colleagues a Master Trainer, she has been invited by many institutions to hold master classes on vocal technique and interpretation of standard operatic repertory and to perform rarely performed song cycles such as Berlioz's \\"Nuits d'Ete,\\" Wagner's \\"Wesendonck Lieder,\\" Richard Strauss's \\"Vier letzte Lieder,\\" Kalomiris's \\"Magic Herbs,\\" etc. Karvelas, who resides on the island of Lesvos, Greece, is the Director of \\"Opera Lesvos\\" which she established in 2000, a truly pioneering venture for a Greek province. In her research into the history of opera, she unearthed a long forgotten libretto used by Verdi as an alternative libretto to \\"Giovanna d'Arco\\", an opera he wrote in 1845 but which he could not present before the Pope in Rome. Verdi and his librettist, Solera, substituted the true story of a Lesbiot heroine who donned male armor and saved the castle of Lesvos from the Ottoman invaders in 1450. The name of the opera was \\"Orietta di Lesbo.\\" This libretto had not been used since 1850. Thus on March 12, 2006, the World Premier Revival of this work in its entirety took place in Portland, Oregon, with the Oregon Symphony and Chorus of Lewis and Clark College (who funded the project), with Karvelas in the lead role of Orietta. Later that summer, the European Premier took place on the island of Lesvos, as part of the \\"Aegean Verdi Festival\\" with an international orchestra of instrumentalists from all over the world (Karvelas as Orietta and \\"Opera Lesvos\\" soloists participating with the international cast). To her educational and performing institute, she invites professional artists from all over the world to perform along with the local talent which she prepares and trains. Karvelas has again combined forces with Garabedian who is Director of the California Opera Association in Fresno, California, serving as Artistic Advisor and Historian, giving master classes and lectures on the history of opera and great opera singers of the past and present. In 2010, they were planning performances of Stravinsky's \\"Oedipus Rex\\" with Karvelas as Jocasta. Karvelas has been \\"Artist in Residence\\" of the University of Indianapolis - Athens Campus, since 2005, always serving her art as educator and performer.  Discography and recordings  *E.R.T.

Its ruins are located 300 meters to the northwest of the modern village Roksolany, in the Ovidiopol district of the Odessa Oblast, Ukraine. History Niconium was founded in the second half of the 6th century BCE by colonists from Miletus. On the opposite bank of the river other Milesian colonists had already founded Tyras. The city was founded at a time when many nomadic tribes were beginning to settle in the areas north of the Black Sea. The Greeks settled in this area because of the plentiful fishing and the opportunity to trade with these barbarian settlers. Stone construction in the city began in the 5th century. At the turn of the 3rd-2nd centuries BCE, the city was destroyed, an event which was associated with the Macedonian commander Zopyrion, associate of Alexander the Great. In the 1st century BCE, the size of the city increased from the previous period. Niconium was abandoned permanently in the middle of the third century CE when the area was invaded by the Goths during the Great Migrations. Archaeological excavations The city was located on a plateau which now descends steeply into the Dniestr estuary, which has submerged the lower terrace of the city. The size of the city is estimated to be . According to the findings of excavations in the area, it appears that in the 5th-4th centuries BC, the money in Niconium mostly consisted of Istrain coins. It is also possible that Niconium itself minted coins, because some of the coins discovered during excavation are unique in appearance and bear the name of the Scythian king Scyles, who had established a protectorate over Niconium and other settlements in the area and may have been buried in the city.

TV Everywhere (also known as authenticated streaming or authenticated video on-demand) refers to a business model wherein access to streaming video content from a television channel requires users to \\"authenticate\\" themselves as current subscribers to the channel, via an account provided by their participating pay television provider, in order to access the content. Under the model, broadcasters offer their customers the ability to access content from their channels through internet-based services and mobile apps‚Äîeither live or on-demand, as part of their subscription to the service. Time Warner Cable first proposed the concept in 2009; in 2010, many television providers and networks began to roll out TV Everywhere services for their subscribers, including major networks such as TBS and TNT (whose owner, Time Warner, was an early supporter of the concept), ESPN, and HBO among others. Broadcast television networks have also adopted TV Everywhere restrictions for their online content, albeit in a less broadscale adoption than their cable counterparts. Television providers and broadcasters have touted the advantages of being able to access content across multiple platforms, including on the internet, and on mobile devices (such as smartphones and tablets), as part of their existing television subscription. Upon its establishment, the TV Everywhere concept received criticism for being difficult for end-users to set up, while media activists have criticized the concept for being a paywall that extends the existing oligarchy of the subscription television industry to the internet, and considering it to be collusion against cord cutters‚Äîthose who drop cable and satellite entirely in favor of accessing content via terrestrial television, the internet, and subscription video on demand (SVOD) services.  Rationale  TV Everywhere services were developed in an attempt to compete with the market trend of cord cutting, where consumers drop traditional pay television subscriptions in favor of accessing TV content exclusively through over-the-air television and/or online on-demand services, including Hulu, Netflix, YouTube, and other sources. Authenticated streaming and video on-demand services allow traditional television providers to directly compete with these competitors, and add value to existing television subscriptions in an effort to retain subscribers. In particular, broadcasters and providers have emphasized the use of TV Everywhere services to allow multi-platform access to their content, on devices such as personal computers, smartphones, tablets, digital media players, and video game consoles.  History  = Precursors = ESPN first introduced a TV Everywhere-like concept with ESPN360, a service which allowed users to stream sports programming from its networks either live or on-demand through a website. However, access to ESPN360 was restricted to the users of internet service providers who had negotiated deals with ESPN to offer the service; a model closer in nature to cable television carriage. Similar tactics were soon used by several other channels, such as NFL Network (who used the technique to restrict access to its Game Extra service for Thursday Night Football) and Epix (an early pioneer of the concept for the premium cable industry). David Preschlack, ESPN's executive vice president for affiliate sales and marketing, foresaw a future in the model, believing that access to exclusive content would soon play a greater role in competition between high-speed internet providers. However, the model was deemed a violation of the principles of net neutrality by some critics. = Introduction and adoption = In 2009, Time Warner Cable announced an initiative known as TV Everywhere, a set of principles which were \\"designed to serve as a framework to facilitate deployment of online television content in a way that is consumer friendly, pro-competitive.\\" The concept would enable users of their respective cable television services to access live and on- demand online content from channels that they subscribe to by using an account-based authentication system. TWC CEO Jeffrey Bewkes believed that the TV Everywhere principles were \\"good concepts\\" that are \\"likely to be the general direction for all TV networks and all the distribution connections that are out there.\\" That summer, both TWC and Comcast began trials of services based on the system; Turner Broadcasting was an early supporter of the system, providing access to TBS and TNT content as part of the trials. Comcast officially launched a public beta of its TV Everywhere-based portal, Xfinity Fancast, in December 2009 for all double-play television and internet customers. Afterwards, other providers began to follow suit. In 2010, broadcasters and television providers began a wider roll-out of TV Everywhere- based services; for the 2010 Winter Olympics, NBC Sports offered live and video on-demand access to events throughout the Games that required users to authenticate for access. Also in February, HBO launched HBO Go, a video on demand service exclusive to HBO subscribers on participating providers. In September 2010, Disney would begin launching an array of TV Everywhere-based services, including WatchESPN (a successor to ESPN360 offered to ESPN television subscribers), and similar apps for Disney Channel and Disney XD. In August 2011, Fox became the first over-the-air network to restrict on-demand access with a TV Everywhere-based system; \\"next day\\" on-demand episodes (either through its website or Hulu, itself a joint venture between Fox, NBC, and ABC at the time) would only be available online to users authenticating themselves as a subscriber to a cable or satellite provider, or those who subscribe to the Hulu Plus service. All other users would be subject to an eight-day delay. On September 1, 2011, fellow Fox property Big Ten Network (a college sports network dedicated to the Big Ten Conference, operated in partnership with Fox Sports) also launched a TV Everywhere service known as BTN2Go. = Expansion = Matt Strauss, Comcast senior vice president of digital and emerging platforms, considered the 2012 Summer Olympics to be a \\"watershed\\" event for TV Everywhere services; NBCUniversal announced that a total of nearly 10 million authenticated devices accessed its online coverage during the Games across both the NBCOlympics.com site and NBC Olympics Live Extra app; in particular, parent company Comcast accounted for 3.3 million devices from 1.5 million users. Following the Games, the service was rebranded as NBC Sports Live Extra to serve as a general streaming app for the NBC Sports division. TV Everywhere services also began to appear in Canada in the early 2010s, with the Canadian launch of HBO Go in 2012, and the 2013 announcement of TV Everywhere services from Bell Media (beginning with Bravo Go, and also including CTV Go) and Shaw Media (beginning with Global). The majority of Canadian broadcasters are vertically integrated; both Bell and Shaw operate internet service providers and national satellite television services. In May 2013, ABC released its Watch ABC mobile app, which allows viewers on participating providers to access live streams from participating ABC affiliates. In December 2013, ABC confirmed that it would impose a similar restriction to Fox for \\"next day\\" on-demand episodes beginning on January 6, 2014, with seven-day exclusivity for authenticated users and Hulu Plus subscribers. NBC unveiled its own plans for a similar TV Everywhere app to its affiliate board in April 2014. In November 2015, after negotiations surrounding revenue sharing and infrastructural mandates (including a proposed requirement that the games only be available through the league's existing apps), Major League Baseball reached a three-year deal with Fox to allow it to offer in-market online streaming on Fox Sports Go (though streamed using MLB Advanced Media infrastructure) for the 16 teams that it holds regional rights to through the Fox Sports Networks division. In December 2015, Discovery Communications, a long hold-out on the concept, launched Discovery Go, a centralized TV Everywhere service and mobile app for Discovery Channel, TLC, and its array of sister networks.  Reception  The TV Everywhere concept has been met with mixed reception. Some broadcasters were initially hesitant to introduce TV Everywhere services, with concerns that they might affect advertising revenue and not be adequately counted by Nielsen ratings. Songwriters Guild of America president Rick Carnes praised the TV Everywhere concept and other recent developments for helping to provide easier, legal access to premium content online. Media activists have criticized the concept as protecting the existing closed, regionalized oligarchy of multichannel television by tying digital content to traditional television subscriptions, thus harming fully over-the-top competitors. Public Knowledge believed that \\"under the 'TV Everywhere' plan, no other program distributors would be able to emerge, and no consumers will be able to 'cut the cord' because they find what they want online. As a result, consumers will be the losers.\\" A 2010 report by Free Press made similar arguments, contending that TV Everywhere was an act of collusion by the cable industry, and arguing that \\"by tying programming to local cable subscriptions, while denying content to pure online TV distributors, the incumbent industry hopes to artificially reproduce the lack of competition for TV distribution to which it is accustomed, based on geographical fiefdoms and turf.\\" The NCTA denied many of Free Press' arguments, stating that it was \\"an effort to ensure more content than ever is distributed over the Internet at no extra charge to consumers.\\" In July 2014, BTIG analyst Richard Greenfield criticized the video on demand services offered through TV Everywhere systems for being ad-supported. In examples from FX and TNT, he noticed that ads often repeated, and that in TNT's case, its version of an episode of The Last Ship included 20 minutes of unskippable ads across 45 minutes of programming. In conclusion, he contended that viewers would rather wait for programs to appear on subscription streaming services rather than use TV Everywhere services. = Viewer awareness = Despite efforts by broadcasters to educate viewers on TV Everywhere services and how to utilize them (including Fox, which produced a promotional video starring Jane Lynch as her Glee character Sue Sylvester, describing the process as being less painful than waterboarding), critics and end-users criticized the registration and authentication processes for being frustrating and difficult. In response, providers took steps to improve their user experiences; Disney reported that use of its TV Everywhere services increased after it simply changed its process to use the term \\"verify\\" instead of \\"authenticate\\", Comcast and Cablevision introduced systems that automatically verify users with their residential gateways, and Synacor (a provider of authentication platforms used by providers) added the ability for users to link their provider account to a social network login, such as Facebook or Twitter. For the 2012 Summer Olympics and 2014 Winter Olympics, NBC worked closer with providers to help educate users, and produced customized marketing materials and video tutorials featuring Carson Daly (2012) and Ryan Seacrest (2014) to help inform users. As an incentive, NBC also allowed authenticated users to enter a sweepstakes to win a trip to London (2012) or Rio de Janeiro (2014). Still, with dissatisfaction with the system and the quality of NBC's overall coverage, there was an increase in the use of virtual private network (VPN) services to access the more comprehensive online coverage of the Games being provided by broadcasters in Canada (CTV in London, CBC in Sochi) and the United Kingdom (BBC), which only used geoblocking and did not require TV Everywhere authentication. In April 2014, the Cable & Telecommunications Association for Marketing (CTAM) unveiled an industry-wide initiative for marketing and educating subscribers about TV Everywhere services provided by broadcasters and providers; these efforts include a stylized \\"tv everywhere\\" logo which the organization intends providers to use as a unified brand to denote TV Everywhere services. The logo consists of interlocking rectangles, representing multiple \\"screens\\" (platforms) for viewing content. The association also provided design recommendations for TV Everywhere user experiences, aiming to alleviate the confusion that had been experienced by users during the authentication process. = Adoption = In a December 2013 survey of 4,205 pay television subscribers, NPD Group found that 21% of them used a TV Everywhere service at least once per month, and that 90% of them were satisfied with the experience. NPD analyst Russ Crupnick felt that \\"aggressive\\" use of the model was helping to counter cord cutting, which \\"speaks to the level of engagement they have with programming and a comfort in using the Internet to both access and interact with that programming.\\" The study also found that 3 out of 10 pay television subscribers who were also subscribed to an SVOD service used TV Everywhere services at least once a week (in comparison to 2 out of 10 for those who were not). Amid criticism of NBC's coverage, adoption of NBC's TV Everywhere services during the 2014 Winter Olympics was still significantly large: on February 21, 2014, coverage of the Men's hockey semi-final featuring the U.S. and Canada recorded the largest Live Extra audience in NBC Sports history, with 2.12 million unique viewers, augmenting the average NBCSN television audience of 3.9 million. ESPN's coverage of the 2014 FIFA World Cup drew similarly heavy online viewership: during a group stage match between the U.S. and Portugal, at least 1.7 million concurrent viewers were using WatchESPN (though, not all of the viewers were necessarily watching the game). In December 2015, research firm GfK estimated that 53% of the United States' pay television subscribers have used a TV Everywhere service‚Äîan increase from 42% in 2012, that overall use had doubled since 2012, and 79% of those surveyed found the login process easy. However, only 25% of those surveyed were aware of the term \\"TV Everywhere\\" or the CTAM logo, leading to the firm believing that consumer awareness and education was still a \\"critical missing piece\\" in the adoption of these services. = Platform non-neutrality = In 2014, Comcast was criticized for its decision to arbitrarily block access to HBO Go on PlayStation and Roku devices, but still allowing its use on competing Apple TV and Xbox 360. Comcast similarly blocked access to Showtime Anytime on Roku as well. A spokesperson for the provider stated that \\"with every new website, device or player we authenticate, we need to work through technical integration and customer service which takes time and resources. Moving forward, we will continue to prioritize as we partner with various players.\\" During both the FCC's net neutrality hearings and comments regarding Comcast's then-proposed merger with Time Warner Cable (which, by contrast, allows HBO Go access on all supported devices), Roku criticized the provider for contradicting the TV Everywhere concept by discriminating against specific devices, thus prioritizing its own on-demand platform over external services. The company argued that providers could selectively favor certain platforms over others, further stating that \\"a large and powerful MVPD may use this leverage in negotiations with content providers or operators of streaming platforms, ultimately favoring parties that can either afford to pay for the privilege of authentication, or have other business leverage that can be used as a counterweight to discriminatory authentication.\\" On December 15, 2014, Comcast enabled the ability to use HBO Go and Showtime Anytime on Roku devices. However, Comcast still blocked HBO Go on PlayStation consoles until December 2016. = Password sharing = There have been instances of users deliberately sharing their TV Everywhere login credentials, or having them sold without their owner's knowledge on the black market, in order to allow others to view programs without subscribing to the channel. Charter Communications CEO Tom Rutledge, and ESPN's executive vice president for affiliate sales and marketing Justin Connolly, have considered this practice equivalent to piracy. In December 2017, it was reported that television providers and program distributors had begun to implement measures in order to discourage this practice, including reducing the length of login session, reducing the number of concurrent streams allowed on a single account, and monitoring unusual usage patterns such as large numbers of concurrent streams on a single account‚Äîespecially those originating from outside of the customer's region, or during major programs. In August 2019, as part of its latest carriage agreement, it was announced that Charter and Disney would \\"work together to implement business rules and techniques to address such issues as unauthorized access and password sharing.\\" By contrast, HBO's then-CEO Richard Plepler argued in an interview that intentional password sharing did not impact their business, and was a \\"marketing vehicle\\" that could help attract new subscribers, while Netflix CEO Reed Hastings similarly argued that \\"household sharing leads to new customers because kids subscribe on their own as they start to earn income\\".

On a mission to save the world by killing a legislator named Stone before it's too late, Penelope is accompanied on her quest by her pet bird Ruby, and orphan friend Kyle (played by Braunohler). The theme song is written and performed by comedian/musician Reggie Watts. Originally a web series of 3- to 5-minute webisodes edited by Dan Mcnamara for comedy website Super Deluxe, Penelope premiered online in March 2007, with nine webisodes released before the site was shut down in December 2008. It was picked up soon after to be adapted into a television show for United Kingdom broadcaster Channel 4. Produced by Avalon Television and billed as a \\"one-off special\\", the half-hour television format backdoor pilot was first broadcast on Comedy Lab on 21 April 2010. Although including various elements and bits from the original web series, the television show has a number of key differences, including altered character back-stories. Whereas the web series title sequence states that Penelope has 3759 hours to save the world, the title sequence for the television show states that Penelope has 3769 hours. The television show features a legislator named Stone like in the web series, but since the TV show is set in the UK rather than the United States, Stone is a Member of Parliament (MP) rather than a senator. While Senator Stone is played by Ali Reza Farahnakian in the web series, in the television show MP Thomas Stone is played by Julian Barratt of The Mighty Boosh. The henchmen played by twin comedians Todd and Adam Stone in the web series are replaced by MP Stone's adopted sons, played by twin actors Sam and Matt Kennard. These secondary characters play a more prominent role in the television series, with MP Stone given main billing in the title sequence.

Milwaukee Sentinel - Google News Archive - Feb 11, 1911 In July 1914, Dunn went to Chicago, Illinois to interest civic and legislative organizations in his new color- coded coupon ballot. Dunn asserted that the ballot would put an end to all electoral fraud; that it was simple enough for any voter; that it would enable clerks and judges to count ballots four times as quickly as under the present Australian ballot system; that it would not entail the expense of the voting machine, and that voters would not be hurried as they were with the voting machines.Wisconsin Man Has New Form of Ballot. Chicago Tribune. Aug 1, 1914 Use of the Dunn Ballot Moncena Dunn and Lois Woodward Dunn ca 1890 Dunn Ballot, Wisconsin, ca 1912 Under Dunn's system there was a colored card of coupons for each party. Every voter was given two envelopes with his ballot. In one he placed the coupons of the candidates he voted for. In the other he placed the remaining coupons. If a voter desired to vote a straight ticket he tore off the full page which contained the names of all the candidates of his party. When he split his ticket he tore out the coupons on which were the names of the candidates he wished to vote for. The coupons of each party were of a different color. \\"Only one ballot is to be counted at a time,\\" Dunn told the Chicago Tribune. \\"When the judge takes the envelopes out of the ballot box he numbers them. There is a pocket in the discard envelope to contain the smaller envelope which holds the voted coupons. The Judge takes the coupons out and reads the vote by the color and number of office, each office being numbered on the ballot. A person standing twenty feet away can tell if he reads the vote correctly. After the vote is read, the judge puts the envelopes together again. Then if any controversy over the result arises there are two records of the ballot. There are the names the voter voted for and the names to be discarded. There is never any question as to what the voter meant, as there so frequently is with the present ballot in general use. There is absolutely no chance for short pencil work. If there are any errors, they are easily caught. We consider, in counting, only the names voted for. With the present ballot we consider all the candidates of every party.

He is a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada, the Canadian Psychological Association, the American Academy of Optometry, and the Royal Danish Academy of Sciences and Letters. Maurice Ptito is a specialist in the study of Development and Plasticity of the visual system in various species including Man. The major goal of his research is the understanding of the mechanisms involved in Visual Plasticity in normal developing individuals, as well as those who were born without vision or lost their vision later in life. His laboratory has been using a wide variety of techniques including anatomy (diffusion tensor imaging, voxel- based morphometry), physiology (visually evoked potentials), positron emission tomography (PET), functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and psychophysics to study human blindness. With colleague, Dr Ron Kupers (University of Copenhagen), he used a sensory substitution device coined the Tongue Display Unit (TDU) that converts visual images into electrotactile pulses applied to the tongue via a grid made out of tiny electrodes. He demonstrated the presence of cross-modal plastic processes that enable the blind to \\"see\\" using the tongue as a portal to the visual cortex. This approach holds great promise for the blind in improving their quality of life, helping them to navigate freely in their environment.

Early years John \\"Jock\\" Woodhouse was born in Kensington, London, on 29 September 1922, the only son of Brigadier Charles Woodhouse, a former Colonel of the Dorset Regiment. He received his education at Malvern College and commissioned into the Dorset Regiment in 1942. Military career =Second World War= Although he was not a member of the SAS during the Second World War, Woodhouse fought as a British soldier in Tunisia, Sicily, and Italy. While commanding with 1st Battalion, East Surrey Regiment, he led an attack on buildings occupied by tank crews which turned out to be the headquarters of the 16th Panzer Division. For this he received his Military Cross. He applied a policy of shoot-and-scoot while in command of a special patrol unit in Italy. In March 1944, a patrol he was commanding was ambushed near Cassino and he was taken prisoner. He became a Russian interpreter with the Allied Control Commission in Germany during the period 1947‚Äì49. =SAS years= Woodhouse joined the SAS in 1950. The initial results for the SAS, which was founded in 1941 and active during the Second World War and in the Malayan Emergency of 1948, were not as successful as had been hoped. After a period of active service, Woodhouse was chosen to return to the United Kingdom to establish a selection process for the SAS. The rigorous systems he developed over three years provided the basis of selection and training of the modern SAS. He returned to Malaya as a squadron commander in 1955. He was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire in 1957 for his services in command of D Squadron 22nd SAS Regiment in Malaya. In 1958, he transferred from the Dorset Regiment to the Parachute Regiment and commanded a company in the 3rd battalion before being appointed second-in-command of 22 SAS in 1960. In 1962, he was chosen to command the regiment. Following the Brunei Revolt, it went to Malaysia in 1963 to address the Indonesian threat. Recalling the approach in Malaya, SAS teams organised jungle tribes to gather intelligence. In January 1964, Woodhouse launched one of his squadrons on Operation Claret with a mission to locate camps from which Indonesian incursions were launched, and to identify their routes into Sarawak. He convinced his SAS troopers that intelligence was of more long-term value than to inflict limited casualties. When Commonwealth forces brought the Indonesian incursions to an end in 1965, 22 SAS was withdrawn. Brewing and later life Upon retirement, Woodhouse joined the family business, Hall & Woodhouse Brewery, Blandford St Mary, Dorset, where from scratch, he created the successful children's soft drink brand, Panda Pops, becoming the managing director of this division. He was involved in local forestry management and, from 1976 to 1984, he served as chairman of the SAS Association.

Historical A Mirage IIIRS in front of an aircraft cavern in Buochs airfield, Switzerland During World War II, the neutral Swiss military airfields were for the first time equipped with simple arched concrete U-43 type shelters to protect the aircraft parked underneath. After World War II, starting in 1947, these open objects became even better protected with steel doors, thus creating the U-68 type shelter. Shortly after World War II and the beginning of the Cold War with the possible escalation between the nuclear superpowers of the Eastern and Western blocks, the Swiss Air Force began to develop concepts for defending their neutrality in the case of a conflict. In the 1940s, the Swiss army had already built so-called retablierstollen (re-equipping caves) at some airfields. These retablierstollen consisted of 100m long straight tunnels excavated in the rock, making it possible to store and eventually re-arm small Swiss fighter aircraft such as the then used Messerschmitt Bf 109 and the Morane-Saulnier M.S.406. The dimensions of these tunnels are comparable to an autobahn tunnel. The airfields chosen were Alpnach, Buochs, Meiringen, St.Stephan and Saanen, all located in the Alps with a lot of cover in the vicinity of the runway so that the aircraft could be out of sight within minutes after touchdown. In the early 1950s, the first large-scale excavations in rock took place, creating more space in the existing caves. The expanded space created by these excavations was now used to service the aircraft and to execute some minor repairs. The first large-scale constructions inside the caves were at the airfields of Ambri, Alpnach, Buochs, Meiringen, Raron and Turtmann, starting operations from 1951‚Äì1954. As the Swiss air force modernized and changed its aircraft during the 1960s, the excavations, now called cavernes, were further modernized and extended. Underground command and communication posts were constructed together with ammunition and fuel storage facilities, generator and technical rooms to keep the facility running, as well as personnel quarters. The cavernes have been used to shelter and service the following aircraft types: * de Havilland DH 100 Vampire * de Havilland DH 112 Venom * Hawker Hunter F Mk 58 * Dassault Mirage IIIS / RS * Northrop F-5E Tiger II * McDonnell Douglas F/A-18C Hornet BAe Hawk aircraft and Alouette III helicopters have only temporarily been stored in cavernes after being withdrawn from service and then sold to third parties. Design and construction A Swiss cavern has space to hold 22 F-5 Tiger aircraft. The outside door usually consists of composite material, steel with a wooden core. The door is defended by personnel in a hardened bunker covering it with machineguns, making the outside door small arms and hand grenade proof. Past the door is an S-shaped tunnel making it nearly impossible to fire on the main blast doors. The blast doors are made of concrete reinforced steel and as long as they are closed, the aircraft parking area remains fully CBRN protected. There are two or more tunnels. The first tunnel provides space for eleven aircraft and is equipped to handle major overhauls such as engine replacements. The aircraft are moved by lifting them by cranes. Once they are on the crane, they can be moved through the whole length of the tunnel. There is a linking tunnel to the weapon storage area (WSA) which is extra protected by a sealed door. In case of fire the weapon storage may be filled with inert Halon gas to prevent fire and explosions. The WSA not only holds the munitions needed to re-arm the aircraft (missiles and cannon shells) but also the small arms ammunition for all military working in the caverne. On the opposite side of the WSA is the command facility holding the workshops to service all aircraft systems, the communications cell, briefing room, kitchen, food & water storage, mess, personnel quarters and no-break generators to maintain electrical power under all circumstances. The command facility is also protected by hermetically sealed doors when working under CBRN conditions. Next to the command tunnel is another tunnel with the same dimensions as the first one. This one is also capable of holding eleven aircraft. Fuel storage is located behind all tunnels allowing the cavern to sustain 22 aircraft for about 10 days without re-supplying of electricity, fuel, ammunition etc. from the outside world. Meiringen Air Base viewed from the Rothorn Operational use The Swiss air force operates from Alpnach Air Base, D√ºbendorf Air Base, Milit√§rflugplatz Emmen, Meiringen air base, Locarno Airport, Payerne Air Base and Sion Airport. Meiringen is the only airfield with fully operational cavernes. The caverne at Meiringen was extended and refurbished for about 120 million Swiss Francs to comply to the needs of the current Swiss airforce F/A-18 fighters. Because of the weight of these aircraft hanging them in overhead cranes would be enormously expensive so that was not considered a viable option. Instead an extra tunnel had to be built. The tunnels are connected by some linking tunnels and extra dispersals were added on the opposite walls of each tunnel making it possible to operate 22 F/A-18s. The aircraft are able to roll in and out at the same time without the need of moving parked aircraft. A linking tunnel constructed directly before the main blast doors makes it possible to refuel and rearm an aircraft immediately after its mission without opening the main blast doors. A very important issue when a unit is working under CBRN conditions. The Meiringen caverne ammo storage has an extra tunnel to the outside. The former cavernes at Alpnach, Ambri, Raron and Turtmann have been deactivated and closed. The caverne at Buochs Airport has been mothballed but it is estimated that the facility could be reactivated to operate F-5's within two months. Origin Originally, the plan for the aircraft cavern started its life as a design for \\"cavern airfields\\". High costs and technical difficulties prevented these from realisation. The idea of using roads as runways was later part of the design demands for the Swiss motorway network.

Suspecting the photographs to have been made publicly available by a former boyfriend, he acknowledged the content of the pictures as being \\"private, personal (but entirely legal)\\"; the pictures were taken years earlier in San Francisco. Editor Martin Townsend told him in late November that ‚Äúserious allegation had been made\\" against him and, with the HR manager at a subsequent meeting, said the photographs had the potential to bring the Express into disrepute. Shenton described the decision to let him go as having \\"a certain irony\\" because the paper's owner Richard Desmond was a publisher of pornographic magazines during the period when the pictures were taken. In a statement read out to an employment tribunal in August 2014, Shenton said his copy was sometimes dictated or changed without his consent, and fulfilling regular requests for free tickets potentially put at risk his professional relationship with theatre production's PRs. The Sunday Express disputed Shenton's account. In mid-October 2014, Shenton lost his claim for unfair dismissal, as he was a freelance paid a retainer, and thus \\"was not an employee within the meaning of the Employment Rights Act\\" meaning the tribunal had \\"no jurisdiction to hear the claim for unfair dismissal\\". The tribunal also ruled that Express Newspapers had not discriminated against him based on his sexual orientation and that Northern & Shell's \\"interests in the pornography industry\\" were irrelevant to the case. However, the company had \\"conducted an unfair process in terminating that contract, in that they withheld information from [Shenton] and they also gave inconsistent accounts of the reason for termination\\".

The writer is Peter Milligan, with art by James Romberger. The Bronx Kill is illustrated in grey-scale. It is done in the fashion of the \\"film noir\\"/detective-crime style. Plot synopsis The story centers around main character, Martin Keane. His father is a New York City cop, as well as his grandfather and his great-grandfather, after whom, Martin is named. Martin‚Äôs grandfather was mysteriously killed while alone in a dock area called ‚ÄúBronx Kill‚Äù. The murder has haunted Martin‚Äôs family for years. Martin is also plagued by his grandmother‚Äôs disappearance. Despite Martin‚Äôs father pushing him to be a cop, Martin becomes a writer; this is part of the reason Martin and his father have such a strained relationship. Martin‚Äôs wife, Erin, disappears within the first quarter of the story- driving the rest of the plot. =Martin's novel= Within The Bronx Kill, Martin is writing a novel about an Irishman named Michael Furey, who moves to America once he has discovered that his family has been murdered, most likely by his brother, Hugh. Peter Milligan actually inserts excerpts of Martin‚Äôs mystery/crime novel within the graphic novel, with annotations as if Michael were still in the process of writing the novel. The events in the novel often happen to parallel Michael‚Äôs own life events, eerily enough. The novel excerpts appear on pages: 38-39, 47-48, 64-65, 86-89, 114-115, 154-155, and 177-179 of The Bronx Kill.

It was laid down in 1866 and launched in 1871. The Derzhava (Baltic Sea) and the Livadia (Black Sea) were the last wooden paddle steamers built for the Romanovs. The Derzhava served the Romanovs until 1898, when she was converted into a training ship and renamed Dvina. The Derzhava was laid down at the New Admiralty, Saint Petersburg by Alexander II of Russia. I. S. Dmitriev was appointed as master shipwright. The design of Derzhava was based on the British royal yacht HMY Victoria and Albert. She was launched five years later, in July 1871. Her two steam engines, of local design and make, were rated at 720 horsepowers, and enabled a maximum speed of 16.72 knots. The deck of the Derzhava had two raised penthouses: the Emperor's in the back and the General Admiral's in the fore. The interiors of the imperial suites, furniture and tableware were designed by Ippolit Monighetti. The contract for the figurehead was awarded to Mikhail Mikeshin. Originally, Mikeshin proposed installing a female allegory of Russia wielding armor and the orb, the ship's namesake, but in 1867 Alexander dismissed the proposal and instructed Mikeshin to shape the standard double-headed eagle. Mikeshin made it by July 1870, yet his sculpture was radically different from the ordinary omnipresent state eagles. The Derzhava had a crew of no less than 200 men. In 1888 she employed 238 men: 93 mechanics and stokers, 65 musicians, 15 choir singers, and others, not including the royal retinue of at least fifty. The Derzhava operated as a yacht until 1898. She was then converted into a training ship and re- christened Dvina. The Dvina was decommissioned in 1905. Shipbuilder's drawings, Russian Navy archive Notes References * Larionov, A. L.

Life She was the daughter of Augustus III of Poland, Elector of Saxony (as Frederick Augustus II), King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania (as Augustus II), and Maria Josepha of Austria, first cousin of Empress Maria Theresa. Maria Christina was born at the Wilan√≥w Palace in Poland. She came from a close family and her parents made sure they put emphasis on a good education. She was educated in Latin, French, Polish, philosophy, geography, religion, drawing, music and dance. Her older sister Maria Josepha married Louis, Dauphin of France in 1747. =Abbess= In 1764, Maria Christina was sent to France to become a Coadjutorice at the Abbey of Remiremont in Remiremont, northern France. Her position was thanks to the personal intervention of Louis XV himself. At the time of her arrival, the abbey was under control of Princess Anne Charlotte of Lorraine, sister of the Holy Roman Emperor and aunt of the future Marie Antoinette.Marie Antoinette would come to France in 1770 to wed the Duke of Berry, future Louis XVI In France, she was known as Marie Christine de Saxe. In 1773, at the death of Anne Charlotte, Maria Christina was named Abbess, a position she would keep until her death. Remiremont had seats and votes in the Reichstag including all rights and obligations of an Imperial Princess (such as low justice, tax, legislation, coinage and military service), and enjoyed immunity against temporal power. She was a frequent visitor to Paris and was fond of the Theatre and the city's social life. She spent a great deal of money, the payment of which was made by Stanis≈Çaw Leszczy≈Ñski (Duke of Lorraine until his death in 1766) and after that the king Louis XV. Her correspondence with her brother Francis Xavier, Regent of Saxony was preserved at Trojes. She was created a Dame of the Order of the Starry Cross. Maria Christina bought the Ch√¢teau de Brumath in the town of Brumath in the Alsace region of France. Purchased in 1775, she chose the building for its location in the country and for its natural setting. She lived a lavish lifestyle at the ch√¢teau which far outdid her revenues. Dying at the ch√¢teau on 19 November 1782, her nephew King Louis XVI was obliged to pay her debts in the amount of 136,876 livres for his dead aunt. She was buried at the abbey in its √©glise des Dames on the 15 December 1782. She was praised for her intelligence, her conversation and for being a cultivated woman for her age.

He is much regarded by the Asian fashion field as the Fashion Czar of Asia. He established the spotlight on Filipino fashion in the world artistic fashion scene during the 1960s until his retirement, paving the way for young Filipino fashion designers in Europe, the Middle East, the Americas, and other parts of Southeast Asia.http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/960604/pitoy-moreno-top-filipino- fashion-designer-dies Early life Moreno studied at the University of the Philippines with a bachelor's degree in fine arts. During his stay in the university, he joined the Upsilon Sigma Phi fraternity, where he managed to build a strong society network with Ferdinand Marcos, Benigno Aquino Jr. and Salvador ‚ÄúDoy‚Äù Laurel. He became close friends with Celia Diaz, who would later marry Doy Laurel, and the painter Araceli ‚ÄúCheloy‚Äù Dans, who he gave his first hand-crafted wedding gown. In an interview, Moreno stated that during his stay in the University of the Philippines, he developed ‚Äúa finer sense of the fashion world‚Äù. Career Moreno became the president of the Philippine Couture Association, the very first association of fashion designers in Manila, Philippines. He was the fashion designer for the Bayanihan Philippine Dance Company. His fashion designs were exhibited at the World‚Äôs Fair in Seattle, Washington and New York City. His fashion designs appeared on the pages of fashion magazines such as Vogue, Harper's Bazaar, Holiday, and Le Figaro, where Moreno introduced the words jusi, pi√±a and lepanto to world fashion, the first time Filipino fashion terminologies were incorporated in world fashion artistry.https://www.rappler.com/life-and- style/fashion/193715-fashion-designer-pitoy-moreno-dies Due to his popularity from the 1960s to 1980s, many heads of state, royalties, and prominent personalities from Asia, Europe, and the Americas became his clients for decades.

He was regarded as the Fashion Czar of Asia by French tabloid Le Figaro, sealing his status as fashion royalty.

In 2009, Moreno was declared as a National Artist for Fashion Design by President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo. However, this was met with protest by other National Artists, such as Bienvenido Lumbera (National Artist for Literature), who told media that the category of Fashion Design was not an accepted art form and was simply dressmaking, not art. The Supreme Court issued a temporary restraining order (TRO) on the conferment of the National Artist award to Moreno and six other recommendees. Later on, the National Artist title on Moreno and three other recommendees were revoked by the Supreme Court in 2013 after finding that former president Arroyo personally conferred the award to the four people, without undergoing to a traditional process made by the National Commission for Culture and the Arts. A few years later, it was clarified that fashion design is under the category of Design in the National Artists roster, making Moreno eligible to be conferred the award in the future through the traditional conferment process.https://www.rappler.com/nation/33871-court- national-artist-award-for-4-invalid  Death  Moreno died on January 15, 2018 at the Manila Doctors Hospital, where he had been confined for the past few years for debilitating ailments.

Although previously known as TABC-79 (transportorul blindat pentru cercetare), it is now known as the ABC-79M.ROMARM website  Summary  The ABC-79M is a simplified version of the earlier TAB-77 8x8 armored personal carrier, which was itself a Romanian version of the BTR-70. Both vehicles share several common components. The ABC-79M is fully amphibious, and is equipped with a single water-jet for propulsion. Other equipment includes infra-red night- vision equipment, winch with 50m of cable and capacity of 5,500 kilograms, and central tire pressure regulation. It is also equipped with an engine preheater, to allow the engine to start in severe cold. It is equipped for nuclear, chemical, and biological warfare and features a 14.5mm KPVT heavy machine gun with 500 rounds of ammunition as primary armament. This is supplemented by a lighter 7.62mm machine gun with 2000 rounds of ammunition on board. Both weapons are located in a small one-man turret which is identical to turret of the TAB 77 and the earlier TAB 71M Production is now complete, and the vehicle is no longer available for foreign or domestic sale.

It was written by co-producer Kay Cannon and series creator Tina Fey. The episode was directed by series producer Don Scardino. It originally aired on the National Broadcasting Company (NBC) network in the United States on April 22, 2010. Guest stars in this episode include Elizabeth Banks, Will Ferrell, Steve Hely, Julianne Moore, and Ariel Shafir. In the episode, Liz Lemon (Fey) starts making an effort to date by attending singles events with her friend Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski). At the same time, Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin) feels forced to choose between his high school sweetheart, Nancy Donovan (Moore), and news anchor Avery Jessup (Banks). Meanwhile, a racist comment sparks an office-wide debate on affirmative action and leaves James \\"Toofer\\" Spurlock (Keith Powell) with a big decision to make regarding his future at the fictitious show The Girlie Show with Tracy Jordan (TGS). \\"Lee Marvin vs. Derek Jeter\\" received generally positive reviews from television critics. According to the Nielsen ratings system, the episode was watched by 4.216 million households during its original broadcast, and received a 1.9 rating/6 share among viewers in the 18‚Äì49 demographic. Kay Cannon and Tina Fey were nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award nomination in the category for Outstanding Writing in a Comedy Series for their work in this episode. Plot On the weekend of Jack Donaghy's (Alec Baldwin) 51st birthday, his advances with CNBC host Avery Jessup (Elizabeth Banks) are called into question when he learns that his high school sweetheart, Nancy Donovan (Julianne Moore), has finally been divorced from her husband. Jack spends evenings having dinner and wine with both, against Liz Lemon's (Tina Fey) suggestion that it is a bad idea. He compares Nancy to actor Lee Marvin, after watching a movie marathon starring Marvin, and Avery to baseball player Derek Jeter, after he spends time with Avery at Jeter's home. He is moved by the thoughtful birthday gifts both women give him. Jack is torn between the easygoing, middle-class Nancy and his successful, wealthy counterpart Avery, and does not know whom to choose. Meanwhile, Liz attends singles activities at the YMCA and her friend, Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski), joins her as her wingman. Nancy accompanies Liz to one of the activities, and is concerned when Liz speaks critically of everyone there and rebuffs a man whom Nancy has drawn into conversation. Nancy encourages Liz to focus not on the negative, but on what she does want from a man. Liz tries to follow Nancy's advice the next day at a dodgeball game, and she tells a man (Ariel Shafir), whom she hit in the face during a previous dodgeball game, what traits she wants from a man. However, the man does not speak English, and a disappointed Liz hits him with another ball. Finally, James \\"Toofer\\" Spurlock (Keith Powell) learns he may have been hired as a writer on TGS with Tracy Jordan because of affirmative action and quits. Liz‚Äîthe show's head writer‚Äîis reluctant to rehire him until TGS producer Pete Hornberger (Scott Adsit) reveals to Liz that she is also a beneficiary of affirmative action, having attended college on a Title IX scholarship and having her project The Girlie Show picked up as a mid-season replacement for a misogynistic show that received complaints. When Toofer returns, he demands that no one call him \\"Toofer\\" anymore, but when everyone comes up with more insulting nicknames, he gives up. Production Series creator Tina Fey (pictured) wrote \\"Lee Marvin vs. Derek Jeter\\" along with co- writer Kay Cannon. \\"Lee Marvin vs. Derek Jeter\\" was directed by series producer Don Scardino, and written by co-producer Kay Cannon and series creator Tina Fey. This was Cannon and Fey's fourth script collaboration, having written the episodes \\"Black Tie\\", \\"Somebody to Love\\", and \\"Christmas Special\\", for season one, season two, and season three, respectively. \\"Lee Marvin vs. Derek Jeter\\" originally aired on NBC in the United States on April 22, 2010, as the seventeenth episode of the show's fourth season and the 75th overall episode of the series. \\"Lee Marvin vs. Derek Jeter\\" was filmed on February 8, 2010.

Banks later guest starred in the episode \\"Future Husband\\". 30 Rock writer and producer Steve Hely appeared in this episode as \\"Jerem\\", a man who twice refuses Jenna Maroney's attempts at conversation starters. Keith Powell, who plays Toofer Spurlock, was asked about his reaction towards his storyline in the \\"Lee Marvin vs. Derek Jeter\\" script, in which he said \\"They kind of warned me about that one ‚Äì I thought it was a really fun thing because Affirmative Action has permeated corporate culture. It didn't freak me out that much\\". Comedian actor Will Ferrell had a brief appearance in \\"Lee Marvin vs. Derek Jeter\\". In a scene, Pete reveals to Liz that the only reason The Girlie Show‚Äîbefore being renamed to TGS with Tracy Jordan‚Äîwas green-lighted by NBC was due to criticism from women's groups after the network aired the action drama Bitch Hunter. In a clip, Ferell, as the character \\"Shane Hunter\\", is seen with a gun, and entering a woman's bathroom, and shouting \\"Happy birthday, bitches!\\". 30 Rock writer Jack Burditt and former co-chairman of NBC Entertainment and Universal Media Studios Ben Silverman are credited as executive producers of this show.

Avery and Jack attend a gala opening at a museum, and upon seeing the decorations and well dressed patrons, Avery remarks that \\"You always know you're at the right party when it feels like the Riddler is about to attack\\", the Riddler is a comic book villain who leaves behind riddles, puzzles, and word games so that they can be solved. While posing for pictures at the gala, a photographer mistakes Avery for stand-up comedian Chelsea Handler, which has been based on real life experience for Elizabeth Banks, who portrays Avery, as she has been mistaken for Handler. When Liz tells Jack that he cannot date both Avery and Nancy at the same time, she says \\"Mrs. Doubtfire shimself could not do this\\", a reference to actor Robin Williams' role in the movie Mrs. Doubtfire, and a scene late in the film in which he alternates between playing two roles in two simultaneous meetings, one as a man, and the other as an older woman named Mrs. Doubtfire. During their dinner, Avery tells Jack some day he will be as great as a man as former U.S. President Ronald Reagan, to which Jack replies \\"I do like jelly beans\\", a reference to Reagan's real-life love of the candy. During one scene of \\"Lee Marvin vs. Derek Jeter\\", Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) tells the TGS with Tracy Jordan staff \\"I know you're all secretly mad, because we finally have a black Disney princess\\", which is a reference to the 2009 Disney animated film The Princess and the Frog in which the princess character, Tiana, is the first black princess in the Disney Princess franchise. In her speech, Liz says that she wants to be with a man who \\"will just shut their mouth\\" when watching the ABC show Lost. Reception In its original American broadcast, \\"Lee Marvin vs. Derek Jeter\\" was watched by 4.216 million households, according to the Nielsen ratings system. It achieved a 1.9 rating/6 share in the key 18- to 49-year-old demographic. This means that it was seen by 1.9 percent of all 18- to 49-year-olds, and 6 percent of all 18- to 49-year-olds watching television at the time of the broadcast. This was a decrease from the previous episode, \\"Floyd\\", which was watched by 6.252 million American viewers. In the 8:30 p.m. timeslot on April 22, in which this episode aired out of its usual timeslot, 30 Rock was outperformed by CBS' reality show Survivor: Heroes vs. Villains, Fox's crime drama Bones, and ABC's FlashForward. Nonetheless, \\"Lee Marvin vs. Derek Jeter\\" outperformed The CW's supernatural-fantasy horror program The Vampire Diaries, which drew 3.155 million viewers. Kay Cannon and Tina Fey received a Primetime Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Writing in a Comedy Series for their work on \\"Lee Marvin vs. Derek Jeter\\" at the 62nd Primetime Emmy Awards, but lost it to Modern Familys Steven Levitan and Christopher Lloyd for their work on the pilot episode. The episode received generally positive reviews from television critics. IGN contributor Robert Canning reported that \\"Lee Marvin vs. Derek Jeter\\" was a \\"stellar episode that was hitting all the right beats\\", and commented that \\"[e]ven the tired, formulaic structure of Jack's two women scenario was given some great new lines\\" from Fey and Cannon, who developed the script. He opined that if the episode centered only around Jack's two women dilemma it \\"would have been just fine.\\" Canning appreciated Elizabeth Banks' and Julianne Moore's appearances, writing that the two \\"exhibited the charms that have made them welcome additions to this season\\". In conclusion, Canning gave the episode a 9.2 out of 10 rating. Jane Boursaw of AOL's TV Squad said that the Toofer story was \\"funny, without being (too) offensive.\\" The A.V. Club's Nathan Rabin said that he enjoyed \\"just about every minute\\" of this episode, and praised Liz's speech citing it as the \\"crowning moment\\" from \\"Lee Marvin vs. Derek Jeter\\". Rabin also liked the Toofer quitting storyline writing that it \\"could easily have gone nowhere but the show made it both funny and surprisingly thoughtful by using it as a springboard to discuss Affirmative Action and our society's defiantly uneven playing field.\\" Time contributor James Poniewozik noted that this episode was stronger than \\"Khonani\\", which aired the same day of the week as this episode. Sean Gandert of Paste wrote that Toofer's plot was not \\"given more than a few minutes of screen time [but] it also doesn't wear out its welcome ... The show doesn't address race, gender, or affirmative action in a particularly enlightened manner, but who cares, it's funny.\\" TV Guide's Adam Mersel wrote that he found the most enjoyment in Liz's story, writing that he found it \\"endearing\\". In regards to Jack's plot, Mersel said that Jack is able to play off Nancy and Avery so well that \\"I am going back and forth on whether or not to scold the NBC boss or give him a pat on the back. Avery and Nancy both have their shining moments, but I feel that he must choose quite soon, or he will be loosing both.\\" Will Ferrell's ten second cameo was well-received, with Canning concluding, \\"...the cherry on the top was discovering that The Girlie Show was only picked up to offset the complaints raised by the series Bitch Hunter. The ten-second clip of this series, with a cameo from Will Ferrell, was phenomenal and I hope the web will soon produce more clips.\\" References External links Category:30 Rock (season 4) episodes Category:2010 American television episodes Category:Television episodes written by Tina Fey ","title":"Lee Marvin vs. Derek Jeter"},{"id":"27109262","text":"thumb Anda Eibele (born July 30, 1984 in Riga) is a Latvian women's basketball player with the Latvia women's national basketball team.

The gang was known, not only for their high-profile robberies, but for their frequent escapes from prison. The members were alleged to have sworn a blood oath to free each other from jail, should they ever be captured, or die in the attempt. History =Terrill and the Central Park Gang= Ray Terrill began working with the famed Central Park Gang based in Tulsa, Oklahoma during the early 1920s. Many future Depression-era outlaws came from this group, most prominently, Volney Davis and the Barker Gang. Then using the alias \\"G.R. Patton\\", he was arrested with Arthur Barker while burglarizing a bank in Muskogee, Oklahoma on January 15, 1921. He was convicted of second- degree burglary and sentenced to two years in prison. Upon his release on March 1, 1923, Terrill joined up with Al Spencer's gang and participated in the March 26 bank robbery in Mannford which left two people killed during the getaway and shootout. He was also part of Spencer's team, which included Frank Nash among others, that stole $20,000 in cash and bonds from the Katy Limited near Okesa on August 20, 1923. This was the last recorded train robbery in the state's history.Newton, Michael. The Encyclopedia of Robberies, Heists, and Capers. New York: Facts On File Inc., 2002. (pg. 170-171) After Spencer was killed by police a month later, Terrill formed his own gang. Some of his earliest recruits were Herman Barker, Wilbur Underhill and Elmer H. Inman. His gang specialized in night burglaries of banks and stores with a unique method of raiding their targets. Using stolen trucks, they extracted the safes and drove them to Herman Barker's home at Radium Springs Health Resort near Salina, Oklahoma. Once there, the safes would be unlocked by safe crackers and emptied, then driven out to a nearby bridge at night where they would be dumped. Terrill and his gang operated for three years until he and Inman were arrested for burglary in Ardmore in 1926. They were both convicted and sentenced to years each, but escaped from prison together on September 27, 1926. The two went their separate ways after escaping and Terrill set out to reform his gang. =Partnership with the Kimes Brothers= George and Matthew Kimes robbed their first bank together in Depew, Oklahoma on June 30, 1926, Matt having escaped from jail in Bristow the previous day. Only three months before Kimes escaped from prison, the brothers went on a brief crime spree of their own before meeting up with Kimes. On August 20, they stole $5,000 from a bank in Beggs and led a gang which simultaneously raided two banks in Covington six days later.Havill, Adrian. The Mother, the Son, and the Socialite: The True Story of a Mother-Son Crime Spree. New York: Macmillan, 1999. (pg. 73-74) The Kimes brothers were confronted by police in Sallisaw on August 27. A shootout occurred which resulted in the death of Deputy Perry Chuculate and the kidnapping of the police chief and another hostage as they attempted to flee to Arkansas. They were trapped by authorities near Rudy the next day, holding out at the home of their cousin Ben Pixley, and surrendered to police after both were wounded in a second gunfight. George Kimes was sentenced to 25 years for bank robbery and sent to McAlester state penitentiary while Matthew was given 30 years for the death of police officer Perry Chuculate. On November 21, 1926, Terrill led a raid on the Sallisaw jail with Herman Barker and Elmer Inman and broke out their newest recruit, Matthew Kimes. The gang's first robbery occurred on January 10, 1927, when Kimes, Terrill and Barker stole $42,950 from a bank in Sapulpa, Oklahoma. A week later, the three men were caught by police burglarizing a bank with two others in Joplin, Missouri. The gang fled into getaway cars and split up during the police chase. Matt Kimes and the two unknown men escaped into Kansas after a high-speed pursuit. Terrill and Barker however were followed to a house in Carterville where, after Barker was wounded in a shootout with police, the outlaws surrendered. =Final years and imprisonment= Terrill was not brought to trial for this recent crime spree and instead was to be returned to prison and complete his 1926 prison sentence. On January 19, 1927, while being transferred to McAlester however, he escaped from custody leaping from a moving police car and fled on foot. He rejoined Kimes in another series of bank robberies. On May 27, Terrill was named by authorities as the prime suspect in a daylight bank robbery in McCune, Kansas in which $207,000 was stolen. Two days later, Kimes and Terrill returned to Beggs, Oklahoma with nine other gunmen and looted two banks of $18,000. Marshal W.J. McAnally was gunned down in the street while attempting to stop one of the robberies. The third bank was not robbed due to the outside bank clock being a few minutes off from the other banks' clocks. This was the gang's last robbery as, on June 24, Matt Kimes and Raymond Doolin were arrested in Arizona near the Grand Canyon. Returned to Oklahoma, Kimes was sentenced to life imprisonment for his role in the murder of W.J. McAnally. Terrill and Inman were arrested in Hot Springs, Arkansas on November 26, 1927, and was also sent to McAlester where the Kimes brothers were also held. Ray Terrill died in prison, but Kimes eventually escaped from McAlester. He was able to obtain a six-day leave of absence, with the help of influential friends, and released to go quail hunting with his lawyer on November 26, 1934. He was given another leave in November 1945, but chose to escape and robbed a bank in Morton, Texas. A warrant was made for his arrest, however Kimes was run down by a poultry truck in North Little Rock on December 1, 1945. As described in the book The Mother, the Son and the Socialite, Kimes admitted himself to the hospital under the alias Leo A Woods where a swarm of FBI agents apprehended him the following day. His condition continued to decline over the next 2 weeks due to complications resulting from the poultry truck accident. Kimes failed to respond to an operation to repair his injuries. He died on December 14, 1945 according to the Fort Smith Times and was buried in Van Buren, Crawford county, Arkansas near the graves of his parents. References Further reading *Koch, Michael.

His counterpart in the British Army is the Military Secretary. The Royal Air Force equivalent is the Air Secretary. The Director People and Training has taken over the role, combining the responsibilities of Flag Officer Sea Training. History The Office of the Naval Secretary was originally established in 1800 when the appointment was styled Private Secretary to the First Lord of the Admiralty and remained so styled until 1911. In 1912 it was re-titled Naval Secretary to the First Lord of the Admiralty. The post-holder assisted the political head of the navy on senior appointments. When the Admiralty department was abolished in 1964 the post was renamed Naval Secretary and he now advised the Royal Navy's military head. From 2010 to 2015 he simultaneously held additional titles of Naval Secretary, Assistant Chief of the Naval Staff (Personnel) and Chief Naval Logistics Officer (as head the Naval Logistics Branch). In 2015 the post holder assumed new additional responsibilities for the Royal Naval Reserve and another additional title of Flag Officer, Maritime Reserves. In this capacity he is currently responsible for advising the First Sea Lord and Chief of Naval Staff on all matters relating to Flag and General Officers‚Äô appointing. He is supported in the fulfillment of these duties by the Office of Assistant to the Naval Secretary who currently holds the rank of Commodore.

Benson is an American vocalist, most known for her recorded background vocals. She is considered one of the most recorded vocalists in the history of the business. Biography =Early years= Carla L. Benson grew up in South Jersey with her mother and two brothers. Eventually her family included a stepfather and younger sister. Benson studied dance at Sidney King School of Dance in Camden from ages 4‚Äì12. She developed her love of a great story and a beautiful melodic line through her mother's love of great jazz vocalists, most notably Sarah Vaughan, Nancy Wilson, Gloria Lynn and Aretha Franklin. She discovered a group called Patti LaBelle and the BlueBelles and played \\"Down the Aisle\\" so often that the 45 record had to be replaced four times. She attended Pyne Poynt Junior High School where she joined the Walter Young Choral Ensemble. in 1968, they earned an appearance on the Ted Mack Amateur Hour in New York City. She began private voice lessons in her eighth grade year at the insistence of her mother, from the man who would become her lifelong mentor and father figure/friend: Dr. James Mumford, Professor Emeritus of Bloomington, Indiana. Two years later she entered Camden High School. She entered Glassboro State College, later named Rowan University, immediately after graduation, as a Music Education Major. In her freshman year, she was invited to audition for a newly formed record company called Philadelphia International Records by her first cousin Barbara Ingram, who called to ask if she knew of another girl who could sing and, together, they could form a group. =Early career= Benson began her professional career singing with her cousin Barbara, who died unexpectedly in 1994, and Evette L. Benton, her best friend from childhood with whom she was now college roommates. After auditioning for Thom Bell, these women, all Camden natives, became the in-house background vocalists for Philadelphia International Records for over 10 years. They vigorously resisted any group name but eventually were named \\"The Sweethearts of Sigma\\" for the famous Sigma Sound Studios where they did the majority of their work, by mix master Tom Moulton. The group became much sought after for their sweet, angelic sound, their professionalism, their speed and accuracy in learning and recording, and their comedic antics during sessions with producers who flew in from all over the world to work with them. They never signed an exclusive contract, making them were free to work as independent contractors for whomever they chose. As a result, they appeared on many projects outside the Philadelphia International stables. Benson's crisp, clear soprano blended perfectly with Barbara's sensual 2nd soprano and Evette's solid, gospel rich bottom. They can be heard on hundreds of hits, including Billy Paul's \\"Me and Mrs. Jones\\", The Spinners' \\"I'll Be Around: , McFadden and Whitehead's \\"Ain't No Stopping Us Now\\", Evelyn \\"Champagne\\" King's \\"Shame\\", Patti LaBelle's \\"New Attitude\\" and \\"If Only You Knew\\", Lou Rawl's \\"You're Gonna Miss My Lovin\\" and Patti LaBelle and Michael McDonald's \\"On My Own \\" to name a few. (see Credits at Discogs.com/CarlaL.Benson) During the Disco era, The Sweethearts were heavily sought after for their vocals. Precluded by confidentiality agreements from revealing actual artists and title songs, the Sweethearts were the actual vocalists for several major disco hits as well as the named and unnamed background vocalists for studio orchestras MFSB, The Salsoul Orchestra, The Original Ritchie Family, and John Davis' Monster Orchestra. They provided background vocals for Grace Jones, The Trammps, the Village People, Gloria Gaynor, Loleatta Holloway, France Joli, and hundreds of others successful Disco Acts. After the runaway success of Saturday Night Fever, even John Travolta tried his hand at recording and insisted on the vocal assistance of the famed Sweethearts. (Credits at Discogs.com/CarlaL.Benson With the sudden decline of disco, the women were without work and decided to break up the group. Benson was approached to produce the annual fundraising event for The Dr. Charles Henderson Auxiliary, the only African American auxiliary of The Cooper University Hospital in her native Camden, New Jersey. She wrote and directed an ensemble cast, produced and performed in her creation, which she named \\"Rhapsody in Black\\". That year, the auxiliary exceeded their own expectations and was able to make its largest donation to the hospital in their history. That record still stands today. Benson won lead roles in two productions of Ain't Misbehavin' at The Riverfront Dinner Theater in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Carla had been a long time Patti LaBelle fan. The Sweethearts had previously recorded the background vocals for Ms. LaBelle's \\"If Only You Knew\\", \\"Love, Need and Want\\", and a few others. In the mid-80s, when LaBelle wanted new background vocalists, she wondered if \\"The Girls\\" would be interested. The Sweethearts hadn't sung together for three years, but when this opportunity arose, they quickly came back together and nailed the audition. For the first and only time in the Sweethearts' career, they toured and recorded exclusively with one artist, Patti LaBelle. It was her who renamed them \\"The Sweeties\\", the name that ultimately stuck. LaBelle fondly referred to Benson as \\"Sweetie Number One\\". It was during their tenure with LaBelle that they recorded the soundtrack for Beverly Hills Cop and did the popular video \\"Stir It Up\\". LaBelle received her first platinum album, Winner in You, on which the Sweeties performed. She graciously orchestrated the moment when the Sweeties received their platinum albums during an on-air interview on the popular television show People Are Talking with Richard Bey in 1987. During her down times off the road, Carla Benson worked as a substitute teacher for the Camden School system, where her love of inner city teenagers began to take root and grow. =On her own= Five years on the road was enough for Benson. She missed her 12-year-old son. She decided to hang up her traveling shoes, and secured an aggressive, successful agent in the Atlantic City area, Andrea Kaufman. Under her direction in 1988, Benson caught the attention of several entertainment directors for Atlantic City casinos, and was eventually offered the opportunity to open in the main room of the Claridge Hotel and Casino in November of that same year. Patti LaBelle showed her support for Benson by attending and singing a bit at the concert. The show was deemed a massive success and Benson spent the next two years performing exclusively at the Trump Casino's special events, and the Claridge Casino. =Wedding singer= When the casinos closed many of their lounges, Benson sang for over fifteen years with a busy, upscale wedding band, The Franklin Alison Orchestra, out of Princeton, New Jersey. Tony Award-winning writer Joseph A. Walker (The River Niger) was hired to produce a series of musicals for Rutgers University. Under his direction, Benson starred in productions of Dreamgirls, The Amen Corner, Buddy Bolden and Raisin. Before his untimely death, he was writing another musical especially for her, which he hoped to have produced on Broadway. Walker's musical director, Tony Booker, was instrumental in Benson being signed to a five-year contract at the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, D.C., where she was featured in their annual production of Black Nativity, under the direction of the founder of the Duke Ellington School of Performing Arts, Mike Malone. She also had a lead role in a developing work written and directed by Tony Award-winning choreographer George Faison. In 1996, Benson graduated at the top of her class from the Technical Institute of New Jersey, Pennsauken Campus as a certified paralegal. She began work as an executive legal secretary in arbitration for Judge Vogelson at the Hall of Justice in Camden. She laughingly refers to this time as proving to herself that she \\"is a musician\\". In 1999, she graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Vocal Music from Rowan University. Benson worked as a Permanent Substitute at Camden High School. =Standing in the shadows= In 2000, Benson was approached by her friend, Allan Slutsky, to participate in a film that would highlight the studio musicians of Motown, who were called \\"The Funk Brothers\\". Being a studio musician herself, this project held a particular appeal for her. Slutsky knew of Benson's professional recording career and hired her to be section leader for the background vocals for the film. Benson hired her cousin Johnny Ingram to go with her, and they traveled with her brother Keith, associate producer for the film, to Detroit, Michigan for two weeks of rehearsals and filming. She worked with artists like Gerald LeVert, whose father she'd previously worked with as a member of the O'Jays; Chaka Khan; Bootsie Collins; Ben Harper; Joan Osborne; Tom Scott; and the Funk Brothers themselves. The project, called Standing in the Shadows of Motown, became an award-winning documentary, and went on to win three Grammy Awards. Encouraged by her mother to return to music, Benson toured the world with the infamous Funk Brothers for about three years. Due to the advanced ages of the Funk Brothers, the touring schedule was very sporadic, leaving big chunks of downtime. Also during this time, writer John A. Jackson approached Benson for an interview in his upcoming book, A House on Fire, the Rise and Fall of Philadelphia Soul, which was released in 2005. Benson is credited with the opening quote and is quoted extensively throughout this rendering, in book form, of one man's view of life at Philadelphia International Records. =Return to teaching= In 2001, Dr. Stephanie Branch offered her a position as a music teacher at the Charles E. Brimm Medical Arts High School in Camden. Benson and her students thrived in the classroom and no one was more surprised by this \\"fit\\" than Benson. She said, \\"My children need to know more than do- re-mi. They need to know they are valuable. They need to know life skills such as the importance of voting and the absolute necessity of being able to read and they must, must reconnect with their dreams and goals. I can help them do all of that, through MUSIC as I teach it\\". Dr. Branch thought it was a plus to have a music teacher who was also a performing musician, as long as her absences were not too long in duration or frequency. After two years, Dr. Branch left to further her own career. The interim powers that remained at Brimm Medical Arts did not have Dr. Branch's vision or understanding of a touring musician, and forced Benson out. She used the time to complete the quest she'd begun so many years ago. She attended classes at the Women's Opportunity Resource Center in Philadelphia to complete her business plan, and her \\"Awakenings, Inc.\\" was born. =Currently= Benson continues to perform and has recently released two new original projects, a single called \\"Welcome\\" and a full CD entitled You Should Be Here. In November 2014, she directed and produced a Christmas video for Youtube with an all Camden, New Jersey cast, entitled \\"Voices of Camden, Featuring Carla Benson\\". She continues to seek funding for her \\"Awakenings\\" after-school program aimed at inner-city, at-risk high school youth. Her dream is to return to the stage on a more consistent basis in order to fund the program herself.

The Lund 1 Runestone, designated as DR 314 in the Rundata catalog, is a Viking Age memorial runestone originally located on the grounds of the All Saints Church in Lund, Scania, Sweden. Description The Lund 1 Runestone is a granite stone pillar nearly four meters in height that has inscriptions carved on its four sides. There are runic inscriptions carved on sides A and B of the stone, images of two animals identified as wolves and a man's mask on side C, and the mask of a lion face on side D. The runic inscriptions are classified as being carved in runestone style RAK, which is the classification of the oldest inscriptions. This is the runestone style classification of inscriptions where the ends of the text bands are straight and there are no attached serpent or animal heads. The inscription, which has a Danish Rundata catalog number because Scania was part of the historical Denmark during the Viking Age, is dated as being carved after the Jelling stones of Denmark. The two wolves on Side C are apparently armed with a shield and sword strapped to their bodies. The depiction of the wolves show a mane and pointed ears similar to that of the wolf on inscription DR 284 of the Hunnestad Monument and on the DR 271 in Tullstorp. The man's mask between the two wolves is similar to those depicted on two other runestones in Scania, inscriptions DR 258 in B√∂sarp and DR 335 in V√§stra Str√∂. The lion face mask on Side D is similar to that depicted on the inscription DR 66 from Denmark, which is also known as the √Örhus 4 image stone or the Mask Stone. Other inscriptions with facial masks include DR 62 in Sjelle, DR 81 in Skern, the now-lost DR 286 in Hunnestad, Vg 106 in Lasseg√•rden, S√∂ 86 in √Öby √§gor, S√∂ 112 in Kolunda, S√∂ 167 in Landshammar, S√∂ 367 in Sl√§bro, N√§ 34 in Nasta, U 508 in Gillberga, U 670 in R√∂lunda, U 678 in Skokloster, U 824 in √ñrsundsbro, U 1034 in Tensta, and U 1150 in Bj√∂rklinge, and on the Sjellebro Stone. The runic text states that the stone is a memorial raised by a man named √ûorg√≠sl in memory of his two brothers, √ìlafr and √ìttarr. The text refers to \\"stones\\" that were raised, so the original memorial consisted of at least one additional raised stone. √ìlafr and √ìttarr are described as being landmennr g√≥√∞a, or \\"good landowners.\\" A similar Old Norse phrase praising the deceased, landmanna beztr meaning \\"best of landholders,\\" is present on the inscriptions on memorial runestones S√∂ 338 in Turinge and DR 133 in Skivum, Denmark. Landmennr is sometimes translated as \\"land-men.\\" Some believe that the term land-men refers to a title that is something higher than a simple free farmer, such as a rich farmer or squire, although there is dispute regarding this. Drawing of the runestone published in 1878. The name of the father of the stones sponsor, √Åsgeirr Bj√¥rn, has several name elements that were common at that time in Scandinavia. √Åsgeirr means \\"Divine Spear\\" and contains a name element referring to the √Üsir, the Norse pagan gods, while Bj√¥rn means \\"Bear.\\" √ûorg√≠sl also contains a god's name as an element and means \\"Thor's Hostage.\\" The Lund 1 Runestone was discovered in the ruins of a monastery in 1682, where it had apparently been re-used as material in the construction of that building. Before the historic significance of runestones was understood, they were often used as materials in the construction of roads, bridges, and buildings. The stone was found broken at two locations, but in 1868 it was repaired and raised at the Lundag√•rd. Since 1957 the runestone has been located in the entrance hall of the library at the Lund University. Locally the runestone is referred to as the Lundastenen (\\"the Lund Stone\\") or the Lundag√•rdsstenen (\\"the Lundag√•rd Stone\\").

A member of the Canadian League of Composers and an associate of the Canadian Music Centre, he is known for his contributions to Jewish music. He has presented many programs of Jewish music (some featuring his own compositions) for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation and has presented similar programs in lecture-recitals throughout Canada, the United States, Australia, and Japan. He has also contributed articles on Jewish music to a number of publications. Several of his original manuscripts and papers are held in the collection at the library of the University of Calgary. Early life Born to Jewish parents in Winnipeg, Steinberg was the son of cantor and conductor Alexander Steinberg.The World of Music. Vol. 37. B√§renreiter Kassel; 1995. p. 79.Music in Jewish History and Culture. Harmonie Park Press; 2006. . p. 261. By the age of eight he was singing as a soloist with his father's synagogue choir. He was a pupil of Samuel Dolin (piano), Weldon Kilburn (singing), and John Weinzweig (composition) at The Royal Conservatory of Music from 1948 to 1951 and 1957 to 1960. He also studied music education at the University of Toronto where he earned a Bachelor of Music in 1961. Career In 1950 Steinberg was appointed director of the music program at the school at Holy Blossom Temple in Toronto, a position he held until 1960 when he became the temple's music director. He remained in that post until he became music director at Temple Sinai in 1970. From 1953-1958 he taught at various public schools in the Toronto area. He became the head of the music department at Winston Churchill Collegiate Institute in 1961. He left there in 1964 to become the head of the music program at Forest Hill Collegiate Institute where he remained until 1986. In 1961 the Union of American Hebrew Congregations commissioned and published his method for youth choirs, Together Do They Sing. During the 1960s Steinberg composed three sacred services which were published by Transcontinental Music. He later wrote two more services of which one was published in 1990. Transcontinental has also published several of Steinberg's choral, organ, orchestral, and vocal works, including The Vision of Isaiah (1970) for tenor, choir, and organ or instrumental ensemble; Yerushalayim (1973) for soprano, choir, and orchestra; and Echoes of Children (1979), a cantata for soloist, narrator, chorus, and orchestra. The latter composition was awarded the International Gabriel Award and was twice performed on nationally televised broadcasts on PBS in the United States. In 1978 and 1980 Steinberg was the artist-in-residence for the city of Jerusalem. In 1980 Paul Brodie commissioned his Suite Sephardi and in 1983 his Suite for String Orchestra was commissioned by the Chamber Players of Toronto. In 1983 he won a composition award from the American Harp Society for his Suite for Flute, Viola and Harp (1981) and was awarded the Kavod Award of the Cantors Assembly. In 1989 baritone Richard Allen recorded several of his works on the cassette A Ben Steinberg Concert and in 1990 his Invocations was commissioned by Lawrence Cherney. He was commissioned to write a total of 18 compositions by temples, synagogues, and congregations in the USA between 1980 and 1991.The American Harp Journal. Vol. 18.

It is a variation of the circle changeup, and when mastered can be extremely effective. Much like a forkball, the vulcan is gripped between two fingers on the hand, but rather than the middle and index finger as with the forkball or split-finger fastball, it sits in between the middle and ring fingers to make a v-shape (Vulcan salute) when releasing to the catcher. It is thrown with fastball arm speed but by pronating the hand by turning the thumb down, to get good downward movement on it. The pitch is uncommon in Major League Baseball. Ian Kennedy throws this style of changeup instead of others because he \\"found it more comfortable and had more movement\\". Among the others who have thrown it are John Gant, former relievers Randy Tomlin and Joe Nelson, and most notably former all-star closer √âric Gagn√©, for whom the vulcan changeup was considered one of his best pitches. Roy Oswalt adopted this pitch during the 2010 offseason and preferred it over the circle changeup. Nelson explained his choice for naming the pitch: \\"It was either going to be Nanu Nanu or the Vulcan. Spock just seemed like a cooler character than Mork.\\" The pitch has been nicknamed the \\"Trekkie\\", because of the Vulcan symbol, from the television show Star Trek, that appears in the grip of the ball.

Probably the Venetian version was a translation made from the original Latin after 1496, when Trani came under Venetian dominion (where it remained until 1509). The printed version appears under a Latin title, with a Latin subtitle (edita per consules civitatis Trani), possible both original. A few Latin phrases left untranslated also evidence a work of translation. The text in the archives of Fermo was supplied by their then keeper, Filippo Raffaelle, for a critical edition and English translation in the Black Book of the Admiralty. The text of the Ordinamenta contains the date anno Domini 1063 and specifies the first indiction. This has been cited as ‚Äúa strong argument in favour of the authenticity of the ordinances‚Äù, since the first indiction only coincides with the sixty-third year of a century every three hundred years, but it did with 1063.Twiss, 523 n.1.

Neither the translation ‚Äúguild‚Äù nor that of ‚Äúcompany‚Äù (typical for Latin societas) for the presumed Latin original, ars, is strictly accurate.Twiss, 525 n.1 Nevertheless, the term has been seen as evidence of the existence of a sailors' corporation at Trani in the mid-eleventh century.

In the two decades of its existence, the brandy trade had increased significantly and the missionaries found it necessary to relocate their neophytes and catechumens farther from the drunkenness and seduction of the cities. In 1696, the inhabitants were moved to the other side of the island, to Fort Lorette at Sault-au-Recollet. The mission at de la Montagne was definitely closed in 1705: the grounds were rented to the local peasants, and some would live in the fortifications. In 1825, a floor is added to the main residence of ch√¢teau des Messieurs and a chapel is built in one of the towers. The fort contained four bastions and a series of ramparts and palisades, which were all destroyed in 1854 except for the two southern towers, during the building of the College of Montreal.

Background Shells of Rangeroceras are smooth, slightly depressed, rod- bearing orthocones with moderately large submarginal siphuncles. The siphuncular rods, which lie along the lower (ventral) side of the siphuncle interiors show thin, slightly undulating, growth lamellae in vertical longitudinal section, a somewhat unusual feature. Dorsal annuli only begin to form when the rod has almost filled the entire siphncle toward to apical end. Connecting rings are thin, but layered. Cameral deposits are known from the dorsal side, the ventral side of the type specimen lost from erosion. Hook and Flower (1977) originally placed Rangeroceras in the family Baltoceratidae because of the siphunclular rod and thin connecting rings. Evans (2005) proposed the family Rangeroceratidae for Rangeroceras and a somewhat similar genus Cyclorangeroceras from Great Britain and included them in the Dissidocerida. Rangeroceras is named for one of the characters, the range ranger, in the Tajar stories by Jane Shaw Ward. Other Tajar story based genera include Tajaroceras, Wardoceras, and Veneficoceras The type, Rangeroceras hintzei came from the Wahwah Limestone in the Ibex area in Western Utah.

Joe comic series. He is a scientist who is the inventor of the Brainwave Scanner. Comics =Marvel Comics= Dr. Venom is the first scientist employed by Cobra. His first major invention for the organization is the Brainwave Scanner. He gets a chance to show off the evil device when the Baroness captures Snake Eyes, Scarlett, and Zap and brings them to Cobra headquarters in Springfield. Dr Venom tries to break through Snake Eyes' resistance and manages to see flashes of several of the Joe's memories including his time in Vietnam and the mission that scarred his face. When Venom is distracted by Scarlett and Zap's attempts to escape, Snake Eyes uses breathing techniques he learned in Japan to simulate his death. When Venom and a guard unstrap Snake Eyes from the scanner, the Joe revives and knocks both of them out. He then meets up with his friends and the trio escape.G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero #10 (1983) Dr. Venom begins work on a plague toxin at a lab in Sierra Gordo. Snake Eyes, Stalker, Breaker and Gung-Ho track down the lab and almost capture Venom, but all four are captured instead by Kwinn the Eskimo. Venom beats Snake Eyes severely and leaves him to die in a burning warehouse as payback for what happened in Springfield. Snake Eyes escapes and tracks everyone to a meeting with the Baroness and Scar-Face on a small island. Baroness, Scar- Face, and the other three Joes escape the island while Snake Eyes, Kwinn, and Venom do battle. Kwinn notices Baroness divebombing the island and pushes the other two into an armored bunker. The island is then bombed out of existence.G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero #13 The bunker survives the bombing and all three agree to work together to escape. However, Venom decides to doublecross Kwinn and knocks him over the head with a wrench while swimming to the surface. Venom and Snake Eyes run into a small force of Cobras who were dealing with the aftermath of the Sierra Gordo operation. The Cobras thought about taking the duo prisoner but were all killed when Kwinn turned up alive. The trio headed for a nearby airfield where they stole an old WW2 Lancaster bomber to fly back to the States. The trip was not uneventful as the Sierra Gordo military tried to shoot them down and Venom tried to kill Snake Eyes and Kwinn by having them fall out the bomb bay doors. The plane limped its way to Miami Beach where the trio were arrested. However, Venom had earlier used the plane's radio to transmit a message to Cobra in morse so he had a lawyer waiting for him at the station.G.I.

This is a part of a plan to have Scar-Face captured by the Joes so Cobra can track down where the Joes' secret base is by watching for signs of medical quarantine.G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero #18 While preparing for the battle to come, Venom is ambushed by Kwinn and Snake Eyes at his lab in Brooklyn. Unfortunately, the arrival of Cobra forces allows Venom to disable Kwinn and Snake Eyes and lock them up in SNAKE armor that brainwashed them into serving Cobra. During the attack on G.I. Joe base, Venom unleashes the SNAKE armor on the attacking Joes, but Snake Eyes breaks free from his brainwashing and frees Kwinn. Kwinn destroys Venom's HISS tank and prepares to kill Venom with a grenade. However, Kwinn finds he can't go through with his vengeance and instead decides to let Venom live. Venom is not impressed by the gesture and shoots Kwinn several times in the back. Kwinn appears to shrug off the shots and tells Venom he will not harm him as long as he lives. Moments later, Kwinn dies and the grenade he was holding roles out of his hand and into Venom's feet. Venom is killed instantly by the blast.G.I.

Joe: A Real American Hero issue 155¬Ω, a Free Comic Book Day giveaway, Dr. Venom makes an appearance of sorts. Venom's image appears and persists on the screen of the Brainwave Scanner as Billy, Cobra Commander's son, is being subjected to a brainwave scan. Dr. Mindbender assures Cobra Commander that this is merely a glitch in the system. Mindbender is later seen discussing his concerns about the glitch to Destro and the comic ends alluding to the fact that readers have not seen the last of Dr. Venom's diabolical schemes. Indeed, Venom has managed to transfer his mind and memories into Billy, suppressing Billy's own personality. He makes several overtures towards the Baroness under the cover of Billy's training sessions. When Snake Eyes is captured and brainwashed, he takes Snake Eyes to Brooklyn to eliminate the defected Storm Shadow. Storm Shadow manages to undo Snake Eyes' brainwashing, and the two of them manage to subdue Billy, having figured that Dr. Venom had taken over. They sneak back into Cobra's base and place Billy in the scanner, confronting Venom in Billy's mind. Entering the Scanner's shared mindspace, they defeat Venom and Billy and force Venom into his darker memories, where they find several ice floes and Kwinn waiting for him. Kwinn seizes Dr. Venom and carries him into his kayak, sailing off into the sunset. In Issues 169, Doctor Mindbender is attempting to repair the Brainwave Scanner after the Ninjas sabotage it, when he sees Venom again, pleading with Mindbender to free him in exchange for his secrets. Mindbender refuses, and destroys the Brainwave Scanner as Kwinn drags Venom away once more. Toys Dr. Venom's action figure was first made in 2010 as part of a two-pack with Adventure Team Commander available from the Official G.I. Joe Collectors' Club.

It was established in response to the First Balkan War and saw action during the First World War. It was disbanded after the ships were transferred to the Ottoman Empire four years after their pursuit by the British battlecruisers and and light cruisers and . Service =Pre-war= When the First Balkan War broke out in October 1912, the German General Staff determined that a naval Mediterranean Division was needed to give Germany the ability to project power in the Mediterranean. Therefore, the staff dispatched the battlecruiser and the light cruiser to Constantinople. The two ships left Kiel on 4 November, and arrived on 15 November 1912. From April 1913, Goeben visited many Mediterranean ports, including Venice, Pola, and Naples, before sailing into Albanian waters, while the Mediterranean Division was reinforced with the arrival of the light cruisers and . Following this trip, Goeben returned to Pola and remained there from 21 August to 16 October for maintenance.Staff, p. 18 On 29 June 1913, the Second Balkan War broke out. As a result, the Mediterranean Division would need to remain in the area. The end of the war saw the withdrawal back to Germany of Strassburg and Dresden, while on 23 October 1913, Konteradmiral Wilhelm Souchon assumed command of the squadron. Goeben and Breslau continued their activities in the Mediterranean, and visited some 80 ports before the outbreak of the First World War. The Navy intended on replacing Goeben with her sister in June 1914, but the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand in Sarajevo, Bosnia on 28 June 1914 and the subsequent rise in tensions between the Great Powers made this impossible.Staff, p. 15 In the immediate aftermath of the assassination, Souchon correctly assessed that war was imminent between the Central Powers and the Triple Entente. As a result, he ordered his ships to make for Pola for repairs. Engineers came from Germany to work on the ship.Halpern, p. 51 Goeben had 4,460 boiler tubes replaced, among other repairs. Upon completion, the ships departed for the French ports Bone and Phillipville, which they shelled in the early hours of August 4.Sufrin, p. 27 From there, they departed for Messina, where they would be coaled by German merchant ships. They arrived in the early hours of August 5, coaled for 36 straight hours, protected from the British due to Italy's neutrality.Sufrin, pp. 28-29 =The pursuit= After their coaling, the ships decided to break out of Messina, although it had been surrounded by British warships, the battlecruisers and and the light cruisers and , under the overall command of Sir Archibald Berkeley Milne. Milne thought that the Germans, after coaling at Messina, would break out to the west and try to escape to the Atlantic. Therefore, he positioned both his battlecruisers and Dublin at the west end of the Strait of Messina. The French also moved their Mediterranean fleet to guard the Gibraltar Strait. On August 6 they broke out of Messina and steamed northwards, feigning a move to the Adriatic Sea to make the British fleet drop back. However, after 5 hours of steaming west, Goeben decided to turn east as her coal supply was running low. Goeben radioed Breslau to drop back and delay the Gloucester which would allow Goeben to reach a collier off the coast of Greece. Gloucester engaged Breslau with minor damage, and then tried to attack Goeben, but missed. Breslau was then able to continue on with Goeben. The battlecruisers had been approaching, but stopped after they received a false announcement that Austria-Hungary had declared war on England. The squadron avoided action with a cruiser squadron under Rear-Admiral Sir Ernest Troubridge, and on August 10, the ships reached Constantinople.Sufrin, pp. 30-31 =First World War= After their arrival in Constantinople on 16 August 1914, the ships were transferred to the Turkish Navy, although they retained their German crews and captains. Goeben and Breslau were renamed and , respectively. Soon after their transfer, Yavuz Sultan Selim shelled the Russian ports of Sevastopol, Odessa and Novorossiysk and intercepted the Russian fleet at the Battle of Cape Sarych. This helped push Turkey into World War I on the side of the Central Powers. The division then started to escort coal convoys and bombard Entente positions during the Dardanelles Campaign until the Battle of Imbros in early 1918. There, Midilli came under air attack and sank.Haplern, pg.255 Yavuz Sultan Selim also hit three mines,Gardiner & Gray, p. 152 and came under attack by British torpedo boats and light bombers,Halpern, pp. 255‚Äì256 but was towed to safety.Staff, p. 20 The ships were officially transferred to the Ottoman Navy on 2 November 1918, nine days before the Armistice ended the war.

The spacecraft carried fresh food and supplies for the ISS crew. Progress M-05M also hauled some special care packages for the station crew that included confectioneries, books and new movies. Launch 200px The launch of Progress M-05M, which occurred at 17:15 UTC on 28 April 2010, was conducted from Site 1/5 at the Baikonur Cosmodrome, using a Soyuz-U carrier rocket. The Progress M-05M spacecraft arrived at the Baikonur Cosmodrome by train on 19 March 2010. Shortly after delivery, initial tests of its electronics and Kurs docking system began, which were completed by 29 March 2010. Further testing was subsequently conducted using an acoustic chamber between 1 and 3 April 2010. It then underwent a series of leak checks in a vacuum chamber. The spacecraft was fuelled for its mission on 19 April 2010, and mated to its launch adaptor on 21 April 2010. On 22 April 2010, the spacecraft underwent a final inspection before it was encapsulated in the payload fairing It was then transported to the MIK integration building for installation atop the carrier rocket, on 24 April 2010. It was rolled to the launch pad on 26 April 2010, and successfully launched two days later. Docking Progress M-05M approaches the ISS for docking. Progress M-05M (background) is docked to the Pirs Docking Compartment. Following three days of free flight, Progress M-05M docked with the Pirs module of the ISS at 18:30 UTC on 1 May 2010. During rendezvous operations, when Progress M-05M was about a kilometre from the station, its Kurs docking system failed. Cosmonaut Oleg Kotov used the backup TORU system to manually control the rendezvous and docking, setting a record for the furthest distance a Progress spacecraft was flown under manual control. The Progress M-03M spacecraft, which had previously been occupying the Pirs docking port, departed on 22 April 2010 to make way for Progress M-05M. Undocking Progress M-05M remained docked with the space station until 25 October 2010. The spacecraft undocked from the Pirs docking compartment at 14:25 UTC on 25 October 2010. Expedition 25 Flight Engineer Fyodor Yurchikhin closed and performed leak checks on the hatch between the space station and Progress M-05M on 22 October 2010, completing preparations for the spacecraft's undocking. The undocking of Progress M-05M cleared the way for the launch of the Progress M-08M spacecraft on 27 October 2010 from the Baikonur Cosmodrome. On 30 October 2010, Progress M-08M docked to the Pirs docking compartment vacated by Progress M-05M. Decay After undocking, the spacecraft was transferred to a lower orbit. The Progress M-05M spacecraft spent 21 days orbiting a safe distance from the space station. The autonomous mission enabled Russian scientists to conduct geophysical experiments before spacecraft's demise. On 15 November 2010, Progress M-05M was deorbited and drowned in the South Pacific Ocean several thousand kilometers East of New Zealand. Progress engines were activated by the onboard computer and retroburn was initiated at 8:50 UTC. The main engine operated for 186.2 seconds, providing the braking burn of 89.7 mps to the spacecraft. The remaining parts of the Progress M-05M, not burnt during the reentry fell down in the area of 47¬∞57' South and 220¬∞44'West at about 9:35 UTC.

The Gran Teatro Falla is a theater in the city of C√°diz, Andalusia, Spain. It is located in the Plaza Fragela, facing the Casa de las Viudas and adjacent to the Faculty of Medicine of the University of C√°diz. Construction of the theater began in 1884, following plans by architect Adolfo Morales de los R√≠os. It was based on the foundation of the previous Gran Teatro de C√°diz, a wooden building designed by Garc√≠a del √Ålamo and built in 1871, but which had burned in 1881. In 1886 the city government took over direction of the project, which proceeded only intermittently due to lack of funds. The theater was completed in 1905. Municipal architect Juan Cabrera de la Torre made significant modifications to Morales's original plans. The theater was known as the \\"Gran Teatro\\" until 1926 when it was renamed for composer and native son Manuel de Falla. Built in the Neo-Mud√©jar style, it is made of red brick, and has three grand horseshoe arch entry doorways on its principal fa√ßade, with alternating red and white voussoirs. One enters through these doors into a large vestibule, which was redesigned in the 1920s. Stairways ascend to the horseshoe or \\"U\\"-shaped galleries above. The stage is wide and deep. The ceiling shows an allegory of Paradise, the work of Felipe Abarzuza y Rodr√≠guez de Arias. Every February the Gran Teatro Falla is the site of the artistic competitions of the Carnival of C√°diz. During repairs and restoration from 1987 to 1991, those competitions were held instead at the now-defunct Teatro Andaluc√≠a. Through the rest of the year, the theater hosts all manner of shows, such as plays or concerts.

The concept posits the notion that experiences comprise distinct economic offerings that create economic value and competitive advantage. Organizations have begun to collect experience data in addition to operational data, since experiences are seen as a competitive advantage. Experience management platforms provide various services to automate the process of identifying and improving experiences across an organization. Broader than customer experience, experience management now encompasses customer experience along with other areas, such as brand experience, employee experience and product experience, which are all seen as interrelated. History In 1994 Steve Haeckel and Lou Carbone collaborated on a seminal early article on experience management, titled \\"Engineering Customer Experiences,\\" where they defined experience as \\"the 'take-away' impression formed by people's encounters with products, services and businesses ‚Äî a perception produced when humans consolidate sensory information.\\" They argued that the new approach must focus on total experience as the key customer value proposition. The concept reached a wide audience in 1999, when it was popularized by B. Joseph Pine II and James H. Gilmore in their book Experience Economy. In the same year, Bernd Schmitt published Experiential Marketing: How to Get Customers to Sense, Feel, Think, Act, and Relate to Your Company and Brands. In the 2000s, experience management emerged as a complex field unifying the experiences of brands, employees, products and more. It was acknowledged that generating new experiences for end customers requires designing better experiences for internal players of an organization. Value is created by focusing on the experiences of everyone involved in or affected by a new offer, such as customers, employees, suppliers, and other stakeholders. Management To create and manage the experiences, businesses must evaluate, implement, integrate, and build experiences from a fragmented landscape. Such needs are met by experience management platforms, which help automate the process of measuring and improving experiences across an organization by coordinating content, customer data and core services, and unifying marketing, commerce and service processes. Experience management platforms compare multiple layers of data and statistics to enable organizations to identify any experience gaps. They connect operational databases with human feedback, analyzing respondents' emotions, beliefs, and sentiments for a holistic view of the experiences they provide. Their methods include artificial intelligence, predictive analytics, and statistical models. Other uses While the term experience management is predominantly used in business, it has another meaning. It is used for a special kind of knowledge management that deals with collecting, modeling, storing, reusing, evaluating, and maintaining experience. In that sense, the term is interchangeable with expertise management.

The others were the Violin Sonata in E minor, Op. 82, and the Piano Quintet in A minor, Op. 84. Along with the Cello Concerto in E minor, Op. 85 of 1919, these were to be his last major works prior to his death in 1934. Structure The String Quartet lasts for around 25 minutes and is in three movements: # Allegro moderato, 12/8 # Piacevole (poco andante), 3/8 # Allegro molto, 4/4 =2nd movement= The slow middle movement was a favourite of Elgar's wife Lady Elgar, who described it as \\"captured sunshine\\". \\"At its reprise Elgar seamlessly quotes from his Chanson de matin ... His wife likened the movement to 'captured sunshine' ... He finished [the Quartet] on Christmas Eve 1918.\\" It was played at her funeral in 1920, by Albert Sammons, W. H Reed, Lionel Tertis and Felix Salmond. It contains a quotation from Elgar's Chanson de Matin. When he visited the composer during his final illness and after having listened to a gramophone recording of the second movement, Arthur Troyte Griffith remarked: ‚Ä≥Surely that is as fine as a movement by Beethoven.‚Ä≥ Elgar agreed: ‚Ä≥Yes it is, and there is something in it that has never been done before.‚Ä≥ When asked what he meant, Elgar merely replied: ‚Ä≥Nothing you would understand, merely an arrangement of notes\\". Brian Newbould has proposed that Elgar may have hinted at a shortened restatement of the opening theme before the coda. Presumably after the completion of the movement, he crossed the fourth bar (between bb. 263 and 264) through, but was still able to retain the original harmonisation. Background Elgar had written a string quartet much earlier in his career, to which he assigned the opus number 8, but destroyed it. He made several other attempts, which all came to nothing. For example, he put aside work on a quartet to work on his First Symphony. This quartet originated from a request by Carl Fuchs, cellist of the Brodsky Quartet and professor at the Royal Manchester College of Music. In February 1900, Elgar and his wife attended a performance of his Enigma Variations in Manchester, conducted by Hans Richter. At supper after the concert Richter introduced Elgar to Adolph Brodsky and his wife, and to Carl Fuchs. Fuchs then asked Elgar to compose a quartet for them. In 1917, Elgar was ill and depressed by war-time London. He began work on the String Quartet on 25 March 1918, while recovering at home at Severn House after having his tonsils removed. He finished only the first subject of the first movement at that time. In May, Lady Elgar found \\"Brinkwells\\", a cottage surrounded by woods near Fittleworth in Sussex, in which he could work in seclusion away from the cares of the world. Now he turned his focus to the Violin Sonata in E minor, completing it on 15 September. He then immediately set to work on the Piano Quintet in A minor. He interrupted work on that piece on 8 October to return to the Quartet; he completed the middle movement on 26 November, and the final movement on 24 December. \\"Before they packed for the final evacuation, on 24 December the Quartet was finished. Keeping an old promise from the turn of the century, [Elgar] dedicated it to the Brodsky Quartet. Adolf Brodsky was now nearly seventy.\\" He completed the Piano Quintet in January 1919. The Quartet was first performed privately at Elgar's London home Severn House in January 1919, with George Bernard Shaw present, among others. Another private performance was given at the London home of his friend Frank Schuster on 26 April 1919. Elgar was assisted in the violin writing, as he had been in the writing of the Violin Concerto in B minor in 1909‚Äì10, by his great friend W. H. Reed, who also led the quartet in the first private play-throughs. Premiere The String Quartet in E minor was dedicated to the Brodsky Quartet,No relation to the Brodsky Quartet formed in 1972. led by Adolph Brodsky, in honour of the promise Elgar had made years earlier to write a work for them. However, the members of the Brodsky Quartet were now around 70 years of age. The Quartet's public premiere was given by Albert Sammons and W. H. Reed, violins; Raymond Jeremy, viola; and Felix Salmond, cello on 21 May 1919, at the Wigmore Hall, London, the Piano Quintet in A minor also receiving its premiere on this occasion. The group was billed as the \\"British String Quartet\\". (Some sources say the London String Quartet gave the premiere, but Albert Sammons was the only member common to both groups.)

In 2008, three independent research groups reported that patients with the rare genetic retinal disease Leber's congenital amaurosis had been successfully treated using gene therapy with adeno-associated virus (AAV). In all three studies, an AAV vector was used to deliver a functional copy of the RPE65 gene, which restored vision in children suffering from LCA. These results were widely seen as a success in the gene therapy field, and have generated excitement and momentum for AAV-mediated applications in retinal disease. In retinal gene therapy, the most widely used vectors for ocular gene delivery are based on adeno-associated virus. The great advantage in using adeno-associated virus for the gene therapy is that it poses minimal immune responses and mediates long-term transgene expression in a variety of retinal cell types. For example, tight junctions that form the blood-retina barrier, separate subretinal space from the blood supply, providing protection from microbes and decreasing most immune-mediated damages. Clinical trials =Leber's congenital amaurosis= Preclinical studies in mouse models of Leber's congenital amaurosis (LCA) were published in 1996 and a study in dogs published in 2001. In 2008, three groups reported results of clinical trials using adeno-associated virus for LCA. In these studies, an AAV vector encoding the RPE65 gene was delivered via a \\"subretinal injection\\", where a small amount of fluid is injected underneath the retina in a short surgical procedure. Development continued, and in December 2017 the FDA approved Voretigene neparvovec (Luxturna), an adeno-associated virus vector-based gene therapy for children and adults with biallelic RPE65 gene mutations responsible for retinal dystrophy, including Leber congenital amaurosis. People must have viable retinal cells as a prerequisite for the intraocular administration of the drug. =Age-related macular degeneration= Following the successful clinical trials in LCA, researchers have been developing similar treatments using adeno-associated virus for age-related macular degeneration (AMD). To date, efforts have focused on long-term delivery of VEGF inhibitors to treat the wet form of macular degeneration. Whereas wet AMD is currently treated using frequent injections of recombinant protein into the eyeball, the goal of these treatments is long-term disease management following a single administration. One such study is being conducted at the Lions Eye Institute in Australia in collaboration with Avalanche Biotechnologies, a US-based biotechnology start-up. Another early- stage study is sponsored by Genzyme Corporation. =Choroideremia= In October 2011, the first clinical trial was announced for the treatment of choroideremia. Dr. Robert MacLaren of the University of Oxford, who lead the trial, co-developed the treatment with Dr. Miguel Seabra of the Imperial College, London. This Phase 1/2 trial used subretinal AAV to restore the REP gene in affected patients. Initial results of the trial were reported in January 2014 as promising as all six patients had better vision. =Color blindness= Recent research has shown that AAV can successfully restore color vision to treat color blindness in adult monkeys. Although this treatment has not yet entered clinical trials for humans, this work was considered a breakthrough for the ability to target cone photoreceptors. Mechanism =Physiological components in retinal gene therapy= The vertebrate neural retina composed of several layers and distinct cell types (see anatomy of the human retina). A number of these cell types are implicated in retinal diseases, including retinal ganglion cells, which degenerate in glaucoma, the rod and cone photoreceptors, which are responsive to light and degenerate in retinitis pigmentosa, macular degeneration, and other retinal diseases, and the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), which supports the photoreceptors and is also implicated in retinitis pigmentosa and macular degeneration. In retinal gene therapy, AAV is capable of \\"transducing\\" these various cell types by entering the cells and expressing the therapeutic DNA sequence. Since the cells of the retina are non-dividing, AAV continues to persist and provide expression of the therapeutic DNA sequence over a long time period that can last several years. =AAV tropism and routes of administration= AAV is capable of transducing multiple cell types within the retina. AAV serotype 2, the most well-studied type of AAV, is commonly administered in one of two routes: intravitreal or subretinal. Using the intravitreal route, AAV is injected in the vitreous humor of the eye. Using the subretinal route, AAV is injected underneath the retina, taking advantage of the potential space between the photoreceptors and RPE layer, in a short surgical procedure. Although this is more invasive than the intravitreal route, the fluid is absorbed by the RPE and the retina flattens in less than 14 hours without complications. Intravitreal AAV targets retinal ganglion cells and a few Muller glial cells. Subretinal AAV efficiently targets photoreceptors and RPE cells. The reason that different routes of administration lead to different cell types being transfected (e.g., different tropism) is that the inner limiting membrane (ILM) and the various retinal layers act as physical barriers for the delivery of drugs and vectors to the deeper retinal layers. Thus overall, subretinal AAV is 5-10 times more efficient than delivery using the intravitreal route. =Tropism modification and novel AAV vectors= One important factor in gene delivery is developing altered cell tropisms to narrow or broaden rAAV-mediated gene delivery and to increase its efficiency in tissues. Specific properties like capsid conformation, cell targeting strategies can determine which cell types are affected and also the efficiency of the gene transfer process. Different kinds of modification can be undertaken. For example, modification by chemical, immunological or genetic changes that enables the AAV2 capsid to interact with specific cell surface molecules.Gene Therapy Net [online]. 2010 [cited 30 March 2010]; Available from: URL:http://www.asgct.org Initial studies with AAV in the retina have utilized AAV serotype 2. Researchers are now beginning to develop new variants of AAV, based on naturally-occurring AAV serotypes and engineered AAV variants. Several naturally-occurring serotypes of AAV have been isolated that can transduce retinal cells. Following intravitreal injection, only AAV serotypes 2 and 8 were capable of transducing retinal ganglion cells. Occasional Muller cells were transduced by AAV serotypes 2, 8, and 9. Following subretinal injection, serotypes 2, 5, 7, and 8 efficiently transduced photoreceptors, and serotypes 1, 2, 5, 7, 8, and 9 efficiently transduce RPE cells. One example of an engineered variant has recently been described that efficiently transduces Muller glia following intravitreal injection, and has been used to rescue an animal model of aggressive, autosomal-dominant retinitis pigmentosa. =AAV and immune privilege in the retina= Importantly, the retina is immune-privileged, and thus does not experience a significant inflammation or immune-response when AAV is injected. Immune response to gene therapy vectors is what has caused previous attempts at gene therapy to fail, and is considered a key advantage of gene therapy in the eye. Re-administration has been successful in large animals, indicating that no long-lasting immune response is mounted. Recent data indicates that the subretinal route may be subject to a greater degree of immune privilege compared to the intravitreal route. =Promoter sequence= Expression in various retinal cell types can be determined by the promoter sequence. In order to restrict expression to a specific cell type, a tissue-specific or cell-type specific promoter can be used. For example, in rats the murine rhodopsin gene drive the expression in AAV2, GFP reporter product was found only in rat photoreceptors, not in any other retinal cell type or in the adjacent RPE after subretinal injection. On the other hand, if ubiquitously expressed immediate-early cytomegalovirus (CMV) enhancer-promoter is expressed in a wide variety of transfected cell types. Other ubiquitous promoters such as the CBA promoter, a fusion of the chicken-actin promoter and CMV immediate- early enhancer, allows stable GFP reporter expression in both RPE and photoreceptor cells after subretinal injections. =Modulation of expression= Sometimes modulation of transgene expression may be necessary since strong constitutive expression of a therapeutic gene in retinal tissues could be deleterious for long-term retinal function. Different methods have been utilized for the expression modulation. One way is using exogenously regulatable promoter system in AAV vectors. For example, the tetracycline- inducible expression system uses a silencer/transactivator AAV2 vector and a separate inducible doxycycline-responsive coinjection. When induction occurs by oral doxycycline, this system shows tight regulation of gene expression in both photoreceptor and RPE cells. =Examples and animal models= Targeting RPE One study that was done by Royal College of Surgeons (RCS) in rat model shows that a recessive mutation in a receptor tyrposine kinase gene, mertk results in a premature stop codon and impaired phagocytosis function by RPE cells. This mutation causes the accumulation of outer segment debris in the subretinal space, which causes photoreceptor cell death. The model organism with this disease received a subretinal injection of AAV serotype 2 carrying a mouse Mertk cDNA under the control of either the CMV or RPE65 promoters. This treatment was found to prolong photoreceptor cell survival for several months and also the number of photoreceptor was 2.5 fold higher in AAV-Mertk- treated eyes compared with controls 9 weeks after injection, also they found decreased amount of debris in the subretinal space. The protein RPE65 is used in the retinoid cycle where the all-trans-retinol within the rod outer segment is isomerized to its 11-cis form and oxidized to 11-cis retinal before it goes back to the photoreceptor and joins with opsin molecule to form functional rhodopsin. In animal knockout model (RPE65-/-), gene transfer experiment shows that early intraocular delivery of human RPE65 vector on embryonic day 14 shows efficient transduction of retinal pigment epithelium in the RPE65-/- knockout mice and rescues visual functions. This shows successful gene therapy can be attributed to early intraocular deliver to the diseased animal. Targeting of photoreceptors Juvenile retinoschisis is a disease that affects the nerve tissue in the eye. This disease is an X-linked recessive degenerative disease of the central macula region, and it is caused by mutation in the RSI gene encoding the protein retinoschisin. Retinoschisin is produced in the photoreceptor and bipolar cells and it is critical in maintaining the synaptic integrity of the retina. Specifically the AAV 5 vector containing the wild-type human RSI cDNA driven by a mouse opsin promoter showed long-term retinal functional and structural recovery. Also the retinal structural reliability improved greatly after the treatment, characterized by an increase in the outer nuclear layer thickness. Retinitis pigmentosa Retinitis pigmentosa is an inherited disease which leads to progressive night blindness and loss of peripheral vision as a result of photoreceptor cell death. Most people who suffer from RP are born with rod cells that are either dead or dysfunctional, so they are effectively blind at nighttime, since these are the cells responsible for vision in low levels of light. What follows often is the death of cone cells, responsible for color vision and acuity, at light levels present during the day. Loss of cones leads to full blindness as early as five years old, but may not onset until many years later. There have been multiple hypotheses about how the lack of rod cells can lead to the death of cone cells. Pinpointing a mechanism for RP is difficult because there are more than 39 genetic loci and genes correlated with this disease. In an effort to find the cause of RP, there have been different gene therapy techniques applied to address each of the hypotheses. Different types of inheritance can attribute to this disease; autosomal recessive, autosomal dominant, X-linked type, etc. The main function of rhodopsin is initiating the phototransduction cascade. The opsin proteins are made in the photoreceptor inner segments, then transported to the outer segment, and eventually phagocytized by the RPE cells. When mutations occur in the rhodopsin the directional protein movement is affected because the mutations can affect protein folding, stability, and intracellular trafficking. One approach is introducing AAV-delivered ribozymes designed to target and destroy a mutant mRNA. The way this system operates was shown in animal model that have a mutant rhodopsin gene. The injected AAV-ribozymes were optimized in vitro and used to cleave the mutant mRNA transcript of P23H (where most mutation occur) in vivo. Another mutation in the rhodopsin structural protein, specifically peripherin 2 which is a membrane glycoprotein involved in the formation of photoreceptor outersegment disk, can lead to recessive RP and macular degeneration in human (19). In a mouse experiment, AAV2 carrying a wild-type peripherin 2 gene driven by a rhodopsin promoter was delivered to the mice by subretinal injection. The result showed improvement in photoreceptor structure and function which was detected by ERG (electroretinogram). The result showed improvement of photoreceptor structure and function which was detected by ERG. Also peripherin 2 was detected at the outer segment layer of the retina 2 weeks after injection and therapeutic effects were noted as soon as 3 weeks after injection. A well-defined outer segment containing both peripherin2 and rhodopsin was present 9-month after injection. Since apoptosis can be the cause of photoreceptor death in most of the retinal dystrophies. It has been known that survival factors and antiapoptoic reagents can be an alternative treatment if the mutation is unknown for gene replacement therapy. Some scientists have experimented with treating this issue by injecting substitute trophic factors into the eye. One group of researchers injected the rod derived cone viability factor (RdCVF) protein (encoded for by the Nxnl1 (Txnl6) gene) into the eye of the most commonly occurring dominant RP mutation rat models. This treatment demonstrated success in promoting the survival of cone activity, but the treatment served even more significantly to prevent progression of the disease by increasing the actual function of the cones. Experiments were also carried out to study whether supplying AAV2 vectors with cDNA for glial cell line- derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) can have an anti-apoptosis effect on the rod cells. In looking at an animal model, the opsin transgene contains a truncated protein lacking the last 15 amino acids of the C terminus, which causes alteration in rhodopsin transport to the outer segment and leads to retinal degeneration. When the AAV2-CBA-GDNF vector is administered to the subretinal space, photoreceptor stabilized and rod photoreceptors increased and this was seen in the improved function of the ERG analysis. Successful experiments in animals have also been carried out using ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), and CNTF is currently being used as a treatment in human clinical trials. AAV-based treatment for retinal neovascular diseases Ocular neovascularization (NV) is the abnormal formation of new capillaries from already existing blood vessels in the eye, and this is a characteristics for ocular diseases such as diabetic retinopathy (DR), retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) and (wet form) age-related macular degeneration (AMD). One of the main players in these diseases is VEGF (Vascular endothelial growth factor) which is known to induce vessel leakage and which is also known to be angiogenic. In normal tissues VEGF stimulates endothelial cell proliferation in a dose dependent manner, but such activity is lost with other angiogenic factors. Many angiostatic factors have been shown to counteract the effect of increasing local VEGF. The naturally occurring form of soluble Flt-1 has been shown to reverse neovascularization in rats, mice, and monkeys. Pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF) also acts as an inhibitor of angiogenesis. The secretion of PEDF is noticeably decreased under hypoxic conditions allowing the endothelial mitogenic activity of VEGF to dominate, suggesting that the loss of PEDF plays a central role in the development of ischemia- driven NV. One clinical finding shows that the levels of PEDF in aqueous humor of human are decreased with increasing age, indicating that the reduction may lead to the development of AMD. In animal model, an AAV with human PEDF cDNA under the control of the CMV promoter prevented choroidal and retinal NV ( 24). The finding suggests that the AAV-mediated expression of angiostatic factors can be implemented to treat NV. This approach could be useful as an alternative to frequent injections of recombinant protein into the eye. In addition, PEDF and sFlt-1 may be able to diffuse through sclera tissue, allowing for the potential to be relatively independent of the intraocular site of administration.

Levalle crossing La Pampa c.1879 He was born in Buenos Aires, the son of Tom√°s Canaverys and Macedonia Castillo, belonging to a patrician family of Irish and Creole roots. He did his primary and secondary studies in the city, and began his military career as second lieutenant in the 8th Infantry Battalion, to the orders of Lieutenant colonel Tomas Elliot in 1873. He participating in the end of the Campaign against Ricardo L√≥pez Jord√°n in Entre R√≠os. Later he served in the military Garrison of Mercedes, province of Buenos Aires. He was discharged from the army for personal reasons in 1875. He was reincorporated into the ranks of the army in 1876, serving in the Fuerte General Lavalle (current General Pinto) and Puan. In 1877, with the rank of first lieutenant, he served in the 1st Line Regiment, under orders of Colonels Teodoro Garc√≠a, Nicol√°s Levalle and General Julio Argentino Roca. During the military expeditions he participated in the assault on the tribes of Catriel in \\"Treyco Grande\\" (La Pampa), and in the operations against the tribe of Namuncura in Chilo√© (La Pampa). Later he took part in the Battle of Hucal Grande against the tribes of Ca√±umil and Huenchuquil (occurred in 1878). Lieutenant Canavery took part in the military actions of December 6 and 7, 1878, in which the Argentine Army confronted the tribe of Namuncura in Lihu√© Calel. In 1879 he provide services in the garrison of Choele Choel and participates in the actions commanded by Gral. Roca, on the banks of the R√≠o Negro. That same year he fell ill from a gallbladder condition, being cured by a female healer who had also attended General Teodoro Garc√≠a in Puan. He maintained a respectful deal with Aboriginal leaders who participated in the Conquest of the Desert, and also with the main Caciques who fought against the Army troops during the Military Campaigns. According to some historians, Canavery would have been honored by chief Catriel with a poncho. After finishing his services in the Argentine south, √Ångel Canavery returned to Buenos Aires, being promoted to captain on April 1, 1880. A year later he served in Salta to the orders of Colonel Garc√≠a, until June 5, 1882. That same year Canavery provides services in the Infantry Inspection, being promoted to major in 1886, and appointed as Military attach√© from Italy in 1889. Returning to Argentina a year later, he was promoted to lieutenant colonel in August 1890, serving in the Estado Mayor del Ej√©rcito. Between 1892 and 1895, Canavery was in charge of the military detachment of Santa Catalina and served as commander of the detachments of C√≥rdoba and San Luis until 1900. In 1896, he went on to serve in the Plana Mayor Activa. He also intervened in civil-military conflicts in Argentina, including the Revolution of 1880 and Revolution of the Park, taking part in the main actions against the revolutionary troops. He was appointed Jefe of Detall in charge of the office of the 1st. Argentine Army Corps in 1897 by decree of the then President Jos√© Evaristo Uriburu. Until the middle of the 19th century the troops of the Argentine army had used sabers and spears, and rifles of a single shot. In 1879, the officers and soldiers of the army were equipped with modern weapons that included Remington rifles, Carbines and Lefaucheux pistols, used by Canavery during his military career. He was a colleague of distinguished Argentine officers with whom he participated in various military campaigns, including Carlos O'Donnell, Carlos Smith, Francisco Smith, Lorenzo Tock and Augusto Rouquaud. In 1902, he attended the funeral of Juan de Dios Rawson, a lieutenant colonel who participated in the Paraguayan War. He retired from the army with the rank of lieutenant colonel in 1905. He was a member of the Club del Progreso, the first gentlemen's club in South America.

His wife was in charge of the Sociedad Protectora de Hu√©rfanos de Militares (Society of Military Orphans), a charitable association founded on July 12, 1891. Garde imp√©riale fran√ßaise. He had several brothers including, the Colonel Tom√°s Canavery, a hero of the Battle of Lomas Valentinas during the Paraguayan War. His nephew was General Enrique Mosconi Canavery, who served as director of the Yacimientos Petrol√≠feros Fiscales between 1922 and 1930. A great-granddaughter of his sister Juana Mar√≠a Canavery, was related to a descendant of Luis Vernet, governor of the Islas Malvinas in 1830. A large part of Angel Canavery's relatives served in the ranks of the army, taking part during the English invasions, the War of Independence, the Argentine and Uruguayan Civil War and the Military Expeditions against the indigenous incursions. His paternal grandfather Mariano Canaverys, whose father (Juan Canaverys) participated in the May Revolution, was a teacher who served as lieutenant of the 1st squadron of Hussars of Pueyrred√≥n, having an active participation in the defense of Buenos Aires during the English invasions. Outside of Argentina in North Italy and South France there are some records about members of the Canavery family associated with military campaigns, including the services rendered to the French Army during the Napoleonic period by Joseph Canavery, born in Stura, Piedmont, who served as a rifleman of the Battalion V√©lites of Turin. He attended numerous meetings of the local aristocracy, including the held in the Circulo Militar in honor to General Jos√© Ignacio Garmendia. Canavery and his wife did not have children, but were the godfathers of baptism of Carmen Canaveri, daughter of Saturnino Canaveri and Carmen Canavery. √Ångel Mateo Canavery was authorized to travel to Europe in 1906, possibly heading to Marseille or Genoa.

He served in the Legislative Assembly of Alberta from 1952 to 1971 as a member of the Social Credit caucus in government. Reierson held numerous portfolios in the governments of Premier Ernest Manning and Harry Strom from 1955 to 1971. He was born in Edberg in 1919, the son of Reier and Bertha C. (n√©e Sorensen) Reierson. Political career Reierson first ran for the Alberta Legislature as the Social Credit candidate in the electoral district of St. Paul in the 1952 general election. He narrowly defeated Liberal candidate Laval Fortier to hold the seat for his party. In the 1955 general election Reierson defeated Liberal candidate J.R. Sweeney with over half the popular vote. On August 2, 1955, Premier Ernest Manning appointed Reierson Minister of Industries and Labour. He was re-elected in the 1959 Alberta election with a very solid majority. On September 1, 1959, Premier Manning changed Reierson's portfolio to Labour. He was re-elected in the 1963 general election with over half the popular vote in his district. Reierson was re-elected in the 1967 general election in a race against three other candidates. After the election Premier Manning gave Reierson a second portfolio, the Minister of Education, in addition to the Labour portfolio. A year later Reierson entered the 1968 leadership contest. He finished third on the first ballot and withdrew from the race. On December 12, 1968, Harry Strom, the new premier, retained Reierson in the Labour portfolio and added the Telephones portfolio to Reierson's responsibilities. In 1970, as Minister of Telephones, Reierson lobbied the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission to give Alberta Government Telephones exclusive control of distributing television content from the United States. He believed his plan would lower subscriber costs from $6 a month at the time to $1 a month and allow the best content from the three US networks in operation at the time. This was in response to new CRTC rules that only allowed cable providers to carry one US Commercial station. Reierson was defeated in the 1971 general election by Progressive Conservative candidate Mick Fluker.

It was released on October 8, 2010, after sneak previews in 811 theaters on October 2, 2010. Plot Holly Berenson is the owner of a small Atlanta bakery, and Eric Messer is a promising television technical sports director for the Atlanta Hawks. Their best friends, Peter and Alison, set them up on a blind date that goes horribly wrong, and results in both hating each other with a passion. As the years go by, Peter and Alison get married, have a baby girl named Sophie, and select Holly and Ericwho teasingly tolerate each otheras the godparents. Shortly after Sophie's first birthday, Peter and Alison are killed in a car crash. Holly and Eric learn that their friends named them Sophie's joint guardians. After finding that none of Peter and Allison's relatives are fit to take care of Sophie, Holly and Eric put their differences aside and move into Sophie's home. Living together proves to be a struggle. One night, Holly is away at an important catering job when Eric is given the opportunity to direct a big basketball game. Eric takes Sophie with him, but her crying distracts him, leading to him making a big mistake on the broadcast. When they get home, Eric and Holly argue, but later they make up. Holly goes on a date with Sam, Sophie's pediatrician. The date is cut short when Eric calls to tell Sam that Sophie has a high fever. When they join him at the hospital, Eric sees Holly kiss Sam. Over time, the guardians discover that raising a child is more expensive than they had expected, and Holly can no longer afford to expand her business. Eric helps by investing in her company, and they cement the new relationship by going on a date, which ends with them having sex, while developing strong feelings. Their Child Protective Services caseworker, Janine, tells them they must make a firm commitment either to stay together, or break up, as waffling in between would be bad for Sophie. Eric is offered his dream job with the Phoenix Suns, and doesn't discuss it with Holly. When she finds out, she tells him to take the job, accusing him of looking for a way out of raising Sophie. At Thanksgiving break, Eric returns from Phoenix for a visit, hoping to patch things up with Holly. She invites him to a dinner that she and Sam are hosting for neighbors and friends. Eric and Holly argue when he learns she is planning to sell the house soon, as the upkeep is too costly. Holly accuses Eric of deserting her and Sophie, while Eric points out how quickly she replaced him. Eric tells her he loves her, but leaves the dinner, planning to return to Phoenix. Once alone with Holly, Sam says that if he and his ex-wife had fought in the way that Eric and Holly did, they would still be together. He tells Holly to work out her feelings for Eric, and leaves. That night, Sophie calls Holly \\"Mama\\" for the first time. Janine visits to make her final determination whether Holly and Eric are fit parents. Holly realizes that she can't take care of Sophie without Eric, and that she loves him. She, Sophie and Janine rush to the airport, but on reaching the gate, finds that Eric's flight has departed. She returns to the house, where she finds him sitting inside. He tells her he has realized that Peter and Alison chose them to be Sophie's guardians because, together, they are a loving family. A few months later, they host Sophie's second birthday party, with all the neighbors and friends in attendance. Holly has made a second cake with the number 1 on it, telling Eric \\"It's for us, 'cause we made it a year.\\" They kiss, then the guests sing 'Happy Birthday' to Sophie.

The Langendorff heart or isolated perfused heart assay is an ex vivo technique used in pharmacological and physiological research using animals and also humans. It allows the examination of cardiac contractile strength and heart rate without the complications of an intact animal or human.Bell, R., Mocanu, M. & Yellon, D. Retrograde heart perfusion: The Langendorff technique of isolated heart perfusion. Journal of Molecular and Cellular Cardiology 50, 940-950 (2011). After 90 years this method is still being used. Method In the Langendorff preparation, the heart is removed from the animal's or human's body, severing the blood vessels; it is then perfused in a reverse fashion (retrograde perfusion) via the aorta, usually with a nutrient rich, oxygenated solution (e.g. Krebs‚ÄìHenseleit solution or Tyrode's solution). The backwards pressure causes the aortic valve to shut, forcing the solution into the coronary vessels, which normally supply the heart tissue with blood. This feeds nutrients and oxygen to the cardiac muscle, allowing it to continue beating for several hours after its removal from the animal or human. This is a useful preparation because it allows the addition of drugs (via the perfusate) and observation of their effect on the heart without the complications involved with in vivo experimentation, such as neuronal and hormonal effects from living animal or human.The Langendorff heart preparation‚ÄîReappraisal of its role as a research and teaching model for coronary vasoactive drugs, K.J.

He was the grandson of Dr. Sylvester Gardiner, the founder of Gardiner, Maine, and a trustee for the Gardiner Lyceum school. He was instrumental in the growth of the city of Gardiner. Background Robert Hallowell Gardiner was born to loyalist parents in England in 1782. He inherited his grandfather's estate in 1787; the previous inheritor had been Gardiner's son William, who had received the estate in 1786 but who died suddenly a year later. Robert Hallowell, who was only five years old at the time, took on the name of Gardiner. He graduated from Harvard College and moved to Kennebec in 1803 to manage the land he had inherited. =To Gardiner= When Robert Hallowell Gardiner moved to Gardiner in 1801, there were about 650 persons there, of whom 60 were squatters. Only two houses stood on Church Hill, and no carriage road led out of town in any direction. A one- mile stretch of dirt road did exist, however, from the river to New Mills. The name New Mills originated when the first mill built at the location decayed and was taken down, and was then replaced by a new mill. Today, a bridge near the spot is called the New Mills Bridge. =Development= Gardiner proceeded to repair the dams and mills. He settled property titles with the squatters liberally, and offered generous inducements for manufacturers to settle in the area. Since there were only a few stores in existence then, and many people were obliged to visit a neighboring settlement to trade, Gardiner built additional stores. He also had the land accurately surveyed. He endowed, and laid the cornerstone of, Christ Church; the building is one of the state's most beautiful granite structures. Gardiner worked to free his land of legal entanglements and squatters, and, in the summer of 1804, he built a church, an inn, a mill, and a wharf in the village, which became known as Gardiner. He was the town's first mayor. He died in 1864.

Akister was born in Brighton in England, and was educated at Staveley Public School and Windermere Grammar School in Westmorland, and Salford Technical College. Trained as an electrical fitter and electrical draughtsman, he worked for the Metropolitan-Vickers company from 1954 to 1959, when he began national service as a private in the 1st Battalion of the Lancashire Regiment. He returned to Vickers in 1961. He migrated to Australia in 1963, becoming a draughtsman at A.E.I. Pty Ltd in 1963. He married Brenda Ann Pye on 18 December 1965 in Sydney and moved to Cooma as senior draughtsman with the Snowy Mountains Authority in 1966. He joined the Labor Party in 1969 and served as secretary of the [Cooma] branch, New South Wales from 1970 to 1976. In 1974, Akister was selected as the Labor candidate for the marginal Liberal Party seat of Electoral district of Monaro in the New South Wales Legislative Assembly. Sitting MP Steve Mauger had resigned before the election, leaving the seat vacant, and Akister was narrowly elected in a three-cornered contest with the Liberal and Country parties. In 1984, he became Minister for Corrective Services, as well as holding junior ministries on Rural Matters and assisting the Agriculture Minister. In 1986 he was given additional responsibility as Assistant Minister for Transport. However, in 1988 the Unsworth Government was defeated at the polls, and Akister was one of the members who lost his seat (to National Party candidate Peter Cochran). He became a businessman after leaving politics.

The protoconch is glossy, domed, white on the early whorls, tawny later. The spire is conical with a deep-set suture. Distribution The Amoria damonii complex includes four large, evidently correlated populations of Amoria, whose distribution extends from Cape Leeuwin (S.W. Australia) to the northern east coast of Queensland,Atlas of Living AustraliaDiscover LifeWMSD . Worldwide Mollusc Data Base i.e. for more than 6,500 km of coastline. Such a large range, rare in Volutidae, is even more unusual for an Amoria. This long stretch of coastline implies genetic differentiation and favours polytypism, giving rise to many taxonomic problems.

The spire is short with 6 1/2 whorls, including the protoconch. The suture is well defined on the later whorls and becomes strongly channeled at the aperture. The outer lip is anteriorly expanded. The edge of the shell is acute. The body whorl is somewhat inflated at the upper portion. The columella bears three ascending plates.JH Gatliff, Description of Voluta (Amoria) spenceriana sp. n. from North Queensland; The Victorian naturalist v.25 (1908-1909), p. 84-85 Distribution This marine species occurs off Queensland, Australia.

The snail's shell is commonly collected in the sea shell trade, which has resulted in overharvesting of the snail. Taxonomy and naming The snail is a member of the phylum Mollusca, the class Gastropoda, the family Volutidae, and the genus Cymbiola. It was first discovered in 1786.National Parks Board, Singapore Government Subspecies * Cymbiola (Cymbiola) nobilis nobilis (Lightfoot, 1786) * Cymbiola (Cymbiola) nobilis tamariskae Sutanto & Patamakanthin, 2004 Distribution Cymbiola nobilis is widespread in Asia from Taiwan to Vietnam, peninsular Malaysia, Indonesia, Singapore and Philippines.Claudio Galli: WMSDB - Worldwide Mollusc Species Data BaseSealife Base Description shell of Cymbiola nobilis Shells of Cymbiola nobilis can reach a length of , with an average size of six centimeters. Females tend to be larger than the males. These fairy large, thick and heavy shells are glossy, with plaits on the columella. They have a wide variety of patterns.Beechey, Des. \\"Family Volutidae Australian Museum The shell colour may be beige, orange or yellow with a zig-zag red or brown pattern. Sometimes these shalls are completely black. The fleshy body of the snail is black with bright yellow or orange spots. Pigment producing cells infect nearby cells so that they also produce pigment. Cells that are infected once become immune to producing pigment again. As a result, the coloring of the snail's shell forms the characteristic pattern. Biolib Habitat This species lives in a marine environment and can be found on sandy reef flats and sandy areas near coral rubble and seagrasses.Wild Singapore Populations of Cymbiola nobilis are present in small and isolated areas and are often close by, but separated by geographic barriers such as water channels. Each separate range has its own shell form and color pattern. Conservation Status The snail is considered vulnerable. The number of Cymbiola nobilis has been greatly reduced by reef destruction and collection as food and for the marine curio and shell trade. The snail was once commonly found in reefs around Singapore, but they have become much scarcer. The government of Singapore has stated that laws are needed to restrict the collection of wildlife fauna such as Cymbiola nobilis. Behavior =Reproduction= The snails are to a certain extent hermaphrodites, but separate sexes exist, and the snails reproduce through sexual reproduction. The female is fertilized by the male internally, and the female responds by depositing fertilized eggs. The egg capsules laid by the female contain multiple embryos. It takes about seven days for the eggs to hatch into larvae. Embryos develop into free-swimming planktonic marine larvae (trocophore) and later into juvenile veligers. Altogether, the snail goes through eight stages of development before becoming a full-fledged snail. =Diet= The C. nobilis is carnivorous, and preys on small animals such as bivalves, other mollusks and echinoderms.

For these actions, he was awarded the Medal of Honor several decades later, on April 9, 1898. Weston was mustered out of the Union Army volunteer service on August 21, 1865. After the war, Weston started the study of law but gave it up in favor of rejoining the army. On August 9, 1867, Weston was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the 7th U.S. Cavalry Regiment of the regular U.S. Army. He was promoted to first lieutenant on November 27, 1868. He was promoted to captain and commissary of subsistence on November 24, 1875.This resulted in Weston becoming a staff officer in the commissary department and no longer with the 7th U.S. Cavalry when most of the regiment's troopers were engaged in the Battle of the Little Bighorn on June 25‚Äì26, 1876. On August 1, 1892, Weston was promoted to major and commissary of subsistence. On November 17, 1897, Weston was promoted to lieutenant colonel and assistant commissary general.

It was first listed on the National Register of Historic Places on January 1, 1976 following renovations. In 1984 a boundary increase was also listed on the National Register. In 1998 the house was moved about 300 feet to the southwest due to an expansion of the shopping mall. On July 27, 2000 the house was re-listed on the National Register, even though it remains listed on the Register at its old address. Note: This includes Former location of the house, about 300 feet northeast of the current site. The land in the area of the house was first sold by William Penn to Welch Quaker Richard Thomas in 1683 as part of the Welsh Tract. Thomas's son, also named Richard, claimed the land in two stages, 1704 and 1717. He sold the land to English Quaker John Morgan in 1718, and Morgan sold the land to English Quaker William Owen in 1734. Owen built the house in 1750 and sold land and the house to Quaker James Brown in 1760. Morritz (or Morris) Zug bought the farm and house in 1770. Morritz Zug later anglicized his name to Zook. He and his family were founding members of the Great Valley Ominist (Amish) Society. The house was added to in 1800, and 1820. During the 1998 move, a new foundation was laid and the 1750 basement was lost. Six generations of the Zook family lived in the house until 1970.

Whorls are smooth and rounded, with axial growth lines and weak spiral grooves on the top of the body whorl. Columella shows four plaits and the outer lip is smooth and flared outwards. The background colour is yellowish-brown or cream, while the inner edge of outer lip may be white or orange. Body whorl usually has two wide spiral bands of axial zigzag brown lines, but this pattern is variable.Des Beechey Sea Shells of NSW The distinctive patterns on the shell are produced by a process analogous to a linear cellular automaton and can accordingly resemble fractal shapes like the Sierpinski gasket.

Born to a Naval officer and flight attendant in Athens, Greece, Suzi is the eldest of four children. She has two brothers and a sister. In 1984, she won the title Miss District of Columbia Teen USA. She appeared in a Michael Jackson Pepsi commercial, and films such as St. Elmo's Fire and Men at Work. She was chosen as Playboy's Playmate of the Month for January, 1992 and has appeared in Playboy videos. February Tanya Michelle Beyer (born June 4, 1971 in St. Paul, Minnesota) is an American model and actress.

The purposes of counter-protests can range from merely voicing opposition to the objective of the other protest to actively drawing attention from nearby media outlets away from the other protest toward the counter-protestors' cause to actively seeking to disrupt the other protest by conflict of a non-violent or violent nature. In many countries where protests by various pressure groups are allowed, the nearby law enforcement installation may make it a priority to keep rival protestors as far from each other as to avoid possible physical contact, and legal contention often arises over whether the rival groups possess permits to gather and rally within short distance of each other. Often, rallies can be infiltrated by rival protestors for purposes ranging from distraction, disruption to merely asking critical questions of the leaders of the rally or providing humorous or mocking diversions; the reactions of protestors to counter-protestors within close proximity can often be violent and confrontational. In some countries, governments can even sponsor counter-protesters who rally against opposition figures and members. By country =Cuba= In Cuba, the various state-run organizations can organize violent pro-government rallies known as \\"mitines de repudio\\" (repudiation meetings, often sponsored by the CDR) against groups such as Ladies in White and help in loading the opposition members into police buses directed to a nearby jail.Cuba arrests Ladies in White, Christian Science Monitor =United Kingdom= Since World War II, protests by allegedly fascist, racist or counter-religious organizations have often been met by anti-racist or anti-fascist groups, many of which are aligned with the Labour Party. Counter-protest activity has been ramped up against anti-Islamist or anti-Muslim organizations since the September 11 attacks in the United States. =United States= Counter-antiwar protests Since the announcement of the impending invasion on Iraq in 2003, anti-war protests were met with counter-protests by pro-war and socially-conservative groups such as Protest Warrior. Counter-healthcare reform protests After Barack Obama launched an initiative for healthcare reform, protests against government and Congress members by Tea Party members at townhall meetings were met with counter-protests by progressive/liberal activists and pro-labor unionists. Counter-protests against the Westboro Baptist Church The Westboro Baptist Church, which achieved notoriety for protesting homosexuality at various locations and events at which they were not invited, have been met with various counter-protests, including participation from high school and college students when the church members arrived to protest at their campuses.
