The event was not very well documented, but historians knew also that despite occasional setbacks, which likely forced the Lithuanian state and its neighbors the Yotvingians to become client states of Mongols for a short period, the Lithuanians were able to take control of a number of formerly Mongol territories in the long run. Lithuanian‚ÄìMongol conflict The Lithuanians first made contact with the Mongols around 1237‚Äì1240, though for the next decade or two the Mongols did not consider Lithuanian-held territories a priority. The first major incursion of Mongols from the Golden Horde under Burundai on the Lithuanian territories took place in winter of 1258. It was likely a reaction to Lithuanian incursions into Mongol-held territories. After raiding Lithuania and the Yotvingians, the next year, two tumens (20,000 men), under the leadership of Berke, attacked Poland (in what is known as the second Mongol invasion of Poland).Stanis≈Çaw Krakowski, Polska w walce z najazdami tatarskimi w XIII wieku, MON, 1956, pp. 181-201 The Mongol invasion of Lithuania in the years 1258‚Äì1259 is generally seen as a Mongol victory, as Lithuanian territories have been described as \\"devastated\\" following the Mongol incursion, in what was \\"possibly the most horrible event of the thirteenth century\\" for Lithuania. In the immediate aftermath of this invasion, Lithuania might have become a tributary or protectorate and ally to the Horde for several years or decades. A similar fate was likely met by the Lithuanians' neighbours, the Yotvingians. Some Lithuanian or Yotvingian warriors likely participated in the Mongol invasion of Poland in 1259, though there are no historical documents to clarify whether they did so with their leaders' permission, or as free mercenaries, or as forced troops. Nonetheless, the invasion did not have major or lasting consequences for Lithuania, particularly as it was not directly incorporated into the Mongol Empire, nor subject to Mongol darughachi administration. Lithuanian defeat did however weaken the power of Lithuanian king Mindaugas who was eventually assassinated in 1263, which also marked the end of the short-lived, Christian Kingdom of Lithuania. The temporary shifting of the allegiance of its successor, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, toward Mongols, or at least, away from the Christian Europe, was also a short-term victory for the Mongols. Legacy Mongols raided Lithuania again in 1275, 1279, and 1325. Overall, the Mongols did not make any major effort to conquer Lithuania. In time, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania became a rival to the Golden Horde, temporarily taking over some of the former Kievan Rus' territories controlled by the Mongols as the Horde became weakened in the 13th and 14th centuries, though it lacked manpower to threaten Mongol territories outside of northeastern Europe.

She is the first person in Russia to have a criminal case brought against her on charges of participating in an \\"undesirable\\" organisation under Russian Federation law. As of 8 April 2019, she remains under investigation. She is recognised as a political prisoner and a prisoner of conscience.  Biography  Anastasia Shevchenko's father, Nugzari Sukhitashvili, served in the military and her mother, Tamara Gryaznova, taught Russian language and literature. Shevchenko was born in the village of Dzhida in the Dzhidinsky district of Buryatia. She met her future husband, Alexander Shevchenko in Jida and graduated from the Irkutsk State Linguistic University with the highest award. She and her family moved to the village of Egorlykskaya in the Rostov region after her eldest daughter, Alina, was born. Her second daughter, Vlada, and son, Misha, were born there. Shevchenko started to work for the local news as a journalist and was a member of the Communist Party of the Russian Federation for some time. On 5 November 2010, during the massacre in the village of Kuschevskaya, Shevchenko's friend Vladimir Mironenko and his family were brutally murdered. After her son was born, Shevchenko left with her husband and got involved in civil activism. Over the years, Shevchenko worked as the head of the television broadcasting department for MUP RT Zarya and as the senior inspector of the organisational and territorial division of the Election Commission for the Rostov region. From 2017 to February 2018, she was the coordinator of the Rostov branch of the Open Russia Movement. During the presidential elections in 2018, Anastasia Shevchenko headed the regional headquarters of Ksenia Sobchak's campaign and headed the regional branch of the Civil Initiative Party. Shevchenko was elected to the Federal Council of the Open Russia Movement at the Movement's annual conference on 25 March 2018. In January 2018, Anastasia Shevchenko was detained for putting up election ads in support of Sobchak. In June 2018, she became one of the authors and activist campaigning against the pension reform which was entitled \\"They‚Äôve stolen everything but our underpants\\".  Criminal case  On 26 April 2017, the Prosecutor General's Office of Russia recognized the following organisations as \\"undesirable\\": Open Russia, the Open Russia Civic Movement (registered in the UK), the Institute of Modern Russia (headed by Mikhail Khodorkovsky's son Pavel in the US). According to the authorities, all three organizations were involved in the implementation of \\"special programs and projects aimed at discrediting the results of the Russian elections, at seeing the results thereof recognised illegitimate\\" and \\"encouraging protest speeches and destabilizing the domestic political situation, which poses a threat to the foundations of the constitutional structure of the Russian Federation and the security of the state\\". In May of the same year, the Russian Ministry of Justice told reporters at a press briefing that the work of the Russian Open Russia Movement will not be conflated with the work of the British organisations that had been recognised as \\"undesirable\\". In January 2019, the authorities conducted searches against Open Russia activists in Pskov, Kazan, Rostov-on-Don, and Ulyanovsk. On 21 January they searched Anastasia Shevchenko's house. She was detained shortly afterwards. Shevchenko was kept in a pre-trial detention facility for 48 hours until her court hearing. On 23 January she was placed under house arrest by the Leninsky District Court of Rostov-on-Don. On 29 January, the Rostov Regional Court upheld the lower court's decision to place her under house arrest. On 31 January, Shevchenko's eldest daughter, Alina, died in Zverev City Hospital. She was taken into the intensive care unit two days earlier and the investigator only allowed Shevchenko to visit her a few hours before she passed away. On 1 February, Dmitry Peskov, press secretary to President Vladimir Putin, expressed his condolences at the death of Shevchenko's daughter. On 24 January Human Rights Watch condemned persecution of Shevchenko and violation of her right to freedom of expression and association.https://www.hrw.org/news/2019/01/24/russia-first-criminal-case- under-undesirables-law=Russia: First Criminal Case under ‚ÄòUndesirables‚Äô Law On 25 January Amnesty International recognized Shevchenko as a prisoner of conscience. On 7 February, members of the Presidential Human Rights Council (HRC) and a number of human rights defenders came out in support of Anastasia Shevchenko and Vyacheslav Egorov. On the same day, the US Mission to the OSCE expressed concerns over her prosecution. On 8 February, the Memorial Human Rights Center, Russia's oldest human rights organization, recognized Anastasia Shevchenko as a victim of political persecution and a political prisoner. On 21 February, 12 human rights organisations signed a statement calling for the release of Anastasia Shevchenko as well as other political prisoners in Russia. Two US senators also published a statement condemning the Kremlin's persecution of Anastasia Shevchenko. On 15 March, the Leninsky District Court of Rostov-on-Don extended Shevchenko's house arrest until 17 June 2019. The court also rejected the appeals made by Shevchenko's defense to soften the terms of her house arrest. Rallies in support of Shevchenko On 1 February, protests began in support of Anastasia Shevchenko. The first demonstration took place in Rostov-on-Don. On 10 February a series of rallies in support of Shevchenko took place under the banner \\"Mothers' Fury\\" in Moscow, St. Petersburg, Yekaterinburg, Kazan, Yaroslavl, Ivanovo and Tambov and protestors in Moscow and St Petersburg were arrested. On 24 February, during a march in Moscow in memory of Boris Nemtsov a separate column developed that demanded an end to the criminal prosecution of civil and political activists, including Anastasia Shevchenko. On 31 March 2019, the Open Russia Conference put out a statement demanding an end to the criminal prosecution of Anastasia Shevchenko. On the same day, the Movement announced its liquidation to protect its activists from criminal prosecution.

She was born in the Aisin Gioro clan, the imperial clan of the Qing dynasty. She is the younger daughter of Pujie, the younger brother of Puyi, the last emperor of China, and her mother was Hiro Saga, a Japanese noblewoman. Biography She was born Aisin-Gioro Husheng at Juntendo University Hospital in Tokyo, Japan on 13 March 1940 to Pujie and Hiro Saga. Her elder sister was Huisheng who was born earlier in Hsinking, Manchukuo in 1938. In June of the same year, her family moved back to Manchukuo. Following the surrender of Japan in 1945, the Japanese puppet state Manchukuo collapsed and the Soviet Red Army occupied Northeast China. Husheng's father was captured by the Red Army and was first held in a prison camp in Chita. While trying to escape to Korea by train, Husheng, her mother and aunt Wanrong were captured by the Chinese Communist guerrillas at Dalizi in January 1946 and held at a police station in Changchun in April, they later released only to be rounded up again and locked up at a police station in Jilin. When the Kuomintang forces bombed Jilin, they and prisoners were moved to a prison in Yanji, where her aunt died of malnutrition and opium withdrawal on 20 June 1946. Saga and Husheng were later moved and imprisoned in Shanghai, before they were repatriated to Japan in 1947. Back in Japan, they were reunited with Huisheng and stayed at their maternal grandfather Marquis Saneto Saga's house. Husheng and her elder sister Huisheng were educated at various prestigious private schools, including the Gakush≈´in in Tokyo. During that period, Huisheng and her lover died at Mount Amagi on 10 December 1957 in what appeared to be a murder-suicide case. In November 1960, her father Pujie was released from Fushun War Criminals Management Centre at Fushun, Liaoning following the pardon by the Chinese government and joined the Communist Party. Husheng, who had not seen her father for 16 years, traveled to China with her mother the following year to visit him. Her parents were then reunited and settled in Beijing, while Husheng returned to Japan and became a Japanese citizen though naturalization. Later in 1963, Husheng traveled to China again and stayed with her parents for one year before returning to Japan. Personal life In 1968, Husheng married in Kobe, Hy≈çgo Prefecture and she was renamed to Kosei Fukunaga. They have five children. * 1st daughter: * 1st son: * 2nd son: * 3rd son: * 2nd daughter: Later life Fukunaga has promoted friendly relations between China and Japan.

Overview  Haniwa depicting a shinto priestess wearing tasukiIn modern Japanese history, tasuki were used by many people as everyday practical accessories, but in ancient Japan they were an exclusive accessory used by the Shinto clergy during ceremonies. Terracotta Haniwa dating to the Kofun period that were excavated in Gunma Prefecture depict Shinto miko wearing tasuki. During the Edo period tasuki were worn by manual laborers for the mobility they would have had if they weren't wearing kimono. The tasuki allowed the kimono wearer to work without large sleeves getting in the way of the job, and without risking damage to the expensive garment. Women wearing tasuki while inspecting silk worm eggs.Tasuki are still used for both practical and aesthetic reasons even for modern wearers of Kimono People involved in the proceedings of Japanese festivals, such as Japanese traditional dancers at odori festivals or those tasked with pulling the danjiri at danjiri festivals wear tasuki over their kimono or yukata for unimpeded movement.

It is situated in a former power distribution building. The building, which was sometime not in use, was converted into an art house by the Bursa Municipality and the Bursa Art and Culture Foundation, and opened on 15 June 1997. It was named the \\"Karag√∂z House\\" in regard to the \\"Manument of Karagz and Hacivat\\" standing just across the building, which is a cultural symbol of Bursa. The art arthouse consisted of a theatre hall, where traditional Turkish shadow play Karag√∂z and Hacivat was performed, a gallery of Karag√∂z and Hacivat puppets, a speciality library and a design workshop. With the establishment of the international puppetry association UNIMA's Bursa branch, the art house turned into a center to revive the traditional shadow play. Ten years later of its foundation, the art house was converted into Karag√∂z Museum by the Bursa Metropolitan Municipality in 2007. Exhibits The museum consists of two galleries. The first gallery is about the history of shadow play. In the second gallery, 61 pieces of original Karag√∂z puppets gathered from traditional shadow play collections are on display.

It is tasteless since H2 is an odorless gas. There is limited scientific evidence that hydrogen water has any health benefits in humans, although its proponents make claims it provides such benefits as functioning as an antioxidant, reducing inflammation, reducing risk of metabolic syndrome, providing neuroprotection for various diseases, and reducing side effects associated with cancer radiation treatment. Composition Hydrogen water is made by dissolving gaseous molecular hydrogen into water under pressure, typically 7.0 mg per liter of water. Alternative means of hydrogen administration are by inhalation of a gas containing up to 4.6% hydrogen, by intravenous injection with a hydrogen-containing saline solution, or by topical application (to the skin). Health claims There is so far a lack of scientific consensus concerning the evidence that hydrogen has health benefits in humans. A few articles have been published on the topic, but the clinical literature is sparse and what has been published covers many conditions, but not multiple trials of any one condition. Hydrogen water proponents claim that it has health benefits such being an antioxidant, reducing inflammation, reducing risk of metabolic syndrome, providing neuroprotection for various diseases, and reducing side effects associated with cancer radiation treatment. But none of the published articles concerning these claims are systematic reviews or meta-analyses and very little work has been done in animals.

It contains dolutegravir, an integrase inhibitor, and lamivudine, a reverse-transcriptase inhibitor. It is taken by mouth. Dolutegravir stops the activity of an enzyme called integrase (and is known as an integrase inhibitor), while lamivudine stops the activity of another enzyme called reverse transcriptase (and is known as a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor or NRTI). It was approved for use in the United States in April 2019, and in the European Union in July 2019. The most common side effects are headache, diarrhoea, nausea (feeling sick) and difficulty sleeping. The most common serious side effects are allergic reactions, including rash and severe liver problems.  Medical uses  In the EU dolutegravir/lamivudine is indicated for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection in adults and adolescents above 12 years of age weighing at least 40 kg, with no known or suspected resistance to the integrase inhibitor class, or lamivudine.

While B-41 was nearing completion, Spiridonov sailed on a long distance voyage aboard the Project AB611-type submarine B-78, serving as second in command under Captain 2nd rank V. V. Gorontsov. During the voyage Spiridonov familiarised himself with the new type of submarines, and carried out tests of the R-11FM ballistic missile system. A Project 629-type ballistic missile submarine. Spiridonov's second command was one of these vessels. With the completion of B-41, Spiridonov brought her to Olenya Bay, where she was commissioned as part of the 140th independent squadron, and assigned the designation K-79. On 7 November 1959 he was promoted to captain, 2nd rank. In January 1960 K-79 was assigned to the Northern Fleet and between June and July Spiridonov took her down to the Canary Islands and then returned to Olenya Bay, carrying out drills and missile exercises. He was commended for his services by the commander of the Northern Fleet, Admiral Andrei Chabanenko, and received a personal weapon from the navy's commander-in- chief.On 21 January 1961 he was appointed Chief of Staff of the 212th squadron of the 8th submarine division of the Northern Fleet. Shortly after his appointment, on 27 January, the S-80 was lost at sea. A State Commission, headed by Marshal Konstantin Rokossovsky, did not return any final conclusions, but still led to a shakeup of personnel. On 28 June 1961 Spiridonov was appointed Deputy Commander of the 18th Division of the 12th submarine squadron of the Northern Fleet. The division included the latest Project 629 ballistic missile submarines. Spiridonov took control of the training of submarine crews. Between August and December 1961 five new ships were assigned to his unit. Spiridonov personally took each one to sea. On 17 December 1962 he was appointed commander of the 211th brigade of the 4th submarine squadron. The squadron commander assessed Spiridonov as being \\"A tactically literate, energetic, strong-willed, disciplined, courageous, and decisive commander of the formation. Knows his assigned business well and copes with it successfully. He has extensive practical experience in the submarine service. Repeatedly undertook independent voyages on submarines. Has commanded boats of projects 613, 641, 629. A good sailor, in a difficult situation acts decisively and correctly. Hardworking.\\" Spiridonov was promoted to captain 1st rank on 21 February 1964, and commended by the Northern Fleet's commander, Admiral Semyon Lobov, as \\"An intelligent and promising officer.\\" Flag rank The Naval Academy, where Spiridonov took advanced officer courses. Spiridonov took at series of courses at the Naval Academy from 29 September 1966 to 3 August 1967, being appointed commander of the 35th division of submarines on 31 January 1967. This division included the new Project 651-type submarines, armed with nuclear ballistic missiles. On 21 February he was awarded the Order of the Red Star and on 19 February 1968 was advanced to rear admiral. On 12 October 1970 he was appointed commander and member of the Military Council of the 15th submarine squadron of the Kamchatka division of the Pacific Fleet. Promoted to vice-admiral on 2 November 1972, Spiridonov achieved good results with training his crews, and the division was recognised as the best unit of the Pacific Fleet. In his assessment of Spiridonov the commander of the Kamchatka division, Vice Admiral V. Sidorov, wrote \\"In 1973, 100% success in missile firing was achieved, and 97.6% of torpedo firing. A lot of painstaking work to improve the deployment of ships and the life of personnel. Energetic and resolute admiral. Personally sails on submarines and ships of the squadron, teaching the commanders of the formations and ships practically.\\" On 20 October 1973 Spiridonov was appointed commander and member of the Military Council of the 2nd Submarine Flotilla of the Pacific Fleet. On 21 February 1974 he was awarded the Order of the Red Banner. He took several courses at the Military Academy of the General Staff, and on 27 September 1974 he was appointed Deputy Commander of the Pacific Fleet. In 1977, during his tenure as deputy commander, he took personal charge of the rescue efforts of the Project 667B -type submarine K-477, which suffered a fire while loading nuclear ballistic missiles at the dockside in Kamchatka. Spiridonov flew from Vladivostok to Kamchatka and took the submarine to sea. After a full day of fighting the fire, on 8 September an explosion caused the warhead of a damaged nuclear missile to be ejected from the submarine and sink in the sea. With the submarine now out of danger, Spiridonov brought her back to port and then supervised the recovery of the warhead and its disposal. For his actions he was awarded the Medal \\"For Courage in a Fire\\". On 21 February 1978, he was awarded the Order \\"For Service to the Homeland in the Armed Forces of the USSR\\" Third Class, and on 31 August 1979 he was appointed Commander of the Pacific Fleet. This was followed with a promotion to admiral on 25 October 1979.In 1980 he was elected a deputy of the Supreme Soviet of the RSFSR and was a delegate to the 26th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. Death and legacy The memorial in the Serafimovskoe Cemetery to Spiridonov and his wife Valentina. In early 1981 Spiridonov and much of the Pacific Fleet's leadership attended meetings in Leningrad, before planning to return to Vladivostok on 7 February. At 18:00 local time the plane, a Tupolev Tu-104, took off from Pushkin Airport, and almost immediately crashed just clear of the runway, killing all aboard. Spiridonov was the highest ranking officer to die, along with 15 other admirals and generals, and 38 lower ranking officers. Also killed along with Spiridonov was his wife Valentina. They were both interred with most of the other victims of the crash in the Serafimovskoe Cemetery in Leningrad, where a memorial to the dead was erected on the orders of the Navy's Commander-in- Chief, Sergey Gorshkov. A memorial service is held annually on 7 February at the St. Nicholas Naval Cathedral in St Petersburg, and on the twentieth anniversary of the crash the line ‚ÄúThose who died in the line of duty on 7 February 1981‚Äù and an Orthodox cross were added to the memorial stele commemorating the Pacific Navy sailors. Over his career Spiridonov was awarded the Order of the Red Banner, two Orders of the Red Star and the Order \\"For Service to the Homeland in the Armed Forces of the USSR\\" Third Class. He was honoured after his death with the naming of a street in Vladivostok and the Udaloy-class destroyer Admiral Spiridonov. Memorial plaques were placed in the Staff Building of the Pacific Fleet in Vladivostok, and in the St. Nicholas Naval Cathedral in St Petersburg.

The statues other names are Mannheimer Engel and Angel of Death; the locals call the sculpture Die schepp' Liesel (The crooked Liesel).  History  In August 1949, the Union of Persecutees of the Nazi Regime (VVN) applied for a memorial plaque to commemorate the resistance fighter, Lechleiter, and those executed with him at Georg-Lechleiter-Platz. In the course of the debate on the motion, the circle of victims of Nazi mentioned on the commemorative plaque was extended to include all those who were persecuted for political, religious or racial reasons, those imprisoned in concentration camps, those deported from Mannheim and those that died elsewhere. This was approved by the VVN. In August 1950, the Social Democratic Lord Mayor Hermann Heimerich wanted the victims of the World War to be included; he also questioned the suitability of Lechleiter-Platz in Schwetzingerstadt. Heimerich strove for a uniform commemoration day for the fight against Nazi and for all the civilian and military victims of the war, stating that it was an obligation to political renewal and peaceableness. At the end of 1950, the Lord Mayor proposed a monument at Schillerplatz in the city centre. Heimerich's ideas were supported by the CDU and SPD. The CDU council and Nazi persecuted Florian Waldeck, said that before the majesty of death the political party barriers should fall. The KPD councillor Anette Langendorf, whose husband had been executed as a member of the Lechleiter group and who herself was imprisoned in the concentration camp, took a counterposition. Langendorf advocated a memorial for the victims of the war, but pointed out that among the victims of the war \\"there [were] people who went to war with great vigour and enthusiasm for Hitler and who wanted exactly the opposite of what resistance fighters voluntarily sacrificed their lives for\\". The idea of a common memory caused considerable conflict among the people of Mannheim, especially the soldiers' associations. The municipal council provided the funds for a memorial to the victims of the years 1933 to 1945; a KPD application for a commemorative plaque at Lechleiter-Platz was heldback and had no chance of being realized when a repeated application attempt was made in 1952.  Sculpture  At the beginning of 1951, the city commissioned Gerhard Marcks to design the monument. Marcks was one of the most important German sculptors at the time but had been defamed by the Nazi in the exhibition \\"Degenerate Art\\". After liberation, Marcks created the memorial Fahrt √ºber den Styx at the Hamburg-Ohlsdorf cemetery, and his designs were to be based on his sculpture Die Trauernde in K√∂ln. Marcks chose the motif of an angel. In doing so, his ideas were based on ancient Persian mythology, according to which the angel of man is the son who flies over the earth on the last day. The sculptor had already created two angel sculptures in 1937 and 1940. The latter, created under the impression of the death of his sister and bearing her facial features, was destroyed in the war. In the second half of the 1940s, Marcks had made several sketches for angelic figures, in which he strove for a stronger stylization and ornamentalization. The Mannheim Angel has a very relief-like structure except for the fully sculptured skin; it spreads its arms out in front of its wings. The inclination of the vertical axis, together with the raised feet, gives the impression of a floating angel. The angel's wings and robe are drawn with parallel lines. Its left hand is slightly bent back, and right hand slightly raised. The director of the Mannheimer Kunsthalle, Walter Passarge, saw an \\"excess of suffering\\" in \\"the painfully restrained expression of the austere temperament with the huge, 'spellbinding' eyes\\". Together with the inscription - \\"Es mahnen die Toten\\" and \\"1939-1945\\" - it is a passionate reminder to the survivors. According to the historian Christian Peters, the angel captivates the observer, but blocks a quick identification. The combination of artistic aspiration, serious admonition and political message is what makes the monument so special. The inscription \\"included and did not exclude\\"; it made it clear \\"that 1945 would not have been conceivable without 1933\\". The Lord Mayor Heimerich and Mannheim municipal councillors were initially sceptical about Marcks' design, which later gave way to approval and admiration. One local councilor thought that the angel would create a memorial that would be a symbol for Mannheim and a serious reminder to the population for centuries to come. In April 1952, the Mannheim administrative committee unanimously voted for the purchase of the artwork. The three-metre-high () angel figure was cast in the summer of 1952 by the bronze founder Schm√§ke from D√ºsseldorf, and at the beginning of November it was placed on a two-metre-high () sandstone base in square B 4 next to the Jesuit Church.  Inauguration  Address by Adenauer at the inauguration ceremony The Angel of Peace was inaugurated on 16 November 1952, the National Day of Mourning. In front of about 5000 visitors, Lord Mayor Heimerich referred to the historical significance of Schillerplatz as the \\"probably most venerable square\\" in the city with the pre-war location of the Mannheim National Theatre, the site of the premiere of Schiller's \\"Robber\\", in which the poet had juxtaposed the ideal of noble humanity with tyranny. Heimerich gave the numbers of fallen and missing soldiers stationed in Mannheim, of civilians killed in air raids, and of Jews deported from Mannheim. He recalled resistance fighters such as the Lechleiter Group and commemorated the refugees and expellees who had come to Mannheim after the end of the war. Federal Chancellor Konrad Adenauer then gave a brief, general speech. After which the Bishop Julius Bender and the Apostolic Protonotar Wilhelm Reinhard as representatives of the Archbishop of Freiburg, the rabbi Robert Raphael Geis spoke. He began his speech with the historian Hans-Joachim Hirsch statement, \\"the reality of the Holocaust into the celebration\\": In the events leading up to the ceremony there had been conflicts between the two organizers, the city and the Volksbund Deutsche Kriegsgr√§berf√ºrsorge. The War Graves Commission insisted on a delayed rally at Mannheim's main cemetery. The city administration gave the impression that the Volksbund was \\"uncomfortable\\" with the connection between commemorating the war graves and the political victims. In a letter to the War Graves Commission, Lord Mayor Heimerich declared that he had long regarded the fact that the commemoration days for the various groups of victims were \\"committed on different days and under different aspects\\" as a grievance, but could not persuade the War Graves Commission to change its mind.  Memorial  In 1953 the commemoration of the national day of mourning took place in smaller form at the Angel of Peace. Before the Memorial Day in 1954, the soldiers' and returnees' associations clearly stated that they did not want to be mentioned at the ceremony together with the Jews and other victims of National Socialism. When the city administration learned that the soldiers' associations were preparing a big ceremony in the cemetery, they cancelled the event at the Angel of Peace in order not to intensify the separation. In the following years, the memorial service, which was initially organized by the Volksbund alone, received an increasingly military character. From 1958 the city, the Volksbund and the Arbeitsgemeinschaft soldiatischer Verb√§nde, to which the Hilfsgemeinschaft auf Gegenseitigkeit der Angeh√∂rigen der ehemaligen Waffen-SS (HIAG) belonged, jointly invited to the event at the cemetery. For the historian Christian Peters, it is \\"more than just a nuisance\\" that former members of the Waffen-SS called on the Mannheim population and thus also survivors of the Holocaust to an event at which the victims of persecution and resistance were also remembered. On the tenth anniversary of the end of the war, an \\"hour of reflection\\" took place at the Angel of Peace on 7 May 1955, to which Lord Mayor Heimerich invited the Protestant theologian Helmut Gollwitzer. Before several thousand people Gollwitzer warned, \\"Remembrance is duty, also and straight if it hurts\\". For Gollwitzer the angel of peace stood \\"against our flight into oblivion, with which we want to undo what happened\\". Since 1954, an informal wreath has been laid on the Angel of Peace for the national day of mourning. In May 1983, the Angel of Peace was moved to a less prominent location in square E 6 next to the hospital church, since residential buildings were to be erected at Schillerplatz. According to information from the 1990s, the Angel of Peace served as a starting point or destination for actions of the peace movement or anti-fascist organizations. In 2008, Sebastian Parzer stated that Heimerich, as a person persecuted even by the National Socialists, possessed a \\"different tact\\", which was evident, for example, in his dealings with the Jewish community of Mannheim. His concept of a central memorial service in the city centre, linked to the angel of peace, could not be implemented. According to Hans-Joachim Hirsch, the Angel of Peace already had an \\"important function in commemorating the horrors of the Nazi era\\" alone due to its prominent former location. The attempt to ‚Äûintegrate broad sections of the population [must] at least in part be regarded as a failure‚Äú. Not only the Jewish community must have felt duped by the general dedication of the angel, stated Hirsch 2005. For Christian Peters, too much was expected with the hope for renewal, for which the angel should stand. Heimerich's concept was an attempt to unite contradictions that could not be united in reality. The emergence of soldiers' and returnees' associations had increased the difficulties in establishing a new tradition of remembrance of the dead. \\"The talk of the victims, the public thematization of the special role of the persecuted, disturbed the process of integrating millions of followers of National Socialism into German democracy,\\" said Peters in 2001. As early as November 1954, the Rhein-Neckar-Zeitung saw the Angel of Peace \\"falling for the fate of intellectual isolation; without the community that gathers around it every year, it stands in a vacuum, lacking the unifying function‚Äú. Lord Mayor Heimerich considered the memorial, shortly before the end of his term of office in the summer of 1955, as not yet completely taken up in the consciousness of the population. He told Helmut Gollwitzer that the soldiers' associations \\"distinguish between heroes and victimss and do not want their heroes to be named at the same time as the victims\\".

Farina spent his entire life in Brindisi where he was an excellent student who developed a passion for science and for music (which came from his father) and who was noted for his devotion to Saint Pio of Pietrelcina and Saint Francis of Assisi, as well as to other saints who were close to him in age. He spent the last decade of his life struggling with a brain tumor that later led to his death; he was forced to seek treatment outside of Brindisi in attempt to remove the tumor. Farina's reputation for personal holiness was evident throughout his life. This led to the introduction of his beatification process on 11 April 2016, just seven years after his death, when he assumed the title Servant of God. On 05 May 2020 he was declared Venerable. Life Matteo Farina was born on 19 September 1990 in Avellino (the birthplace of his paternal grandfather) as the second of two children born to Miky Farina (a bank clerk) and Paola Sabbatini (a housewife); his elder sister was Erika whom he was close to. Farina was baptized on 28 October in the Ave Maris Stella parish church in Brindisi where the Farina's lived. Throughout his life he had a deep devotion to Saint Francis of Assisi and to Saint Pio of Pietrelcina and would recite the rosary each day and read the Gospel; he also made his confession once a week. Farina also attended Eucharistic Adoration often. Farina also had a devotion to Saint Gemma Galgani and Blessed Pier Giorgio Frassati while the writings of Saint Th√©r√®se of Lisieux inspired him. From his father developed a strong liking for music and he learnt from his father several musical instruments while with his friends he formed a music band called \\"No Name\\". His friends would often refer to Farina as \\"the moralizer\\" since he often spoke about God and encouraged peace. He also had a passion for chemistry and thought about continuing his studies in the environmental engineering field. He liked information technology during his time at school. Farina made his first confession (Reconciliation) when he was eight and on 4 June 2000 made his First Communion; he received Confirmation on 10 May 2003 from the Archbishop of Brindisi-Ostuni, Settimo Todisco. For his Confirmation he selected his older sister to be his sponsor due to their close relationship. Farina also had a dream during the night between 2-3 January 2000 in which he saw Saint Pio of Pietrelcina who revealed to him the secret of Christian happiness which he urged Farina to spread to others; this dream made him realize that he was meant to evangelize this secret to others to lead them to God. Farina also created a fund for the missions in Mozambique and deposited his savings there while urging his parents to replace Christmas shopping with sending something to the poor of Africa. In April 2007 he began dating a girl named Serena (whom he remained with until his death) and referred to her once as \\"the most beautiful gift that the Lord could give\\". In September 2003 he began experiencing severe headaches and vision problems and so travelled alongside his parents and his uncle Rosario for a series of health checks conducted in Avellino and Verona hospitals before a two week visit to Hannover for a brain biopsy that October. On their return to Brindisi he believed his health problems were over but the tests soon showed an extended edema in the right temporo-occipital area of his brain with malignant cells suspected also. Farina had a severe seizure ten months later and found his vision was impaired. This forced him to go to Germany for a craniotomy operation to remove a third degree brain tumor, later in January 2005. He spent over a month doing chemotherapy in Milan and was able to return to Brindisi on 2 April 2005 ‚Äì the date that Pope John Paul II died ‚Äì and had periodic checks until 2007 in which it was believed the disease was regressing. But this was short lived for Farina experienced the first recurrence in December 2007. In October 2008 he left for Hannover for checks in which the second recurrence was discovered at which stage his mother felt it was appropriate for him to receive the Anointing of the Sick. Farina had the first of three operations to remove the tumor on 9 December 2008 but his condition worsened and in January 2009 he underwent the third operation. He returned to Brindisi on 13 February 2009 with paralysis of his arm and left leg (due to the operations) and began using a wheelchair in order to move around. In late March he had a high fever which saw him admitted to the Antonio Perrino Hospital where he received an Easter blessing from Archbishop Rocco Talucci. His doctors were unable to do anything more for Farina and advised him to return home. He received his last Communion on 13 April 2009 and died a week later on 24 April. Farina's remains were relocated on 29 September 2017 to the Brindisi-Ostuni Cathedral at a Mass that the Archbishop Domenico Caliandro presided over. Beatification process The beatification process for Farina launched on 11 April 2016 after the Congregation for the Causes of Saints titled him as a Servant of God and issued the official nihil obstat (no objections) decree which would allow for the Brindisi-Ostuni archdiocese to open the investigation. The diocesan process was opened on 19 September 2016 and concluded some months later on 24 April 2017; the C.C.S. validated this process on 22 September 2017. The postulators submitted the official Positio dossier to the C.C.S. officials in mid-2018 for evaluation. Farina's beatification depends upon the papal confirmation of a miracle attributed to his intercession which in most cases is a healing that neither medicine nor science could explain. The Brindisi-Ostuni Archdiocese investigated such a case from 7 November 2018 until 21 March 2019 with all the relevant interrogatories and medical evidence presented to the C.C.S. following that investigation. The current postulator for this cause is Dr. Francesca Consolini.

Her work focuses on the development of statistical models for the analysis of intensive longitudinal data in psychology, mainly within the frameworks of Structural Equation Modeling and Time Series Analysis.  Biography  = Education = Hamaker received a bachelor and master degree in psychology from Utrecht University, in 1997 and 1999 respectively. She earned her PhD in psychological methods in 2004 at the University of Amsterdam, under the supervision of Peter Molenaar and Conor Dolan, for her thesis: ‚ÄúTime series analysis and the individual as the unit of psychological research‚ÄùHamaker, E. L. \\"Time series analysis and the individual as the unit of psychological research\\", University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, 1 December 2004. = Academic career = In 2005 Hamaker became a postdoctoral fellow at the Department of Psychology, University of Virginia. Hamaker returned to the Netherlands in 2006, being appointed Assistant Professor at the Department of Methodology and Statistics, Utrecht University. She was promoted to Associate Professor in 2011, before being promoted to Full Professor with the chair Longitudinal Data Analysis in 2018. Since 2014 she has also been a research fellow at the Research Group of Quantitative Psychology and Individual Differences, KU Leuven, in Belgium. = Research focus = Hamakers early research focused on the application of time series techniques within psychology, to study process that unfold within individuals over time. Increased availability of data collected using the experience sampling method in psychology led to increased interest in this methodology in applied psychological research. Most notable of her papers is her critique of the cross-lagged panel model, in which she proposes to better account for stable trait-like differences between individuals through the use of multilevel models with random intercepts. She is also an advocate of within-person thinking in social sciences, pointing out that conclusions based on cross-sectional data do not necessarily generalize to the processes within a particular person. Since 2015 Ellen has collaborated frequently with Bengt O. Muth√©n and Tihomir Asparouhov in the development of the Dynamic Structural Equation Modeling, a module that allows for Bayesian Time Series analysis in the software package Mplus. Hamaker has stated that the overarching goal of her research is to establish a connection between innovative statistical techniques and applied psychological research. = Achievements and awards = Throughout her academic career, Hamaker has served as Associate Editor of Multivariate Behavioral Research. In 2019 she was appointed a fellow of the Association for Psychological Science.  Personal life  Ellen Hamaker is the granddaughter of Dutch scientist Hugo Christiaan Hamaker, noted for his contributions to physics (the Hamaker constant) and statistics.

Life and work  Born in Solihull, England, to Scottish parents, Pope's family moved to rural Aberdeenshire when she was still a young child. Her father was a businessman and keen art collector, from whom she inherited a number of significant works such as one of Samuel Peploe's Iona paintings. Pope attended Albyn School in Aberdeen, and then commenced study at Edinburgh College of Art in 1936. Her studies were interrupted by World War II, during which time she served with the Women's Auxiliary Air Force. In 1946 Pope resumed her studies at Edinburgh College of Art, then undertook teacher training at Moray House. Pope held several teaching posts in primary and private schools, including Lansdowne House in Edinburgh and the role of art mistress at Oxenfoord Castle School, Midlothian. Pope took up a post as art lecturer at Moray House in the mid-1960s, which she held until her early retirement in 1973. Upon retirement from teaching, Pope concentrated on painting at her home, Weaver's Cottage in Carlops. She is linked to The Edinburgh School of artists, having studied under Sir William Gilles at Edinburgh College of Art and formed friendships with fellow artists such as Joan Eardley. Like many artists of the Edinburgh School, Pope worked in both oil and watercolour. She primarily painted still life and landscapes. Her work was heavily inspired by the Aberdeenshire landscapes of her youth, but she also traveled frequently both within Scotland and Europe, notably Cyprus, Lebanon, the Peloponnese and Spain, looking for inspiration. Pope exhibited at the Royal Academy, with the Royal Scottish Academy and had a series of solo shows at The Scottish Gallery between 1956 and 1982 and then at the Macaulay Gallery.

He previously worked for Silicon Valley technology companies such as Google and Facebook as well as Harvard's Berkman Klein Center for Internet and Society. He was a Presidential Innovation Fellow at the White House and a partner at Mohr Davidow Ventures, a firm on Sand Hill Road.  Early life and education  Hartley was born in Richland, Washington, but soon moved to Highlands Ranch, Colorado. His family moved to Palo Alto, California in 1993, where he attended Palo Alto High School. He was a student of Esther Wojcicki. Hartley already completed his second year at the University of Virginia (where he was an Eccles Scholar) when he decided to transfer to Stanford University, seeking classmates with a broader Liberal Arts perspective. In 2005, he finished his BA in Political Science at Stanford and later obtained an MBA at Columbia University Business School and an MIA in International Economic Policy at Columbia University School of International and Public Affairs. He is a term member at the Council on Foreign Relations.  Career  After finishing his BA at Stanford, Hartley started working for Google. He lectured for Google.org and TechnoServe across East Africa. He also spent a year in India setting up the Google India team before moving to Facebook. He left the social media company to become a startup investor. Hartley has attracted attention for his position that technology is not the only discipline necessary at Silicon Valley. He noted that, although technology is uniform in the technology field, there are many CEOs and startup founders who have backgrounds in humanities, liberal arts, and social sciences. In an interview, he stated that these leaders, based on their performance over time, have the ability to take a step back, ask the right questions, and, empathize with the customer, making them more effective than a leader who merely has technological fluency. In his book, The Fuzzy and The Techie: Why the Liberal Arts Will Rule the Digital World, Hartley also argued that the business world depends on human touch that soft skills bring despite the increasing role technology plays in running business organizations. His book has been translated into six languages.According to him, technology and the liberals arts cannot be studied in isolation from each other. He spoke about his book at the World Bank annual meeting, USGIF's GEOINT Symposium, Google, IBM, Stanford University with Marissa Mayer, University of Washington, University of Arizona and Arkansas State University. The book was also selected as a book of the month by the Financial Times and was a finalist for the FT and McKinsey & Company's Bracken Bower Prize. He maintained that liberal arts degrees are crucial in applying emerging technologies to the creation of breakthrough innovations. Hartley also criticized fellow venture capitalists such as Marc Andreesen, who previously declared that the average graduate with a degree in English ends up \\"working in a shoe store‚Äù. He pushed back against Andreesen's position that a liberal arts education limits the dimensionality of one's thinking since it makes students less familiar with mathematical models and statistics. Hartley said that those with backgrounds in these fields \\"will develop ethics in artificial intelligence, question bias in algorithms and data and will bring contextual understanding to code.‚Äù Hartley is also a contributing writer to a number of publications, including the Financial Times, Forbes, and Foreign Policy. He is managing partner of a venture capital firm, Two Culture Capital.  Personal life  Hartley lives in Brooklyn, New York.

Many Orthodox monasteries are off the beaten track, however, St. Nilus Island Skete is obviously the remotest of all 80 American Orthodox Christian monasteries in North America. The inlet, owned by the monastery, is void of any other settlement. In the winter months, St. Nilus Skete and the four nuns there can be left desolate from the rest of civilization for days and weeks at a time. The small community is affiliated with St. Archangel Michael Skete in Alaska and two other monasteries in California, St. Xenia Serbian Orthodox Skete and the Monastery of Saint Herman of Alaska, but only St. Archangel Michael Skete is close to St. Nilus Island Skete.http://www.stnilus.org/ The handful of nuns living at St. Nilus Island Skete‚Äîacross Narrow Strait from the northeast tip of Kodiak Island‚Äîuse a small boat to get to and from their abode to buy necessary supplies. Throughout the summer when days are longer and the seas are calm, the boat brings women pilgrims to the island, and those wishing to stay longer are put up in the guest-house. The monastic community, like the affiliated ones, is under the omophorion of Bishop Maksim Vasiljeviƒá of the Serbian Orthodox Eparchy of Western America. The women strugglers follow the Russian monastic tradition of a small, self-sufficient skete, a model handed down by their Patron St. Nilus of Sora and others. The sisters generally follow the complete daily cycle of services and support themselves through making vestments, prayer ropes, greeting cards of Alaskan Saints, fishing, gardening, and cooking. They are obliged by Orthodox canons to offer hospitality to their non-cleric guests as though they are one of them. Visitors are welcome for the traditional three-day period, and accommodations can be made for female pilgrims to stay longer.

Holmes earned his bachelor's degree in biology from Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in 1954 and then began graduate study in the history department of Harvard University, where he graduated with MA in 1958. His graduate study was interrupted by two years of service in the United States Air Force and when he returned to Harvard he transferred to the department of the history of science, graduating with PhD in 1962 with thesis Claude Bernard and the concept of internal environment. For his dissertation, he reconstructed Claude Bernard's path of discovery of basic physiological functions, such as those of the liver, on the basis of Bernard's laboratory books from the 1840s. Mirko Grmek referred the laboratory books to Holmes. He then spent two years at MIT as a postdoc. At Yale University he became in 1964 an assistant professor and in 1968 an associate professor of the history of science. In 1972 he became a professor at the University of Western Ontario and head of his department. In 1979 he returned to Yale as a full professor and chair from 1979 to 2002 of the Section of the History of Medicine in the Yale School of Medicine. He became Avalon Professor in 1985, and from 1982 to 1987 was Master of Jonathan Edwards College. He became a leading force in building the history of science and medicine at Yale. He initiated an undergraduate major in the history of science/history of medicine and in 1986 a graduate program in the history of medicine and the life sciences. In 2002 he helped establish a new Program in the History of Medicine and Science. Holmes was the author of more than sixty papers and several books on the history of medicine and the biological sciences. For his two-volume work on Hans Adolf Krebs and the discovery of the citric acid cycle, Holmes not only evaluated Krebs's lab books, but also conducted detailed interviews with Krebs. Holmes won several prizes and was a leading contributor to the history of medicine and the biological sciences for two generations. He and his wife Harriet Vann Holmes (d. 2000) had three daughters.

He is best known for his novel The Jumbie Bird, a semi-autobiographical work which blends Indian and Afro-Caribbean mythology and experience to explore the creation of a new Indo-Caribbean identity.  Early life and education  Ismith Khan was born to Faiez and Zinab Khan in Port of Spain, to a Muslim family of Indian Pathan descent. His paternal grandfather, Kale Khan, left British India after participating in the Indian Rebellion of 1857 and migrated to British Guiana. He later moved to Trinidad and Tobago, where he established a jewellery business. After surviving the Hosay massacre in 1884, Kale Khan settled in Port of Spain where he established what his grandson later described as \\"the largest and most famous jewellery shop in Port of Spain\\". He lived with his son Faiez and his family when Ismith was a child, and inspired one of the main characters in The Jumbie Bird. Ismith Khan attended Queen's Royal College, where he completed the Cambridge School Certificate and graduated in 1945. In 1947 he enrolled in the Indiana University Fort Wayne to study engineering, but dropped out after a year because he was short on funds. He returned to Trinidad and Tobago in 1948 and took a job as a reporter at the Trinidad Guardian newspaper at the recommendation of Sam Selvon. Khan had met Selvon in 1941 when Khan's sister, Betty, and Selvon's brother, Dennis, were married. Khan and Selvon worked together at the Guardian and became \\"lifelong friends\\". Khan considered his friendship with Selvon to be \\"the single most powerful influence on him becoming a writer\\". While working at the Guardian, Khan was assigned to interview Mariam Ghose, a graduate student at Michigan State University who was in Trinidad and Tobago doing research. Ghose encouraged Khan to apply for a tuition scholarship to Michigan State University, and in the fall of 1948 Khan left Trinidad and Tobago to pursue a degree in sociology. Khan and Ghose were married in 1949. He completed his course work, but was unable to graduate because he was unwilling to take a course in physical education, which the degree required. In 1952, two courses short of a degree, Khan transferred to The New School for Social Research in New York, where he completed his degree in sociology. Originally interested in journalism, Khan took several fiction-writing workshops at The New School, which prompted him to pursue fiction instead of journalism. In 1958, Khan became an American citizen. While living in New York, Khan wrote his first two novels, The Jumbie Bird and The Obeah Man, and most of his short stories. In 1964 Khan met Vera Reichler and became romantically involved with her. They moved in together in 1966, and were married in 1969 after his divorce was finalised. In the fall of that year they moved from New York to Baltimore after Khan was admitted to the creative writing program at Johns Hopkins University. In 1970 Khan received an M.A. in creative writing and submitted The Crucifixion, which he had started writing before leaving New York, as his thesis.  Career  Khan's first novel, The Jumbie Bird, was published in 1961. His second novel, The Obeah Man, was published in 1964 and his third novel, The Crucifixion, which was written as part of his master's thesis, was published in 1987. A collection of short stories, A Day in the Country and Other Stories, was published in 1990. Khan taught at The New School and Johns Hopkins University between 1955 and 1970. Between 1970 and 1982 he was based in California, and taught at the University of California, Berkeley, University of California, San Diego, University of Southern California, and California State College, Long Beach. After the end of his third marriage in 1982, he returned to New York, where he continued to write and taught as an adjunct at Medgar Evers College. Khan's work was overshadowed by his two more prominent Indo-Trinidadian contemporary novelists ‚Äì V.S. Naipaul and Sam Selvon. Khan's relative obscurity may have been due to the fact that he was based in the United States while his contemporaries were based in London, which \\"functioned as the English Caribbean's literary capital\\" and provided a support network. = The Jumbie Bird = Khan's first novel, The Jumbie Bird, was published in 1961, on the eve of Trinidad and Tobago's independence from the British Empire. It tells the story of three generations of men ‚Äì Kale Khan, the grandfather, a Pathan from India who migrated to Trinidad as a free immigrant (not an indentured labourer); his Trinidadian-born son, Rahim; and Rahim's son, Jamini. The book is semi-autobiographical (Khan based Kale Khan closely on this grandfather, using both his name and personality). The novel also blends Indian and Afro-Caribbean mythology and experience to explore the creation of a new Indo-Caribbean identity. = The Obeah Man = Khan's second novel, The Obeah Man, was published in 1964. It tells the story of Zampi, an obeah man who lives at Blue Basin in the hills above Diego Martin, west of Port of Spain; his lover, Zolda, who lives in a hut at La Basse, a community built on the margin of a landfill on the east side of Port of Spain; and two other residents of La Basse ‚Äì Hop and Drop, a disabled man, and Massahood, a stick‚Äìfighter. The novel spans a three-day period from Carnival Monday morning through Ash Wednesday morning. The Obeah Man is the only novel in West Indian literature to feature an obeah man as its main character. = The Crucifixion = Khan's third novel, The Crucifixion, was published in 1987, seventeen years after it was submitted as part of his master's thesis at Johns Hopkins University. After being rejected by two publishers, the novel remained unpublished until Jeremy Poynting of Peepal Tree Press learned of it and agreed to publish it. The Crucifixion tells the story of Manko, a young man from the country who hears the voice of God calling him to become a preacher. Manko moves to the city, settles in a barrack yard in Port of Spain, and eventually arranges his own crucifixion on Calvary Hill in the eastern part of the city. In his critical analysis of Khan's work, Roydon Salick compares the presentation of life in the barrack yards as presented in this book with the more hopeful picture in C. L. R. James' Minty Alley, which also tells the story of life in Port of Spain's barrack yards. Manko is based on the same character that inspired Man-Man in Naipaul's Miguel Street, Brackley in Selvon's The Lonely Londoners, and Taffy in Earl Lovelace's The Dragon Can't Dance. Salick considers the underlying character to be folkloric, and \\"possibly real\\", and notes that Khan is the only one who gives the character a complete backstory.  Style  Khan's work is notable for his use of Trinidadian dialect and his ability to capture its speech patterns.  Themes  The themes of Khan's work are \\"firmly grounded in Trinidad\\"; he wrote of the Indian experience in the Caribbean and the relationships between ethnic groups in this racially diverse region. Khan's work addresses the experience of childhood, the clash of cultures, and the search for identity, all common themes in West Indian literature.

Construction and design HMS Cottesmore was ordered from the Scottish shipbuilder Yarrow on 11 April 1939, as part of the second batch of ten Hunt-class destroyers, following on from the first batch of ten Hunts ordered in March that year. The Hunts were meant to fill the Royal Navy's need for a large number of small destroyer-type vessels capable of both convoy escort and operations with the fleet, and were designed with a heavy anti-aircraft armament of six 4-inch anti-aircraft guns and a speed of . An error during design, which was only discovered once the first ship of the class was built, meant that the ships as designed were dangerously unstable. To restore stability, the first 23 Hunts, including Cottesmore, were modified by removing a twin 4-inch mount, cutting down the ships' superstructure and adding ballast. These ships were known as Type I Hunts. Later ships in the class had their beam increased, which allowed them to carry the originally intended armament, and were known as Type II Hunts. Cottesmore was long between perpendiculars and overall. The ship's beam was and draught . Displacement was standard and under full load.

Additional close-in anti-aircraft armament was provided by a quadruple 2-pounder \\"pom-pom\\" mount. The ship was later modified by adding two single Oerlikon 20 mm cannon on the bridge wings. Up to 40 depth charges could be carried. The ship had a complement of 146 officers and men.

Investigation  From 20 November 2017 to 31 January 2018, the ICC collected representations by victims in relation to their claims of crimes against humanity and war crimes committed by the Taliban and affiliated armed groups, war crimes by the Afghan National Security Forces, and war crimes committed in Afghanistan, Poland, Romania and Lithuania by United States Armed Forces and the United States Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). Information about allegations of crimes committed by other international military forces in Afghanistan was also sought. In 2019, the request by Fatou Bensouda, the ICC chief prosecutor, to open an investigation was rejected at the pretrial level on the grounds that the chance of a successful prosecution was low, much time had passed, Afghan and US authorities were uncooperative, and the investigation wouldn't \\"serve the interests of justice\\". On 5 March 2020, after an appeal against the decision, the investigation was authorised to proceed. Judge stated that the court has jurisdiction, since Afghanistan is party to the Rome Statute, and that the preliminary examination showed \\"reasonable grounds to believe that war crimes had been committed in Afghanistan\\".  Reactions  In April 2019, the United States (US) cancelled Bensouda's visa in response to the ICC investigation in Afghanistan, on the grounds that the US does not wish claims of war crimes by US military personnel to be investigated by the ICC. On 11 June 2020, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced the signing of Executive Order 13928 by US President Donald TrumpWhite House press release, establishing economic sanctions and visa travel restrictions against ICC lawyers and investigators as well as journalists providing evidence of war crimes by US citizens and military troops. Pompeo claimed that the ICC is a kangaroo court. On 2 September 2020, Bensouda and Phakiso Mochochoko, Head of the Jurisdiction, Complementarity and Cooperation Division of the ICC, had sanctions imposed on them by the United States in response to the ICC investigation in Afghanistan.

The college was formed in 1907 out of the Royal Colleges in South Kensington, and throughout the 20th century became central to the national strategy for technical education and research. It existed for most of its life as part of the University of London, only becoming independent in 2007.  Founding Colleges  Albert, Prince Consort, led the Great Exhibition and the subsequent development of South Kensington, and the establishment of the Royal Colleges and a technological university in London. The earliest college that led to the formation of Imperial was the Royal College of Chemistry, founded on Hanover Square in 1845, with the support of Prince Albert and parliament. Following some financial trouble, this was absorbed in 1853 into the newly formed Government School of Mines and Science Applied to the Arts, located on Jermyn Street. The school was renamed the Royal School of Mines a decade later. The medical school has roots in many different school across London, the oldest of which dates back to 1823, with the foundation of the teaching facilities at the West London Infirmary at Villiers Street. Later known as Charing Cross Hospital Medical School, it was designed to provide medical education for the needs of a university. This was followed in 1834 when Westminster Hospital surgeons started taking students under their care. Established on Dean Street, the school was forced to close in 1847, but was reopened in 1849 with a new specimen museum. The first teaching at St Mary's Hospital in Paddington began in 1851, with St Mary's Hospital Medical School established in 1854. Imperial Institute =The Great Exhibition= Proceeds from the Great Exhibition of 1851 were designated by Prince Albert to be used to develop a cultural area in South Kensington for the use and education of the public. Within the next 6 years the Victoria and Albert and Science museums had opened, joined by the Natural History Museum in 1881, and in 1888 the Imperial Institute. As well as museums, new facilities for the royal colleges were also constructed, with the Royal College of Chemistry and the Royal School of Mines moving to South Kensington between 1871 and 1872. In 1881 the Normal School of Science was established in South Kensington under the leadership of Thomas Huxley, taking over responsibility for the teaching of the natural sciences and agriculture from the Royal School of Mines. The school was granted the name Royal College of Science by royal consent in 1890. As these institutions were not part of universities, they were unable to grant degrees to students, and instead bestowed associateships such as the Associateship of the Royal College of Science. The Central Institution of the City and Guilds of London Institute, formed by the City of London's livery companies, was opened on Exhibition Road by the Prince of Wales, founded to focus on providing technical education, with courses starting in early 1885. The institution was renamed the Central Technical College in 1893, becoming a school of the University of London in 1900. 20th century Royal College of Science At the start of the 20th century there was a concern that Britain was falling behind its key rivals ‚Äì particularly Germany ‚Äì in scientific and technical education, and the idea grew for a \\"British Charlottenburg\\", similar to the German Technische Hochschule Charlottenburg. In 1902, the Technical Education Board of London County Council called for the establishment of a similar institute for advanced technological training in London, and Richard Haldane had involved Lord Rosebery, Arthur Balfour and the Duke of Devonshire in a scheme to raise ¬£600,000 as a trust fund for the proposed institution. A departmental committee was set up at the Board of Education in 1904, originally chaired by Francis Mowatt and (from 1905) by Haldane, officially to look into the future of the Royal College of Science. An interim report in 1905 asked if the government would support the unification of the two national schools of science in South Kensington ‚Äì the Royal College of Science and the Royal School of Mines ‚Äì into a single institution. This was followed in 1906 by the final report that called for the establishment of this unified institution, also to take in ‚Äì if agreement could be reached with the City and Guilds of London Institute ‚Äì their Central Technical College. The committee was divided on whether the new institution should be incorporated into the University of London or be associated as an independent college of the university, but recommended that the establishment of the new institution should not wait for this question to be settled. On 8 July 1907, King Edward VII granted a Royal Charter establishing the Imperial College of Science and Technology. This incorporated the Royal School of Mines and the Royal College of Science. It also made provisions for the Central Technical College to join once conditions regarding its governance were met, as well as for Imperial to become a college of the University of London. The latter of these was accomplished within a year, with Imperial joining the University of London on 22 July 1908. The Central Technical College joined Imperial in 1910 under the name City and Guilds College. The main campus of Imperial College was constructed beside the buildings of the Imperial Institute. The college before its mid-20th century expansion King Edward VII granted the coat of arms of the college on the 6th of June, 1908 by royal warrant. The foundation stone for the Royal School of Mines building was laid by King Edward VII in July 1909. There was controversy over the inscription on the foundation stone, which was originally to commemorate \\"the completion of the Royal College of Science ‚Ä¶ henceforth to be known as the Imperial College of Science and Technology\\". This led to objections from the Royal School of Mines and the inscription being changed to commemorate instead \\"the new buildings of the Royal School of Mines ‚Ä¶ and of the City and Guilds College of Engineering, which, with the Royal College of Science, form integral parts of the Imperial College of Science and Technology\\". While students at Imperial could study for University of London degrees, the three constituent colleges also awarded associateships at bachelor's level (Associateship of the Royal College of Science, ARCS, Associateship of the Royal School of Mines, ARSM, and Associateship of the City and Guilds of London Institute, ACGI). To these was added the Diploma of Imperial College (DIC), a postgraduate-level qualification first awarded in 1912. It was not long before agitation for full university status began. In January 1919, students and alumni met at the Imperial College Union and voted to sign a petition to make Imperial a university with its own degree awarding powers, independent of the University of London. This won the backing of the rector and the professors, in addition to the majority of past and present students, and Nature called in 1920 for \\"a free and frank examination of the proposition in all its bearings, undisturbed and unprejudiced by lesser interests than that of increasing the efficiency of university education and especially of scientific education\\". One of the issues raised was that, as Imperial was unable to grant degrees, only diplomas, students were going to America to study. While Imperial did not gain its independence at this time, the University of London changed its regulations in 1925 so that the courses taught only at Imperial would be examined by the university, enabling students to gain a BSc. In October 1945, King George VI and Queen Elizabeth visited Imperial to commemorate the centenary of the Royal College of Chemistry, which (as part of the Royal College of Science) was the oldest of the institutions that united to form Imperial College. \\"Commemoration Day\\", named after this visit, is held every October as the university's main graduation ceremony. The college also acquired a biology field station at Silwood Park near Ascot, Berkshire in 1947 Queen's Tower as part of the Imperial Institute = Post- War expansion = Following the second world war, there was again concern that Britain was falling behind in science ‚Äì this time to the United States. The Percy Report of 1945 noted that \\"there have been indications lately of a readiness of the English to move in the direction of American institutions, such as the Massachusetts Institute of Technology\\". The report of the Barlow Committee in 1946 advised doubling the number of graduates in science and technology and establishing a new technological university. The idea of a \\"British MIT\\" was backed by influential scientists as politicians of the time, including Lord Cherwell, Sir Lawrence Bragg and Sir Edward Appleton, but there was also strong opposition: the University Grants Committee (UGC) argued that \\"an institution confined to a narrow range of subjects is unfavorable to the highest attainment\\", while the Committee of Vice-Chancellors and Principals stated that \\"a single-faculty institution cannot be a university\\". In 1952, the government stated their intention of \\"building up at least one institution of university rank devoted predominantly to the teaching and study of the various forms of technology\\". However, the continued opposition of the UGC led to a compromise being announced in 1953: Imperial College would be expanded, almost doubling in size (from 1,650 to 3,000 students) over the next ten years, as the \\"institution of university rank\\" promised in the government's policy, but would remain part of the University of London rather than becoming an independent technological university. City & Guilds, 1964 The expansion of the college led to a number of new buildings being erected. These included the Hill building in 1957 and the Physics building in 1960, and the completion of the East Quadrangle, built in four stages between 1959 and 1965. The building work also meant the demolition of the City and Guilds College building in 1962‚Äì63. The Imperial Institute building was also demolished between 1957 and 1967, although it remained partly occupied by the institute until 1962. Opposition from the Royal Fine Arts Commission and others meant that the central tower (now the Queen's Tower) was retained, with work carried out between 1966 and 1968 to make it free standing. New laboratories for biochemistry were established with the support of a ¬£350,000 grant from the Wolfson Foundation in 1959, which was also instrumental in attracting Ernst Chain to Imperial to head the biochemistry department. The new buildings were opened by the Queen in 1965. A special relationship between Imperial and the Indian Institute of Technology Delhi was established in 1963. Under this agreement, Imperial helped train Indian staff and academics from Imperial went on long term secondments to Delhi. In the same year, the Department of History of Science and Technology was established. From 1965, the UGC allocated 'indicated' funding to Imperial. While the grant continued to come thorough the University of London, the federal university, was no longer free to decide on Imperial's allocation out of its block grant. As the university used its grant to cross-subsidise weaker components of the federation, leading to complaints that stronger colleges were losing out, this was a situation envied by the other colleges. An agreement was made for the Architectural Association School of Architecture to join Imperial as a fourth constituent college, but this was dependent on the Architectural Association raising ¬£500,000 for a new building and did not take place. By the late 1960s, government funding was no longer so readily available, and in 1969, Imperial launched an appeal for ¬£2 million. Over half of this was to be spent on student accommodation, with the aim that students would spend at least one year in college-owned halls of residence, the rest to be spent supporting research and teaching and on developing the Silwood Park field station. The Department of Management Science was created in 1971 out of the Management Engineering Section of the Mechanical Engineering Department. The Associated Studies Department was established in 1972, introducing foreign language teaching to Imperial. The Humanities Department was formed in 1980 by merging the Associated Studies and History of Science departments. St Mary's Hospital = Imperial College of Science, Technology and Medicine = In 1988, Imperial merged with St Mary's Hospital Medical School under the Imperial College Act 1988. Amendments to the royal charter changed the formal name of the institution to The Imperial College of Science, Technology and Medicine and made St Mary's a constituent college. In 1995, Imperial launched its own academic publishing house, Imperial College Press, in partnership with World Scientific. Imperial merged with the National Heart and Lung Institute in 1995 and the Charing Cross and Westminster Medical School, Royal Postgraduate Medical School (RPMS) and the Institute of Obstetrics and Gynaecology in 1997. In the same year the Imperial College School of Medicine was formally established and all of the property of Charing Cross and Westminster Medical School, the National Heart and Lung Institute and the Royal Postgraduate Medical School were transferred to Imperial as the result of the Imperial College Act 1997. In 2000, Imperial merged with both the Kennedy Institute of Rheumatology and Wye College, the University of London's agricultural college in Wye, Kent, which later closed. 21st century Queen Elizabeth II opening the Imperial College Business School In 2001, the college announced that constituent colleges which had been incorporated into the college in the early 20th century would become fully integrated and lose their individual identity, with the college transitioning to a faculty system. This process was completed by 2003, forming the Faculties of Engineering, Medicine, Life Sciences, and Physical Sciences. The faculties of life and physical sciences were later merged to form the Faculty of Natural Sciences in 2005. In October 2002, a merger was proposed between Imperial and UCL that would have formed an institution with 28,000 students and a research budget of ¬£400 million ‚Äì more than Oxford and Cambridge combined. Richard Sykes, then Rector of Imperial, said that the merger \\"would lead to the creation of a truly world-class research-based institution with the resources necessary to compete effectively with the best in the world.\\" Strong opposition from academics, particularly at UCL where a \\"takeover by Imperial\\" was feared, led to the proposals being dropped a month later. In 2003, Imperial was granted degree-awarding powers in its own right by the Privy Council. The London Centre for Nanotechnology was established in the same year as a joint venture between UCL and Imperial College London. In 2004 the Imperial College Business School, originally known as the Tanaka Business School, and a new main entrance on Exhibition Road were opened by Queen Elizabeth II. It was renamed the Imperial College Business School in 2008. The UK Energy Research Centre was also established in 2004 and opened its headquarters at Imperial. On 9 December 2005, Imperial announced that it would commence negotiations to secede from the University of London. Imperial became fully independent of the University of London in July 2007. In July 2008 the Centre for Advanced Structural Ceramics was opened in the Materials department. In April 2011, Imperial and King's College London joined the UK Centre for Medical Research and Innovation (UKCMRI) as partners with a commitment of ¬£40 million each to the project. The centre was later renamed the Francis Crick Institute and opened on 9 November 2016. It the largest single biomedical laboratory in Europe. In March 2013, the Brevan Howard Centre for Financial Analysis was constructed using a ¬£20.1 million donation from Imperial alumnus and hedge fund founder Alan Howard. The centre researches financial economics and risk, and promotes investment and productivity across disciplines. The centre is designed as a bridge between the business school and business, policy-makers, academic experts, and the public. In 2014 the Dyson School of Design Engineering was opened following a ¬£12m donation by the James Dyson Foundation, along with undergraduate courses in Design Engineering. The college began moving into the new White City campus in 2016, with the launching of the Innovation Hub. This was followed by the opening of the Molecular Sciences Research Hub for the Department of Chemistry in 2018.

Walter G Moss, A History of Russia, Anthem, 2005, p 349 Photius also pleaded for Golitsyn's dismissal. Michael Jenkins, Arakcheev, Grand Vizier of the Russian Empire, Faber, 1969, p228-30 The Czar hesitated, and Photius then confronted Golitsyn with a curse, later confirmed by Metropolitan Seraphim; 'Anathema! You will be damned!'. Golitsyn was thus forced to resign, his ministry was abolished, and control of the Bible Societies passed to the Orthodox Church; in 1826 Photius and Seraphim persuaded Nicolas I to abolish it altogether. It was a 'surreal episode of fanaticism' by a 'psychologically unstable' priest. Barbara Skinner, op cit, p 93-5 Arakcheyev was the mastermind behind the plot Michael Jenkins, Arakcheev, Grand Vizier of the Russian Empire, Faber, 1969, p230 and Photius continued to support him in later years, for example insisting that Arakcheyev's murdered mistress should be 'buried in holy ground'. Michael Jenkins, Arakcheev, Grand Vizier of the Russian Empire, Faber, 1969, p248-50 Countess Orlova is buried alongside Photius near the Church of the Annunciation in Novgorod. In popular culture Pushkin capitalised on the rumours of an affair with Orlova by writing three short satirical poems: Photius was a 'half saintly fool who means no good'; the countess 'pious on the whole/ To God devoted full her soul/ And gave her flesh without a fight/ To Photius, Archimandrite'.

(19.1 √ó 21.3 cm) The pew group is a rare type of pottery Staffordshire figure, apparently made only in the 1740s. Typically it has two or three \\"rigidly posed\\" figures sitting on a high-backed bench, often with a woman in the centre; great attention is paid to details of hair and clothing. The setting is not church, as the usual name suggests, but a comfortable home or inn, where high-backed settles (protecting from draughts) were a common piece of furniture. Details are picked out in dark brown or black glaze, and dogs and musical instruments may be depicted,Poole, 56‚Äì57 (online); Wood, 22; Hughes, 181‚Äì183, 182 quoted or the gentlemen may be taking snuff.Christie's; V&A;, \\"The man on the left wears a black tricorne hat and is taking snuff from his box. The man on the right in a black cap raises his left hand and takes snuff\\". The two most elaborate group subjects in Staffordshire figures were the \\"arbour group\\", with two lovers seated in front of a bocage of foliage, and the pew group. The arbour group is a simplification of porcelain groups, whereas the pew group is more original to Staffordshire. Both types are \\"flatbacks\\", plain at the rear, as they were designed to be placed against a wall.Wood, 21‚Äì23 The figures in arbour groups were already mostly moulded, but the pew groups were shaped and constructed individually, from rolled and moulded pieces of clays, with much use of \\"slabs\\" rolled flat.Hughes, 181‚Äì182; Poole, 56‚Äì57\\"Pew Group\\", Fitzwilliam Museum Despite the sculptural quality given by the contrast of thin sheets and round forms, this technique was not used for later figures.V&A; Lady with lapdog and two musicians, 1740s It seems likely that they were made as individual commissions by potteries mostly making more routine wares, although almost none are inscribed with names, either of makers or patrons (see below for exception). It is possible the figures were intended as portraits of individuals. Their dating relies as much as anything on the style of the costumes, which are at the least genteel.Poole, 56‚Äì57; Note on British Museum example. Pew groups are rare, and now extremely expensive. A pew group of c. 1745 sold for $168,000 at a Christie's auction in 2006,Christie's and in 1986 Sotheby's sold one for $179,520.\\"Passionate Collectors set new Auction Highs\\", by Rita Reif, 22 January 1987, New York Times There are also modern forgeries and imitations; some imitators have acquired their own collectors.Wood, 22; \\"Late 20th- century\\" imitation, sold as such; another.Another Glaisher Fitzwillam example, \\"circa 1900 ‚Äî before 1925; probably 20th century fake\\" An even more rare group, intermediate with the arbours, but sharing the pew group technique, was Adam and Eve standing with a very small tree (and snake) between them, and a bench rather oddly placed behind them.Wood, 22; Fitzwillam example; Another Glaisher Fitzwillam example, \\"circa 1900 ‚Äî before 1925; probably 20th century fake\\" Construction Couple with a pug dog, c. 1745. 5 1/2 √ó 5 3/4 in., 2 lb. (14 √ó 14.6 cm, 0.9 kg) The settle framework is made from pieces rolled flat; the centre of the back may be decorated, either by piercing or incisions, which may be filled with brown slip. The arms and men's legs are rolled cylinders; the ladies have no legs underneath their wide skirts. For the clothes, thin cut slabs were fixed to a cylinder torso, with the many extra details made using a variety of techniques including stamps and roulettes (patterned roller wheels). Some of the dark details use slip painted on, but others such as shoes and cuffs were modelled in dark clay and attached.Hughes, 182‚Äì183 History The groups are usually in salt-glazed stoneware, of a Staffordshire type newly developed in the 1730s by John Astbury, which was mostly used for tablewares.Wood, 21 This is unlike the single but smaller Staffordshire figures, which are usually in glazed earthenware, which may be agateware, mixing white and brown clay immediately before shaping to give a marbled effect. The groups were probably \\"made by a mere handful of potters\\";V&A; they have been associated with the well-known potters Thomas Astbury and Aaron Wood, but on little evidence.Savage and Newman, 220 A group that are lead-glazed and have circular benches with purple and brown highlights are impressed underneath with \\"Wedgwood\\", but this is not for Josiah Wedgwood but one of his many potter relatives.Hughes, 183 The Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge has six examples from the collection of the Cambridge mathematician James Whitbread Lee Glaisher (1848‚Äì1928), including two Adam and Eve groups, one probably fake,Fitzwilliam database, searched on \\"Pew group\\"; \\"Object of the Month: June\\", Professor Hedgehog's Journal; The Glaisher Fitzwillam example, \\"circa 1900 ‚Äî before 1925; probably 20th century fake\\" plus another example bequeathed from another collection.Fitzwilliam database, AA, EC.7-1943 All show just two figures.

At a time when there were no academic courses nor textbooks, offered in women's history, Bell compiled images of women's participation in society from artworks and began presenting lectures to present roles women had held in society. In 1971, a year after the first women's studies course was offered in the United States, Bell taught her own class on the subject and prepared a reading guide for the course which would become one of the first textbooks to treat women's history from an academic perspective. She taught and researched for more than four decades as an independent scholar at the Clayman Institute for Gender Research. Posthumously, a conference named in her honor was held at Stanford and a plaque recognizing her contributions to women's history was dedicated by the history department of Stanford University. Early life Susan Groag was born on 25 January 1926 in Troppau (now known as Opava), in the German-speaking Sudetenland area of Czechoslovakia. Her father was a lawyer and both of her parents had Jewish heritage, though they converted to Lutheranism. In 1938, when the Germans annexed Sudetenland, Groag was no longer allowed to go to school. To protect his wife and daughter, Groag's father arranged a visa for his wife to work as a domestic in England, and dispatched them via train from Prague in January 1939. While her mother worked as a maid, they tried to arrange a visa for Groag's father, but were unsuccessful. He was unable to leave Czechoslovakia and was one of the victims of the Theresienstadt concentration camp. Groag attended a boarding school in Haywards Heath and upon graduating in 1943, she moved to Wales where she attended a high school program developed by the Czech government-in-exile. The curricula was designed to train students to help rebuild their homeland. When the war ended in 1945, Groag returned to Czechoslovakia with her classmates. Unable to reconcile her memories with the post-war reality, or identify with the nationalist aims of the country, within a year, Groag returned to London, where her mother had remained. Sidelined until 1950 by illness, in the second half of that year Groag married Alfred E. Barrington in Chelsea and moved to the United States in October. After a few years, the Barringtons divorced and in 1960, Groag married Ronald Bell, a physicist who lived in Woodside, California. Career Proximity to Stanford University, led Bell to pursue a long-held dream to earn a university education and she graduated in 1964 with a Bachelor of Arts in history. She applied for Stanford's PhD program but was denied entry because she was too old and instead earned a master's degree in history from Santa Clara University in 1970. Her dissertation focused on the lives of Elizabeth Gaskell, Caroline Herschel, Mary Somerville, and Frances Trollope, four women whose careers began later in their lives and who succeeded without formal education. During her studies, in the late 1960s, Bell began presenting lectures for the speaker's bureau, Women Perspectives. The lectures focused on women as depicted as subjects of western art over the previous two millennia. Centering her talks around images she had organized into a slide projection show, Bell's lectures used a wide range of source materials from medieval manuscript illuminations to gardening imagery to demonstrate women's work, status, and roles in society over time. The socio-political events of the late 1960s including the civil rights movement, anti-Vietnam War movement, and women's liberation movement led to pressure on academic institutions to add courses on women's studies which rejected the notion that women were second class citizens. The first academic treatment of women's experiences as a field of study in the United States was launched at San Diego State University in 1970. The following year, Bell developed a women's studies course for Ca√±ada College. Lacking textbooks, she prepared a reading guide which was published as a textbook, Women, from the Greeks to the French Revolution, in 1973 and reprinted in 1980. She lectured in the history department of Santa Clara University and traveled throughout the country presenting women's history lectures from Bryn Mawr College to the University of New Mexico. In the late 1970s, Bell joined with other scholars at Stanford's Center for Research on Women (CROW), now the Clayman Institute for Gender Research, to form a network of independent women scholars. She was one of the first affiliated scholars of CROW and later was appointed as a permanent senior scholar. In 1982, Bell published Medieval Women Book Owners: Arbiters of Lay Piety and Ambassadors of Culture in Signs. In the article, she argued that noble women in medieval society, operating within their own socially defined roles became catalysts for cultural change, through their relationship to books. Teaching their children and commissioning books for them; influencing devotional publishers to write Books of Hours in vernacular languages rather than Latin; and bringing their books with them to new courts upon marriage were all ways in which women participated in cultural exchange. The book became widely influential and inspired other scholars to analyze how women were obscured in historical records. For more than four decades, Bell worked as an independent scholar at the Clayman Institute. In addition to her own publishing, she collaborated on such works as Women, the Family, and Freedom: The Debate in the Documents: 1750-1950 with Karen Offen. Published in 1983, the work presented translated documents related to the debates that occurred in the period on whether women should lead public or traditional lives. On the basis of its scholarship, Bell and Offen created training seminars for Stanford and Bell and Barbara Gelpi taught a Stanford/Oxford seminar series focused on British gender depictions. In 1986 she co-edited with Marilyn Yalom, Revealing Lives: Autobiography, Biography, and Gender and in 1991, wrote her own memoir, Between Worlds: Czechoslovakia, England, and America. Her final major published work, The Lost Tapestries of the City of Ladies (2004) traced the journey to unsuccessfully locate tapestries owned by various European royal houses which depicted imagery from Christine de Pizan's Le Livre de la cit√© des dames and how the tapestries survived even when Pizan's writing had fallen into obscurity. Death and legacy Bell died on 24 June 2015 at her home in Palo Alto, California. In January 2016, a conference was hosted by the Clayman Institute to pay homage to her contributions to women's history and in June 2016 a plaque was dedicated by the history department of Stanford University in her honor. Part of Bell's papers (1978-1982) are housed in the special collections of the Stanford University Libraries. In 2017, the Association of Art Historians hosted a conference in the UK at Loughborough University to evaluate the legacy of Bell's Medieval Women Book Owners, thirty-five years after its initial publication. That same year, Stanford University Press launched the Susan Groag Bell Publication Fund in Women's History to support the \\"publication of outstanding books in the field of women‚Äôs history\\".

Criteria The War was fought between the British HEIC and the Kingdom of Burma, primarily over Burmese incursions into north east India. The war ended in February 1826 with the Treaty of Yandabo, in which Burma ceded territory to the HEIC, paid a large indemnity and agreed to sign a commercial treaty. The medal was authorised by Lord Amherst, the Governor-General of India, in April 1826. It was awarded to HEIC forces only, to native Indian officers and officials in gold (about 750 awarded) and to native other ranks in silver (about 24,000 awarded).Note: Mayo page 211 states: 758 gold and 33,133 silver medals awarded to the Bengal and Madras presidencies, of which 197 and 9,022 unclaimed from Madras. 10 and 100 respectively were retained for future claims, the rest returned to the mint as bullion. This indicates 571 gold and 24,211 silver medals issued or retained. The only European to receive the medal, in gold, was General Sir Archibald Campbell who commanded the British and Indian forces during the campaign. The medal was limited to those involved in the actual fighting, it also being awarded posthumously ‚Äì to the heirs of those who had died. Europeans who took part, including officers in HEIC service and members of the British Army and Royal Navy, were not eligible for the medal. However, surviving British officers, soldiers and sailors qualified for the Army of India Medal with clasp Ava, when this medal was established in 1851. As they had already received the Burma Medal, native Indians did not receive the Army of India Medal for the campaign. Description The medal was struck at the Calcutta Mint in gold and in silver. Both types were in diameter with the following design:Medals of the World: UK: HEIC's Medal for Burma, 1824-26 The obverse, designed by William Daniell , depicts the elephant of Burma crouching in submission to the victorious British lion, while behind the Burmese standard is lowered before the Union Flag, there being palm trees behind. In the exergue is the Persian inscription The Elephant of Ava is obedient to the Lion of England, year 1826. The reverse, designed by William Wyon, depicts the storming of the Shwedagon Pagoda in Rangoon. To the left is the Irrawaddy Flotilla, with the British commander General Campbell directing the attack from under a palm tree. In the exergue is the Persian inscription A medal for the victorious British soldiers of Ava. No clasps were authorised and the medal was issued unnamed.Collett, D.W, Medals Yearbook, (1981) Published by Medal Year Book. The suspension was either a ring attached to the medal by way of a steel clip, or by a straight bar attached to a steel claw. The medal was worn on the left chest, suspended from a wide ribbon of crimson with dark blue edges. This was the British 'military ribbon' previously used for the Army Gold Medal and Cross, the Waterloo Medal and later the Military General Service Medal. The Burma Medal was the first HEIC campaign medal to be issued with a distinct ribbon, earlier medals having been worn around the neck, most by a cord.

The UNSWP was incorporated into the UP in 1971. The Windhoek publisher John Meinert decided in 1927 that an Afrikaans language paper was needed to complement the English language Windhoek Advertiser and the German language Allgemeine Zeitung. Ernst Schlengemann accepted the post of editor. The first edition was published on April 8, 1927, the second-Afrikaans-speaking daily after the short-lived Suidwes Nuus (1922-1923). Die Suidwes-Afrikaner was initially meant to be a voice for Afrikaners in SWA, where Dutch and English in 1920 had replaced German (the former colonial power's tongue) as the official language. The editor grew the paper into a major political factor and later ran as a candidate for the UNSWP for the 1929 legislative elections. Schlengemann ran for the Windhoek-Sentraal constituency, but lost in a landslide to the National Party of South West Africa candidate. In 1929, he represented South West Africa at the foundation of the Federasie van Afrikaanse Kultuurverenigings in Bloemfontein. On May 8, 1930, he died of pneumonia in Windhoek Central Hospital. He wrote the first Afrikaans poem written in SWA, \\"Die Namib-woestyn.\\" Die Suidwes-Afrikaner endured longer as an opposition UP mouthpiece than any Afrikaans-language UP paper in South Africa. The growth in popularity of Die Suidwester (the NP newspaper) so overwhelmed its competitor in readership that the UP paper stopped publishing in 1976. At the end of 1977, Die Republikein emerged under editor Jan Spies as a competitor to Die Suidwester, which won the battle in December 21, 1990, when Republikein was forced to change from daily to twice-weekly and ultimately weekly publication.

While this relation cannot currently be attributed to one government in Libya, generally, this relation refers to a contested relationship between Turkey and the pro-Turkish Government of National Accord. Libya has a functional embassy in Ankara and Turkey has its counterpart in Tripoli. Turkey currently occupies bases in Libya with Al-Watiya Air Base being a major airbase in the west, and Port of Misrata being most notable naval base acquired but contested during the 2020 Turkish military intervention in the Second Libyan Civil War. History The Ottoman Empire conquered the coastal areas of Libya during the mid-16th century and had made a great impact on the society of Libya. By then known as Tripolitania under the Ottomans, the province enjoyed a degree of autonomy, though unstable and varied. In the 18th century, Ahmed Karamanli founded the semi-independence Karamanli dynasty, which ruled Libya and still acknowledged Ottoman control. Under his reign, Libya was one of the most prosperous parts of the empire with strong Libyan , but due to his defiance to the Turks, it drew hostility indirectly from the Ottomans. His successors, however, were not as successful as Ahmed, and the dynasty would immediately collapse in late 18th century, and the Barbary Wars launched by the United States only ensured the complete collapse of Karamanli authority. By then, until the Italian conquest, Ottoman rule in Libya was secured, but it was neglected from the mainland due to its lack of development. After the Italo- Turkish War (1911‚Äì1912), Turkey and Libya lost formal connection as the Kingdom of Italy conquered Libya. It was not until 1947 when the two nations rebuild their links. =20th century to 2011= With the Kingdom of Libya established, Turkey and Libya maintained cordial relations, with both are commonly Muslim majority nations. In 1969, a bloodless coup occurred in Libya while King Idris was in Ankara, Turkey for medical treatment. Subsequently, King Idris condemned the coup, but lacked authority to be against it. Eventually, the Libyan King had to live in exile until 1983 when he died in Cairo. Since the fall of Senussi dynasty, Turco-Libyan relations were driven between cooperations and hostilities. Despite Muammar Gaddafi provided Turkey with spare parts to its US-made aircraft during the Turkish invasion of Cyprus, as a U.S. arms embargo was imposed on Turkey, and preferred buying Turkish stuffs, he had also created controversies, accusing Turkey for the Kurdish question, and provoked Turkey by supporting Kurdish independence. This was reconfirmed in 2011 by Jawad Mella, the President of Kurdish National Congress in exile. Thus, tie between Turkey and Libya was severely damaged until 2011. Libyan conflict Although Turkey opposed and accused \\"Sarkozy of pursuing French interests over liberation of Libyan people\\" and on March 20 it took an observant position. Turkey in 2011 was also among the first to immediately cut ties with Gaddafi's Libya, demanding Gaddafi quit the Government and Turkey would offer him exile. Gaddafi refused to do so and Turkey threw its support behind anti-Gaddafi forces, notably the National Transitional Council in July 2011. With the outbreak of the second Libyan Civil War, Turkey remains supportive of the UN-recognized Government of National Accord in Tripoli, against Haftar-based House of Representatives in Tobruk. Haftar's vehement anti-Turkish stance had contributed to ongoing hostility between Turkey and Tobruk Government, as well as Turkey has transported weapons and ammunitions to the government in Tripoli. Turkey's Vice President, Fuat Oktay, accused indirectly Haftar as the trouble-maker who wanted to prevent peace for Libya and had left the conference for peace in Libya in November 2018. Haftar had remained as belligerent against Turkey, led by Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan, and Tobruk-based forces often seized Turkish ships transporting arms to the army in Tripoli. Following the 2019‚Äì20 Western Libya campaign led by Haftar, Turkey had shown deep concerns and secretly condemned Haftar for destabilizing Libya. In November 2019, Turkey stated that it signed an agreement with Libya's internationally recognized government on maritime boundaries in the Mediterranean Sea, in addition to a deal on security and military cooperation (see Libya‚ÄìTurkey maritime deal). In 2019, the United Nations reported that Jordan, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates have systematically violated the Libyan arms embargo. Adding that ‚Äúroutinely and sometimes blatantly supplied weapons with little effort to disguise the source‚Äù. Also, the Libyan National Army accused the Turkish authorities of supporting terrorist groups in Libya for many years, added that the Turkish support has evolved from just logistic support to a direct interference using military aircraft to transport mercenaries, as well as ships carrying weapons, armored vehicles and ammunition to support terrorism in Libya. However, these accusations were made after pro-Haftar forces lost control over the strategic town of Gharyan after anti-Haftar forces, who back Libya's internationally recognized government, managed to push back pro-Haftar forces. In retaliation for his defeat, Haftar, who is backed by the United Arab Emirates and Egypt, responded by threatening Turkey and vowed to target all Turkish ships and companies, ban flights to and from Turkey, and arrest Turkish nationals in Libya. Other false accusations by Haftar after his loss of Gharyan were refuted by both the GNA and authorities in Gharyan. On 2 January 2020, Turkey's parliament approved a bill to deploy troops into Libya to back the UN-recognised government in the capital, after forces loyal to Haftar, a rival administration, launched an offensive. The legislation passed with a 325-184 vote, however the details of the deployment have yet to be revealed in terms of amount and timing. On 6 January, Turkish troops began moving into Libya. On 8 January 2020, after talks between presidents Tayyip Erdogan and Russia's Vladimir Putin (which supports Haftar's force) in Istanbul, Turkey and Russia urged all parties in Libya to declare a ceasefire at midnight on 12 January.

Bandaranaike's foreign policy emphasized the idea of non-alignment however he had strong ties with socialist and communist nations as well as with Arab nations and India.

Suez Crisis and Arab nations When the Suez Crisis occurred Bandaranaike stood by Egypt and supported its right to nationalize the Suez Canal Company going against Israel and the UK in the UN. In his address to the United Nations Assembly, Bandaranaike defended Egyptian president Gamal Abdel Nasser by saying Suez Canal rightfully belonged to Egypt. His effort to resolve the Suez Crisis, pleased the Arab Countries. Thus Sri Lanka was appointed as a member of the Suez Advisory Board. Sri Lankan ties with Arab nations grew even stronger under the administration of his wife Sirimavo Bandaranaike when Sri Lanka closed down the Israel embassy in support of the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO). Sri Lanka was among the first countries to recognize the state of Palestine when it was declared as a state in 1988. People's Republic of China Bandaranaike Memorial International Conference Hall in Colombo gifted by China to Sri Lanka Chinese premier Zhou Enlai was invited to participate at the ninth celebrations of Sri Lanka‚Äôs Independence on February 4, 1957 by prime minister Bandaranaike.The visit paved the way for the establishment of diplomatic relations with the People‚Äôs Republic of China. On February 7, 1957, China and Sri Lanka established diplomatic relations. China gifted the Bandaranaike Memorial International Conference Hall to Sri Lanka in memory of prime minister SWRD Bandaranaike. The People‚Äôs Republic of China donated LKR 35 million towards the construction of BMICH. China gave 5 Shanghai Class Fast Gun Boats to Sri Lanka which were named \\"Sooraya\\" \\"Weeraya\\" \\"Ranakamee\\" \\"Dakshaya\\" and \\"Balawatha\\" to represent the initials of S.W.R.D Bandaranaike. India Unlike the previous United National Party regimes Bandaranaike maintained a fruitful relationship with India. Indian Prime Minister Nehru called Bandaranaike the Silver tongued orator of Asia. Soviet Union Sri Lanka and the Soviet Union established diplomatic relations in 1956 under the leadership of Bandaranaike. Soviet Union granted 120 million LKR as economic aid and provided technical assistance for the Colombo Plan. British Bandaranaike International Airport Even after Sri Lanka gained independence in 1948 the British kept Trincomalee harbor as a naval base and the Katunayake airport as a airbase. These bases were strategically importance because of its location in the Indian Ocean. On October 15, 1957, the Trincomalee naval base was taken over by the Sri Lankan Government from the British Navy in a ceremony attended by Prime Minister S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike marking a significant milestone in the path to gaining complete independence. On November 1, 1957 the British airbase in Katunayake which was then known as the Royal Air Force Base Negombo was taken over by the Sri Lankan Government. The airbase was renamed Katunayake airbase. In 1970, Katunayake was named Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA) to commemorate Prime Minister S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike.

Development  = Start of the 20th century = Port of Mainz The Ingelheimer Aue was originally an island. The construction of the port of Mainz starting in 1880 included the construction of a dam that connected the island with the mainland, creating the river harbour north of the tax port (see illustration). This new harbour was inaugurated on 6 June 1887.http://zollhafen-mainz.de/files/download/Hafenchronik-1887-2007.pdf \\"Hafenchronik\\" - Eine Sonderpublikation der Stadtwerke Mainz AG zum 120-j√§hrigen Jubil√§um des Mainzer Zoll- und Binnenhafens im Juni 2007 Starting at the end of the 19th century, an industrial area developed on the previous island. The first development was a gas and electric works, from 1899, as well as certain factories, for example the metal works of Wilhelm Hannss. In the subsequent years, a number of larger factories were built, for example Blendax (1931), Werner & Mertz (1908), and R√∂mheld & Moelle (1906). Between 1906 and 1997 the Aue was connected to the Mainz tram network (Terminus: Ingelheimer Aue). The piers of the Kaiserbr√ºcke bridge, which is part of the railway ring around Mainz, the Mainz bypass, stand on the embankment. The bridge was inaugurated in 1904 by Kaiser Wilhelm II and the Hessian Grand Duke Ernst Ludwig in the presence of Reich Chancellor Bernhard von B√ºlow. = During National Socialism = In 1944, a camp for forced laborers was set up on the site of the Dr. Ing.

In early maps, the stream is usually called \\"Oxen Run\\" and in 1892 the U.S. Geological Survey still labelled the stream as \\"Oxen Run\\" on its maps. Late in that year they changed the spelling they used, and others have followed suit, though it's unclear what led to the spelling change. Government officials and mapmakers often don't make a distinction between Oxon Creek and Oxon Run, instead treating Oxon Creek as a continuation of Oxon Run, but USGS still does. USGS first started labeling it as Oxon Creek in 1892.  Geography  The headwaters of the stream originate in the Coral Hills area of Prince George's County near Francis Scott Key Elementary School. From there it flows west and then south for to a confluence with Barnaby Run (sometimes known as Winkle Doodle Run), forming Oxon Creek which drains to the Potomac River and the Chesapeake Bay. The watershed area of Oxon Run is about in Prince George's County and in Washington.District of Columbia. Department of Health. Watts Branch Watershed Implementation Plan. January 2004. Some consider Oxon Creek to be a continuation of Oxon Run, but USGS considers them separate streams. The stream flows mostly through open land in Prince George's County. It first flows through Coral Hills to a stormwater management pond near Seton Way where it combines with water from a storm drainpipe that empties the Penn Station Shopping Center parking lot. From there it flows through a floodplain forest north of Pennsylvania Avenue interrupted by a concrete box culvert under Brooks Drive; a series of galvanized steal culverts under private property, a church parking lot and Quarter Avenue; and, at the end of the forest, through a concrete lined channel beside and beneath Pennsylvania Avenue. South of Pennsylvania Ave, it runs along the edge of Cedar Hill and Lincoln Memorial cemeteries before passing through a strip of parkland including Suitland Parkway and Oxon Run Valley Park at the same time passing under the Suitland Parkway at Naylor Road and then under Southern Avenue, into D.C. Map of the Oxon Run Parkway Once in D.C., the stream flows through parkland. Upon entering D.C. it flows through the Oxon Run Parkway managed by the National Park Service. The parkway contains four northern magnolia bogs, the only ones known to be on Park Service land, and is primarily made up of land from Camp Simms. The stream then flows through Oxon Run Park where it is in a concrete- lined channel. After passing under South Capitol Street, it flows through a natural channel between NPS's forested Bald Eagle Hill and a former landfill site owned by D.C. Just inside the D.C. Boundary, it meets with Barnaby Run and becomes Oxon Creek. Within D.C., there are approximately 38 sewersheds with storm drain outfalls discharging into Oxon Run. Oxon Run was originally a meandering riffle-pool type sequence stream, with a gravel or sand bed; but in the 20th Century it was changed by flood control projects and significant urbanization of its watershed. In addition, many of its tributaries have been converted to storm drains. History Up until the 20th century, the Oxon Run watershed was a lightly settled valley filled with plantations, farms and orchards. First a part of Maryland it was split between the District of Columbia and Maryland when the former was created in 1800. In 1855 much of it was owned by the District's largest slaveowner, George Washington Young as a part of Nonesuch Plantation and the Young family owned the land for generations starting in the 18th Century. Within the District, Oxon Run was contained within Washington County until the whole of the District was unified in 1871. There were dozens of properties and many owners in the valley, the names of some of which live on in the streets, most notably Wheeler Road and Livingston Road. The first boom in the valley came during the Civil War. The Army built forts on the hills above Oxon Run and the expansion of the population of the city led to the extension of formal roads into the valley. Wheeler Road, named for Colonel J.H. Wheeler, was extended across the stream in 1870, and two years later the first bridge was built across it to serve the road. Additional roads and bridges were built across the stream around the same time forming Marlboro Road, Suitland Road, Livingston Mill Road (later shortened to Livingston Road and then partially renamed Atlantic Avenue) and Walker Road (later named Naylor Road). All were built during the post Civil War boom and all were in place by 1878. The plantations, orchards and dairy farms that filled the valley eventually gave way to the needs of the city. The first developments to encroach on the valley were a pair of cemeteries and a military base. In 1895, the Cedar Hill Cemetery was founded as Forest Lake Cemetery along the east bank of the stream north of Suitland Road, and in 1904 the military established a firing range that straddled the stream in DC as part of Camp Simms. Nonetheless, in 1912, the stream was still described as flowing through a \\"gentle, graceful valley...between steep, wooded hills.\\" In 1927, Lincoln Memorial Cemetery was established just south of the Cedar Hill Cemetery on the south side of Suitland Road. It was the second cemetery in the Washington area to admit African-Americans, and is the oldest one remaining. Quarter Avenue in Maryland was built across the stream prior to 1938. Even with these changes, the watershed remained largely rural until World War II. In the 1920s Congress took steps to preserve much of the green space outside the old city of Washington, with special focus on the stream and river valleys, including that of Oxon Run. In 1924, Congress created the National Capital Park and Planning Commission (NCPPC) to create a park and playground system for the National Capital and by 1926, they had begun making plans for a \\"parkway\\" or park system that would include land in the Oxon Run valley. By 1930, NCPPC had begun purchasing narrow strips of land along the shores of the stream for the \\"Oxon Run Parkway.\\" This coincided with a report from NCPPC identifying Oxon Run as a possible water source for Maryland. The report stated that a sewer would be needed through the valley to protect the waters of Oxon Run from pollution. After a 1937 flood of Oxon Run, NCPPC decided to widen the parkway by purchasing more land in the valley between the District line and the Camp Simms rifle range. This prevented the construction of homes in the floodplain and allowed for the construction of the sewer project, the Oxon Run interceptor, that was completed in 1939. NCPC continued buying land in the valley from 1939 to 1944. By the end of 1944, the Parkway extended across the entire District, with the exception of the portion within Camp Simms. Use of the Camp Simms firing range ended in 1953 due to urban encroachment. In 1958, the Defense Department transferred the land to the General Services Administration and later 94 acres of the site was added to the Oxon Run Parkway. In the 1960s an unlined landfill was constructed along the east bank just south of South Capitol Street which was intended to become recreational space, but never did. Following World War II, preservation of the valley was extended into Maryland. In 1946, President Truman signed an amendment to the Capper-Crampton Act which, among other things, called for the Oxon Run valley to be preserved from the District line to the Marlboro Pike (then known as Marlboro Road). By 1953, M-NCPPC had acquired 5 acres along the stream in Maryland and planned to acquire another 367. 17 additional acres were purchased in 1955 and that land used to build the Hillcrest Heights Recreation Center. In 1961, M-NCPPC acquired the Oxon Run Golf Course, located on the north side of Oxon Run between 23rd and 28th Avenue in Hillcrest Heights, and operated it until it was closed in June 1986. The 9-hole course, the first public one in Prince George's County, was built in 1954. While the land around it was preserved, Oxon Run was channelized and straightened for flood control. Sections near the Potomac and along Cedar Hill and Lincoln Memorial Cemeteries were channelized prior to World War II. The stream in the Suitland Parkway was channelized by 1949 and in 1959, as part of the work extending Pennsylvania Avenue, the stream was realigned and placed in a concrete-line channel. After Tropical Storm Agnes caused extensive flooding in the valley in 1972, 2,800 feet of the stream was dredged. The largest channelization project came in 1978 and 1979 when the D.C. Stormwater Management Authority constructed a 7,920 foot long, concrete-lined channel for the stream from 13th Street, SE to South Capitol Street. More recently, in 1995, WMATA stabilized and realigned the channel near the Suitland Parkway to allow construction of the piers for the Naylor Road Station. Meanwhile, construction of the Oxon Run Sewer Interceptor in the 1930s and the World War II population growth enabled another housing boom in the Oxon Run valley and an expansion of the road network. Town centers at Silver Hill, Suitland and Dupont Heights filled the watershed with urban and suburban housing and, to provide transportation to them, South Capitol Street, Branch Avenue, Shadyside Avenue and Brooks Drive were bridged over the stream between 1938 and 1942. From 1943 to 1944, the military constructed the Suitland Parkway, then known as the Camp Springs Highway, through the stream valley to connect Bolling Air Force Base to Andrews Air Force Base, crossing Oxon Run at Walker Road. Between 1947 and 1951, bridges for the 23rd Parkway and the entrance road to Cedar Hill Cemetery were built across the stream. In 1959 Pennsylvania Avenue was extended to Forestville, MD through the Oxon Run valley and over the stream at Shadyside Avenue and around the same time 4th Street bridged the stream. The last road bridge over the stream, at Southern Avenue, was built in 1980. The last transportation development in the valley was the final section of Metro's Green Line from Congress Heights to Branch Avenue which was built by WMATA from 1995 to 2001. It extended Metrorail under Oxon Run and the Parkway through a tunnel, and then over the stream twice, once just south of the D.C. boundary and a second time near the intersection of Suitland Parkway and Naylor Road before turning east along the Oxon Run's tributary to Suitland. In 1971, the land between 13th Street and South Capitol became Oxon Run Park, and was placed under the control of the District government, while the land between 13th and Southern Avenue remained the Oxon Run Parkway under the management of the National Park Service. In 1975 local officials began planning improvements in the Park, but didn't complete those plans until 1984 because of funding limitations. The plan called for several miles of jogging and bike trails, picnic areas, ball fields, an amphitheater, basketball and tennis courts, and a nature trail. Work began in 1984 and included 5 pedestrian bridges over the stream. Between 2016 and 2017 the trail system was expanded and rehabilitated.  Water quality  Oxon Run is in a highly urbanized area, and its water quality has been rated as poor by government agencies. The stream has been polluted by stormwater runoff, dumped trash, sewer leaks and contamination from an old firing range and an unlined landfill. Much of the stream is in concrete channels or culverts. Virtually all of the streams in the watershed are unstable, with stream bank erosion producing 18,000 tons of sediment per year.

Sexual violence was common on the part of Nationalist forces and their allies during the Civil War. Falangist rearguard troops would rape and murder women in cemeteries, hospitals, farmhouses, and prisons. They would rape, torture and murder socialists, young girls, nurses and milicianas. Regular Nationalist soldiers engaged in similar patterns of rape, torture and murder in places like Maials, Callus and Cantalpino. Moroccan Foreign Legionaries were used to commit rape against women to instil terror among local populaces, using rape as a weapon of war. Women in prison were also raped, often facing death if they refused to have sex with their captors. The exact extent of the problem will likely never be known as there was less record keeping around women, and quantification attempts have largely resulted in the erasure of women's history. After the Civil War ended, Spanish men returned home to a culture that insisted women were completely subservient to men, and where men were allowed to have sex with prostitutes and otherwise be promiscuous. Women were taught to be subservient and that their happiness was not important. This culture encouraged domestic violence by husbands towards wives, and it included rape. Laws made non-consensual sex illegal in some cases, but there was tremendous social pressure not to report this behavior. Women with Republican ties were often raped until at least the 1960s, with social acceptance of the practice. These women often tried to move to cities to become more anonymous. Some were raped and sexually harassed in prison, including Lidia Falc√≥n O'Neill. As a result of Franco's death in 1975 and the democratic transition starting, the first protest condemning violence against women was held in Barcelona in 1976. Age of consent laws changed two years later, along with laws about honesty. Men were also legally able to be considered rape victims. Divorce was legalized in 1981. Other legal reforms took place in 1983. Still, rape was not treated as a serious institutional problem inside Spain and victims had little recourse. In 1987, Spain's Supreme Court ruled that rape victims did not need to prove they actively fought off their rapist to lodge a complaint. Historical memory laws in Spain have resulted in more attention about to the violence faced by women during the Spanish Civil War and the Francoist period. The Junta de Andalusia started offering women compensation for violence against them in 2010. Court cases also began to be explored against perpetrators of these crimes, with some action taking place in Spain but most of the attempts to prosecute taking place in Argentina.  History  = Francoist forces in the Civil War period (1936 - 1939) = Repression against women by Nationalist forces has been difficult to understand as historians have traditionally been obsessed with quantifying the number dead, imprisoned and wounded. As much more detailed records were kept about men than women, the history of Francoist repression specifically targeting women has historically underrepresented women or devalued the specific repression women faced in this period. Much of the violence in this period was gendered, and there were efforts to dismiss, hide or downplay violence against women as part of further efforts to repress women. Quantification has largely resulted in the erasure of women's history. Sexual violence was a commonly used tactic by Nationalist forces during the Spanish Civil War, aimed exclusively at women. It was coupled with other violence aimed at women, including forcing women to drink castor oil so they would uncontrollably soil themselves, taking children away from women in prison, taking children away from mothers and placing them in Nationalist homes before the mother was executed. Women were considered prizes of war; their bodies were considered part of a battlefield that Nationalist forces had to defeat. The purpose was to force women into subordination or to use women's trauma to control male family members. Women in Nationalist prisons were raped. As a form of punishment, women sometimes were paraded through the streets wearing very little clothing. They were made to sing \\"Face to the sun\\". Their heads were often shaved in an attempt to humiliate them by stripping them of one of their outward signs of femininity. Many of these practices were borrowed from Italian fascists. To add to the humiliation of these women, many had their households ransacked, with all their valuables stolen by Nationalist supporters who then sold all their property on the black market. The Franco regime's actions against women during the Civil War were flagrant and unprosecuted violations of the 1898 Hague Convention and 1929 Geneva Convention. The total numbers of women who were victims of sexual violence and abuse during the Civil War will never be known. Falangist troops acted as rearguard troops, serving in places captured by troops or where there had never really been any nationalist opposition. Daria and Mercedes Buxad√©, two sisters from Barcelona, were participating in Republican action against Franco's nationalist forces in Mallorca in 1936. After being caught, Falangist troops gave them a virginity test, and then brutally and repeatedly raped the sisters. Margalida Jaume was in Mallorca in the same time, and Falangist also raped her. Pilar S√°nchez, the wife of a socialist party member, was also hiding from Falangists. She too was discovered by a group of four Falangists who beat and raped her, before taking to her a cemetery where they raped her again and then executed her. All were thrown into common graves. During the Civil War, Falangists raped women in the courtyard of the hospital in Oviedo, and in the Melilla prison. Civil Guard corporal Juan Vadillo and Falangist Fernando Zamacola were both decorated by Nationalists forces after they raped women in Benamahoma. In the town of Brenes, a woman was taken to a farmhouse, and then forced lay on the ground and roll up her dress to expose her genitals. After this was completed, Falangist Joaqu√≠n Barrag√°n D√≠az was given scissors so he could cut off all the woman's genital hair. He refused. A member of the Civil Guard was brought in to do this, but he only half finished removing her genital hair. Finally, the head of Falange de Brenes completed the job. Wife of a socialist councilor of a pueblo in Andalucia of El Gastor, Mar√≠a Torre√±o was beaten so badly that she miscarried. She was then abandoned by her Falangist torturers, and died a short time later as a result of the torture she had been subjected to. After Frasquita Avil√©s rejected a Falangist who fell in love with her, the Falangist killed her and then raped her in a cemetery. In Fuentes de Andaluc√≠a, five young girls between the ages of 16 and 22 were raped, murdered and then thrown into a well by Falangists on 27 August 1936. Their names are Mar√≠a Le√≥n Becerril, Mar√≠a Jes√∫s Caro Gonz√°lez, Joaquina Lora Mu√±oz, Coral Garc√≠a Lora and Josefa Garc√≠a Lora. Before their rapes and murders, they were forced to drink alcohol and perform oral sex on male Falangists and were paraded through the streets in only their underwear. After they were thrown in the well, the Falangists paraded through the town with the women's underwear hung like flags from their rifles and shotguns. Five female nurses from Barcelona were captured in Majorca after the Republican retreat. Falangists gave all gave intrusive virginity tests, and then engaged in group rape in Manacor. The next day, all five women were murdered in the Son Coletes cemetery. Following their deaths, Falangists tried to depict these Republican nurses as prostitutes to justify their actions. The reputations of these Republican nurses would not be rehabilitated until 2005. Nationalists forces would rape girls as young as 12, sometimes repeatedly. One such incident occurred in Moguer. Sometimes Nationalist soldiers would stay in homes of poor families with no man present. They would take advantage of the situation to rape women in the household. In Peguerinos, two female nurses and other local women were raped by Falangists. Pregnant and non-pregnant women were raped and then executed in Spanish cities like Fuente de Cantos, Zafra, Almendralejo, Aguacho, Fuente del Maestre, Boecillo, Valdedios, Pallars Sobir√° and Zufre. Sometimes after Falangists were done raping women, they would brand the breasts of their victims with the yoke and phalanx arrows, the Falangist symbol. In late 1938, a 17-year-old girl in Unarre was forced to watch her mother being executed, and then she was brutally gang raped and executed. When Nationalist troops occupied Vizcaya in the summer of 1937, their supporters engaged in wide scale sexual harassment. Women's heads were shaved, and some were publicly beaten while half naked. This caused psychological damage not just to the victims, but also to their families who had to bear witness to the abuse. Catholic Nationalist troops also engaged in sexual violence against Republican women. Led by General Mola, a group of regulars in Valdedi√≥s first raped fourteen nurses and a 15-year-old girl. They then murdered them. Regular Nationalists soldiers raped at least four women in Maials. Another group of Nationalist regulars raped a woman, her daughter and her female cousin in Callus. When they were done, they then bayoneted the women. Other regulars in Marganell raped two women and then executed them by placing grenades between their legs. Regulars also raped several young women in Cantalpino. On 24 December 1938, four women in Maials were raped, including one who was raped at gunpoint in front of her husband and 7-year-old son. In Call√∫s, a husband had to watch his wife, daughter and female cousin be raped by Regulars before they were bayoneted, also in front of him. Milicianas, female militia members, were also frequently raped by Nationalist supporters when captured on the battlefield. They too also had their heads shaved. Women in Nationalists prisons were often raped. This was common in the Las Sales Prison, where women were removed by Falangists to their barracks to be raped. Thirty women were raped in the course of three months by two officials at the Albacete prison. The voices of victims could be heard screaming throughout the prison. Women in prison were constantly faced with guards who asked them for sexual favors in exchange for improving their situation in prison or the situation of other incarcerated relatives. Some female political prisoners in Vizcaya in late 1937 refused to have sex with their Nationalist military captors, even with the threat of being executed. The night after refusing, many were actually shot. The stories of these women's resistance were spread by word of mouth, and they became symbols of resistance for other women facing repression. As a way of creating additional humiliation for women and their families, Nationalist troops would sometimes direct groups of Moroccan soldiers under their command to rape specific women and groups of women in villages. These sexual assaults were often so brutal that women victims died within hours. One such case occurred in Navalcarnero. Because many died, it makes getting approximate numbers of rape victims difficult. Another occurred in San Roque, with the anarchist woman subsequently being shot by a firing squad. Other incidents also occurred in Seville, which Gonzalo Queipo de Llano discussed on his radio program. This practice of using Moroccan Foreign Legion members to rape local women was a carryover from Spanish military actions in their colonial possessions. German soldiers offering Nationalists support during the Civil War would sometimes delight in taking photographs of violence committed by Spanish Moroccan Legionaries against women, including the removal of women's breasts. Despite Franco's attempts to intervene to stop this behavior, it continued. Foreign Affairs magazine in October 1942 said of Francoist commanders, \\"They never denied that they had promised white women to the Moors when they entered Madrid. Sitting with the officers on a camp bivouac, I overheard them discussing the collusion of that promise; only some argued that a woman was still Spanish despite her \\"red\\" ideas. This practice was not denied either by El Mizzian, the only Moroccan officer of the Spanish army. I was with this soldier at the road junction of Navalcarnero when two Spanish girls, who seemed not to have turned twenty yet, were brought before him. One of them had worked in a textile factory in Barcelona and a union card was found on her jacket; the other, from Valencia, claimed not to have political convictions. After questioning them to get some information of a military nature, El Mizzian took them to a small building that had been the village school, where about forty Moors rested. When they reached the door, there was a howling scream from the throats of the soldiers. I attended the scene horrified and uselessly indignant. El Mizzian smiled affectionately when I protested what happened saying, \\"Oh, they will not live more than four hours.\\"\\" On extreme occasions, men were prosecuted in military courts for the violence they committed against women, though even then most male perpetrators were acquitted. Sevillian homosexual Falangist Andr√©s D√≠az murdered his pregnant ex-wife Ana Lineros while she was giving birth, having taken her from jail and shaving her first. He then tried to hide her body. D√≠az was acquitted of murder because the court ruled Lineros was a dangerous red, despite lots of testimony from other women who claimed she was not. In a case in Torre Alh√°quime, when there was a leadership in Falange, the incoming boss wrote an internal report that accused the outgoing leader as drunk, rapist and extortionist. For the most part, such written testimonies either do not exist, were destroyed or have gone missing. Women in Extremadura who worked in homes of the rich as seamstresses tried to form a union in the spring of 1936. Following the start of the Civil War, these women were tried for their attempt to unionize. Their punishment was sexual abuse.  Gonzalo Queipo de Llano  Gonzalo Queipo de Llano in Berl√≠n in 1939. Queipo de Llano had a radio program, where he said of the mass rape which occurred in Seville, \\"Our brave legionaries and regulars have taught the cowards of the reds what it means to be a man. And, by the way, also to women. After all, these communists and anarchists deserve it, have not they been playing free love? Now at least they will know what real men are and not sissy militiamen. They will not fight, no matter how hard they struggle and kick.\\" Queipo de Llana would also resort to calling Republican he opposed prostitutes. On his radio show, he said of Dolores Ib√°rruri \\"The famous Pasionaria has taken it with me because she does not realize that I admire her, for having managed to ascend from virgin of 30 reals to the first figure of the regime.\\" His radio show was so explicit in its violence that it was sometimes censored by Francoist forces. Ahead of the M√°laga‚ÄìAlmer√≠a road massacre, which saw thousands of women and children attempting to escape Malaga for Almer√≠a, \\"Yes, red scoundrel from Malaga, wait until I get there in ten days! I will sit in a caf√© on Calle Larios drinking beer and for each sip of mine you will fall ten. I will fire ten ... for each one of us who you shoot, even if I have to get you out of the grave to do it.\\" Of the potential capture of Sevilla and Cordoba, he said, \\"Tomorrow we take Pe√±aflor, so let the women of the reds prepare their mourning shawls. We are determined to apply the law with inexorable firmness: Mor√≥n, Utrera, Puente Genil, to prepare graves. I authorize you to kill like any dog who resists you, that if you do so, you will be exempt from all guilt.\\" Rafael Alberti wrote a poem that was read of Nationalist radio by Queipo de Llano that said, \\"Tonight I take Malaga, / on Monday, I took Jerez, / Montilla and Cazalla Tuesday, / Wednesday, Chinch√≥n, and on Thursday, / drunk and in the morning, / all the stables / Madrid, all the blocks, / mullendo cagajones, / they will give me their soft bed./ Oh, what a treat sleeping / taking for a pillow / and at the reach of the snout / two cribs of alfalfa. / What an honor to go to the tying / of the halter! What remarkable grace / receive in my hooves, / nailed with hooks, / the horseshoes that Franco / won by boldness in Africa! / I already have my back lowered, / my legs are already lowered, and my ears are growing, / already the teeth are lengthened, / the cinch comes short, / the reins are falling out of my way, / gallop, gallop ... step. / I'll be in Madrid tomorrow, / that the schools close, / that the taverns open, / nothing of Universities, / of Institutes, nothing, nothing, / that the wine runs to the meeting / of a liberator of Spain. / - Attention! Radio Sevilla. / The general of this square, / foolish brave idiot, / Queipo de Llano, he doesn't say anything.\\" Nationalist supporters defined women two ways: Either as good, Catholic, self-sacrificing mothers, or immoral women who provoked men by their dress, showing off bare arms and using tight clothing to highlight their form. For figures like Gonzalo Queipo de Llano, these women were worth degenerating further through rape. = Francoist period (1939 - 1975) = When men returned home from the front lives of the Civil War, culture dictated they had a certain sexual freedom that women were denied. This included the ability to go out at night, have sex with prostitutes and otherwise be promiscuous. At the same time, the return of traditional Catholicism demanded the woman return to traditional roles such as the wife and mother. Women were taught in the Francoist period that their purpose was to submit to their husbands, and this included in areas of sex where they were to humbly accede. Domestic violence, committed by men towards their spouses, was a rampant problem in Francoist Spain. This sort of violence against women was perfectly legal, and women had no recourse for dealing with it as they were considered legal property of their husbands. For many married women in the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s, sexual abuse was the norm in marriage. A woman from Cordoba named Theodora described her experiences with her husband in this period as, \\"I did not want, I did not want to [have sex]. Because if he came (...) Because he has always came late (...) Frozen from drinking and smoking, to me what I would like, if I came to a tart wine and I did not feel like it. But he, whether I wanted to or not, would take me and put me face up and go up and I gave him a speech and he did not care about me, that I had no pleasure.\\" Some women would pretend to be menstruating to avoid having sex with their husbands. The Penal Code of 1848 established the definition of sexual crimes in Spain. It would not be substantially altered until 1996, and was the major law related to this type of crime in the Francoist period. Title X had a section called \\"Crimes against honesty\\". This section deal with a number of crimes including adultery, rape and corruption of minors and kidnapping. Rape was specifically dealt with in article 363. It required that force or intimidation directed at the victim or deprivation \\"of reason or sense\\" on the part of the victim or the victim need to be under the age of 12 needed to be present for rape to occur. Dishonest abuse was another category related to sex crimes. This included things like anal penetration. Rape convictions lead to sentences of 12 to 20 years. Teachers, priests and authority figures could be imprisoned for having carnal knowledge of those under their care between the ages of 12 and 23, with a minor prison sentence of 4 to 6 years. If the charge was only of dishonest abuse, then prison time could be between 7 months and 6 years. Men could often avoid prison time by marrying their victims. A law enacted by Franco in December 1941 said that pregnant women given death sentences would have their executions stayed until they gave birth. At that point, the baby would be given to the father if he was alive and in Spain. Otherwise, many of these women had their newborns taken from them where, had the last names of their baby changed, and then were given to loyal Nationalist families. This law helped formalize the stolen babies process, a process that would not end until the middle of the democratic transition. Estimates by activists put the number of stolen babies at around 30,960 boys and girls. The Law of 6 November 1942 changed the criminal code around both rape and adultery. Women between the ages of 16 and 23 who were deceived into having sex could file a complaint again a man, which could see him going to prison for up to six months. If an honest woman was deceived into having carnal sex with a man and abuse was also involved, then he could received 12 to 16 years in prison. Employers who abused honest women in their employ into having sex with them could also be imprisoned, though this sentence could be commuted if he married her. Financial penalties for committing rape were also increased. The 1944 Penal Code said rape was a punishable offense when a girl was between 12 and 23 if she was a virgin, and between the ages of 17 and 23 if she was not a virgin. The 1944 Penal Code also made it so that in almost all cases, only married women and men they had affairs with could be guilty of adultery; married men were only guilty if they brought their mistresses to live in the marital home. The 1945 Law of Political Responsibilities punished anyone who showed any active or passive affinity towards the Second Republic or towards the \\"reds\\". In the Northwest Region of Murcia, only 2.49% of the arrests under the Law of Political Responsibilities involved women. Women guilty of this offense were not always charged this way. A 1944 edition of Semanario de la SF said, \\"The life of every woman, despite what she may pretend, is nothing but a continuous desire to find somebody to whom she can succumb. Voluntary dependency, the offering of every minute, every desire and illusion is the most beautiful thing, because it implies the cleaning away of all the bad germs -- vanity, selfishness, frivolity -- by love.\\" Women in prison during the Francoist period continued to have their heads shaved as a way of denying their womanhood. Women in Francoist Spain were sometimes subject to forced abortions. The regime claimed that if a woman had an orgasm; it was an insult to her husband. Lidia Falc√≥n O'Neill, arrested seven times, was abused so badly in Madrid's Yeseria prison and in Barcelona's Trinidad prison between 1960 and 1974 that she was left permanently damaged. While beating her, one guard shouted, \\"¬°Now you will not give birth anymore, bitch witch!\\" Falc√≥n later said of this, \\"In my case, in addition to the blows, one of the humiliations or insults that they repeated was 'bitch, that way you will not give birth anymore', because they hit me in the abdomen.\\" She said of other women's experiences in prison with her, \\"Others were raped; luckily it did not happen to me. [...] They undressed them ... there is a macho sadism that enjoys a free woman to deliver her to his criminal instincts.\\" Children, both boys and girls, who lived in state run boarding schools or in orphanages run by the Catholic Church were often subject to violence, degradation and rape. Julia Ferrer, who lived at the Casa de la Caridad in Barcelona, said of her own personal experience, \\"They took me to Sant Boi. Sometimes I would answer the nun and they would punish me with electric shock, but not because she was crazy, but as punishment.\\" Rape of women with Republican ties was common until at least the 1960s, with authorities generally treating male perpetrators as immune to prosecution. Everyone was taught to look the other way when violations of women occurred, and records of rape were not kept. Anita Sirgo and Tina P√©rez were both raped while in prison as a result of their involvement in the 1962 Asturian mining strikes. The rapes took place as part of broader torture they were forced to submit to. Women in PCE were pressured to have sex in the mid-1960s and 1970s to prove that they were free. There was an element of lack of choice if they wanted to prove their leftist credentials. According to Merche Comalleba, \\"The PCE militants told us that we were some sluts, some whores, that our goals were neither feminist nor political nor anything\\". While rape was illegal in some instances in Spain, the crime was under-reported in the Franco period because women saw being a rape victim as a source of humiliation and shame. This was compounded by the fact that many victims were not highly educated and lacked the personal confidence to undergo a humiliating experience of reporting the act to the police who were often suspect of their claims or who would take the side of the rapist by default.  Consultorio de Elana Francis  Consultorio de Elana Francis was a radio program that aired in Spain between 1947 and 1984, where women were able to ask for advice on problems they had. Issues of marital gender violence often came up. The show was created by Angela Castells, a member of Secci√≥n Feminina, Patronato de Protecci√≥n de la Mujer and Spanish League against Public Immorality, Spain's immorality police. Letters with delicate subject matters did not air, but did receive sometimes horrifying responses. Many women wrote to the show as they had no one else to turn to. None of the letters that have been preserved from the show use the word rape, but women writers described being raped using euphemisms, such as \\"He did what he wanted from me\\" and \\"I fall asleep and my brother does what he wants ... \\" Women who were abused by their husbands were routinely told to not leave home, to put up with his behavior, and that they were guilty of failing their husbands which was why they behaved violently towards them. Women wrote to describe being victims of gender violence. One woman, who described herself as a wretched wife whose husband bear her in front of her 10-year-old daughter, that she should, \\"Be brave, do not neglect your personal arrangement for a moment. And when he gets home, be willing to please him whenever he asks.\\" Another woman talked about how her neighbor made her 15-year-old daughter pregnant, with Elana's advice being to give the child up for adoption. Another woman wrote in to say, \\"When I was 9 years old, my brother- in-law took advantage of my sexual curiosity to make me lose my purity.\\" Elana Francis told this woman to confess, as she was partly to blame as she had sinned and encouraged her to continue to living in the home where the violation took place. One woman wrote asking what to do when she saw her husband out with his mistress, with Elana's response being, \\"If you see them together again, do not get upset; pretend that and offer the sacrifice to the Lord.\\" Another teenaged girl from Barcelona wrote in to say of her father, \\"I have to wait with resignation the day I do not doubt my father would hit me or step on my face as one day he did and I would be forever disgraced.\\" The advice to women who were rape victims or victims of gender violence was that they should stay, endure and offer their suffering up to God.  Antonio Gonz√°lez Pacheco (Billy the Kid)  Antonio Gonz√°lez Pacheco, also known as Billy the Kid, was a Social Political Brigade policeman. Decorated for a medal for police merit, he was known for his enjoyment of imposing terror, particularly on women, that he professionally came into contact with while investigating or arresting them. One of his victims was Lidia Falc√≥n. One alleged incident took place in 1975 involving an 18-year-old girl name Rosa Garc√≠a Alc√≥n who belonged to the Spanish Democratic University Federation (FUDE), Revolutionary Antifascist and Patriotic Front (FRAP). She said of her experience with Gonz√°lez Pacheco following her arrest by two policemen that summer, \\"What I remember most was his mouth, very big, how he approached my face and yelled at me ... more than fear it made me sick, it smelled very bad, it was very unpleasant, I do not remember asking anything, just hit me like a crazy. [...] He used to call me a bitch, a slut, he was very contemptuous of women, very macho, and he enjoyed imposing terror, I could see it in his eyes.\\" She went on to say, \\"One night they took me out in a car, Billy the Kid and three other police officers were saying that they were going to show me a safe house they had located, and they threatened me saying that they were going to take me to the Casa de Campo, to rape and leave me out there, that my family would never know about me again.[...] Imagine, when I had just turned 18, handcuffed in a car with four men ... I was a girl, when they threw me on the floor in interrogations, like I was wearing a dress, they said 'look, what the bitch teaches us', those sort of things.\\" Felisa Echegoyen was another Gonz√°lez Pacheco survivor. She was had just destroyed documentation about her political affiliations before Gonz√°lez Pacheco broke into her house. She said of this, \\"He would approach your face and take your breath, which was repulsive because it smelled like alcohol. This was something he did a lot with women; he wanted to make us smaller, as if he were a monster.\\" Complaints against his ill-treatment of prisoners had been made to the police by 1974, but had not been acted on, even after the start of the democratic transition. The complaints, while he was still employed, would eventually total to 17. In 1974, the Municipal Court Number 19 in Madrid sentenced Gonz√°lez Pacheco single day in prison and fined him 1,000 pesetas for abuse by Enrique Aguilar Ben√≠tez de Lugo. Other proceedings against her were dismissed as a result of the 1977 Amnesty Law. In February 1975, Communist Youth member Mar√≠a Rum√≠n was a 17-year-old when she became another one of his victims while she was defending free and quality publish schools at Plaza del Parterre in Carabanchel. She said of this, \\"Just to hear the name of Billy the Kid , my hair stood on end. I was detained for three days in the Puerta del Sol police station. No one warned my family and no one gave information about my whereabouts during those three days. My hair is still standing on end when I remember those days. Just to hear the name Billy the Kid makes my hair stand on end.\\" Gonz√°lez Pacheco broke her face by hitting it with his fists. Gonz√°lez Pacheco also stole some of the money Rum√≠n had on her when she entered detention. = Democratic transition period (1975 - 1986) = Franco died in November 1975. The first protest condemning violence against women was held in Barcelona in 1976. Women marched, chanting phrases like \\"Against rape, castration\\" (), \\"We want to walk calmly\\" (), \\"Let's make our night\\" (), \\"Alone, drunk, I want to go home\\" () and \\"Enough of violations!\\" (). At the time, rape was not treated as a serious institutional problem inside Spain, and rape victims had few rights. The issue of age of consent was before the Congress in April 1978. It was changed from eighteen, to between twelve and sixteen. Between those ages, consent was allowed only if the other person did not have authority over the younger person. Issues around women's honesty as it related to rape accusations also disappeared in 1978. The Socialists also successfully got articles 436 and 442 repealed from the criminal code in April 1978. Reforms in the law in 1978 meant men could also be considered victims of rape. That year, contraception also became legal. Divorce also became legal in 1981. A reform in 1983 said that a victim offering forgiveness to the perpetrator would not result in the dropping of criminal proceedings in the cases of rape, sexual abuse and kidnapping. Thefts of children from female political prisoners continued into the early 1980s. These mothers were often told their children were born dead, or had serious illness at birth and subsequently died. In 1987, Spain's Supreme Court ruled that rape victims did not need to prove they actively fought off their rapist to lodge a complaint. = Post Francoist Spain (1985 - present) = In the modern era, it is understood that the type of violence women experienced in the Spanish Civil War is common, having occurred throughout history in places like Troy and into the modern day in places like Darfur. Spain's has been criticized for \\"the complete forgetfulness within the law of the Historical Memory of the crimes against humanity against republican women.\\" Prior to the 1990s, there was no way to tell in Spain that number of women who were killed by their boyfriends or husbands. The abuse and murder of women in Spain was a form of sexist terrorism and claimed more victims than that of ETA. El caso de los ni√±os perdidos del franquismo by Miguel √Ångel Rodr√≠guez Arias ends with a demand that the Spanish government start \\"the opening of an effective and independent official investigation of all its crimes, as required by the European Court of Human Rights, which will lead to the clarification of the facts and the criminal prosecution of those responsible.\\" In 2010, the Junta de Andalusia compensated women who were forced to swallow castor oil or had their hair shave or forced to walk naked through their towns with ‚Ç¨1,800. This compensation was a result of the Historical Memory Board of Andalusia. Similar compensations were offered to other victims of historical repression during the Spanish Civil War in Andalusia. Of the 2,742 people who received compensation under this scheme, only 5% were women. On 16 March 2016, a case about Francoist sexual and gender violence was filed, citing human rights violations, in Argentina. The case was brought by Women's Link and was to be heard by Mar√≠a Servini de Cubr√≠a, the only Argentine judge reviewing Franco era human rights violations in the country. Of the six women named in the suit, five were murdered. They were Margalida Jaume Vendrel, Daria and Mercedes Buzad√© Adroher, Pilar S√°nchez Lladr√©s and Matilde Lanza Vaz. The other woman was Lidia Falc√≥n, who was imprisoned repeatedly between 1960 and 1974. Glenys de Jes√∫s said of Women's Link's need to file this, saying, \\"both for the crimes already reported within the cause and for which Women's Link adds now, apply a perspective that takes into account that violence that was used against women and men was direct, had a different impact, and a different meaning.\\" She went on to say that, \\"not only of a different brutality, but also had a clear objective, which was to punish those women that the regime considered had broken with their social position.\\" She continued, saying the goal of Francoist was to, \\"send a message of pressure to the whole society of what the model of female behavior should be and at the same time they used women to punish the men of the Republican side.\\" A new line of investigation into sexual abuse by the Franco regime was admitted in the National Criminal and Correctional Court No. 1 of Buenos Aires in October 2018. A more general case about human rights violations by the regime had first been opened in Argentina in 2010. Antonio Gonz√°lez Pacheco benefited from the Amnesty Law in October 1977. Argentine Justice placed an international arrest warrant for Gonz√°lez Pacheco in 2013 as part of their broader investigation into human rights abuses by the Francoist regime. People first tried to bring charges in Spain against Antonio Gonz√°lez Pacheco in the Spain's National Court in 2014. Gonz√°lez Pacheco was finally investigated in 2018 as a result of seven complaints filed in Madrid that alleged crimes against humanity. Only one of the seven cases was investigated for torture related offenses. The government argued against the cases being accepted as his actions and those of other men in the Spanish police were not part of a systemic pattern designed to repress a specific part of the population. Gonz√°lez Pacheco was never stripped of any of his honors by the Spanish state, despite the allegations later made against him.

Life He was born at 2 Hanover Terrace in Kensington, London on 1 February 1859 one of 15 siblings and (three half-siblings) of Edward Fox White, a surveyor, and his wife, Julia Gomes Silva (1834-1871).

Early life P√°l M√°rkh√°zy was born to a Hungarian noble family, named for M√°rkh√°za in N√≥gr√°d County. His early life is undocumented. His relative, Orsolya M√°rkh√°zy, was the wife of the commander of the fortress at Ajn√°csk≈ë (now Hajn√°ƒçka in Slovakia). The Ottomans captured her husband and she appointed M√°rkh√°zy to command the garrison. After the Ottomans occupied the fortress on 24 April 1556, M√°rkh√°zy was accused of treachery and his estates were confiscated in Royal Hungary. He fled to John Sigismund Z√°polya's \\"Eastern Hungarian Kingdom\\" and settled in Transylvania. M√°rkh√°zy married the widow of Stanislaus Niszovzky, who had been a Polish courtier of Z√°polya and Z√°polya's mother, Queen Isabella. His wife, Saphira (or Zamfira), was the daughter of a prince of Wallachia. Historian S√°ndor Papp associates her father with Mircea the Shepherd, who had ruled the principality from 1545 to 1552 and from 1553 to 1554. Diplomat M√°rkh√°zy visited Istanbul several times. In the spring of 1575, he went to the Ottoman capital to buy horses and also to conduct business on behalf of Z√°polya's successor, Stephen B√°thory. On this occasion, M√°rkh√°zy met with David Ungnad, who was Emperor Maximilian II's ambassador. He convinced Ungnad that he had been baselesly accused of treachery, but he could not achieve the return of his confiscated estates. M√°rkh√°zy was accused of treating his wife badly. Stephen B√°thory's brother and deputy, Christopher B√°thory, ordered him to separate from his wife. M√°rkh√°zy was also captured and held in prison for four years, but his wrongdoings were not proved. He decided to appeal to Stephen B√°thory, but instead of visiting the king in Poland, he fled to the Ottoman Empire around 1578. In Ottoman service M√°rkh√°zy received a ziamet estate in Syrmia in Ottoman Hungary. A rumor about the death of Christopher B√°thory reached Istanbul in the second half of 1580. The influential Koca Sinan Pasha proposed M√°rkh√°zy to achieve his appointment to rule Transylvania if he were willing to increase the annual tribute payable to the Sublime Porte, but the rumor proved false. Fearing of M√°rkh√°zy's ambitions, the Diet of Transylvania elected the ailing Christopher B√°thory's minor son, Sigismund, his co-ruler. Christopher B√°thory died on 27 May 1581. Sinan Pasha had not returned from a military campaign against Safavid Persia and the Imperial Council decided to confirm Sigismund B√°thory's accession in his absence in early July. The Sultan's envoy departed from Istanbul to deliver the princely insignia to Sigismund. Sinan Pasha returned to Istanbul before 12 July. M√°rkh√°zy soon approached him, offering 60,000 forints as a personal gift to him, and also proposing 100,000 forints as a single payment and the increase of the annual tribute from 15,000 to 100,000 forints. Sinan Pasha accepted the offer and M√°rkh√°zy entered into negotiations with the Phanariote bankers about a loan to finance the transaction. A new Ottoman envoy was sent to Transylvania who demanded the same tribute that M√°rkh√°zy had promised. The Diet refused to increase the annual tribute, but the Sultan's envoy handed over the princely insignia to Sigismund B√°thory. Learning of the Transylvanians' disobedience, the Imperial Council decided to replace Sigismund B√°thory with M√°rkh√°zy on 20 August 1581. Sinan Pasha's opponents knew that Stephen B√°thory who ruled the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth would not allow to expel his nephew from Transylvania and they wanted to avoid an armed conflict with him. After the Transylvanian envoys who came to Istanbul to deliver the annual tribute agreed to increase it by 1,000 thalers, their offer was accepted. Sinan Pasha fell into disgrace and was imprisoned on 6 December 1582. M√°rkh√°zy was also imprisoned, but Stephen B√°thory could not achieve his extradition and he was released in 1583. M√°rkh√°zy converted to Islam either during his captivity to avoid capital punishment, or soon after his release. ƒ∞brahim bey, as M√°rkh√°zy was named after his conversion, ruled several sanjaks (or districts) in Ottoman Hungary and Croatia. He administered Simontornya from 1585 to 1587, he stayed in Zvornik from 1587 to 1589, and he was transferred to Borosjen≈ë near the Transylvanian border (now Ineu in Romania) in the spring of 1589. According to the English diplomat, Edward Barton, ƒ∞brahim bey did much harm to his native country.

The wife of a high-profile judge and politician, and related to Australian literary and political figures, she sought to promote ideas of racial hygiene and single mothers through association with several organisations and progressive movements. Piddington was most well known for her advocacy of contraception, 'celibate motherhood', racialist theory and social legislation in Australia during the interwar period of the nineteen twenties and thirties, works that were neglected until the nineteen eighties; Peddingtons first biographer concludes, \\"She defied modern categories such as 'puritan' or 'libertarian', being in some curious measure both.\\"  Biography  Marion Louisa O'Reilly was born to Rosa, n√©e Smith on 23 December 1869 in Sydney, youngest of four fathered by a clergyman in the Anglican faith, the canon Thomas O'Reilly (1819‚Äì1881).Neil O'Reilly, 'O'Reilly, Thomas (1819‚Äì1881)', Australian Dictionary of Biography, National Centre of Biography, Australian National University, published first in hardcopy 1974, accessed online 10 April 2019. Amongst her notable relations is her cousin Edith Badham, her brother was Dowell O'Reilly, an Australian author and politician, and her niece was the author Eleanor Dark. She was married in 1896 to Albert Bathurst Piddington (1862-1945), the high court judge and royal commissioner, who was likewise active in social reform and politics.  Works  Piddington was enthused by the ideas of eugenics and parenthood, perhaps initially inspired by the London \\"International Eugenics Congress\\" (1912) she had attended with her husband, prompting her to develop and publicise her ideas of sex education and social reform. She advocated for procreation outside marriage for the pragmatic purposes of 'racial hygiene', seen as an unusually liberal view amongst advocates of racialist theories and social programs such as compulsory sterilisation. A theme in Piddington's campaigns was promotion of \\"celibate motherhood\\", unwed mothers receiving artificial insemination from a selected donor, in part to compensate for loss of suitable partners in the Great War. She corresponded on the topics regarding the prevention of pregnancy and sexual transmission of disease, abortion and feminism and the contentious theories of social reformation emerging in Britain, Europe and the United States during the interwar period. Marion Piddington's works include books and pamphlets, various societies publications and newsletters, and publicised through articles in newspapers and magazines. Her correspondence was retained and has been examined in later research. Her own papers include a response from Sigmund Freud to her proposals, polite but dismissive of her ideas for single mothers and foresaw disastrous consequences in the absence of sexual relations. Piddingtons's views found more favour with Marie Stopes, an English activist, and shared her opinion that motherhood could exist independently of sex and marriage. A summary of her lectures was issued as Tell Them! or the Second Stage of Mothercraft (1926), following her earlier pamphlet entitled \\"The Unmarried Mother and Her Child\\" (1923). In 1916 she had published her adaptation of the ideas founded in eugenics, perhaps in response to the 1912 conference in London, Via Nuova; or Science and Maternity, a story or parable of a woman left without a suitable partner by the gender imbalance of young men lost in war. The central character is moved by religious and national fervour and becomes a single mother with the 'aid of science', a scarcely veiled depiction of her own progressive ideas. Her novel was published under the pseudonym 'Lois'. Working as a publicist, Piddington sought to associate herself with nominally allied groups and agencies in pursuit of her causes, but shifted allegiance when the objectives contradicted her own views. She was a founding member of the Racial Hygiene Association (RHC) of New South Wales in 1926, and through them gave lectures on sexual education, but disassociated herself when their objectives turned against her promotion of public education on sex, procreation and unconventional parenting. A rival organisation was formed by her in reaction to the RHC lobbying for the ban of Stope's book Contraception, which she succeeded in having lifted.  Legacy  Marion Piddington's contribution to the history of the eugenics movements was international, but overlooked in the studies of the British and American organisations. She became well known in her lifetime for promotion of social causes, but overshadowed by the works of her husband in the courts and parliament during politically turbulent periods. Her own positions and character presented difficulties to later researchers, mixing sexual emancipation with the objectives of the eugenic movements, and the first major study of her life was not presented until the 1988 entry in the Australian Dictionary of Biography.

These ideas were first expounded upon in the 1930s by men like Antonio Vallejo N√°jera and Gregorio Mara√±√≥n. It was heavily influenced by Roman Catholicism. Much of this was realized through women's bodies in Spain, through Francoists policies around the role of women.  Race and ideology  Eugenics in Spain in the late 1930s and through to the 1940s was not based on race, but instead on people's political alignment with the regime. Ricardo Campos said, \\"the racial question during the Franco era is complex.\\" He went on to say, \\"despite the similarities of the Franco regime with the Italian and German fascism and the interest that the eugenics provoked, the strong Catholicism of the regime prevented its defense of the eugenic policies that were practiced in the Nazi Germany.\\" Campos's translated text went on to say, \\"it was very difficult to racialize the Spanish population biologically because of the mixture that had been produced historically.\\" Vallejo-N√°gera in his 1937 work, Eugenics of the Hispanicity and Regeneration of the Race defined Hispanicness around spirituality and religion. The goal was the \\"strengthening psychologically\\" of the phenotype. Because Catholicism was opposed to negative eugenics, the only way to fight the degradation was through repression of abortion, euthanasia and contraception.  Ideological pioneers  Hispanic eugenics was pioneered by doctors like Antonio Vallejo N√°jera and Gregorio Mara√±√≥n. Antes que te cases was published by N√°jera in 1946, with one part saying, \\"Racial decadence is the result of many things but the most important is conjugal unhappiness in the most prosperous and happy of homes. ... Eugenic precepts may avoid morbid offspring. ... It is impossible a robust race without a sound preparation of youth for marriage, through Catholic Morality. This little work is a minuscule contribution to the exaltation of the Fatherland.\\" Vallejo N√°jera's 1937 book, Eugenesia de la Hispanidad y la regeneraci√≥n de la raza outlined the purpose of Hispanic eugenics as being about returning Spain to its historical glory by purifying not the Spanish race, but Spain's political ideology. Mara√±√≥n's 1921 Maternidad y feminismo, republished as a second edition in 1951, said, \\"The difference between the sexes is insurmountable. Such difference emerges from the anatomical surface of each man and woman, and it goes to the deepest, darkest roots of life, to the home of the cells.\\"  Catholic influence  Science was viewed as a complement to Catholic eugenics in Spain. Hispanic eugenics has, in comparison to Nazi Germany, been tremendously influenced by the Catholic Church. In Fransisco Haro's 1930 Eugenesia y Matrimonio, he wanted to see the introduction of marriage certificates to insure morality in eugenic practices through the use of positive population control instead of negative population control. His thinking was informed by Catholic tradition. Hispanic eugenics were further supported out of condemnation of the left, who supported negative eugenics policies and who were anti-clerical in their outlook. This made Hispanic eugenicists more likely to support positive eugenics with a Catholic tie in.  Women's reproduction in Spain  Doctors in Francoist Spain had two roles: to be moral protectors of Spanish reproduction and to provide science based medical services. This put male doctors in charge of women's birth control. When medical doctors in the Second Republic and early Francoist period defended birth control, it was on the eugenics grounds that it protected the health of both women and children, especially as it related to the spread of genetic disease and the spread of tuberculosis and sexually transmitted diseases. Hispanic eugenics and pronatalism were viewed as key components of addressing the decline in the Spanish birth rate and the need for an increased population size to serve the needs of the Spanish state during the Francoist period. Policies around this eugenics program involved bans on abortion, infanticide, contraception and information around contraception. This practice was started as policy during the Dictatorship of Primo de Rivera, discontinued by the Second Republic and then picked up again as a national level policy by Francoists. Anything that was viewed by the state as interfering with women's reproduction activities and increasing the size of the Spanish population size were viewed as being in opposition to the state. All activities that stopped this began to become defined by the regime as crimes.Nash, Mary.: \\"Pronatalism and motherhood in Franco's Spain\\". In G. BOCK & P. THANE. (ed.): Women and the Rise of the European Welfare States, 1880s-1950s. Routledge, London & New York, 1992, pp. 160-173.Eiroa, Matilde. \\"Mujer y pol√≠tica social en los primeros a√±os del franquismo: M√°laga 1941\\". In P. Ballar√≠n and T. Ortiz (eds.): La mujer en Andaluc√≠a. Primer Encuentro Interdisciplinario de Estudios de la Mujer. Vol. 1. Granada, 1990, pp. 397-406. Anyone who did not fit into traditional gender norms and who expressed any deviance from Roman Catholic sexual norms was viewed as a sexual pervert. While some women quietly questioned their biologically determined place in society, male intellectuals provided rationals to support Francoist policies that used medical and biological sciences, along with anatomy and physiological studies. These works often drew on phrenological works by doctors such as Franz Joseph Gall that were later translated into Spanish. Carmen de Burgos Segu√≠ published one such translation in La inferioridad mental de la mujer which said, \\"Many female characteristics are very similar to those of beasts; mainly the lack of a main of their own. Since the beginning of times they have functions like that, hence the human race would be stagnated in its original state if there were only women.\\" The Franco government found an ally in their anti-abortion beliefs and practices in the Roman Catholic Church. Those within the Catholic Church wrote in support of the law, with Father Jaime Pujiula, Professor of the Colegio M√°ximo de San Ignacio de Sarri√° and member of the Royal Academies of Sciences of Madrid and Medicine of Barcelona saying, \\"The fruit that is lost criminally would be perhaps the most robust man, the healthiest, the most intelligent to raise the same society or to renew it or print new directions and directions.\\" It is also an attack against population problems. of society and Eugenics, not only the women who cause the abortion, but the perverse midwives and doctors conspired with them to perpetrate the crime for the vile spirit of profit are responsible before God, before society and before the Eugenics. \\"Pujiula, Jaime. La Eugenesia ante la Iglesia y ante la ciencia\\". Revista Internacional de Sociolog√≠a. Volume 11, Number 2-3, April-September 1943, pp. 113-155. Because midwives appeared to be so frequently involved in sharing knowledge about abortion and contraceptives and performing abortions, the male led scientific community in Spain tried to marginalize these women. Professionalization in medicine would help to further relegate the importance of midwives in Spain. Further attempts to dislodge midwives from the birthing process included accusing them of witchcraft and quackery, trying to make them appear unscientific. This was all part of a medical and eugenic science driven effort to reduce the number of abortions in Spain. PSOE introduced legislation to legalize abortion in 1983 through an amendment to Spain's penal code. Abortion was finally made legal by Congress later that year by a vote of 186 - 50, but did not enter into legal effect until July 1985 as Coalici√≥n Popular (now Partido Popular) challenged the constitutionality of the law. The decriminalization of abortion was allowed for three reasons. The first was that it was ethical in the case of rape. The second was it could be a necessary to save the life of the mother. The third reason was that eugenic, allowing abortion in case of fetal malformation.  History  A Hispanic eugenics conference took place from 21 April to 10 May 1933 in Madrid, where topics like eugenics, divorce, abortion, birth control and prostitution were discussed by over fifty intellectuals. Catalans eugenics supporters were advocating their own form of Hispanic eugenics by 1934, with its leading advocates including Hermenegildo Puig i Sais, Josep A. Vandell√≥s, Pompeu Fabra, and Francesiso Maspons. Josep A. Vandell√≥s published his first book advocating Catalan eugenics in 1934. The Societat Catalana d'Eugen√®sia was founded that year. Their purpose was to create an improved Catalan people.

Plot It's sunset and the narrator rests amidst the Moldovan vineyards, watching men and women returning home from work, singing songs. With him is Izergil, once beautiful, now very old, decrepit woman. She scolds him for being so withdrawn (\\"You Russians are born already old men!\\"), then starts telling him stories. I. The first one, having to do with the origins of the mysterious moving shadow (which she claims to see, although the narrator doesn't), is the legend of Larra, the son of an eagle and a woman. Larra enters the local community of men full of pride and with no concern or respect for others, knowing just one law, that of his own desires. A young woman thwarts his approaches and gets brutally killed. Outraged, the men try to figure out the proper way to punish the villain. Then the wisest one suggests that they should just let him go, for that would be the worst fate for this evil creature, bound to punish himself. For many years he fights them, then starts longing for death, but such is the curse upon him that he cannot die. He tries to kill himself but fails. Left alone, wandering on his own, after many years he gradually turns into a shadow doomed to wander the world forever. II. After informing the narrator that \\"health is like gold, it is there to be spared\\", Izergil relates to him the story of her rather turbulent love life. Among the men whom she had, unrepentantly, discarded, were: ‚Äî the fisherman from Prut whom she fell in love as a teenager girl, but soon got bored with; ‚Äî the red-haired Gutsul outlaw. He was later hanged, along with the fisherman (who'd joined the same gang), after being betrayed by a Romanian landlord; the latter has been punished severely for this, and Izergil apparently had some part in the deed; ‚Äî the rich middle-aged Turk whose harem she agreed to join in Bucharest; ‚Äî his 16-old son whom she soon eloped with to Bulgaria, where a woman stabbed her (\\"for either her husband, or fianc√©, I don't remember\\"); ‚Äî a Polish man, described as 'funny and mean', but also prone to offensive remarks for one of which she threw him into the river and went away; ‚Äî a Jew who bought her to make her sell her body; ‚Äî the handsome Szlachta man whom she fell in love with, and later (after he'd been imprisoned for taking part in the January Uprising) helped escaping from the Russian prison camp, killing a guardsman. III. Izergil asks the narrator if he sees the blueish sparks in the field, as the night falls, and when he says he does, tells him the story of their origins. In the old times and the distant lands, a small community of people, driven out of their homeland by the enemy, enter the dark and dangerous forest. Surrounded by darkness and paralyzed with fear, they still have to go forward, into the unknown, for with them are the old testaments of their forefathers. The moment comes when things become so intolerable that they start talking about turning round and surrendering. But the young man named Danko arises and encourages them to move on, taking up the role of their leader. For a while they follow him enthusiastically, then the discontent starts to grow again. The great storm breaks out, and, horrified by the rain and lightning, they blame Danko for everything that happened to them. Overcome by rage, but also the desire to help out this ungrateful crowd, he tears his chest up, and rises his flaming heart up, as a lantern. Their way suddenly lightened, the people rush forward, soon reach the end to the path and then suddenly find themselves in the sun, among beautiful fields washed with fresh rain. Everybody forgets about Danko who, left behind and bleeding, falls down and dies. Just one last man, perhaps fearing something, approaches him and tramples down the embers of his heart, sending blue sparks around and away. Background, influences and interpretations \\"Prometheus Brings Fire to Mankind\\" By Heinrich Fueger, 1817 \\"Old Izergil\\" was inspired by the trip to Bessarabia and Romania which Gorky had made four years earlier.Naksimova, V.A.

The Moldovan writer and folklorist George Bogach traces the origins of the name Izergil to two sources: the Akkerman toponym Iserlia and Kara-Ningil, the character of the Mamin-Sibiryak story \\"Tears of the Queen\\". The Gorky biographer V.A. Maksimova notes that phonetically \\"Izergil\\" is close to \\"Iggradzil\\", the giant ash of the Scandinavian mythology, similar to the Biblical Tree of Knowledge. It is connected to the three worlds, those of the dead, the living and the gods, respectively. The name Danko, according to the critic V.A. Khanov, comes from the Russian \\"dan\\" (in the general sense, 'the given thing'). The Slav god of light is Da≈æbog, which is \\"the giving god\\".Khanov, V. A. Old Izergil.

But George Bogach in his book \\"Gorky and the Moldavian Folklore\\" states that the 'Danko' is of the Romani origins, meaning \\"the youngest son\\" or \\"little gypsy boy\\". Some aspects of the legend of Danko echo the story of the Exodus, but while Moses, a harsh disciplinarian, is inspired by God, Danko is motivated by his \\"great love for the people\\" and is closer to the figure of Christ, Khanov argues, noting also that the story's structure may have to do with the notion of the World tree, Larra, Izergil and Danko representing its bottom, middle and top sections, respectively. The Gorky biographer Pavel Basinsky stresses the importance of considering the early Gorky as a Nietzsche follower, something that the Soviet critics have made a point to overlook.–ë–∞—Å–∏–Ω—Å–∫–∏–π –ü. –í. –ì–æ—Ä—å–∫–∏–π. ‚Äî –ú.: –ú–æ–ª–æ–¥–∞—è –≥–≤–∞—Ä–¥–∏—è, 2005. ‚Äî .

Another hero for Gorky was the Bulgarian poet Pencho Slaveykov. One of the latter's poems, \\"The Heart of Hearts\\", on the death of the English poet Percy Bysshe Shelley, might have influenced the young Gorky too.

He was one of the leading coal owners in the North-East and a member of powerful coal cartels. Although he served in Parliament over a long period, his contributions there were limited. Early life Montagu was the second son of Edward Montagu, 1st Earl of Sandwich, MP, and his wife Jemima Crew, daughter of John Crew, 1st Baron Crew of Stene. As his father's favourite child, he received a more liberal education than his younger brothers. He was educated at Twickenham under Dr Fuller by 1660 and attended the acad√©mie du Plessis, Paris from 1662 to 1664. He accompanied his father at the Battle of V√•gen in 1665. Between 1666 and1671, he travelled abroad in Flanders, Germany, Italy and France.and Spain where his father was envoy in 1667. In 1675 he became an ensign in the Royal Foot Guards, later Grenadier Guards. He married in about 1676, Anne Newcomen his father's ward who was brought up at Hinchingbrooke. She was the illegitimate daughter and heir of Sir Francis Wortley, 2nd Baronet of Wortley, Yorkshire who had died in 1666. Montagu assumed the additional. name of Wortley. He developed extensive mining interests in Durham and Northumberland, allegedly based upon favourable leases of episcopal lands obtained from his kinsman Nathaniel Crew, Bishop of Durham. Political career Wortley Montagu's political interest was based on his family's influence in the Midlands . He was returned as Member of Parliament for Huntingdon after a contested election in February 1679. He was nominated to the committee of elections and privileges in the first Exclusion Parliament, but made no speeches and was absent from the division on the exclusion bill. He was Commissioner for assessment for Huntingdonshire and Huntingdon from 1679 to 1680. At the general election of August 1679, he was returned for Huntingdon again but was inactive in the second Exclusion Parliament. He was appointed Deputy Lieutenant for West Riding for a year in 1680. He was returned again in February 1681 and was again appointed to the elections committee in the third exclusion parliament. After a brief canvass in Huntingdon in 1685, he abandoned the contest at the March 1685 general election. Wortley Montagu initially disapproved of the landing of William of Orange, but on reports of desertion from James's army, he took a prominent part in the Revolution. He occupied Sheffield with the West Riding militia, and was the second to sign the Yorkshire petition for a free Parliament. He was again returned for Huntingdon at the general election of January 1689 to the Convention, and was again appointed only to the elections committee. He supported the disabling clause in the bill to restore corporations. His wife turned Roman Catholic and went abroad. He was allowed to bring in a bill for a competent maintenance for their children, in case his wife survived him, which received the royal assent before the dissolution. He was appointed deputy lieutenant for West Riding again in October 1688, and held the position for the rest of his life. He was also appointed a Justice of the Peace for Nothamptonshire and was appointed Commissioner for assessment for Huntingdonshire, Northamptonshire and West Riding of Yorkshire from 1689 to 1690. Wortley Montagu was trustee for the estates of his nephew, Edward Montagu, 3rd Earl of Sandwich a weak-willed man, which gave him his influence at Huntingdon elections. A protracted struggle for control raged between Wortley Montagu and Sandwich's wife, Elizabeth Wilmot but Montagu was able to return at least one Member for Huntingdon at all but one of the elections between 1690 and 1715. Montagu was returned for Huntingdon at the 1690 English general election but made no further significant contribution to the 1690 Parliament. He was Justice of the Peace for West Yorkshire by 1690, serving for the rest of his life. At the 1695 English general election, he stood down from his Huntingdon seat to make way for the nominee of his kinsman the 4th Earl of Manchester. He was appointed Commissioner for taking subscriptions to the land bank in 1696. He returned to Parliament, at a by-election for Camelford on 1 April 1696. He abstained from the vote of 25 November 1696 on the attainder of Sir John Fenwick. At the 1698 English general election, he was returned instead as MP for Peterborough on the Whig interest of Lord Fitzwilliam. Wortley Montagu was a follower of the Whig Junto in early 1700 and was returned on the Whig interest for Peterborough in both the elections in 1701 elections. He was Justice of the Peace for Huntingdonshire by 1701. He was returned unopposed for Peterborough at the 1702 English general election, but the struggle to control the interest at Huntingdon with the Tory- supporting Lady Sandwich intensified and led to dispute within parliament. He was again otherwise relatively inactive in Parliament. He was returned again for Peterborough at the 1705 English general election and on 25 October he voted for the Court candidate for Speaker. At the 1708 British general election, he was returned again for Peterborough. He supported the bill to naturalize the Palatines which was guided through the Commons by his son Edward. In 1710, he supported the impeachment of Dr Sacheverell. He was defeated at Peterborough at the 1710 British general election, and his petition against the return was unsuccessful. As a member of a north-east coal cartel with his brother Hon. Charles Montagu and Sir Henry Liddell, 3rd Baronet, he petitioned the Commons on 13 April 1710, against a bill to dissolve and prevent further combinations in the coal trade, and through extensive lobbying, was able to negate the bill's effect upon their activities. He was appointed joint High Steward of Northallerton, Yorkshire by 1713. Recognising the value of a seat in parliament, he replaced his son as Member for Huntingdon at the 1713 British general election, his interest in the borough remaining strong despite the intrusion in this election of his great-nephew Edward Montagu, Viscount Hinchingbrooke. He remained an inactive Member, but on 18 March 1714 voted against the expulsion of Richard Steele. Wortley Montagu was returned for Huntingdon on his family's interest at the 1715 British general election, and remained loyal to the Whig Administration and voted for the septennial bill in 1716, but was absent from other recorded divisions. He was returned again on his own interest for Peterborough at the 1722 British general election. At the 1727 British general election he was defeated in the poll at Peterborough, but his petition was resolved in his favour on 13 May 1728. Coal cartels Wortley Montagu was on the directorate of a powerful coal cartel formed in 1709, and by 1714, was one of the greatest coal owners of the day, actively co-operating with other representatives of the industry in Parliament on matters affecting their joint interests. In 1716 his defection led to the break up of the cartel, earning him considerable unpopularity among his former associate. In 1726 he joined with two other major coal proprietors, George Bowes and the Liddells, to form a new cartel, the Grand Alliance, ‚Äòwhich dominated the coal trade for the rest of the century‚Äô. Death and legacy Wortley Montagu died on 9 November 1727, having survived his wife and his male children, except his second son, Edward, who succeeded to all his coal mining interests as well as to the settled Wortley estates. He also had grandchildren by his deceased son John, and two surviving daughters.

Life and career  McDonald was born on 29 March 1936, in Langside, Glasgow. With his brother, he attended Glasgow High School. He went on to study law at University of Glasgow and began postgraduate studies in Greek and Italian at the same university. Soon thereafter McDonald was conscripted into the army as a translator in Cyprus, however he had studied ancient Greek rather than the modern Greek which was required for his posting. McDonald was discharged from the army and joined a law firm in Glasgow. He later moved to Karachi, Pakistan, to work as a teacher for a year. Upon his return to the UK, McDonald was appointed to a junior position in the Ministry of Defence. He was promoted through the ranks until spring 1982, during the Falklands War, when he came into prominence as the spokesman for the ministry. Speaking in a monotone voice that British viewers found authentic and reassuring, McDonald gave regular briefings on the events of the war using a teacher's pointer and maps of the islands. As the British forces recaptured the islands, \\"McDonald became renowned for his restrained, and at times emotionless, style of delivery.\\" However, he frustrated reporters with his mysterious answers to questions, often quoting William Shakespeare in lieu of a response. In one instance he said \\"Hamlet, Act One, Scene Two, Line 215\\" which reads \\"But answer made it none\\". On Channel 4's documentary When Britain Went To War (2002), McDonald revealed that he became the subject of amorous attention from TV viewers, including a woman who stalked him for two years and sent him emotive letters. In 1986, McDonald was made head of the Defence Exports Services Secretariat. He was in charge of the department during the Arms-to- Iraq affair and his name was included in the 1996 Scott Report, in which Richard Scott criticised McDonald for his \\"inattention ‚Ä¶ consistent with his general approach to line management\\". McDonald, who never married nor had children, spent his later years at a villa in Umbria, Italy. He died of pneumonia on 28 March 2019, the day before he would have turned 83 years old.

It is one of the Boulevards of the Marshals, which run in the outer parts of the city.  Location  The former buildings of the Central Civil Engineering Laboratory stand on the southern side of the boulevard. Across the boulevard, on the northern side, there is a group of buildings, one of whom collapsed during its construction in January 1964, killing at least 20 people and injuring at least 18. This accident was known as the . The Exhibitions Center and the D√¥me de Paris stand along the boulevard. Boulevard Lefebvre was accessible through the Petite Ceinture bus line. Now it can be reached through the tramway Line 3a.  History  The French war department had completed the Thiers wallincluding fortifications, a dry moat, a Rue Militaire and a large bermaround 1840. In 1859, the military engineering service gave conditional control to the Paris city council. The expansion of the land area of Paris in 1860, by annexing bordering communities, created a situation where everything within the Thiers wall was Paris and everything without was not. The Thiers wall, with its accompanying berm and moat, led to a profound disruption and complication of the synergistic relationship between Paris and its suburbs. Paris city council started upgrading and conversion of some sections of the Rue Militaire into boulevards in 1861, with the (yet unnamed) Boulevard Lefebvre one of the first stretches to open. On March 2, 1864, the boulevard was named after Fran√ßois Joseph Lefebvre (1755-1820), Duke of Dantzig and Marshal of France. Each section of the upgraded Rue Militaire was then named for a marshal of the First French Empire (1804‚Äì1814) who served under Napoleon I, leading to the entire ring being collectively called the Boulevards of the Marshals. The Boulevards of the Marshals concept was almost fully realized by 1932, though the final three sections, closing the ring, would not be completed until 2005. Of the 22 boulevards, 19 have been named for Lefebvre or one of his fellow First Empire marshals.

Example for a skyspace In 2014, James Turrell conceptualised the Skyspace Lech design specifically for this location to integrate itself in the landscape seamlessly. It opened to public in September 2018. A skyspace is an enclosed space which is open to the sky through a large hole in the ceiling or dome. It usually is large enough for about 15 people. In this particular skyspace, the artist combines two of his vital art concepts: Firstly, the skyspace itself with its dynamic dome which allows visitors to gaze at the sky and the colour-changing light at the walls. The aperture of Skyspace Lech's dome is in an elliptic shape. The light performances last for about 45 minutes during which visitors are able to spot the Biberkopf summit and the village B√ºrstegg on one side and on the other the Omeshorn. Secondly, the so-called Ganzfeldraum which the skyspace turns into in its closed state.

The film stars Michael Abbott Jr., Virginia Newcomb, Andre Hyland, Sarah Baker, Jess Weixler, Roy Wood Jr., and Sunita Mani. It premiered at the 2019 Sundance Film Festival on January 26, 2019, and was released by A24 on September 27, 2019. Plot The film begins with friends Dick Long, Zeke Olsen, and Earl White carousing: playing loud rock music, shooting off fireworks, and pulling pranks on one another. The night turns deadly serious when Dick ends up sustaining severe injuries and his friends dump him in front of an emergency room. The cause of his wounds is unexplained. Earl returns to his home and loads up his truck with several of his possessions, telling friend and casual love interest Lake that he has to leave town for a family emergency but rather than skip town immediately, he briefly attends a shift at his warehouse job. Zeke gets a shower and quietly sneaks into bed, fooling his wife Lydia into thinking he had been asleep. She asks him to drive their daughter Cynthia to school. He agrees and when Lydia asks him for some cash, he inadvertently pulls Dick's wallet out of his pocket: he and Zeke took it off of him as he laid unconscious. He takes out the driver's license and puts it on the counter and quickly gets Cynthia down to the garage. Before they leave, he realizes that his back seat is covered in blood and he covers it with a sheet. As the two men begin their day, Dr. Richter‚Äîthe physician who discovered Dick lying outside the hospital where he works‚Äîcalls the local police department. The man has died overnight from severe rectal hemorrhaging and he suspects that there was a sex crime involved. Zeke stops off at a gas station and inside the store, Cynthia interacts with Officer Dudley. As the child tells her that her father found a wallet that he should return, Zeke notices that the blood in the back seat has soaked through to Cynthia's dress. He runs inside to keep the police officer from seeing and gives her the wallet. The two quickly leave and Zeke calls Earl to tell them that they have to meet immediately. Earl arrives at Zeke's house where Cynthia is upstairs bathing: the two attempt to scrub the blood from out of the back seat and Earl takes the girl to school in his truck where he briefly speaks to Dick's widow Jane who doesn't realize her husband is dead. The duo eventually decide to dump the evidence in a river and walk away, with the cover story that the car was stolen. At the police station, Sheriff Spenser enlists Dudley to help her with the murder. Lydia hears gossip that someone was murdered and calls Zeke in a panic; that night, she is flustered and afraid for her safety. When Zeke tells her that their car was stolen the night before, she insists on calling the police and Dudley and Spenser arrive to question him. The interrogation is brief: forensic analysis is complete on Dick's body. Cynthia overhears Zeke's lying and mentions how he drove her in the car that morning. Lydia tells her to go watch television and confronts Zeke about these inconsistencies, demanding the truth. Zeke breaks down and tells her that Dick is dead. She is shaken and asks for details. Zeke confesses that he, Earl and Dick all had participated in zoophilic acts for years, and Dick died from having had sex with Dick and Jane's horse Comet. Lydia is disgusted and demands that he leave. He goes to a local bar to meet Earl and becomes resolved that he will not run away. Meanwhile, at the police station, Dudley and Spenser agree to return to the Olsens' and to inform Jane of what has happened to her husband. At Jane's house, she walks to their stable to find a drunk Zeke shirtless. She asks him what is happening and if Dick is having an affair. He reassures her that he is not and the duo walk back to Zeke's house where Dudley has recently arrived. They all sit at the dinner table where Lydia and Zeke's stories spiral out of control until he blurts out that Lydia had nothing to do with what happened and he runs out of the kitchen. Dudley follows after him and Lydia tells Jane to stay so she can explain. Zeke has gone to the stable to free Comet and begs him to run away as Dudley arrests him. The next morning, Dudley and Spenser walk to the site of the ditched car and the sheriff explains that Zeke has been released. Dudley is incredulous but her boss explains that these charges would only cause more harm, ruining the lives of Cynthia, Jane, and Lydia. Zeke wanders away from the police station to Cynthia's school in time to catch the end of her piano recital. Lydia briefly confronts him and tells him to get out of their lives. That night, he is dropped off at a motel where Earl and Lake have a room. Zeke asks what Earl's plan is for his complicated lie and how the three of them will survive. Earl shrugs, says that he'll come up with something, and starts playing \\"How You Remind Me\\" on his guitar.

Critical response On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 75% based on 76 reviews, with an average rating of 6.85/10. The site's critics consensus reads: \\"The Death of Dick Long mixes dark humor with provocative ideas to produce a sharp blend that's admittedly uneven but uniquely satisfying.\\" On Metacritic, it has a weighted average score of 69 out of 100 based on 21 reviews, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". Writing for The A.V. Club, Ignatiy Vishnevetsky gave the film a B‚àí, favorably comparing it to the absurdity and grotesqueness of Swiss Army Man, saying the tone \\"falls somewhere between irony and sincere fondness\\".  Inspiring events  As the death of the titular character is due to internal injuries sustained from intercourse with a horse the film evokes a parallel to the real life death of Kenneth Pinyan, an engineer who worked for Boeing and resided in Gig Harbor, Washington. Those events were wildly reported by The Seattle Times as the Enumclaw horse sex case.

It featured Josephine Brandell and Margaret Dumont in early roles. Synopsis Vincent and Rea beneath the \\"Trysting Tree\\" Babette is the only daughter of Poquelin, a prosperous miller, who holds the mortgage on the ch√¢teau and estate of the gay old Marquis de St. Gautier. Babette, according to the custom of her village, has been betrothed by her parents to Baptiste, a famous Paris chef, who is hourly expected to claim his bride. Facing the mill is a fine old tree known as the \\"Trysting Tree\\", to which is attached a curious legend. If man and maid meet beneath its branches and exchange vows of love at the moment the bells of a neighbouring convent chime, then a happy marriage may be expected. Had Baptiste arrived a little sooner it might have been his good fortune to have experienced that felicitous omen, but as it happens, it is young Raymond de St. Gautier, the son of a Marquis, who was the fortunate individual, and he and Babette fall in love at first sight. The old Marquis, however, has different views as to his son's matrimonial affairs. To relieve the estate from the heavy debts with which it is burdened it is necessary that Raymond should make a rich marriage, and to that end the Marquis is doing all in his power to bring about a union between Raymond and his wealthy ward, Mlle. Denise de la Vire. Denise also has a love affair to hand, with the Comte Victoire de Casserole, and she is determined that her fortune and her heart shall be placed in the same keeping. But there is a golden lining to the Marquis's cloud, and, as the old miller promises the mortgage deeds as Babette's dowry, the Marquis withdraws his objections, and the bells of Brittany give hearty and melodious salutation to the daffodil \\"belle\\".The Belle of Brittany, The Play Pictorial, No 77, Vol XIII, (1908), pp. 27‚Äì28 Original cast Darrell as Toinette and Graves as the Marquis de St. Gautier *Baptiste Boubillon (a chef) ‚Äì Walter Passmore *Raymond de St. Gautier (son of the Marquis) ‚Äì Lawrence Rea *Comte Victoire de Casserole (a dandy) ‚Äì Davy Burnaby *Poquelin (a miller) ‚Äì M.

The aircraft was first flown on 18 July 2017 and is supplied as a kit for amateur construction. It is named after the shark. The Mako was the first new design from Lancair since the company's purchase by Mark and Conrad Huffstutler and the company's relocation to Texas from Redmond, Oregon in 2017. The design is a development of the Lancair IV and Lancair ES and is related to the Columbia 300 and the later Cessna 400. The design was intended to compete with the type certified Cirrus SR22 and the now out-of-production Cessna TTx, with higher performance for half the price. Design and development Aircraft type's logo The aircraft features a cantilever low-wing, a four-seat enclosed cabin accessed by doors, tricycle landing gear with an optional automatic retractable fully castering nose wheel, main landing gear with wheel pants and a single engine in tractor configuration. The optional retractable nose gear automatically retracts when the onboard sensors measure the airspeed over 100 knots, 1,000 feet above the ground, throttle position above 30% power, weight off the wheels and flap position up. All five parameters must be met for the nose wheel to retract. Retracting the nosewheel increases cruise speed by up to 12 knots, due to its location in the disturbed air of the propeller slipstream. The system is fully automatic; there is no cockpit selection lever. The aircraft is made from composites. The wing mounts flaps. The standard engines used are the Lycoming IO-540, the Continental IO-550, the turbocharged Lycoming TIO-540 and the turbocharged Continental TSIO-550 four- stroke powerplants for the T-Mako turbocharged version. A Ballistic Recovery Systems ballistic parachute is optional. A center stick or side stick are optional, as is a ThermaWing heated wing or TKS weeping wing ice protection systems, air conditioning and heated seats. The company's Builder Assistance program is included with the kit purchase price. Kit production commenced in January 2018, with an initial goal of producing one kit per month. Operational history In a 2017 flight test review Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association Pilot Editor at Large, Dave Hirschman described the design noting, \\"the Mako‚Äôs first impression is that it‚Äôs big and sleek‚Äîlike its shark namesake. It strongly resembles a Lancair IV because the two models use the same fuselage and retractable nosewheel ... The Mako is sleek and appealing on the outside‚Äîand it‚Äôs comfortable, roomy, with good visibility and terrific avionics on the inside.\\" Hirchman was critical of the nose gear retraction automation, saying, \\"Personally, I‚Äôd prefer either fixed or fully retractable landing gear. Call me old-fashioned, but if the gear moves, I want to have a lever for that‚Äîeven though I recognize I‚Äôm less reliable than software.\\" Flying Magazine reviewer, Pia Bergqvist, flew the design in 2018 and wrote, \\"Flying the Mako is simply a joy. While the control feel could be a bit lighter (something Conrad is working on), it is a solid platform that will help the pilot stay out of trouble. I tried to get the airplane to stall but couldn‚Äôt get it to break. With Conrad‚Äôs help, we brought it to 56 knots, 6 knots below the red line on the airspeed indicator. An AOA gauge popped up automatically on the G3X, and it was well in the red. There was no tendency for the nose or a wing to drop as we floated downward at about 1,000 fpm.\\" Specifications (T-Mako)  See also *List of aerobatic aircraft *List of seaplanes and amphibious aircraft References External links * Lancair aircraft 2010s United States sport aircraft 2010s United States civil utility aircraft Single-engined tractor aircraft Low-wing aircraft Homebuilt aircraft Aircraft first flown in 2017 ","title":"Lancair Mako"},{"id":"60454464","text":"is a Japanese rock band, formed in 2011 in Osaka Prefecture.

As a photographer, Pailet documents once-in-a- lifetime events such as the 1976 American Freedom Train, the 1984 World's Fair and the aftermath and devastation of Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans. He opened A Gallery for Fine Photography in 1973, making it one of the first art galleries to be devoted solely to fine-art photography.  Early life  Joshua Mann Pailet was born June 30, 1950 in New Orleans, the son of Charlotte Mann Pailet and Gustave Pailet. His mother was born in 1924 in Brno, Czechoslovakia to a Jewish family, and was the only member of her immediate family to survive the Holocaust after she was rescued along with 668 other children as part of the Kindertransport effort organized by Sir Nicholas Winton. Pailet's parents met in London at the end of World War II ‚Äì his mother was working as a nurse and his father was a United States Army Lieutenant ‚Äì and moved to America to Gustave's birthplace, New Orleans, in 1945. The family then moved to Baton Rouge, Louisiana, where Pailet lived before attending Rice University, graduating with Bachelor's degrees in Accounting and Economics in 1973. At Rice University Pailet was first exposed to photography under the tutelage of Eve Sonneman, and was mentored by world-renowned art collectors John and Dominique de Menil of the Menil Collection. After his graduation, Pailet then returned to his birthplace of New Orleans and opened A Gallery for Fine Photography that same year.  A Gallery for Fine Photography  A Gallery held its first exhibition in 1975 featuring the work of master landscape photographer Ansel Adams, whose influence Pailet says \\"shaped me ... and I began collecting photography in the early 1970s.\\" Four years later, Pailet and A Gallery became founding members of AIPAD, the Association of International Photography Art Dealers. The gallery went on to represent world- renowned photographers such as Henri Cartier-Bresson, Helmut Newton, Sandy Skoglund, Joel-Peter Witkin, Herman Leonard, Sebastiao Salgado, Elliott Erwitt, Ruth Bernhard, Peter Beard, Danny Lyon, Jessica Lange, and many more. Pailet and A Gallery have been staunch supporters of the New Orleans photography community ‚Äì especially in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, when they were instrumental to the founding of the New Orleans Photo Alliance and PhotoNOLA, New Orleans' annual festival of photography ‚Äì and currently represent many New Orleans-based photographers such as Josephine Sacabo, Louviere+Vanessa, Ben Depp, and Richard Sexton.  Documentary photography  In addition to his career as a gallerist, Pailet has established himself as a well-known documentary photographer with work in the collections of the Smithsonian Institution, the Library of Congress, the Polk Museum of Art and the Menil Collection. After shooting \\"a roll of film per day for nearly forty years,\\" Pailet has amassed an archive of more than \\"150,000 black-and-white negatives and 250,000 Kodachrome slides\\" featuring subjects such as \\"People, places, things, and once in a lifetime events; steam engine, performers, music, festivals, jazz funerals, the 1984 World's Fair, streets, and characters of New York City, New Orleans, San Francisco, London, Paris, and Prague.\\" In 1976, Pailet was invited to photograph the American Freedom Train as it made its cross-country journey; Pailet's trip produced 15,000 images, a selection of which was published in the book All Aboard, America.\\" Pailet's next major body of work focused on the 1984 World's Fair in New Orleans, the last world's fair to be held in the United States. Pailet's series \\"focused on the rebuilding of downtown New Orleans from 1980 to 1985, and the transformation of a riverfront warehouse site into the 1984 Louisiana World Exposition\\" and was reproduced in the 1987 book The World's Fair, New Orleans. In August 2005, when Hurricane Katrina made landfall in New Orleans, Pailet remained at his gallery, which fortunately survived undamaged. He remained in New Orleans for the storm's aftermath and rebuilding efforts, and captured what he saw in photographs that would be later be exhibited together on the storm's 10th anniversary as Joshua Mann Pailet: Recover, Rebuild, Rebirth. In 2010, Pailet's work was exhibited in a retrospective at the Polk Museum of Art in Lakeland, Florida titled Eye See America: Through the Lens of Joshua Mann Pailet. Together with museum curator Adam Justice and board member Robert Puterbaugh, Pailet \\"combed through thousands of images, ... most of which had never been printed for display ... [and] whittled the images from several thousand to 1,500 and finally to 66.\\" The exhibition ran at the museum from October 2010 through January 2011.

The three were put on trial in 1574 for multiple crimes, including the murder of a courier, attempted poisoning of Duchess Hedwig and copying keys to the Duke‚Äôs chambers with the intent to steal some papers. However, it is hypothesized that their real crime was not being able to produce the Philosopher‚Äôs Stone and their attempt at covering up the fact that they had not produced the Stone. The three were tortured and all eventually confessed to their crimes.Gordon, Searching for the Soror Mystica, 72.

From 1954 to 1967, she served as the executive director of the South Carolina Council on Human Relations, which was an affiliate of the South Carolina Division of the Southern Regional Council (SRC). She directed the council to participate in the Voter Education Project, which helped to promote compliance with the Civil Rights Act of 1964.  Early life and education  Spearman was born on March 12, 1902, in Marion, South Carolina, to Samuel Wilkins Norwood, a well known South Carolina banker and Albertine Buck, the daughter of one of South Carolina's largest slave owners. Spearman attended private and public schools in Marion, South Carolina and studied at Converse College, where she earned a bachelor of arts degree in history and literature in 1923. After graduating from the college, Spearman taught school in South Carolina before moving to New York City in 1926, where she earned a master's degree in religious education from Teachers College, Columbia University. She was a member of the Young Women‚Äôs Christian Association, where she practiced her Baptist religious beliefs through social service. Particularly, after finishing her career in Teachers College, Columbia University, she took courses at the YWCA National Training School and Union Theological Seminary and worked for the YWCA in Germantown, Pennsylvania. After attending an international student conference in Oxford, England, Spearman decided to begin a three-year journey around the world. She studied Asian culture in Japan and travelled to the Soviet Union, and India.  Early career  After returning from her journey, Spearman was soon appointed as a relief director in Marion County, where she set up relief for textile workers in the United Textile Workers of America strike in 1934. In 1935, she married Eugene H. Spearman Sr., whom she worked with. Because the Employment Act of 1932 prohibited both spouses from being federal employees, Spearman quitted her job and move to Newberry, South Carolina. In 1951, overwhelmed by financial problems, Spearman sought a full-time position as an executive secretary of the South Carolina Federation of Women's Clubs (SCFWC) and as an associate editor of the Club Woman magazine.  Anti-segregation efforts  In October 1954, Spearman became the first full-time and paid director of the South Carolina Council on Human Relations. In the aftermath of the Supreme Court‚Äôs decision in Brown v. Board of Education, she devoted much of her efforts into desegregation. Particularly, she attempted to reach out to various white women's organizations and encouraged them to understand the racial injustice facing society. Because Spearman believed the idea that privileges bring responsibilities, her central philosophy focused on pushing women to their limits at the time women were largely excluded by social movements. Additionally, she also served as a bridge between the progressive women members of the Southern Regional Council (SRC), whom she tested her innovative ideas with and older generation members, whom she sought advices from. Spearman tried to form a coalition with white men, but her efforts were unsuccessful. In 1959, under Spearman‚Äôs leadership, the SRC launched several initiatives, including the student sit-ins and lunch-counter demonstrations of the desegregation movement. Spearman and her council also worked to create educational and economic opportunities for black South Carolinians. Through her lobbying efforts, in 1963, the University of South Carolina admitted three African-American students. Under Spearman‚Äôs leadership, the South Carolina Council, chartered independently of the Southern Regional Council in 1963, joined the Voter Education Project (VEP) and participated in programs addressing issues regarding illiteracy, job opportunities, and poverty in rural South Carolina.  Later life and death  In March 1970, Spearman married Marion Wright, whom she had forged an enduring friendship with while she was fighting in the civil rights movement. Both moved to Linville Falls, North Carolina. Wright and Spearman were honored with the Frank Porter Graham Civil Liberties Award from the American Civil Liberties Union, respectively in 1969 and in 1973. After Wright died in February 1983, Spearman returned to Columbia, South Carolina. On her eighty-seventh birthday, March 12, 1989, Spearman died at the South Carolina Episcopal Home at Still Hopes.

It was founded in 1988 by Robert Kurtzman, Greg Nicotero, and Howard Berger, though Kurtzman left in 2003. After establishing a reputation for gory effects in horror films throughout the late 1980s and early 1990s, they broadened to performing animatronics and makeup effects for mainstream comedy and drama films. Their work on The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe and The Walking Dead have netted them multiple awards and nominations.  History  Founders Robert Kurtzman, Greg Nicotero, and Howard Berger were all working freelance on various Hollywood productions in the mid-1980s. Kurtzman likened the atmosphere to that of local bands who influenced each other. Nicotero and Berger met while performing special makeup effects under Tom Savini on George Romero's zombie film Day of the Dead. While Berger did that, Kurtzman was hired to take Berger's place as John Carl Buechler's assistant. Nicotero, Berger, and Kurtzman all worked together on Sam Raimi's Evil Dead II. The three briefly continued working freelance, sometimes on the same films. In 1988, the three formed their own company. The name KNB was chosen to represent the first letter of each founder's last name. KNB's first film was Intruder, directed by Scott Spiegel, who had written Evil Dead II. After that, they did makeup effects for several direct-to-video films and horror film sequels, including A Nightmare on Elm Street 5: The Dream Child and Halloween 5: The Revenge of Michael Myers. They credited their work with these films, which frequently had a low budget, for developing a reputation in the industry. To work within these budgets, they performed most of the work themselves. Around the same time, Romero recommended KNB to producer Debra Hill for Gross Anatomy, a comedy film about medical students. Romero knew Nicotero had a background as a pre-med student himself. Their work on this film cost them more money than they made but helped further establish their reputation. The realistic-looking cadavers they created got them the attention of Kevin Costner, who hired them to make animatronic buffalo for Dances with Wolves. Nicotero said this helped to break them out of being known only for gory horror films. Hoping to break into further mainstream films, KNB contacted Rob Reiner when they heard he was adapting Misery. Reiner initially declined their offer, reasoning that he did not need special effects because he was deemphasizing the novel's gore. After pointing out the potential for realistic ‚Äì but subdued ‚Äì effects, Reiner hired them. For the 1991 film City Slickers, they made animatronic calves. In the early 1990s, they continued their collaboration with Sam Raimi, working on Army of Darkness, the sequel to Evil Dead II. Among other horror films, they performed effects for Dr. Giggles, which was not well received among genre fans or critics, though its effects were praised. In the 1990s, a collaboration with Quentin Tarantino began with Reservoir Dogs. Kurtzman had hired Tarantino to write a screenplay from a treatment; this was eventually filmed as From Dusk till Dawn. In return, Kurtzman promised KNB would perform special makeup effects for Reservoir Dogs, which turned into that film's torture scene. Dusk did not get produced until 1996. In the meantime, KNB worked on Pulp Fiction. Following the release of Jurassic Park in 1993, many artists worried that computer-generated imagery might overtake the industry, forcing out practical effects. Berger said that instead of panicking and changing their specialty, KNB decided to \\"just ride it out\\". At the same time, there was a slowdown in horror films in the mid-1990s. KNB emphasized to filmmakers their ability to create realistic animatronics, bringing effects that had once been mainstays of B movies to mainstream films, such as prosthetic effects in comedy films. Throughout the 2000s, they continued their collaboration with Tarantino, working on Kill Bill and other films. Kurtzman left the company in 2003. Berger said Kurtzman wanted to focus on directing and raising his family. KNB performed makeup effects for Land of the Dead, Romero's followup to Day of the Dead. Savini, who was by then working as a director, appeared in a cameo as a zombie at Nicotero's suggestion. In 2006, KNB created animatronics for The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, which was initially going to be completely digital. Their work resulted in an Academy Award for Best Makeup and Hairstyling and BAFTA Award for Best Makeup and Hair. Since 2010, Nicotero has performed special makeup effects for The Walking Dead, which has drawn awards and nominations. In 2011, Nightmare Factory, a documentary about the company, was released.

Williams was a politician from Georgia and served on the Republican National Committee. In 1924, Williams became the first woman from Georgia and first African American woman to speak on the floor of the Republican National Convention. She is a member of the Georgia Women of Achievement hall of fame.  Early life  Mamie Williams was born in April, 1872 in Savannah, Georgia to Reverend James and Sarah Miller. Her given name was Mary Frances, but she was called Mamie. Williams was educated at the Beach Institute in Savannah and at the Atlanta University. After completing her education, Williams married twice but was twice widowed. Her second husband's first name was \\"George,\\" so she was often referred to as Mrs. George S. Williams. Eventually, she became known by to many as \\"Mamie George.\\"  Civic service  During World War I, Williams began her career in civic service by supporting war efforts at home such as Liberty Loan Drives. Additionally, she dedicated over 2,400 hours of volunteer work for the Toussaint L'Ouverture branch of the American Red Cross. After spending much of her time on charitable work, Williams began to make a transition and focus instead on politics.  Political career  = Voter mobilization = In 1920, after the Nineteenth Amendment was passed which granted women the right to vote, Williams took action and registered such a large amount of African American women to vote that the governor suddenly stopped voter registration so that ancillary laws could be passed. During the 1920 presidential election, Williams was credited with turning out over 40,000 women from Georgia to vote. Her voting campaign, which included picketing polling centers and making speeches, spread throughout 160 counties. = National Republican Committee = In 1924, Williams became the first woman from Georgia and the first African-American woman in the United States to be appointed to the National Republican Committee. That same year, Williams made history again, as she was the first woman given the right to speak on the floor of the Republican National Convention. On the floor, she defended the Georgia delegation whose seats were in danger because a white faction of the party wanted to strip black Republicans of their power. Shortly after the 1924 Republican National Convention, Williams created the first political organization composed of only African American women in the United States, the National Republican League of Colored Women Voters. Until 1932, Williams held a position of political power, however, her political influence was stripped from her that year by a contingency of white politicians, whose mission was to remove black Republicans from key political positions.  Community influence  = Women's clubs = Aside from her career in politics and civic service, Williams was also heavily influential with United States women's clubs. Established in 1924, Williams was a charter member of the Southeast Federation of Colored Women's Club, and during the same year she became the president of the Georgia Federation of Colored Women's Clubs. Furthermore, she served as the Vice-President of the National Association of Colored Women's Clubs, \\"serving with such venerable women as Hallie Q. Brown, Mary Church Terrell, Ida B. Wells, and Mary McLeod Bethune.\\" Williams also was involved with the Girl Scouts in Savannah and eventually had a troop named after her. = Business = Though her career in business was not as extensive as her career in politics, Williams served as a Director of the Carver Bank and also as a Board Member of Central State College in Macon, Georgia. Additionally, in the 1940s, Williams led movements to establish a public colored recreation and swimming pool in Savannah and also helped secure a grant to establish a state home for African-American girls in Macon.  Death and legacy  Mamie Williams died in the Savannah Charity Hospital in 1951, and since her death, many remember her as one of the pioneers for African-American women in politics. After her passing, Sol Johnson, the editor of the Savannah Tribune at the time, eulogized Williams by writing: > \\"Mamie Williams was indeed a tireless fighter. She was a leader in state, > regional, and national women's clubs, fought for a Republican delegation > representative of both black and white citizens of Georgia, and scored > \\"firsts\\" for women in national politics. Although battle-tested, victorious, > and at times standing as a \\"lone reed\\" speaking on behalf of her people, > Williams never flinched; she never gave in. Mamie George Williams was a > beacon of light and hope for women across Georgia and the nation.\\" In 2018 she was posthumously named a Georgia Woman of Achievement.

His scholarship focuses on Jewish ethics, theology, and the Musar movement. Education Claussen received his BA in Classical Languages from Carleton College. He was ordained as a rabbi and received his M.A. and Ph.D. from the Jewish Theological Seminary of America. Career Claussen joined the Elon faculty in August 2011 as an assistant professor of religious studies. In April 2012, he was named the Lori and Eric Sklut Emerging Scholar in Jewish Studies. He is also the founding director of Elon‚Äôs Jewish Studies program, which launched in fall 2012. Claussen served as president of the Society of Jewish Ethics from 2015‚Äì2017. Jewish Veganism In 2017, Claussen was one of the rabbis who signed a statement by Jewish Veg encouraging veganism for all Jews. Claussen has argued that teachings of the Musar movement may enrich Jewish vegan practices today.  Scholarship  Claussen has been noted for his book Sharing the Burden: Rabbi Simhah Zissel Ziv and the Path of Musar. Christian B. Miller claimed that in his book, Claussen \\"succeeded in making the teachings of Simhah Zissel Ziv relevant today, both to contemporary Jewish ethics and, I would argue, to other traditions of both secular and religious thought about morality.\\" Claussen's work has also pointed to the significance of the 21st century revival of the Musar movement and the value of a virtue-centered approach to moral reasoning.

Ely Playter (1776‚Äì1858) was a farmer, lumberman, militia officer, and member of the Upper Canada House of Assembly, who lived in and around York, modern day Toronto. Playter was born on November 30, 1776 in Chesterfield Township, Burlington County, New Jersey to George Henry Playter, a Loyalist, and his wife Elizabeth Welding, a Quaker. By the 1790s, Playter, with his parents and siblings, had moved to York in Upper Canada. In York, Playter worked as a tavern-keeper, farmer, and militia officer. He participated in the War of 1812 including the siege of York. Following the war he was elected to the 9th Parliament of Upper Canada, defeating William Warren Baldwin in 1824. Playter moved with his family sometime around 1826 to Pekin, Niagara County, New York. Playter documented his life from 1801 to 1853 in a number of diaries. In addition to documenting his day-to-day life, he also provided a first-hand account of someone living through the War of 1812. Topics include the challenge of rounding up the local militia, the siege and subsequent fall of York to American soldiers in 1813 and its subsequent occupation. Playter's diaries have been used as primary resource material for numerous publications related to the early history of Toronto including Pierre Berton's War of 1812 and Flames Across the Border, 1813‚Äì1814.

Her parents were Walter C. and Emma Moore Bedwell.\\"New York, New York City Municipal Deaths, 1795-1949,\\" database, FamilySearch (10 February 2018), Bettina Bedwell Rattner, 29 Apr 1947; citing Death, Manhattan, New York, New York, United States, New York Municipal Archives, New York; FHL microfilm 2,133,606. She attended school in Denver and then studied at the Art Institute of Chicago.  Mid-life and career  Bedwell moved to Paris in 1921 or 1922. In 1924, she began reporting on fashion for the Chicago Tribune-New York News Syndicate. That year she also married Abraham Rattner, an American painter, in Paris.: 268 In 1929, American author Kay Boyle began working for Bedwell as a \\"secretary.\\" Boyle wrote to her family that the work included writing fashion articles for the Chicago Tribune, which appeared under Bedwell's name. Boyle and Bedwell became friends, continuing to work together and visit each other into the 1940s.: 164-5 From 1929 until 1940, Bedwell was a \\"style spy\\" for Margaret Hayden Rorke of the Textile Color Card Association of the United States. Bedwell wrote weekly letters to Rorke, reporting on the color trends she saw on the streets, in restaurants, and in the couture houses of Paris. Her letters were often full of swatches and color samples. Rorke used Bedwell's letters and swatches to enhance her own color forecasting in the U.S. Bedwell understood the pirating of Paris fashions well. She had reported on fashion bootlegging and \\"style pirates\\" in a 1930 article that appeared in the New York Times. Bedwell's own columns were sometimes accompanied by sewing patterns that copied the Parisian styles she reported on. Bedwell later put this knowledge to use in outlining a novel, Yellow Dusk (Hurst & Blackett, 1937), a thriller about drug smuggling and fashion theft set in a Paris couture house. The novel appeared under Bedwell's name, but it was ghostwritten from her outline by Kay Boyle, who was paid $250.  Later life and death  Bedwell and Rattner left Paris in late 1939 to avoid the Nazi invasion. They settled in New York. Bettina Bedwell died there from a kidney infection on April 29, 1947.

During the nine-month-long governorship of his brother al-Mufaddal over Khurasan, Mudrik, who was headquartered in Balkh, was appointed alongside Uthman ibn Mas'ud as joint commander of an expedition against the rebel general Musa ibn Abd Allah ibn Khazim of Tirmidh.Shaban 1970, pp. 62‚Äì63.

Mudrik and Uthman secured alliances with the non-Muslim principalities surrounding Tirmidh and defeated Musa's forces, a task which had eluded many of al-Mufaddal's predecessors.

Background  = Negotiations between businesses, trade union and the government in 2002 = Fedec√°maras began to distance itself from Ch√°vez whilst the new Constitution of 1999 was being drafted. Pedro Carmona indicates that the lack of dialogue between the government and businessmen during the constitutional process caused general discomfort in the business industry. Carmona thinks that the Constitution's specific points that irritated businesses are changing the nature of the armed forces to no longer be up for discussion or with public deliberation; the power granted to the president in terms of military promotions; the elimination of the bicameral Congress; the strengthening of presidential powers and the extension of the presidential term to six years with the possibility of immediate re-election; the loss of the balance between the ministers and chambers; indigenous rights disproportionate to the Venezuelan reality;In 2001, only 2.3% of the population identified themselves as indigenous, the amount went up in 2011 up to 2.7%. and the reaffirmation of a national ideology promoting statism and interventionism, which would limit individual and economic liberties. Vicente Brito, the then-president of Fedec√°maras, added one more reason when announcing that his organization would support \\"No\\" in the coming constitutional referendum: a statement that Ch√°vez had made on 18 November 1999 that had bothered him. In the 28 July 2001 election, Carmona Estanga defeated Alberto Cudemus, a businessman close to Ch√°vez, and succeeded Brito in the presidency of Fedec√°maras. On 4 August, Carmona met with Chavez at the Military Academy of the Bolivarian Army, where they celebrated the anniversary of the National Guard; according to Estanga, Ch√°vez said that he didn't want conflicts with Fedec√°maras to continue, and they planned a meeting on 22 August at Miraflores. At the meeting, Carmona proposed a plan to lower unemployment by 17% at that time, improving conditions in order to increase private investment up to 20% of GDP in five years, and Ch√°vez responded with a plan for strengthening the public sector. A table for dialogue was created between Fedec√°maras and the government, the latter represented by Jorge Giordani, Minister of Planning. The meetings did not bring results: despite the fact that they happened once a week and that Ch√°vez was present at one of them, the government continued to write the controversial 49 laws without sharing their content with Fedec√°maras or its agricultural equivalent, Fedenaga. In the opinion of the opponents, this violated articles 206 and 211 of the Constitution. In October 2001, some of the content of these laws had been leaked as rumors, and so Carmona and Chavez met at the Caracas Military Circle. According to Carmona, they had tense dialogue:On 13 November Ch√°vez decrees 49 laws based on the Enabling Law, a legal instrument that allowed him to legislate without the approval of the Legislative Power, that was granted by the National Assembly in the previous November. Although originally two thirds of the Assembly were controlled by Chavez, the situation had changed as some deputies had become dissidents; it was unlikely that Ch√°vez would succeed in obtaining another enabling act and so he passed these laws a day before this power expired. As such, several laws appeared, including the Organic Law of Hydrocarbons, the Fisheries Law, the Special Law of Cooperative Associations, the General Law of Ports. The most controversial was the Law of Land and Agrarian Development. Under this law, the Venezuelan government gained the power to take private lands if they surpassed a certain size and were classified as latifundia, or if the government believed that they weren't being used to their maximum potential; this also meant that the State must now approve the owner's use of the land. In addition, all owners were required to prove ownership of their land before 18 December, at the risk of losing them if they did not. Carlos Ortega at a press conference (2002) Carmona Estanga then suspended dialogue with the government and called an extraordinary assembly on 28 November. There he proposed that a national twelve-hour strike be held on 10 December, and he won the majority support of the business leadership, though the proposal was surprisingly rejected by Miguel P√©rez Abad, the president of Fedeindustria. On 4 May, Fedec√°maras joined Confederaci√≥n de Trabajadores de Venezuela, the main trade union; its Secretary General, Carlos Ortega, was strengthened after winning the elections against the Chavista candidate, Arist√≥bulo Ist√∫riz. However, the opposition political parties were divided in their opinions on how to overcome the political crisis. Acci√≥n Democr√°tica insists on designating a medical board that proves the mental incapacity of the president, Francisco Arias C√°rdenas and his deputies call for a referendum, the Movement for Socialism calls for more meetings on the Constitution, while Justice First and the Catholic Church ask the government for a change of course. All options come from a business perspective, since the parties still hadn't recovered from electoral setbacks in recent years. Although firm in executing the 49 laws, Ch√°vez does try to prevent Fedec√°maras from carrying out the strike. During a luncheon with a group of businessmen and bankers on 6 December, the latter are pressured not to join the strike, with the threat of withdrawal of public funds deposited in their banks. As a result of this meeting, the Interior Minister, Luis Miquilena, prepared a compromise that was presented to Carmona Estanga, but both Estanga and Ch√°vez reject it, a fact that deepens the separation. On the day of the strike Carmona announced that it was accepted by 90% of the country, though the government denied this; whether or not it was a success, though, both Ch√°vez and Carmona said, in retrospect, that date was historical:Indeed the conflict irreconcilably tore the businesses and the government apart; in the next two months Ch√°vez makes two changes in his cabinet that show that there is no going back. First, he replaced the Minister of Agriculture and Lands for \\"a revolutionary professor\\" whose main mission was to make sure that the Land Law is executed; he then fires Miquilena from government. Although he publicly promises to continue cooperating with Ch√°vez, in private he was disgusted by the aggressive discourse of Ch√°vez and waits for the right moment to take control of the National Assembly. = Boston Group = The Boston Group was a parliamentary committee of the National Assembly of Venezuela financed by the Organization of American States (OAS) and created following the creation of the Venezuelan- American parliamentary friendship group, which in turn was created in 2002 after the coup d'√©tat attempt. The group consisted of parliamentarians from the United States and Venezuela that agreed to meet outside the country to discuss important issues for both nations in a less polarized environment. Its objectives were to learn legislative practices, to establish and maintain a solid link between the United States Congress and the Venezuelan parliament, and to create an exchange of legislative information and cooperation in areas of common interest. Half of the Venezuelan members were opposition deputies and the other half were pro-government deputies. Among the members of the group were Nicol√°s Maduro and John Kerry. Its executive committee was led by Pedro D√≠az Blum and Calixto Ortega. Other members of the group were Cilia Flores; Luis Acu√±a; the vice president of CADIVI, Jos√© Salam√°n Khan; the rector of the National Electoral Council (CNE), Tania D'Amelio; Elvis Amoroso; ; and √Ångel Emiro Vera. One of the main themes of the Boston Group's discussions was poverty and the media. Cass Ballanger, who chaired the Committee for International Affairs of the Western Hemisphere in the US Congress, announced that five members of the group were going to get funding, donate equipment, and provide training for the National Assembly to have a public television station and a radio to transmit the debates of the Assembly and its commissions. The first discussions of the Law on Social Responsibility on Radio and Television (Ley Resorte) were stopped so that the Boston Group could listen to the arguments for and against the law of owners of private media, in working groups. The Boston Group dissolved in 2005 after the retirement of opposition deputies during the 2005 parliamentary elections, which coincided with the creation of the official television channel of the Assembly, Asamblea Nacional Televisi√≥n (ANTV). Many of the laws passed by the Assembly during this period, including the Resorte Law, ignored the arguments and conclusions from the working groups of the Boston Group.  History  = 2014 protests= During the protests in Venezuela in 2014, the government held a series of meetings from 26 February 2014, known as the \\"National Conference for Peace\\", where various sectors of society met together. The Democratic Unity Roundtable (MUD) announced that it would not participate in the National Peace Conference at that time, declaring that \\"it would not lend itself to a simulation of dialogue\\", with Julio Borges, secretary of the Justice First opposition party, adding that the MUD had not participated because it did not know the meeting agenda proposed by the government, and believes that the main points discussed should be around disarmament of armed groups, the release of detained students, the separation of powers, the release of Leopoldo L√≥pez, among other points. On 10 April the first round table was held between representatives of the Venezuelan opposition and members of the national government. The meeting took place in the Ayacucho Room of Miraflores Palace. The meeting was chaired and mediated by Colombian Foreign Minister Mar√≠a √Ångela Holgu√≠n, Ecuadorian Foreign Minister Ricardo Pati√±o, and Brazilian Foreign Minister Luiz Alberto Figueiredo, all from the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR), as well as a representative from the Holy See through the Apostolic Nunciature, at the request of the Venezuelan opposition.Hist√≥rica reuni√≥n entre el Gobierno y la oposici√≥n en VenezuelaGobierno y oposici√≥n de Venezuela se enfrascan en debate televisivoVea el video completo del di√°logo Gobierno-oposici√≥n President Maduro was accompanied by several senior politicians, among them the First Lady Cilia Flores; Vice President Jorge Arreaza; Foreign Minister El√≠as Jaua, Secretary of the Tupamaro Movement, Jos√© Tom√°s Pinto; and the mayor of the Libertador municipality, Jorge Rodr√≠guez. The governor of Miranda, Henrique Capriles Radonski, was accompanied by different representatives of the MUD, including Ram√≥n Guillermo Aveledo and Henry Ramos Allup. The meeting had 22 speakers in total, eleven from the MUD, and eleven from the government. The members played different songs for five hours on the national radio and television network. Pope Francis sent a letter to the members of the meeting, which opened discussions.¬´El nuncio apost√≥lico ley√≥ la carta por la paz del papa Francisco¬ª, art√≠culo del 10 de abril de 2014 en el peri√≥dico Infobae (Buenos Aires). = 2016 recall referendum= In 2016, the opening stage of the recall referendum was suspended by the National Electoral Council (CNE) on 20 October, citing the decision of the regional courts of Apure, Aragua, Bol√≠var, Carabobo and Monagas. The votes were annulled, due to accusations of fraud by the Democratic Unity Roundtable. The opposition called for peaceful mass marches called \\"takeover of Venezuela\\" from 26 October 2016. A few days later, the opposition announced the suspension of the \\"March to Miraflores\\" planned for 3 November 2016, whose destination was the Miraflores Palace in Caracas. The march was suspended after opposition representatives met with Thomas Shannon, US Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs, and Archbishop Claudio Mar√≠a Celli, who was sent by the Vatican as mediator of the conflict in Venezuela, negotiating the participation of the opposition at a dialogue table with the government. = 2017 protests= During the protests in Venezuela in 2017, in September, the government and the opposition began negotiations again in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic. After Operaci√≥n Gede√≥n, in which the dissident √ìscar P√©rez died during a clash with security forces, the interior minister said he had obtained information for the operation at tables of dialogue. The coalition of the Democratic Unity Roundtable denied providing information and the operation, describing it as an \\"extrajudicial execution\\". The MUD issued a statement to President Danilo Medina, demanding that the Venezuelan government clarify the statements offered by Minister Reverol on the case of P√©rez and said that the debate should not continue with the climate of tension that exists. The opposition delegation did not attend the last meeting scheduled for 18 January 2018, citing the operation as one of the reasons why it did not participate. = Presidential crisis =  2019  On 22 January 2019, Mexico and Uruguay called for talks to reduce the tensions between government and opposition supports to prevent an escalation of violence. On 24 January, the secretary general of the UN, Antonio Gutierres, issued a call for dialogue, asking all the parties to tamper tensions and open an independent and transparent investigation into the events of the 23 January. On 28 January, Pope Francis reiterates his call for dialogue by specifically stating \\"that it be carried out in a climate of peace and justice.\\" On 30 January, Mexico and Uruguay announce the convening of an International Conference on the Situation in Venezuela to be held in Uruguay on 7 February \\"to lay the foundations to establish a new dialogue mechanism that, with the inclusion of all Venezuelan forces, will contribute to return the stability and peace of this country\\", according to the statement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Uruguay. The initiative is proposed, they point out, in response to the call of Gutierres and of Pope Francis for dialogue. Bolivia joins the initiative hours after the announcement. On 31 January, the Vice President of the European Union, Federica Mogherini, announced the creation of the Contact Group on Venezuela, initially composed of eight European countries and four Latin American countries (Uruguay, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal, the United Kingdom, Sweden, Spain, Ecuador, Costa Rica and Bolivia). During their first meeting on 7 February, Uruguay alongside the participating states‚Äîwith the exception of Bolivia and Mexico‚Äîagreed to form the International Contact Group on Venezuela and issued a jointly signed declaration which called for new elections to occur in Venezuela. On 1 February, the White House rejected \\"any mediation of dialogue\\" that keeps Nicol√°s Maduro in power. For his part, President Maduro agreed with the dialogue initiative. A US-drafted UN Security Council resolution calling for free and fair presidential elections in Venezuela received majority support, but it was vetoed by Russia and China on 28 February, with South Africa voting against the resolution as well. A Russian counter-resolution calling for a dialogue between the Maduro government and the opposition based on the Montevideo mechanism, was voted against by France, the United Kingdom, the United States, Germany, Poland, Peru and Belgium while only 4 countries voted in favor of the resolution. Juan Guaid√≥ declared that the National Assembly will not participate in the dialogue with Maduro. His reasoning is that it comes to nothing and has already been done \\"inside and outside Venezuela, in private and in public, alone and with international companions.\\" He says that the result in each case has been more repressive, with Maduro taking advantage of the process to strengthen the dictatorship. Offering as examples Leopoldo Lopez, the detention of Juan Requesens, the exile of Julio Borges, among others, he said that if Maduro really wanted dialogue, he would free the political prisoners. Referring to a letter that Maduro wrote asking for help from Pope Francis, Guaid√≥ rejected the Vatican's offer to mediate if both sides accepted, calling the attempt \\"false dialogue\\" and said the Vatican could help those who \\"refused to see the Venezuelan reality\\". Guaid√≥ said Maduro did not respect the terms of the 2016 negotiations and suggested that the pope could encourage Maduro to allow an orderly transition of power. Corriere della Sera cited an edited copy of a private letter sent by Pope Francis to Maduro on February 7 in response to a letter that Maduro wrote asking the pope for mediation. In the letter, the Pope refers to Maduro as \\"His Excellency Mr. Nicol√°s Maduro Moros\\" and says that previous negotiating agreements have not been met. The conditions, still applicable, were the opening of a humanitarian channel, the convocation of free elections, the freedom for political prisoners and the reestablishment of the powers of the National Assembly. According to Andrea Gagliarducci, writing for the Catholic News Agency, the Pope accepted the position taken by the Venezuelan bishops, who maintain that Maduro's election was illegitimate, by not addressing him as president. Following the failed military uprising, representatives of Guaid√≥ and Maduro began mediation with the assistance of the Norwegian Centre for Conflict Resolution. Jorge Rodr√≠guez and H√©ctor Rodr√≠guez Castro served as representatives for Maduro while and Stalin Gonz√°lez were representatives for Guaid√≥. Guaid√≥ confirmed that there was an envoy in Norway, but assured that the opposition would not take part in \\"any kind of fake negotiations\\". After the second meeting in Norway, no deal was reached. During a rally in June, Guaid√≥ announced that there were no plans for further talks in Norway, \\"not on the table today. Why not? Because if anything that does not move us toward (Maduro‚Äôs resignation) is useless\\", he said. Guaid√≥ also declared that the next time there is a meeting in Oslo it would be because they are closer to the \\"cease of usurpation, transition government and free elections\\".  2020  In February 2020, the coordinator of the Lima Group, Hugo de Zela, announced that three of its member countries, ‚Äì Argentina, Canada and Peru ‚Äì are attempting to negotiate with the Cuban government to find a solution to the crisis. Although no details of the negotiation were leaked, it was confirmed by officials in Buenos Aires. In late March 2020, the United States relaxed its position and proposed a transitional government that would exclude both Maduro and Guaid√≥ from the presidency. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said that sanctions did not apply to humanitarian aid during the coronavirus pandemic health emergency and that the United States would lift all sanctions if Maduro agreed to organize elections that did not include himself in a period of six to twelve months. Pompeo reiterated U.S. support for Juan Guaid√≥. The deal would enforce a power-sharing scenario between the different government factions, and the US would remove all sanctions should it be agreed to. Elections would have to be held within the year, and all foreign militaries (particularly noted are Cuba and Russia) would have to leave the country. The US were still seeking Maduro's arrest at the time of the announcement. Other aspects of the US deal would include releasing all political prisoners and setting up a five person council to lead the country; two members each chosen by Maduro and Guaid√≥ would sit on the council, with the last member selected by the four. The EU also agreed to remove sanctions if the deal went ahead. Experts have noted that the deal is similar to earlier proposals but explicitly mentions who would lead a transitional government, something which stalled previous discussions, and comes shortly after the US indicted Maduro, which may pressure him to peacefully leave power. Guaid√≥ accepted the proposal, while Venezuela's foreign minister, Jorge Arreaza, rejected it and declared that only parliamentary elections would take place that year. Arreaza said that decisions about Venezuela would be made in Caracas and not in Washington or other capitals and that the most important transition for Venezuela was from capitalism to socialism which had started many years ago. Reuters reported that during the COVID-19 pandemic, allies of both Nicol√°s Maduro and Juan Guaid√≥ had secretly begun exploratory talks, according to sources on both sides. Guaid√≥ and U.S. Special Representative for Venezuela Elliott Abrams have denied that negotiations have taken place.  Public opinion  In December 2017, a survey by Venebar√≥metro showed that 49.8% of Venezuelans disagreed with the dialogue that was taking place in the Dominican Republic.

Career  Bamberg received his PhD in physical chemistry from the University of Basel in 1971, and a habilitation in biophysical chemistry from the University of Konstanz in 1976. He was a Heisenberg fellow from 1979 to 1983, when he became head of an independent working group at the Max Planck Institute of Biophysics in Frankfurt/Main. In 1988, he became an adjunct professor at Frankfurt University, which named him a full professor of biophysical chemistry in 1993, and professor emeritus in 2009. He has also been a director and Scientific Member at the Max Planck Institute of Biophysics since 1993, and a senior investigator at the Cluster of Excellence Frankfurt (CEF) since 2008.  Research  Bamberg's research focuses on channelrhodopsins. With Georg Nagel and Peter Hegemann, who were attempting to identify the proteins that allow Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, a green alga, to move toward light using photocurrents, Bamberg was part of the first research team to isolate and characterize channelrhodopsin 2 (ChR2). ‚ÄúWe had a hard time trying to convince people that it was true,‚Äù he told Nature later, but \\"Before we published the first papers [showing that algal proteins could generate currents in eukaryotic cells], we applied for a patent where we gave to our fantasy a free run about the possible applications of channelrhodopsins on electrically excitable cells, including some biomedical applications.‚Äù In 2005, Bamberg and Nagel worked with Ed Boyden, Karl Deisseroth, and Feng Zhang to demonstrate that this light-gated channel could be used as an actuator to control neural activity, helping to lay the foundations for the study of optogenetics.

It is a monotypic genus, and the single species is Clistosaccus paguri, which is found in the northern Atlantic Ocean and the northern Pacific Ocean. Taxonomy In his 1861 paper, Wilhelm Lilljeborg described two new monotypic genera, Apeltes (with the species A. paguri) and Clistosaccus (with C. paguri), both collected from Pagurus hermit crabs. It was not until the 1920s that Hilbrand Boschma pointed out these two purported species, at the time placed in separate families, were but two distinct growth stages of the same organism and united them under Clistosaccus. Description This parasitic barnacle starts life as an internal parasite in the abdomen of its host hermit crab. After about three months a protuberance, known as an \\"externa\\", pushes its way through the abdomen, usually on the left side. This bulge is at first globular, but elongates as it grows, becoming cylindrical. The mantle opening is at one end, and the parasite is attached to the host by a short, wide stalk about two thirds of the way towards the other end. The externa is white and can grow to a length of about . Host hermit crabs include Pagurus bernhardus, Pagurus pubescens, and Pagurus dalli. Distribution and habitat Clistosaccus paguri occurs in both the northern Atlantic Ocean and the northern Pacific Ocean. In the Atlantic its range extends from the White Sea to Nova Scotia, and in the Pacific, its range extends from Alaska and the Bering Sea to Kodiak Island, the Sea of Japan and the Sea of Okhotsk. Its depth range is down to about . Life cycle After an infective female cyprid larva has settled on a suitable host, it pierces the cuticle with its antenule and injects some cells into the abdomen of the hermit crab. These develop internally, sending out root-like processes into the surrounding tissues. The parasite has no gut, but after about three months, the externa pushes through the crab's abdomen. This is essentially a reproductive structure on a stalk, with a large ovary and a brood chamber. A male cyprid larva settles on the externa and fertilises the eggs by antennule penetration, the larvae developing inside the brood chamber. Here they develop directly into cyprid larvae, missing out the nauplius stage of more typical crustaceans. The cyprid larvae are at first unisex, becoming male or female according to what role they play in the reproductive cycle. The presence of this parasite effectively sterilises the host hermit crab, the gonads do not degenerate, but they fail to produce mature eggs and sperm.

He was an important member of the First International and a veteran of the Paris Commune. Biography Simon Deutsch was born in Vienna in 1822 to parents from Nikolsburg, Moravia He studied at the Nikolsburg yeshiva, and later completed courses in philosophy and pedagogy in accordance with an 1842 law aimed at modernising the Moravian rabbinate. As a young man he devoted himself to Hebrew studies in Vienna. He catalogued in collaboration with A. Kraft the Hebrew manuscripts in the possession of the Vienna Imperial Library, and published a medieval grammatical work in 1845. From 1844 to 1848, Deutsch was a contributor to Der Orient, a Leipzig-based German‚ÄîJewish weekly; and from 1846 to 1848, he wrote for ', a Viennese literary and cultural journal, founded and edited by Ludwig August von Frankl. Alongside writer , Deutsch co-published J√ºdischer Plutarch in 1848, which contained biographies of prominent Jewish poets, painters, scientists, mathematicians, doctors, philosophers and educators. That same year, he became a member of the Deutsche Morgenl√§ndische Gesellschaft, one of the first scholarly associations to welcome Jews into its ranks. In 1848 Deutsch sided with the revolution, escaping after its collapse to France. In Paris, through the assistance of Mme. Strauss, the friend of B√∂rne, he entered upon a business career, in which he was successful. He assumed a prominent position in the Finance Department of the Paris Commune. After the fall of the Commune in May 1871, Deutsch was denounced to the government as a Communist. He was arrested and imprisoned at Versailles, and only the efforts of Austrian ambassador Richard von Metternich saved his life. In 1875 Deutsch began publishing the Ma·∏•beret of Mena·∏•em ben Saruq in fascicles with annotations and translations into Yiddish, based on a manuscript in the Imperial Library of Vienna, but the work was left incomplete. Towards the end of his life Deutsch was a supporter of the Young Turks movement. He died unexpectedly while in Constantinople on business, and was interred at the P√®re Lachaise Cemetery in Paris.

In Korea, we call factory women workers as Yo Gong (Ïó¨Í≥µ) which letters came from a Chinese character (Â•≥Â∑•). Specifically, \\"yo\\" means (Â•≥ female) and \\"gong\\" means (Â∑• work). Most of the South Korean female factory workers were unmarried single and were mostly very young. Also, their derogatory name was Kongsuni (Í≥µÏàúÏù¥) which is a combination of the word common woman's name (Kongdori) and factory (Kong Jang).  History  One of the well-known protests was 1976 Naked Demonstration. During 1976, there was a Naked Demonstration by female workers at the Dong-il Textile Company. It was one of the significant protests by women, where they only wore bras and panties and confronted police and government. The police dragged and screamed at these protesters. This was the first protest for South Korean women workers where they were able to confront and claim their own rights with courage. Not only there was a Naked Demonstration but there was also another significant event which was Korean Women Textile Workers Fighting for Fair Union Election from 1976 to 1978. This fight prolonged for two years and was the one of the most impressive protests among women protest. During 1970, the South Korean economy was difficult and was heavily depending and relying on the profits by gaining low industrial cheap products. Most of the products were chemical and apparel products. As factories required women workers to work more hours to produce more cheap products, their working hours had extended over the years. Also, in 1973, the \\"New Factory Movement\\" was known as (Kongjang Saemaul Undong), did support workers to identify who they really were.  Personal life and struggles  In the beginning, most of the factories imposed workers to work overnight until Saturday and allowed them to rest on every Sunday. Factory management sets this rule because they cared about workers' health and their conditions. However, in most of the cases, it didn't last long. Later overnight work was added and even extended on the other days. As workers repeated this routine, the women workers became more sensitive and had a great tense in working places. As this tension continued, it leads to arguments and fights among workers in factories. Some factories had an air conditioner, but someplace didn't. Since some factories didn't have any fans for workers, they were sweating all the times and faced physical exhaustion which eventually leads factory workers to use abusive and coarse language to each other. The manager of the factory workers usually pressured workers to come out of the factory even though they were severely injured or sick. This didn't only apply to women workers in South Korea, but it also applied to all the workers in South Korea including both females and males. Within and outside the factory, management controlled their lives and workers sincerely hoped and sought liberation from the cage of \\"work\\". Factory women workers also struggled with the multiplicity of their identity, being a mother, daughter, student, worker, friend, and sister. According to the KOSIS (Korea Statistical Information Service), the rate of age 15 and older women workers were working reaching 52.7 percent in 2016. As there were more women workers, the birth rate declined as the population rate decreased when half of the women in South Korea started to work. It not only decreased the population and birth rate, but also caused various types of cancer to factory women workers in South Korea. Most of the ovarian cancer was found from the textile factory workers. Other than ovarian cancer, women workers also suffered from breast cancer, thyroid cancer, uterine cancer, and hair loss.Im, H. (Director). (2015). Factory Complex [Video file]. Torch Films. Retrieved June 11, 2019, from Kanopy. Moreover, most of the women workers got tuberculosis by not eating enough or if the working condition or environment was bad that caused the disease. Not only they struggled with this sickness, but they had trouble dealing with sexual assault and few of the workers were raped by the managers. Even though they were working hard, the workers still strived from the hunger. During the 1970s, women factory workers had struck by saying \\"too hungry to live, give us food\\". Hunger was another issue for factory women workers.  Education  The female labor participation rate increased by 20.8% in 35 years from the 1960s. The female labor participation rate increased by urbanization, where large numbers of women moved to cities from urban areas to find jobs. Most of the women looked for their jobs in factories and businesses. From the age of 15, they had been working in factories without studying at middle school and high school during their youth. They didn't have any chance to graduate properly in both primary schools and weren't fully educated compared to other 15-19 aged teenagers who go to school. From 20 to 24 years old women had the highest percentage of the age group that occupied in the factories among other age groups. In the 1980s, only 66 percent of female workers were educated in primary school. Since they worked from an early age, they didn't have a chance to be fully educated.  Legal rights  Right after there was an economic crisis in South Korea in the 1990s, women workers had to face gender hierarchy in their community and union. In most of the times, women were excluded from the conversation of labor and were taking a major part in public work. Since factory women workers were mostly young, they were hired in very low wages because they had less experience. Therefore, the companies earned huge benefits by using these workers with low wages, extending the working hours longer than usual working hours. The wages that women received was less than half of men's wages in industrial factories.

A Conscientious Objector is defined as \\"an individual who has claimed the right to refuse to perform military service on the grounds of freedom of thought, conscience and or religion\\" by the United Nation's Human Rights Commission. Since the signing of the Conscription Law in 1949, stating that every male 18 years of age must serve in the military, Conscientious Objectors, when found, are arrested and subject to violent punishments. Post 1949, there have been at least 400,000 Conscientious Objectors and draft evaders recorded and over 20,000 have been criminalized and subject to brutal treatment. In South Korea, the majority of Conscientious Objectors are part of Jehovah's Witnesses and Seventh Day Adventists. However, in the early 2000s, more men claimed to be a Conscientious Objector for their political ideologies, instead of religious affiliations. While there is not an official list, there have been cases in which Conscientious Objectors have died because of their injuries sustained in prison. One such example is the case of three men, Chong-Sik Kim, Chung-Gil Lee, and Sang-Bok Jeong. Each of these men faced brutal beatings and starvation during their prison sentence, leading to their deaths in 1975 and 1976. Until the early 2000s the discourse about Conscientious Objectors amongst South Korean media outlets and political parties was scarce. The culture of militarism was pervasive amongst the government and civilians alike as the nation dealt with international wars and conflicts with North Korea. Post 2001, activists groups such as World Without Wars, began fighting against the criminalization of Conscientious Objectors. In November of 2018, for the first time in South Korean history, the Constitutional Court ruled that the military must provide an alternative service to those who object to violence and released fifty seven imprisoned Conscientious Objectors.  Timeline  * 1945: End of Japanese Colonial Rule * 1948: Korea is split into the Republic of Korea and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. * 1948: The Constitution of the Republic of Korea is formed. ** Article 19-21 discuss Freedom of Conscience and Religion. * 1948: Creation of Military Service Act * 1950-1953: Korean War * 1963-1979: President Park Chung-hee's term ** 1971: Park declares state of emergency * 2018: Fifty-seven Conscientious Objectors freed from prison  Conscientious objectors movement  With the end of World War Two and the end of Japanese colonial rule in South Korea, the United States and the Soviet Union split Korea into two nations, the Republic of Korea and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. In 1948, the Constitution of the Republic of Korea was written and implemented, solidifying the right of freedom of consciousness and religion. However, South Korea had just escaped the traumatic and violent Japanese colonization, creating an atmosphere of anxiety and defensiveness. Therefore, the government decided to create the Military Service Act, which established that all men must join the army to protect and serve the new nation. When President Park Chung-Hee was elected in 1963, he made it his mission to have a 100% conscription rate, meaning that every man beginning at age eighteen until age twenty-two had enlisted and served in the army. In order to establish this, in 1971 President Park declared that South Korea was in a state of emergency, claiming that South Korea was vulnerable to North Korean invasion. President Park created systems to trap Conscientious Objectors, making it seemingly impossible to avoid military service. Park manufactured identification documents that could be checked by any government official at any time. By creating a registry of citizens, Park was able to track who had completed their military service and who had not. Park also ordered soldiers to go to Jehovah's Witnesses' churches and arrest men of age who had not been enlisted. In an effort to award veterans, President Park afforded men who had served employment opportunities. While these tangible systems were efficient, Park also influenced the public's opinion of Conscientious Objectors by claiming that joining the military was a way to address classism and solidify equality. In addition to the disdain the public had for draft evasion, due significantly to the aura of anxiety surrounding Northern invasion, Park's attempt to paint Conscientious Objector's as citizens against equality and democracy further isolated and silenced Conscientious Objectors. While internationally 80% of criminalized Conscientious Objectors reside in South Korea, the humanitarian issue of criminalizing Conscientious Objectors was not a heavily debated topic amongst the media in South Korea, rendering the debate stagnant whilst men served their sentences until 2001. Some scholars claim that this is because of the media attention growing activist groups gained. World Without War was a particularly influential group of activists as they objected to Korean soldiers aiding the United States in the war in Iraq, adding to a group of individuals who claimed to be a Conscientious Objector based on their political beliefs, rather than because of religious affiliation. Currently, World Without Wars is meeting with other activist groups in the hope to further gain rights and protections for Conscientious Objectors. The introduction of a feminist perspective not only included women in the conversation about conscientious objection but also challenged the militaristic proceedings of other activist groups and counter the hegemonic masculinity constructed and perpetuated by universal male conscription.  Religious persecution  For years, Conscientious Objectors were considered a group of abnormal minority of religious people who chose the doctrine of the Church over the sanctity of the state. This is largely due to the mass arrests of Jehovah's Witnesses for refusing to join the military and the criminalization of Seventh Day Adventists who refused to bare arms. While both Jehovah's Witnesses and Seventh Day Adventists are Christian denominations, their relationship to conscription has differed. Both Jehovah's Witnesses and Seventh Day Adventists were imprisoned and treated inhumanely, however in the 1960s their sentencing was determined by different courts. In the 1960s Jehovah‚Äôs Witnesses refused to even enlist in the army and were therefore tried in a civilian court whereas Seventh Day Adventists would enlist in the army but refuse to hold guns, and were therefore tried in military courts. With President Park's changes in the 1970s however, both Jehovah's Witnesses and Seventh Day Adventists were tried in military courts, often facing longer and more violent punishments than if they were tried through the civilian courts. Additionally, Seventh Day Adventists and Jehovah's Witnesses had a different relationship with the law and conscription. While the Seventh Day Adventists released a collective statement and appealed to the military and Constitutional Court to petition for legal objection to military service, Jehovah's Witnesses as a collective did not take legal action. Further, Seventh Day Adventists criticized conscription as an act that was against the Church and therefore posed the Church against the State. On the other hand, Jehovah‚Äôs Witnesses formulated conscientious objection as a matter of individual conscience. Even before the Constitutional Court‚Äôs decision of 2018, starting with a court in Seoul in 2004, some local courts had acquitted Jehovah‚Äôs Witnesses and other religion-based conscientious objectors on the basis of the constitutional principle of religious liberty.  Criminalization of dissent  Feminist scholars and activist groups criticize President Park's means of obtaining a one hundred percent conscription rate, as he created the means to criminalize men who deviated from the hegemonic masculine ideal President Park propagated. Through his fear tactics, President Park painted Conscientious Objectors as possible spies or communists. Further, the propaganda released supporting conscription ensures that being a part of the military is a critical aspect of South Korean men's identity and idea of masculinity that is then legally solidified by the Military Service Act. In the fight against Conscientious Objectors, both the public and the government criminalized deviance from the status quo. The pervasiveness of militarism creates a cause and effect relationship between protecting conscription and arresting Conscientious Objectors.

Brown (born 1961/62) is an American investigative journalist with the Miami Herald best known for pursuing the sex trafficking story surrounding Jeffrey Epstein, who in 2008 was allowed to plead guilty to two state-level prostitution offenses. She is the recipient of several awards including two George Polk Awards for Justice Reporting. Brown was included in Time magazine 's 100 Most Influential People of 2020.  Early life and career  Brown was raised near Philadelphia, Pennsylvania by a single parent. She left home at 16 and worked in menial jobs before she could afford to attend college. She graduated magna cum laude from Temple University in 1987 with a degree in journalism. After college, Brown worked for the Philadelphia Daily News before joining the Miami Herald a daily newspaper owned by the McClatchy Company, around 2000. While at the Miami Herald, Brown spent four years investigating patterns of abuse in the Florida prison system. Her reporting work prompted a 2018 federal investigation into civil rights abuses in Lowell Correctional Institution in Central Florida. Brown has been credited with re-opening the Jeffrey Epstein sexual abuse case with a series of reports published in November 2018. She began investigating Epstein in early 2017 and persisted in uncovering facts about the large number of accusers and the pressure campaign to silence them. Brown uncovered 80 potential victims (as young as 13 and 14 years old when the abuse occurred) and documented the 8 individuals who agreed to tell their stories. In 2008 Epstein had been allowed to plead guilty to only two state-level prostitution offenses even though sex with underage girls was legally rape. The secret deal that then-US Attorney Alex Acosta struck with Epstein made federal sex trafficking charges disappear, shut down a FBI probe that might have uncovered dozens of victims, and granted immunity to any possible co-conspirators, a clause that allegedly protected powerful men. Her 2018 reporting on the deal and Acosta's role in it sparked criticism of Acosta, who by then had become the United States secretary of labor, and there was pressure for him to resign. He eventually resigned after Epstein was arrested and charged in July 2019. After Epstein was re-arrested, many commentators praised her and the Herald for their reporting. \\"This is what happens when a reporter refuses to give up on a story,\\" The Columbia Journalism Review wrote on Twitter following Epstein's arrest. Geoffrey Berman, a federal prosecutor for the Southern District of New York, also commented at a news conference that his team had been ‚Äúassisted by some excellent investigative journalism.‚Äù But she tweeted in response \\"The Real Heroes Here were the courageous victims that faced their fears and told their stories\\". Brown‚Äôs articles were collected under the title \\"Perversion of Justice\\" and resurfaced on social media. Brown is working towards a book on Epstein that will also act as the foundation for a limited series on HBO to be executive produced by Brown along with Kevin Messick and Adam McKay.  Awards  Brown won a 2014 George Polk Award in Justice Reporting from Long Island University for \\"Cruel and Unusual,\\" her series of articles on \\"the brutal, sometimes fatal mistreatment of Florida prison inmates with mental illnesses.\\" Brown received a second George Polk Award in the category of Justice Reporting in 2018 for her investigative journalism on \\"Perversion of Justice.\\" Her series covered the extensive number of accusers in the Epstein case and the role of federal prosecutor Alex Acosta who permitted a non-prosecution agreement that protected four named conspirators and \\"granted immunity to any possible co-conspirators, a proviso that seemed to protect the powerful men Epstein partied with.\\" In April 2019, Alan Dershowitz (an associate of Epstein who was one of his attorneys during his criminal investigation in 2006-2008) tried to pressure the Pulitzer prize committee to shut out Brown and the Miami Herald for her investigative reporting that reopened the Epstein case. In an open letter Dershowitz wrote that Brown should not be rewarded for her work. She was not. At the start of her investigative reporting on Epstein, Brown had been warned by former Police Chief Michael Reiter to expect pushback as other members of the media who attempted to report on Epstein had been reassigned following a phone call to their publisher. Reiter stated ‚ÄúSomebody‚Äôs going to call your publisher and the next thing you know you are going to be assigned to the obituaries department.‚Äù Brown received the National Press Club Journalism Institute's 2019 Neil and Susan Sheehan award for investigative journalism in October 2019. In December 2019, Brown and her Miami Herald colleague Emily Michot were jointly recognized for their five-part series \\"Perversion of Justice,\\" with a Sidney Award, the Hillman Prize for Journalism in the Common Good, from the Sidney Hillman Foundation.

She was raised in Kobane, Syria, and gained attention after traveling by wheelchair, fleeing conflict in the Syrian Civil War, before arriving and resettling in Germany. She was listed as one of the BBC's 100 Women in 2018, and her story was featured on the television show Last Week Tonight with John Oliver. In 2019 she became the first disabled person to brief the United Nations Security Council, and was the recipient of the Alison Des Forges Award for Extraordinary Activism from Human Rights Watch. She has co-authored two books about her experiences. She resides in Wesseling where she attends a school for the disabled.  Life  Mustafa was raised in Kobane, Syria, with her sisters and brother as part of a Kurdish family. Her father, who is unable to read, sold sheep and goats while her brother dug water wells. She was born with cerebral palsy and spent the majority of her life \\"confined to her family's fifth-floor apartment in Aleppo.\\" According to reporting by National Geographic, their building had no elevator, and so leaving the apartment could only be accomplished by having someone carry her to the ground floor. She later compared the situation to being under house arrest: > For me, it meant not being able to go to school, hang out with friends or go > to the cinema ... Having a disability in Syria often means that you are > hidden away. You confront shame, discrimination and physical barriers. You > are someone who is pitied. Mustafa could not attend school while in Syria, as there were no facilities to accommodate the disabled, but she learned English from watching television, including the American soap opera Days of Our Lives. Beginning in 2014, at age 16, Mustafa traveled from Syria to Gaziantep in Turkey, and finally Germany as a refuge from the Syrian Civil War. Without the money to travel as a family, her parents remained in Turkey while she and her sister Nasrine continued to Germany, where her brother was already living. For the length of the trip, Mustafa traveled in a wheelchair with her sister pushing her. She traveled, in her own words, as a \\"pay-as-you-go refugee\\", meaning that she did not have enough money to pay smugglers to take her the entire way, and had to find new ways to progress each day, from taxis to trains in addition to smugglers. The trip in its entirety cost around ‚Ç¨6,000. She was granted asylum by Germany in late 2016. As of 2017 she lived in Wesseling and attended a school for the disabled.  Activism and recognition  Mustafa gained attention during her journey to Europe as a so-called \\"refugee celebrity\\", as she was interviewed by journalists while en route. In 2018, Mustafa was listed as one of the BBC's 100 Women. In 2019 she became the first person with a disability to brief the United Nations Security Council on her experiences during the war in Syria and policy regarding disabled persons. She has also given talks at the Palace of Nations in Geneva, TEDx in Iraq and the United Kingdom, and the presentation of the Nansen Refugee Award in 2017. In February 2019, Mustafa was announced as the winner of the Alison Des Forges Award for Extraordinary Activism, given out by Human Rights Watch, which cited the role her story played in helping to \\"move policymakers in the European Union\\" on the issue of the delivery of humanitarian aid to those with disabilities. She accepted the award at a ceremony in Australia in April of the same year. =Last Week Tonight= In 2015, Mustafa was featured on a segment of the television show Last Week Tonight hosted by John Oliver, covering the treatment of refugees, and which included segments from interviews she had given to the BBC. The segment also featured a one-off scene between Days of Our Lives characters EJ DiMera and Sami Brady. These had been reported as Mustafa's favorite characters in the show, and the former had been killed off in a recent episode. The character EJ addressed Mustafa, recognizing the difficulty of her journey as a refugee and calling her \\"our kind of people\\".

The conference was prepared over 18 months during 2018 and 2019 and planned to take place 14‚Äì16 April 2019. It was postponed in early April 2019 as a result the attack on Tripoli by the Libyan National Army led by Khalifa Haftar.  Preparation  The Libyan National Conference was coordinated by Ghassan Salam√©, head of the United Nations Support Mission in Libya (UNSMIL) over 18 months during 2018‚Äì2019. From April to July 2018, UNSMIL and the Centre for Humanitarian Dialogue organised 75 meetings in Libya and internationally with 7000 Libyans, three-quarters men and a quarter women. Half a million comments were collected on online social media from 130,000 online followers together with 2000 formal online \\"submissions\\". The November 2018 summary of the consultation stated that the main desires of Libyans were: * \\"a united Libya capable of defending its borders and sovereignty\\"; * \\"a united military institution, free from political interference and committed to the national interest\\"; * \\"more fair distribution of resources through a decentralized state\\"; * \\"a government based on competence, not identity\\"; * \\"professional police services to ensure local security\\". Salam√© summarised the preparation of the conference as including \\"broad consultation with all the Libyan factions and groups, and after the painstaking and delicate handling of local, regional and international constraints and imperatives.\\" The planned number of participants is about 120‚Äì150 Libyans from diverse sociopolitical Libyan groups, with no foreign groups represented. Salam√© stated in April 2019 that holding the conference was justified given that \\"the necessary conditions had been met to enable an effective solution to the crisis in Libya through a political settlement, the establishment of a national charter and commitments that could be given to place the country on the path of recovery, towards peace, restoration of unity and sovereignty and a decent life for the Libyan people.\\" The holding of the National Conference was supported by the United Nations Security Council.  Aims  The conference was planned to only make recommendations, with no executive powers, with the aim of not competing with existing Libyan political bodies such as the Presidential Council, the House of Representatives, the High Council of State. Specific proposals that should result from the conference include methods and dates for the 2019 presidential and parliamentary elections. These would be recommended to the House of Representatives and High Council of State, who would be responsible for implementing these.  Postponement and relaunch with new name  The National Conference was postponed in early April 2019 as a result of the military actions constituting the 2019‚Äì20 Western Libya campaign. In late 2020, a series of meetings similar to the originally planned National Conference was initiated, with the new name being the Libyan Political Dialogue Forum.

History  The railway line between and was opened on 11 October 1852 by the broad gauge South Wales Railway, which later became part of the Great Western Railway. The engineer of this line was Brunel. Originally, Loughor was the first station westwards from Landore; and were opened at later dates. The station was double track, with 2 platforms. A mineral line to Broad Oak Colliery diverged from the line to the east of the station. Loughor Viaduct Brunel's viaduct as at 2007 The new bridges, as at 2013 The Loughor Viaduct to the west of the station carries the line across the River Loughor. Before it was replaced in early 2013, the viaduct was the last remaining timber viaduct designed by Isambard Kingdom Brunel. The Loughor viaduct was constructed to carry the broad gauge South Wales Railway west of Swansea to Carmarthen. It was opened to traffic (broad gauge and standard gauge) in 1852. The viaduct was rebuilt several times; modifications made include the removal of its swing bridge and broad gauge tracks, replacement of the timber deck with an iron structure, and additional piles. In 1986, due to structural concerns, the track was singled and speed restrictions were imposed adding to journey times. In the early 2010s, Network Rail commissioned a new- build replacement. On 8 April 2013, the new bridge with its redoubled track was opened to traffic.https://www.railway-technology.com/projects/loughor- railway-viaduct-replacement-project/ A section of the original viaduct is preserved alongside the new structure. 1904 railway accident On 3 October 1904 an express passenger train of 2 engines and 8 coaches from New Milford towards Landore derailed.

Keen (n√©e Davidson) is a Canadian geologist and professor emeritus at the Geological Survey of Canada. Her work focuses on the structure of the earth's crust and the upper mantle using geophysical imaging and magnetic measurements. She was the first woman to go on a Canadian Survey Ship.  Early life and education  Keen was born in Halifax, Nova Scotia. She attended elementary school in Ottawa and went to school at Lachine High School in Montreal. She studied at Dalhousie University, and earned her bachelor's degree in 1964 and master's degree in 1966. In 1964 Keen became the first woman to go to sea on the Canadian Survey Ship Hudson. As a woman, Keen was technically not allowed to be on board, but was smuggled aboard with Frances Wagner in the Strait of Canso. She published her first Nature paper whilst still an undergraduate student. She moved to the United Kingdom, where she competed a PhD at the University of Cambridge and was one of the first two women members of her department. During her doctoral studies, she investigated the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, and her thesis included the first demonstration of seismic refraction experiments near a ridge. At Cambridge, Keen worked with Drum Hoyle Matthews, who had recently discovered seafloor spreading. She quickly became an expert in plate tectonics. After completing her PhD, Keen joined the Atlantic Oceanography Lab of Energy, Mines and Resources in Dartmouth, Nova Scotia.  Career  = Research = In 1971, Keen was made a research scientist at the Geological Survey of Canada, eventually becoming the most senior research scientist. At this time, women were not formally allowed on Canadian Research Ships, which resulted in Keen and her boss raising the issue with the Ottawa Deputy Minister's Office. She became the first woman to legally work on a Canadian Survey Ship. Her early work considered the continental margins and sedimentary basins in the Pacific Ocean. She performed refraction measurements to study the seismic anisotropy in the upper mantle, showing that the maximum and minimum velocity was consistent with seafloor spreading. Alongside extensive studies of the Atlantic and Pacific Ocean, Keen used biostratigraphic and metamorphic data to analyse the exploratory wells around Labrador. She showed that the subsidence of basement followed similar depth-age curves to the oceanic lithosphere. Keen developed thermal-mechanical models and applied them to rifted continental margins. She has studied the crystal structure of the continental margin of Eastern Canada. Keen was responsible for the development of the LITHOPROBE, the largest ever research science project in Canada. LITHOPROBE looked to investigate the geology and continental lithosphere of the ocean floor. In 1986 she was appointed the Head of Regional Reconnaissance at the Bedford Institute of Oceanography. Her research provided the scientific framework to interpret the petroleum geology of the region. In 1992 Keen was featured in Claiming the Future: The Inspiring Lives of Twelve Canadian Women Scientists and Scholars, a book of biographies about Canadian women scientists. She retired from the Bedford Institute of Oceanography in 1998.

He rose to the rank of admiral and was commander of the Northern Fleet. Born in the Russian Empire in 1909, Chabanenko entered the navy in 1927 and after completing his studies, began service with the Pacific Fleet as a submariner. By the outbreak of the Second World War he had graduated to command of his own boat, and then during the war, whole squadrons. Promoted to flag rank in 1944, he took part in the brief Soviet‚ÄìJapanese War, assisting in the invasion of South Sakhalin shortly before the surrender of Japan. The postwar years were spent combining further advanced studies with the command of several naval bases, before taking command of the Northern Fleet in 1952. He held this post for the next decade, overseeing important improvements and advancements with the introduction of nuclear submarines with greater capabilities than their predecessors. After some time as the Assistant Chief of the General Staff for Maritime Affairs, he became a consulting professor at the Military Academy of the General Staff, before retiring in 1976. He was honoured with numerous awards before his death in 1986, and was further honoured posthumously with the naming of a street in the Northern Fleet's base at Severomorsk, and the Udaloy II-class destroyer Admiral Chabanenko. Biography Chabanenko was born on in the village of Kozynka, then part of the Russian Empire, and now part of the city of Verkhivtseve, in Ukraine. He entered the M.V. Frunze Higher Naval School in 1927, and after graduating, served as an officer aboard submarines of the Black Sea Fleet. He joined the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in 1932, and was promoted to his own commands in 1933, as captain of a submarine in the Pacific Fleet. In 1938 he was further advanced to command of a submarine division. From 1940 to 1945, during the Second World War, he commanded one of the Pacific Fleet's submarine brigades, and on 5 November 1944 was promoted to rear admiral. He saw action in the brief Soviet‚ÄìJapanese War from August to September 1945, helping to land troops for the Soviet assault on Maoka, part of the invasion of South Sakhalin, and after the war was appointed commander of the Sovgavan Naval Base. In 1946 Chabanenko took a series of courses at the Naval Academy, and was then assigned to command the South Sakhalin Naval Base. He continued his studies with a secondment in December 1947 to the Military Academy of the General Staff, before joining the Baltic Fleet in 1950 as commander of the Porkkala Naval Base, and as chief of staff of the 8th Fleet. Chabanenko was promoted to vice-admiral on 27 January 1951, and in April 1952 was appointed commander of the Northern Fleet, with the rank of admiral from 3 August 1953 onwards. Chabanenko held the post for the next decade, during which time he oversaw the development of submarine tactics and operations, the introduction of the first nuclear submarines to the fleet, and the beginning of polar and long range submarine voyages. In June 1962 he was appointed Assistant Chief of the General Staff for Maritime Affairs, and in 1972 became a consulting professor at the Military Academy of the General Staff. He retired in November 1976, and died in Moscow on 19 December 1986. He is buried at the Kuntsevo Cemetery. Chabanenko's namesake, the Udaloy II-class destroyer Admiral Chabanenko, in 2011 Chabanenko was twice awarded the Order of Lenin, the Order of the Red Banner four times, the Order of the Patriotic War First and Second Classes, the Order of the Red Star twice and the Order \\"For Service to the Homeland in the Armed Forces of the USSR\\" Third Class, as well as a number of medals.

She was the teacher and life-long friend of the music scholar and composer Donald Tovey.  Biography  Weisse was born in Edinburgh in 1852 to immigrant parents. Her father, Traugott Heinrich Weisse, was a refugee of the German Revolution of 1848. Although blind, he worked as a German language teacher and wrote a book on German grammar, which ran into multiple editions. His wife, Sophie Marquidorff, was a Lithuanian pianist who performed regularly in chamber-music concerts in Edinburgh. Weisse had a younger brother, Heinrich, born in 1855. Like their father, Heinrich also worked as a teacher. In adulthood he used the name Henry Whitehouse. A sister Mary was born a year after Henry, and then a brother Victor was born in 1860. The family home was a cultural centre for Edinburgh people with interests in literature and philosophy. Little is known of Weisse's early life and education. Weisse had a large network of friends and associates. She knew Robert Louis Stevenson as a child through school and her father's role as his German tutor. Weisse claimed it was her father's influence that encouraged Stevenson to take up writing. Both Weisse and her brother Henry were long-time friends of Hungarian violinist Joseph Joachim. She spent time with Leopold von Ranke in the final weeks of his life, and published an account of their time, Leopold von Ranke, reminiscences of Berlin 1884-1886. Weisse never married and had no children of her own. For a few years following Tovey's divorce from his first wife, she and her former student, Clara Wallace, had joint guardianship of his young son, John Wellcome. Weisse died in January 1945 at Guildford, Surrey.  Teaching career  On the suggestion of friends, Weisse went to Eton in early 1880 with the intention of settling and establishing a school for the children of the college masters. She purchased Bendemere House in Englefield Green and turned it into an all-girls school called Northlands in 1892. Weisse ran the school for twenty-five years. It was a school of general education, but music and art were given a prominent place in the curriculum. Drawing upon her network of associates, Weisse had many musical celebrities visit the school, including Joseph Joachim, Maud MacCarthy, flautist Louis Fleury and cellist Pablo Casals. In her role as a teacher, Weisse encountered the young Donald Tovey, who would go on to become a renowned pianist, music scholar and composer.  Relationship with Donald Tovey  Upon identifying Tovey's talent for music at the age of four, Weisse took it upon herself to manage his education. She oversaw all aspects of his education until he attended Balliol College, Oxford. Despite not being a pianist herself, Weisse had studied Ludwig Deppe's piano method and used this as the basis to teach Tovey the piano. When Tovey was an adolescent, she arranged for him to study counterpoint with Walter Parratt and James Higgs, and composition with Hubert Parry. Tovey featured as the pianist in the Northland's concerts, providing a platform for his launch as a concert pianist. Weisse also supported Tovey's career by financing the publication of his Piano concerto in 1903, of which she was the dedicatee. She subsequently provided the funds for the publication of more of his work between 1906 and 1913. Weisse and Tovey maintained a relationship throughout their lives, although it was strained at times. Weisse disapproved of choices Tovey made in his personal life and expressed frustration with a stall in his career between 1902 and 1914. When the Reid Chair of Music at the University of Edinburgh became available to Tovey, Weisse was dismissive, believing that the role was beneath him, stating that the students are ‚Äòthe worst set of amateurs‚Äô and expressed her disappointment that he had passed up the opportunity of a summer of concerts in mainland Europe. However, upon Tovey's acceptance of the role of Reid Professor of Music at the University, Weisse followed Tovey to Edinburgh. Whilst Tovey held of the post of Reid Professor, he bestowed on Weisse an honorary degree of Doctor of Music in 1936, in recognition of her services to music.  Philanthropy  Weisse was a benefactor of the University of Edinburgh, with which she had an association through her relationship with Tovey. In memory of Tovey, upon his death in 1941, she gifted the property at 18 Buccleuch Place to the University. The property was named 'The Tovey Memorial Rooms', with the intention that it be used for student study. She also gifted Philip de Laszlo portraits of Tovey and herself, and ¬£750 for the foundation of the Tovey Memorial Prize for annual award to the undergraduate in the Faculty of Music who shows the greatest promise in composition or in instrumental performance. Her collection of around 600 books and scores relating to Beethoven was purchased by the University in 1948. Much of her correspondence, both professional and personal, is held in the University Archives. It includes correspondence between Weisse and Tovey, Louis Fleury, Hubert Parry, Joseph and Ellen Joachim, and J.A. Fuller-Maitland.

His father was a well known clergyman who completed 30 years of missionary service in France, and left several publications on his life such as Thomas Constable's Memoir.Source 1. Early life His ancestor prospered during the ancien r√©gime in Lorraine, and owned estate named Boinville. His great-grandfather, Jean Baptiste Chastel de Boinville, became much associated with Lafayette in political matters, and served as aide-de-camp under him. When the French Revolution broke out, and the King and Queen were brought from Versailles to Paris, they were escorted by Lafayette, who rode on one side of the carriage, and by De Boinville on the other. Like many other noble unfortunates, Jean Baptiste's estates were confiscated by the Revolutionary Government. He escaped to Britain where he met a wealthy supporter of French emigres, John Collins, a sugar planter in St. Vincent. Jean Baptiste fell in love with a daughter of Collins, Harriet and got married at the Gretna Green. They had a son John Collins Alfred and a daughter Cornelia Pauline Eugenia. After Napoleon seized power, Joan Baptiste returned to France, and lost his life in the Russian Campaign of 1812. Harriet and Cornelia were active in fashionable and literary society, and supported Percy Shelly in 1813‚Äì1814.John Worthen, Life of Percy Bysshe Selley, 2019, p.101-102. Two sons of John Collins Alfred, Charles Alfred and William tried to restore their old estate, but soon gave up to enter clergy service; Charles Alfred into Protestant missionary in France and William into Anglican Church. Architect Boinville was born at Lisieux, where his father of same name was pastor, in March 1849. After some years, de Boinville was removed to Bar-le- Duc in Lorraine, near the old family home, and subsequently to Cherbourg. He entered the office of William Henry White, who at that time was in practice as an architect in Paris. As soon as the Franco-Prussian war broke out, his family left for London except De Boinville, who was called to serve his country, writing many balloon-post letters to his anxious family in London. Shortly after the conclusion of the war, he has as an officer of the Garde Mobile, been on the defense of Paris during the protracted siege. He eventually crossed the Channel in early 1871. Scotland Through his father's connection with Thomas Constable, a publisher in Edinburgh, De Boinville entered the office of Campbell Douglas, an architect in Glasgow as assistant, and stayed in his house for about a year and a half. At that time, Douglas' friend Colin Alexander McVean was in the Civil Service of the Japanese Government, being chief surveyor of the Public Works Department. As McVean had a good deal of building work to do, Douglas helped him to send out a quantity of fittings and building materials, as well as a talented young architect. Douglas recommended De Boinville for this post. Before De Boinville left Scotland, he got engaged to Agnes Cowan, a youngest daughter of Charles Cowan, a banker and provost of Ayr. Japan's Public Works De Boinville arrived in Japan in December 1872, and soon started to work under MacVean for construction of the buildings of the Imperial College of Engineering. After the Survey Department was transferred to the Home Office in 1874, De Boinville took responsibility of the building section of the Public Works. In that service he remained for eight years, until the Japanese began gradually to dismiss their foreign officers. His two chief works were (1) the Imperial College of Engineering, Tokyo, including the main building, museum, workshops, dormitories, professors' houses, &c.;, and (2) the New Imperial Palace. Main Building, Imperial College of Engineering, 1880. Edward Cookworthy Robins admired that design of the Imperial College of Engineering was one of the best examples for technical education.Buildings for Secondary Educational Purposes, The Physical Department of the Imperial College of Engineering at Yedo, The Builder, April 7 & 14, 1880. Robins presented this article in the RIBA meeting and Royal Society meeting too. Practice in London After his return to England, De Boinville was selected as an associate member of the Royal Institute of British Architects with recommendation of William Henry White and Campbell Douglas in 1881, and got partnershiped with several architects such as Robins and de Boinville Brothers (Victoria Mansion, London), De Boinville and Wiblin (London) and De Boinville and Morris (Ayr). Although he won several competitions, his business was not successful. Several his architectural works still remain in Kingston upon Thames such as Anglican Church, now Korean Church London. Government Work De Boinville settled down in H.M. Office of Works in Whitehall Place in 1886, probably through his connection with Algernon Freeman-Mitford. He expressed his full talent of the detail drawings for the foreign Embassies, such as Brussels, Paris, and Lisbon, where he instituted and carried through important works. Indeed, it was on account of his much valued services at Whitehall Place‚Äî-or at least largely a direct result of them-‚Äîthat he was appointed to the honourable position of Surveyor to the India Office by the Government. His chief work was renovation of an upper storey of some sixteen apartments over part of the India Office. At that time, the India Office intended to carry out several large projects commemorating the Queen Victoria including the Victoria Memorial Hall in Calcutta now Kolkata, and of course De Boinville was ought to take responsibility if he did not pass away in 1897 due to pneumonia. Family De Boinville married Agnes Cowan at Yokohama on May 23, 1874 same day with Henry Dyer's marriage in presence of Sir Harry Smith Parkes, and registered their marriage at both the British Consulate and the French Consulate.The Japan Weekly Mail, May 27, 1874. The De Boinvilles lived at the Yamato Yashiki, the Public Works foreign officers' quarter, now site of the Hotel Okura Tokyo. They had a daughter Mary and a son Charles.

He was Bishop of San Pedro de Macor√≠s from 1997 to 2016.  Biography  = Early years = Francisco Ozoria Acosta was born on 10 October 1951 in Nagua, Dominican Republic. His basic education took place at Escuela Primaria de Payita and at Mercedes Bello in Nagua and his secondary education at the Seminario Menor San P√≠o X in Licey al Medio, Santiago de los Caballeros, which he entered on 30 September 1967. He studied philosophy at the Pontificia Universidad Cat√≥lica Madre y Maestra in Santiago de los Caballeros and theology in the in Santo Domingo. On 2 September 1978, he was ordained a priest and assigned to pastoral work in San Francisco de Macor√≠s. Other postings included: diocesan director for priestly vocations, vice-rector and director of spiritual formation at Seminario Menor Santo Cura de Ars, La Vega (1978-1981), pastor of Mar√≠a Madre de la Iglesia de San Francisco de Macor√≠s (1981-1988), and Pastoral Vicar. He was also pastor of San Jos√© de La Bomba de Cenov√≠, San Juan Bautista de Pimentel and of the Cathedral Santa Ana. He earned his licentiate in pastoral theology at the Pontifical Lateran University in 1988. Beginning in 1990 he had responsibility for spiritual formation and was professor of pastoral theology at the Pontifical Seminary Saint Thomas Aquinas in Santo Domingo. In 1992 he was named pastor of the parishes of Sant√≠sima Trinidad and San Francisco de As√≠s in the ‚ÄúEl Factor‚Äù neighborhood of Nagua and of Santiago Ap√≥stol de Arroyo. = Bishop and Archbishop = On 1 February 1997, at the creation of the Diocese of San Pedro de Macor√≠s, Pope John Paul II named him its bishop. He received his episcopal consecration on 15 March from Cardinal Nicol√°s de Jes√∫s L√≥pez Rodr√≠guez, Archbishop of Santo Domingo. As bishop he built a strong reputation for developing vocations for the priesthood. In 2006, in an action that attracted press attention and political controversy, he ordered Christopher Hartley, a New York priest whose activism among Haitian immigrants he had long defended, to leave the diocese, apparently because Hartley had attempted to interfere in the process of episcopal appointments. On 4 July 2016, Pope Francis named him Archbishop of Santo Domingo. His appointment was unexpected, as it moved him from a diocese with a population of a half million to one of five million and he was \\"barely known to the media\\". He described himself as \\"passionate follower of the Second Vatican Council, above all of the ecclesiology of communion that underpins our national pastoral program\\". He was installed in Santo Domingo on 10 September. On 2 January 2017, Francis named him Military Ordinary of the Dominican Republic as well. He received the pallium that represents his status as a Metropolitan Archbishop from Francis on 30 June 2017. Within the Dominican Episcopal Conference he was, from 2008 to 2014, president of the commissions on international Eucharistic Congresses, on the pastoral care of migrants, and on the Haitian pastorate.

SLM distributes products from over 260 music products industry brands, is the corporate owner of several string- and brass-instruments brands, and is the producer and exclusive worldwide distributor of Alvarez and Alvarez-Yairi guitars.  History  = Early years (1920-1927) = Bernard Kornblum was a violinist who at the age of 19 emigrated from Vienna, Austria to St. Louis, Missouri. After working at a music store and as a necktie salesman, he purchased a shipment of instruments and accessories in response to a newspaper advertisement placed by German musical instrument wholesaler Seibenbrun. Due to falling exchange rates, Kornblum's purchase cost him less than anticipated and made it possible for him to offer the goods to music instrument retailers in St. Louis at exceptionally low prices. Following the successful sale of his initial shipment of inventory, Kornblum established himself with other manufacturers, and by 1922 he established a downtown office for his new import business and quit his other job. Within two years, the company also employed Bernard's sister Erna and his brother David, operating under the Kornblum Brothers Music name, and the business flourished during the 1920s, moving into expanded facilities twice by 1927. = Supply and distribution expansion (1929-1959)= In 1929 while Bernard and David established European distribution headquartered in Belgium, Erna acquired sheet music wholesaler St. Louis Music Supply, with Kornblum Brothers Music assuming the St. Louis Music Supply name. In 1938 Erna and her husband Jack moved to California, and the Kornblum brothers ceased their efforts in Europe, returning to the US. St. Louis Music Supply, now 20 employees strong, expanded its product offerings to include band instruments, sheet music, and accessories. SLM survived the World War II- era by diversifying and selling paint, leather goods, and fine writing instruments. After World War II, the company expanded distribution of musical instruments with the addition of brands like Harmony guitars, Kay guitars, Regal ukuleles, York Band Instruments, Zildjian cymbals, and Turner microphones. In 1954 SLM became a distributor of Thomas organs. = Rock and Roll era (1961-1974) = Bernard's son Gene joined the company full-time in 1961, and the birth of Rock and roll and the mainstream popularity of bands like The Beatles created unprecedented demand for products like drum sets and guitars. Under Gene's direction, rather than only distributing the same products as other distributors, St. Louis Music became the exclusive distributor for Trixon Drums and developed the Apollo Drums brand. Additionally, SLM became a regional distributor for Magnatone guitars and amplifiers. In 1968, Gene Kornblum met Japanese luthier Kazuo Yairi through a Japanese trading partner, resulting in handmade acoustic guitars produced under the Alvarez-Yairi brand and attracting endorsements from notable guitarists such as Roy Clark and Waylon Jennings, with Alvarez later expanding into electric guitars. In 1971, the company acquired exclusive distribution rights to the Elka String Rhapsody keyboard and moved into expanded facilities on Ferguson Avenue. At the same time, St. Louis Music refined its processes for importing unfinished string instruments with final assembly and setup in the U.S.. = SLM Electronics, Crate, and Ampeg (1975-1987) = When Magnatone went out of business in the mid 1970s, St. Louis Music worked to develop new guitar amplifier business. In 1975 SLM partnered with local electronic technician John Karpowicz to develop an electric guitar with interchangeable signal processing modules, resulting in the Electra MPC (Modular Powered Circuit) Guitar, unveiled at The NAMM Show in 1976. SLM bought Karpowicz's service and repair shop and established the SLM Electronics division. While visiting a Crate & Barrel store in Chicago, Gene Kornblum saw products displayed using packing crates and had the idea of making guitar amplifiers housed in wooden cabinets, resulting in Crate Amplifiers first product, the ponderosa pine encased CR1 guitar amplifier, in 1978. St. Louis Music chose to manufacture the amps themselves rather than outsource manufacturing overseas, and the success of the CR1 grew into a full line of Crate amplifiers for guitar, bass, and keyboards. SLM Electronics moved into a dedicated facility in 1980, and a larger facility in 1986, while also developing the Audio Centron line of PA systems and mixers for live sound reinforcement. In 1986, St. Louis Music acquired pioneering bass amplification brand Ampeg from bankruptcy and reintroduced the SVT tube bass amplifier with original specifications and refinements. In 1987, the company changed its name to St. Louis Music, Inc.. In 1992, SLM opened a new 20,000 foot R&D; facility, and a second Yellville, Arkansas manufacturing facility two years later. In 1996, a 3rd generation of the Kornblum family, Ted Kornblum, joined the company. = Ownership changes (2005-2008) = In March, 2005 after a two-year search for potential buyers, St. Louis Music was sold to LOUD Technologies for USD$38.4M in cash and stock. At the time, SLM was generating USD $85M in annual revenue, and had 350 employees in its combined service and headquarters, warehouse, engineering offices, and manufacturing plants in Missouri and Arkansas. In November 2008, U.S. Band and Orchestra Supplies, Inc. acquired St. Louis Music and its divisions of Knilling string instruments and Austin guitars from LOUD Technologies, Inc., and in March of the following year announced it would be doing business as St. Louis Music in the original SLM facility on Ferguson Avenue. = Modern era (2009-present) = In 2015, SLM acquired E.K.

It is an email newsletter and mobile app focusing on helping subscribers find cheap flights, using flight deal alerts. There are over 1,000,000 members in the United Kingdom and Europe. History Jack's Flight Club was established in September 2016 by namesake Jack Sheldon in London. Before establishing Jack's Flight Club, Jack worked for a large data company. He had originally just searched for low airfare rates for the benefit of him, his friends, and his family, and later decided to turn it into a business. He also attributed his interest in searching for flight deals to seeing mistake fares. Jack spent ¬£30 to set up the newsletter. Jack would later move headquarters to Kiev. Jack currently works with partner Philip Wintermantle out of Barcelona. When determining how to monetize Jack's Flight Club, they briefly considered a total paywall, but felt that this was too aggressive. Affiliate links were also considered, as they found them \\"antithetical\\" to what the newsletter stood for. =App= Jack's Flight Club is available as an app on Android and iOS devices following demand from users. The app proved an easier means by which to send notifications to users due to an issue where the number of emails Jack was sending were creating delivery delays on time sensitive flight alerts. Jack also states that the inclusion of an app version means that users, if they see a notification during a conversation, may be more likely to share it with whoever they are next to at the time. The app was created using React Native due to the ease by which it would be compatible for both iOS and Android platforms. Concept Jack's Flight Club offers members cheap flight deals from the United Kingdom, Ireland & Continental Europe. They monitor price fluctuations and highlight cheap fares, whether a result of price drops or a mistake fare. Jack‚Äôs Flight Club estimate that around 30 percent of error fares are cancelled and refunded, while most are honored by the airlines. According to Jack, publication of error fares have rubbed airlines the wrong way at times. Jack's Flight Club use a computer program to search ‚Äúevery fare on every route by every airline‚Äù, monitoring them for error fares or flash deals. People can either sign up for a free membership and receive one to two emails per week or pay ¬£35 a year for four times the number of deals. Paid users also receive deals sooner than free users, ranging from hours to a days in advance. The newsletters also contain instructions to assist users in booking on the respective airline's site or a comparison site. In certain circumstances, Jack and his team have helped users on an individual basis if, for example, their flight is cancelled or they are trying to get home to a sick relative. Jack Flight Club's newsletter suggests that people should go for the cheapest deals that they can find as opposed to accumulating air miles with a single airline. Jack claims that this is because in the UK, airline mileage programs such as Amex do not provide much value in terms of sign up bonuses as opposed to the United States. Reception Jack's Flight Club has been recommended for its services by publications including refinery29, The Sun, and iNews. Three months after being established, the subscription service attracted 3,000 users. After doing an \\"Ask Me Anything\\" post on Reddit's /r/AmA page that made the front page of Reddit, Jack's Flight Club gained 42,000 more subscribers. Before implementing the freemium payment model, Jack's Flight Club had 65,000 members. Jack's Flight Club had 500,000 subscribers as of May 2018. As of March 2019, Jack's Flight Club has 1.2 million subscribers. Jack Sheldon has written advice articles about cheap flights on websites such as The Guardian, iNews, and The Telegraph.

The large double-hulled sailing-canoes (lualua and foulua) had ceased to be constructed in the Ellice Islands some time before contact with Europeans. Donald Gilbert Kennedy, the resident District Officer in the administration of the Gilbert and Ellice Islands Colony from 1932 to 1938, describe the construction of paopao and of the variations of single-outrigger canoes that had been developed on Vaitupu and Nanumea. Gerd Koch, an anthropologist, Koch visited the atolls of Nanumaga, Nukufetau and Niutao, in 1960-61, and published a book on the material culture of the Ellice Islands, which also described the canoes of those islands. The variations of single-outrigger canoes that had been developed on Vaitupu and Nanumea were reef-type or paddled canoes; that is, they were designed for carrying over the reef and being paddled, rather than being sailed. Outrigger canoes from Nui were constructed with an indirect type of outrigger attachment and the hull is double-ended, with no distinct bow and stern. These canoes were designed to be sailed over the Nui lagoon. The booms of the outrigger are longer than those found in other designs of canoes from the Ellice Islands. This made the Nui canoe more stable when used with a sail than the other designs. Nanumea Atoll in Tuvalu.  The skilled woodworker (tufunga) An outrigger canoe would be constructed by a skilled woodworker (tufunga) of the family, on whose land was a suitable tree. The canoe builder would call on the assistance of the tufunga of other families. The ideal shape the canoe was that of the body of a whale (tafola), while some tufunga shaped the canoe to reflect the body of a bonito (atu). Before steel tools became available, the tufunga used shell and stone adzes, which were rapidly blunted when used. With a group of up to ten tufunga building a canoe, one or two would work on the canoe, while others were engaged in sharpening the edge of one adze after another. Each morning, the tufunga would conduct a religious ceremony (lotu-a- toki) over the adzes before the commencement of work. When steel tools became available, two tufunga would be sufficient to build a canoe. Variations in the design of the single outrigger canoe There were differences between the designs used on each island for outrigger canoes that were built in the 19th and 20th centuries. Kennedy described the canoes of Vaitupu as being of 3 types: * The Vaitupu type - described as the traditional design of the southern islands of the Ellice Islands, which had lengths of to ; * The Nanumea type ‚Äì described as the traditional design of Nanumea, one of the northern islands, which had lengths of to ; * The general paopao, referring to a small canoe of any type, which had lengths of to . The main differences between the Vaitupu type and the Nanumea type are in the superstructure ‚Äì the bow-cover (puke mua) and stern-cover (puke tua) ‚Äì that were added to the dug- out canoe. For example, the stern-cover of the Nanumea type did not have a tokoulu, or built-up rest for carrying the bonito fishing-rod at a trolling- angle while hunting for a shoal of bonito. The Nanumea type had in place of the tokoulu, a cross-piece (lango kofe) set immediately in front of the inner edge of the stern-cover. The bonito fishing-rod was placed in a groove in the centre of the crosspiece. The traditional Nanumea type, also had a different design for the lifting-grip (saunga) and the platform on the booms (kaufuatanga) on the port (ama or outrigger side) of the canoe. The design of the traditional Nanumea type, made it impossible for the paddlers occupying the seats on the after and central booms to use their paddles on the outrigger side, which meant they were more liable to fatigue when paddling long distances only on the starboard (katea) side. Construction materials On Vaitupu, the wood used was from the broadleaf forest of the Tuvaluan atolls. A log of te fetau, (Calophyllum inophyllum) or te puka (Hernandia peltata) was dug out to form the canoe. The boom (kiato), and the boom-leg (tapuvae) that braced the booms, which were attached to the float for the outrigger, were made from a branch of pua (Guettarda speciosa) or tausunu (Heliotropium foertherianum). The outrigger-float (ama) was usually made of te puka. The float had a diameter of to , depending on the size of the canoe. The float usually had a length in relation to the canoe such that the forward end of the float was laterally opposite the feet of the bow-paddler (tino i mua), and the after end opposite those of the steersman (tautai) in the stern of the canoe. The hull of the canoe, the booms, boom-legs, and the float were attached together using the strong three-plait sennit (tuli kafa). The less durable two-ply twist sennit (kolokolo) was only used for unimportant parts of the construction. Two distinct types of paddle were used: the common type of paddle; and a large type used by steersmen. The woods used for paddles were pua, te puka, tausunu, fetau (Calophyllum inophyllum), milo or miro (Thespesia populnea), kanava (Cordia subcordata) and fau or fo fafini, or woman's fibre tree (Hibiscus tiliaceus). All bailers had a shovel shape. Kennedy note that the same phrase - o ta te liu ‚Äì applies ‚Äúto bail out‚Äù a canoe and ‚Äúto hollow out the interior‚Äù, when building a canoe. A canoe, when on a fishing expedition, carried a club (te siki). This is usually a branch of any heavy wood roughly trimmed and in length, and about in diameter, which was used to kill a large fish before it is hauled into the canoe. Fishing and inter- island voyaging by canoe During the day canoes would be taken out to the bonito grounds or for deep-line fishing for albacore (takua), and at night, torch-fishing for Flying fish or fishing for palu (ruvettus pretiosus). Each canoe would be given its proper name and was an important asset of the family. The larger canoes could be used to travel between the Ellice Islands. The discovery of Niulakita is claimed by travellers from Nui, led by Kaunatu who was taking people home to Vaitupu, however their canoe drifted off course to the south and they arrived at Niulakita, before returning home.

These adventitious roots form in response to moist, dark, nutrient-rich conditions that are found in ‚Äúcanopy soils‚Äù. Canopy roots have been found in species of maple, poplar, alder, myrtle, beech, and spruce, among many others. They are structurally similar to roots found on the forest floor and likely serve a similar purpose for water and nutrient uptake, though their specific functions are still being studied. Canopy roots form in highly organic soils classified as arboreal Histosols. Canopy soils form when lateral branches intercept leaf litter and epiphytes, accumulating plant matter that eventually decomposes. In some cases, these soils can get up to a meter thick on a single branch. Canopy soils provide habitat for wildlife and epiphytes, hold water and nutrients, and contain diverse microbial communities. Mycorrhizal fungi and nitrogen fixing bacteria have been found in these soils, making nitrogen available for plant uptake. Adventitious roots can form during normal or stressful growing conditions. Canopy roots have been shown to grow in response to wet, nutrient- rich media. Nadkarni induced the formation of canopy roots by air layering branches, which involves wounding a branch and then wrapping it with damp moss. Nadkarni found that, after initiating air layering, roots form out of swollen lenticels on the stem. While the specific physiological mechanism causing canopy root development has not been determined, it is thought to follow a similar process of other adventitious roots, such as burial-induced stem roots. Once a receptor in the stem perceives the moist, dark environment, auxin levels increase quickly and levels of cytokinin, a root inhibitor, drop. This influx of auxin, likely due to increased synthesis, transport from other cells, and decreased degradation, promotes root growth. Canopy roots have been shown to associate with mycorrhizal fungi, which suggests they are absorbing nutrients and water from soils. Nalini Nadkarni and Richard Primack showed that tagged radionuclides of trace nutrients (Se, Cs, Mn, Zn) entered through the canopy roots and were transported to other areas of the plant. This proves that plants can take in nutrients from canopy roots, supporting the idea that the canopy roots provide access to secondary nutrient pools. Current research is being done to show that the canopy roots uptake water as well as nutrients.

The evolution of bacteria has progressed over billions of years since the Precambrian time with their first major divergence from the archaeal/eukaryotic lineage roughly 3.2-3.5 billion years ago. This was discovered through gene sequencing of bacterial nucleoids to reconstruct their phylogeny. Furthermore, evidence of permineralized microfossils of early prokaryotes was also discovered in the Australian Apex Chert rocks, dating back roughly 3.5 billion years ago during the time period known as the Precambrian time. This suggests that an organism in of the phylum Thermotogae was the most recent common ancestor of modern bacteria. Further chemical and isotopic analysis of ancient rock reveals that by the Siderian period, roughly 2.45 billion years ago, oxygen had appeared. This indicates that oceanic, photosynthetic Cyanobacteria evolved during this period because they were the first microbes to produce oxygen as a byproduct of their metabolic process. Therefore, this phylum was thought to have been predominant roughly 2.3 billion years ago. However, some scientists argue they could have lived as early as 2.7 billion years ago, as this was roughly before the time of the Great Oxygenation Event, meaning oxygen levels had time to increase in the atmosphere before it altered the ecosystem during this event. The rise in atmospheric oxygen led to the evolution of Proteobacteria. Today this phylum includes many nitrogen fixing bacteria, pathogens, and free-living microorganisms. This phylum evolved approximately 1.5 billion years ago during the Paleoproterozoic era. However, there are still many conflicting theories surrounding the origins of bacteria. Even though microfossils of ancient bacteria have been discovered, some scientists argue that the lack of identifiable morphology in these fossils means they can not be utilised to draw conclusions on an accurate evolutionary timeline of bacteria. Nevertheless, more recent technological developments means more evidence has been discovered.  Defining Bacteria  Bacteria are prokaryotic microorganisms that can either have a bacilli, spirilli, or cocci shape and measure between 0.5-20 micrometers. They were one of the first living cells to evolve and have spread to inhabit a variety of different habitats including hydrothermal vents, glacial rocks, and other organisms. They share characteristics with eukaryotic cells including the cytoplasm, cell membrane, and ribosomes. Some unique bacterial features include the cell wall (also found in plants), flagella (not common for all bacteria), and the nucleoid. They metabolise is a different ways, but this most common is either by a heterotrophic or autotrophic (either photosynthetic or chemosynthetic) process. They also reproduce through binary fission. They can still share genetic information between individuals either by transduction, transformation, or conjugation. = Process of Bacterial Evolution = Bacteria evolve in a similar process to other organisms. This is through the process of natural selection, whereby beneficial adaptations are passed onto future generations until the trait becomes common within the entire population. However, bacteria reproduce via binary fission, which is a form of asexual reproduction meaning the daughter cell and the parent cell are genetically identical. This makes bacteria susceptible to environmental pressures. This is overcome by sharing genetic information by either transduction, transformation, or conjugation. This allows for new genetic and physical adaptations to evolve, thus allowing bacteria to adapt to their environment and evolve. Furthermore, bacteria can reproduce in as little as 20 minutes, which allows for fast adaptation meaning new strains of bacteria can evolve quickly. This has become an issue regarding antibiotic resistant bacteria. Thermophile bacteria from deep-sea vent. This organism eats sulfur and hydrogen and fixes its own carbon from carbon dioxide.  Thermotogales  These organisms are typically thermophilic or hyperthermophilic, Gram-negative staining, anaerobic organisms that can live near hydrothermal vents where temperatures can range between 55-95 ¬∞C. They are thought to be some of the earliest forms of life. Evidence of these organisms have been discovered in the Australian Apex Chert near ancient hydrothermal vents. These rocks date back 3.46 billion years and these fossils are thought to have belonged to early thermophilic bacteria. This is because these organisms do not require oxygen to survive, which was an element that was not present in large quantities in Earth's early atmosphere. Furthermore, this phylum still has living species such as Thermotoga neapolitana, which still largely resemble their ancestral form and still live around these vents, which some scientists have used as evidence to support this theory. More recent evidence has emerged, which suggests that Thermotogales evolved roughly between 3.2-3.5 billion years ago. This evidence was collected via gene sequencing of bacterial nucleoids to reconstruct their phylogeny. The first major divergence within the Thermotogales phylum was between Thermotogaceae and Fervidobacteriaceae, however, it is yet to be determined as to when this occurred. The family of Thermotogaceae then diverged into the genus Thermotoga and the genus Pseudothermotoga. The genus Thermotoga represent the majority of existing hyperthermophiles and are unique in that they are wrapped in an outer membrane that is referred to as a \\"toga\\". Today some existing species part of the Thermotoga genus include T. neapolitana. = Thermotogale Phylogeny = English: Colourful Thermophilic Archaebacteria (Heat-loving bacteria) Stain The phylogeny based on the work of the All-Species Living Tree Project.  Cyanobacteria Bacteria  Cyanobacteria or blue green-algae is a gram negative bacteria, a phylum of photosynthetic bacteria that evolved between 2.3-2.7 billion years ago. This prokaryote produces oxygen as a byproduct of its photosynthetic processes. They have made a distinctive impact in pharmaceutical and agricultural industry due to their potential of making bioactive compounds with antibacterial, anti-fungal, antiviral, and anti-algal properties. Typically they form motile filaments referred to as hormogonia, which can form colonies and then bud and travel to colonise new areas. They have been located in environments including freshwater, oceans, soil and rock (both damp and dry), as well as arctic rock. These organisms had evolved photosynthetic reaction centres and became the first oxygen producing autotrophs to appear in the fossil record. They utilise sunlight in order to drive their metabolic processes, which removes carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and releases oxygen. Due to this trait some scientist credit this phylum to causing the Great Oxygenation Event roughly 2.3 billion years ago English: Bloom of cyanobacteria in a freshwater pond. This accumulation in one corner of the pond was caused by wind drift. It looked as if someone had dumped a bucket color into the water. However, the closest known relatives of oxygen producing Cyanobacteria did not produce oxygen. These relatives are Melainabacteria and Sericytochromatia, neither of which can photosynthesise. Through genetic sequencing, scientists discovered that these two groups did not have any remnants of the genes required for the functioning of photosynthetic reactions. This suggests that Cyanobacteria, Melainabacteria, and Sericytochromatia evolved from a non-photosynthetic common ancestor.

Career  = Early works = In 1957 Brouwn relocated to Amsterdam at the age of 22. His career as an artist flourished after he was introduced to the Zero movement by Armando. The Zero movement, a group of artists who rejected the role of authorship upon their works, is largely responsible for the anonymity Brouwn demonstrated throughout his career. In the early 1960s, Brouwn produced his first works. These consisted of iron and wooden sculpture. He also used suspended polythene bags filled with garbage. Few of these early works have survived, as Brouwn destroyed most of them. Eventually, Brouwn began to consider the role of the audience in the development of artwork. One of his early works involved the dispersion of paper sheets across Amsterdam streets. The art that appeared upon the sheets resulted from the footprints of pedestrians and tire prints from cyclists. Brouwn's early works were later destroyed. The remainder of Brouwn's works earned him placement in various prestigious exhibitions such as Documentas 5, 6, 7 and 11, and the 1982 Venice Biennale. In 2005, a retrospective collection of Brouwn's works was exhibited in the Van Abbe Museum in Eindhoven, Netherlands. His practice and works have influenced various critics, artists and contemporary aesthetics. = Works of the 1960s = Brouwn produced his most well-known work in 1961, ‚ÄúThis Way Brouwn‚Äù. It was both a conceptual and performance art piece that consisted of Brouwn asking passers-by for directions, recording their responses on tape or encouraging them to draw their directions. Such drawings were stamped with text that read ‚ÄòThis Way Brouwn‚Äô. \\"This Way Brouwn\\" was performed on several other occasions in the early 1960s. In the 1960s, conceptual art, as well as the Zero movement within the Netherlands was widespread. Brouwn, as a conceptual artist of the movement, had chosen distance and size as his artistic medium: > \\"More and more people make long flights once or twice a year. The validity > of the concept of distance is constantly being eroded. Distances are > reloaded in my work, they get meaning again.\\" Similarly, in a rare interview in 1964, Brouwn stated: > \\"It is the search for the awareness we have of wide space and the discovery > of the city before we discover space. With these events, I am trying to make > something of what is going on to have an effect on the spectators in terms > of an action\\". In 1964, at the Patio Gallery in Neu-Isenberg, an 'art-happening' occurred. Brouwn was seated upon a chair, placed atop a pedestal in the corner of the gallery with a polythene bag over his head. That same year, at the opening of the Ren√© Block Gallery, Brouwn asked guests directions through the streets of Berlin through a walkie-talkie. = Works of the 1970s = During the 1970s, Brouwn produced works exploring units of measurement. Brouwn developed units of measurement based on the length of his various body parts. He developed the ‚ÄòStanley Brouwn foot‚Äô, which was the length of his foot. It measured approximately 26 cm. One of his works, ‚ÄúAfghanistan-Zambia‚Äù, is a typewritten register of the number of steps Brouwn completed in various cities across the world, and a physical example of his concerns surrounding measurement and distance. In 1972, Brouwn exhibited grey filing cabinets at the Documenta 5 in Kassel. Each cabinet consisted of varied numbers of white cards. One of these cabinets held 1000 cards, an outline of a 3000-step walk and the length of the strides between 840 and 890 millimetres. Brouwn also explored the concept of deformation. In 1974, he drew lines constructing borders upon three sheets of paper. Each of these lines denoted the length of a step. If these sheets were hung together, a movement in a single direction could be observed. = Later works and exhibitions = Brouwn's works gained fame and earned him positions in a variety of prestigious exhibitions. During his lifetime, his works were included in Documentas 5, 6, and 11, the 1982 Venice Biennale and a 2005 retrospective exhibition at the Van Abbe Museum. Another dominant trait of Brouwn's conceptualism was his absence. Brouwn refrained from attending exhibitions of his works and no bibliographical information was supplied to his audiences when viewing such exhibitions. In exhibition catalogues, the following phrase was often seen: > ‚ÄúAt the request of the artist, no bibliographical information is provided > here‚Äù.  Critical response  When discussing Brouwn's conceptualism in the 1960s, Art historian, critic, educator and author Antje von Graevenitz explained that ‚Äúfrom 1960 up to the present, his work would indeed appear to be exemplary of the intentions and realisations of that period‚Äù. Dutch writer Oscar van den Boogard analysed the role of the audience as active participants of Brouwn's works, especially with ‚ÄúBROUWNTOYS 4000AD.‚Äù, stating that Brouwn ‚Äúwants the viewer to become his work\\" and \\"[t]hat is only possible by letting the viewers complete his work in their imagination, over and over again. They are forced to become space and distance, forced to experience space as if it were 4000 AD‚Äù. Belgian curator and writer Laura Herman critiqued Brouwn's manipulation of existing and creation of new units of measurement, explaining that ‚Äúa sly sense of humour permeates the artist‚Äôs appropriation of bureaucratic language, which he manipulated toward his own ends.\\"  Legacy  = Artistic and cultural influence = The works and practice of Brouwn are said to have shaped future conceptualist thinking and aesthetics. Laura Herman stated that Brouwn continues to inform contemporary observations and reflections of scaled perspectives. The signature absence of Brouwn and its impact upon Conceptualist style is evaluated by Modern Edition founder Mike Brennan, who stated that Brouwn is ‚Äúan almost legendary figure whose practice is marked by insistence on various absences‚Ä¶ and is famously reclusive\\".

Starting in early 2018, the government of China, under Operation National Sword, banned the import of several types of waste, including plastics. The ban has greatly affected recycling industries worldwide, as China had been the world's largest importer of waste plastics and processed hard-to-recycle plastics for other countries, especially in the West. The decision caused widespread repercussions on a global scale. This decision in China will promote investment in domestic recycling facilities and innovation in plastics production, making these products easier to reuse. It can also inspire the public to change the current ‚Äúone-time use‚Äù culture. Pollution and wastes are the biggest environmental problem faced by China and the global. In July 2018, China produced a document to the World Trade Organization regarding environmental and health issues. China requested an urgent change to be made revolving the imported waste China imports from other countries. The recommended list was pushing forward for wastes such as plastics, textile, and paper products to be banned from imports. Background China being the largest importer of waste plastics, account for 56% of the global market. Meanwhile, the United States, Japan, Germany, and the United Kingdom are the main source countries. Since 2010, China has begun to implement more stringent waste import policies that correspond with the quality of import waste and improvement of domestic production capacity. Likewise, environmental and health considerations have led China to introduce the waste import policy in 2017 which bans the import of 24 types of solid waste, including certain types of plastics, paper, and textiles. Based on a study by the University of Georgia, it is predicted that by 2030 with this policy, 111 million metric tons of plastic waste will be left unaccounted for. = Chinese plastic history = In the 1990s, economic development and the rise in living standards increased China‚Äôs demand for plastic products by 21% annually. However, in that year, China lacked raw materials, and the production quality was incapable of meeting to the growing needs. Moreover, they did not have an efficient recycling system, and waste was collected through an informal recycling network. From 1980 to 1994, the recycling rate of waste products in China fell by 11%, which brought about pressure on the municipality. In some big cities, a large number of waste plastics were not being recycled and led to a strain on the urban drainage system blockage. According to statistics, about 60% of plastic waste in China was discarded or not recycled at that time. In 1994, China‚Äôs agricultural film consumption was 1.9 million tons, but 300,000 tons of agricultural film remained in farmland every year, affecting the soil and causing animal diseases. In the early 21st century, China had become the second largest plastic producer in the world, second to the US. However, China‚Äôs domestic productivity still could not meet their demand for plastics. Furthermore, the rising crude oil prices at the time also led to the inflation of the price of pure plastics. At the same time, although the price of waste plastics has also increased, it is still relatively cheap compared to virgin plastics. Thus, in order to cope with demand and lower costs, the import of waste has increased again. The increasing demand led China to rely heavily on the import of waste, such as waste plastics. However, this also formed the dependence of other countries in the world on China's imports of waste plastics.  The Green Fence Operation  The quality of recyclable materials exported to China gradually declined; on the contrary, large amounts of waste entering China was mixed with food, garbage, and other pollutants. These unmanageable waste products have thus burdened the Chinese government. Similarly, the profitability of the waste industry has attracted speculators to invest in the market. In order to enhance the management of the market and the reduction of illegal traffic, the Chinese government had decided to implement the green fence operation. It is said that this operation was the result of the China Customs‚Äôenforcing action against the law governing from February to November 2013. This initiative was designed to monitor the quality and flow of incoming waste and combat smuggling. It was reported that in just five months, China customs had seized 337 cases of solid waste smuggling amounting to 1.7 billion RMB. According to the regulations of the China Waste Plastics Association, import license transactions are prohibited, and imported waste plastics must be delivered to factories with import qualifications in accordance with the provisions of the import license. Since countries are dependent on China‚Äôs waste imports, this action had adversely affected the entire value chain of waste plastics and exporting countries. In Chinese ports, inspections of waste have slowed down port operations, which means that exporters need to bear the demurrage of the goods left in the dock before the inspection. At the same time, a large number of waste materials that have not passed the review have also been returned. By the end of 2013, China‚Äôs waste imports had been reduced by one million metric tons. China‚Äôs policy has made exporting countries aware of the drawbacks of excessive dependence on exports. Hence, this will bring a negative impact on the domestic reprocessing capacity of exporting countries. = Plastic recycling = Packed and prepared plastic It was reported that roughly 50% of plastics are being utilized in disposable manufacturing processes such as packaging, agricultural films, and disposables, while 20 to 25 % was used for long-term infrastructure like pipes, coating for cables and structured materials and the remainder is used for durable moderate life consumer goods such as electronics, furniture, and vehicles. In general, plastic is considered to be durable and non- biodegradable hence making them difficult to decompose for at least a few decades with some lasting over hundreds or thousands of years. Judging from the domestic environmental factors, even some degradable plastics may still exist for a considerable period of time due to their degradation rate which is also influenced by factors such as the exposure of UV, oxygen, and temperature, whereas biodegradable plastics require the need of adequate microorganisms. Therefore, the rate of degradation in landfills and terrestrial, marine environments would tend to vary. Due to poor management of plastic waste, most plastics are currently disposed of in unauthorized dumping sites or burned uncontrollably in the field. Moreover, due to the particularity and quantity of plastics, the recycling of plastics has always been a problem. In theory, most thermoplastics could be recycled in a closed loop. However, plastic packaging may call for the need to use different kinds of polymers as well as other materials such as metals, paper, pigments, inks, and adhesives, which make it challenging to control. Setting up a landfill is one of the traditional methods of waste managements, but some countries lack the land to accommodate to landfills. The process of incineration will reduce the need for a dedicated plastic waste landfill, but this brings up the issue of whether or not harmful substances being released into the atmosphere during this process. Furthermore, collecting and packaging plastics for sale to other countries is much cheaper than recycling. = Challenges of waste disposal = Waste disposing is a great challenge faced by China, each type of waste disposing industry has its advantages and disadvantages. So choosing a proper combination of different waste disposing industries is much more efficient than adopting monotonic industry. Nevertheless, the technology on waste disposal industries should always improving and creating. Importantly, technological progress can as an endogenous factor to increase the aggregate demand in economy and ultimately driven the economic growth in China. Sorting The first step of disposing of the waste is to divide them into different categories. Recycling standards are various from different countries. But we can divide them into two big categories, recyclable and none-recyclable waste. In general, plastic products can be fully recycled. The difficulty is the sorting process. For example, although the plastic bottle is theoretically 100% recyclable, the plastic bottle cap and the label cannot be mixed together for recycling because they are different plastic materials. The sorting machine is currently unable to unscrew the cap and tear off the label, so this step must be done manually by the sorting worker. This process obviously increases the business cost and human resources. Some illegal industries recycled mixed plastic products together to control the costs, this cause incomplete recycling of plastic which causes some unexpected environmental issues. Burning The general disposal method is to categorize the types of waste and dispose of them in different processes. However, a few illegal industries want to minimize the cost of disposing of the waste, so they choose the easiest way to deal with the rubbish. By inappropriate use of landfills and incinerators, earning money from the disposal of waste, rather than the secondary benefits of proper recycling waste. The burning of uncategorized waste produces toxic and contaminate air to the sky which harmful for human health. The carbon dioxide also produced by the process of burning wastes. By statistic, the global total carbon dioxide produced in 2018 was about 37.1 gigatonnes. Some power plants were operated by the heat produced from the burning of waste (Waste-to-energy plant). It is a combination of disposing of waste and producing electricity which widely adopted in China's waste disposing industries. Pyrolysis plants PyrolysisPyrolysis plants is an innovative technology that can help in the aid of waste disposal. The process of disposing of is describing as \\"Plastics are crushed and melted at temperatures below gasification temperature and contain less oxygen. Heat decomposes plastic polymers into smaller hydrocarbons that can be refined into diesel or even other petrochemical products, including new plastics.\\" This technology is still in the demonstration phase and hopping to expand globally. The facilities are built in China as well. Pyrolysis plants can recycle many hard to decomposed materials that normal recyclers cannot. It will only produce a little carbon dioxide and no contamination at all. The economic profits from expensive pyrolysis plants is the determinate factor of whether to build more of these plants or not.  Ban policy  China determined in July 2017 and announced on 16 August 2017https://www.recyclingtoday.com/article/plastic-scrap-china-import- ban-2018-mixed-paper/ that it would stop the import of 24 kinds of solid waste from foreign countries. Solid wastes including plastics, paper products, and textiles, etc. The new policy was implemented on 1 January 2018, and banned the imports of those wastes.https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2019/03/china-has- stopped-accepting-our-trash/584131/ An even tighter policy was announced on 15 November 2017, to take effect on 1 March 2018. This policy severely reduced the allowable contamination levels on a number of scrap material imports.https://www.recyclingtoday.com/article/china-bans-solid-waste-imports/ The newly-proposed maximum thresholds for contamination were so low that they amounted in practice to another ban. A further policy aimed to ban almost all waste imports into the country. The Ministry of Ecology and Environment of China announced the new policy on 19 April 2018. 16 types of ‚ÄúCategory 7‚Äù materials will be banned from import beginning 31 December 2018. Another 16 materials will be banned on 31 December 2019. It's important to notice the amount of imported foreign wastes that were unauthorized by the government, which flowed in country through reselling licenses, fake report, and smuggling, etc. The conservative estimate is approximately a few times the national licensing quota. The cost of obtaining foreign waste is very low. It can be sold at a high price through simple process processing and obtain high profits. It is a ‚Äúhoney‚Äù for illegal people; but the process to dispose of foreign waste caused serious pollution to the local atmosphere, water, and soil. It is a \\"poison\\" that destroys the local ecological environment and endangers the lives and health of the people. The documentaries \\"Plastic China\\" and \\"Beijing Besieged by Waste\\" told the story about garbage in China, that revealed the poverty and human cost. Electronic waste transactions began in the eastern coastal areas of China and enabled local farmers to get rich quickly. For example, in Guiyu, Guangdong Province, there are 150,000 people in the town, and 120,000 people are engaged in the e-waste industry. They handle millions of tons of e-waste every year, and the transaction amount is 75 million US dollars. After more than ten years of development of the garbage dismantling industry, Guiyu has already become a wealthy town. However, the wealth of Guiyu has come at the expense of environmental degradation. According to a research report published in 2010, 81.8% of rural children under the age of 6 have lead poisoning, and the source is likely to be lead ash from chip fragmentation or molten lead solder extracted pollution from gold, copper and other precious metals and semi-precious metals. The gold on the circuit board needs to be separated by highly corrosive acids; after the high corrosive acid is used up, it is often poured into rivers and other open waters and further polluted environment, which is a vicious circle for the ecology. The waste ban policy hopefully improves severe circumstances in China and facilitates the healthy development of people and society.  Impact  Since 1992, China has received 106 million tons of plastic waste, half of the world‚Äôs plastic waste imports. After the introduction of the policy, China‚Äôs imports of plastic waste saw a sharp drop of 99% while the imports of mixed paper have fallen by a third, and imports of aluminum and glass waste have been less affected. In the meantime, many recycling projects abandoned the separation of recyclables when they decided to just dispose of the waste into the same box. This had increased the risk of contamination from food and waste and resulted in a large amount of waste that cannot be reprocessed. China's economy was highly associated with imported waste since a few decades ago. This rapidly growing economy requires a lot of raw materials to sustain. This is not due to China's technology and ability to recycle these waste but because China's economy is based high on the manufacturing sector which has a high demand for raw materials. Therefore, importing wastes from other countries is actually benefit China itself. Due to China's large manufacturing industry, it is profitable for China to import waste from other countries. Although the cost of importing waste is only a little bit lower, due to the large quantities of output these factories produce, these small costs add up, yielding a higher return for the industry. The waste import ban in one hand slowly changes China's natural environment (both cons and pros), in another hand influence the global waste exporting countries. Due to the massive amount of wastes these countries import, countries who import waste must develop and better their technology around waste disposal in order to not let these waste cause adverse effects on the environment. Also, after the ban policy, the not accepted wastes force the waste exporting countries to develop better technology to deal with their own domestic wastes. Unexpected, the restricted policy started to influence the recycle industries and raw materials supply industries in China. The raw materials supply faces a gap of millions of tons without the imported waste from foreign countries. The restriction of recycling materials, which banned by China, will eventually forces the industries to use the raw materials. However, using the recycling materials to produce same amount of products are much more energy efficient and material saving than adopting raw materials, which presumably not a good news for the environment. The consequences of insufficient supply of recycling materials are serious, agents have to find materials from other places, for example, perhaps cutting down trees to produce paper. It is also very harmful to the environment. With the comprehensive recovery of the national economy, the rapid improvement of people's quality of life, and the acceleration of urbanization, major changes have taken place in the generation and treatment of urban domestic waste in China. A waste problem miniature is about the cemetery of \\"share bicycle\\" in China which thousands of bikes were discarded in dumping grounds. Also, the rise of the takeaway industry causes 60 million takeaway food containers thrown out across the country. There are hundreds of million tons of wastes produced domestically every year. However, the garbage disposal capacity of most cities has not kept up with the growth rate of garbage. Statistics show that about 40% of the total waste in the country has not been processed centrally. In Japan, waste management is relatively mature than other Asian countries, especially for waste sorting. However, Japan owns the most waste incinerators in the world, the consequence is a lot of air pollution in Japan. The surrounding less developed Asian, for example, Indonesia, facing the waste crisis from the land and ocean. The ocean waste is a global problem, countless marine animals died for eating the plastic products every year. Stacked garbage and improper handing create a good living place for bacteria, causing various diseases in areas with poor sanitation. = Europe and the U.S. = February 2020 announcement of \\"Deterioration of the global recycling markets\\" on a U.S. consumer garbage bill In these more developed countries, the waste was exported to China and other Asian countries to handle before the limited waste import strategies started in most Asian countries. The United States exports about 4,000 shipping containers of garbage to China every day before the waste ban policy. Now the waste is facing by the U.S. itself or it can exporting to other Asian countries which have relatively lower restriction of importing waste. Adina Renee, from Scrap Recycling Industries in a Washington-based institution, stated that \\"There is no single and frankly, probably not even a group of countries, that can take in the volume that China used to take.\\" Since the ban the US has switched from shipping to China to Thailand, Malaysia, and Vietnam. Reports from these countries state that they are struggling to handle the large increase in plastic waste intake. The United States and other western nations have used China to dispose of the majority of waste for several years. The sudden ban on imports has led many countries to conclude that they are ill equipped to recycle and manage their own waste output. One of the major issues was that the US and Europe sent China contaminated recyclables which still contained food and could not be processed so these recyclables in turn filled Chinese landfills. Given that the US is one of the largest producers of waste, the ban has had a great impact on the country. Some US garbage collection services have told customers that \\"recycling is not mandatory\\" now that China has stopped accepting the US recyclables, also saying that the recycling service will now incur a separate charge on the consumer's bill. An example of issues resulting from that ban can be seen in Southern California municipalities who had to prepare for large cost constraints as current infrastructure could not compete with the large amounts of waste. In 2016 NAFTA and Europe were the two highest consumers of plastics by developed nations. NAFTA had the largest consumption with 139 kilograms per individual, the greatest overall in the world. The ban will also have the potential to cost the U.S. 6.5 billion in annual exports and remove roughly 150,000 jobs in the industry. Some US municipalities have ceased curbside pickup programs for specific paper and plastics. Robin Wiener, President of the US Institute of Scrap Recycling Industries (ISRI), said that these changes are \\"a big force for us in raising this issue with the US government\\". = Oceania = Gas Collection of Landfill In Australia and New Zealand, the waste managements are based on landfill. The waste handled by landfill in Australia increased by 12% from 2001 to 2007 by statistic data. And the waste disposed of by landfill also increased 100% in Auckland within 10 years. Landfill causes many problems include the pollution on air, water, and agriculture. Methane is a kind of green house gas that mainly produced by decomposition process in landfill. It's about 20 times harmful to the air than carbon dioxide. Australia handled approximately 40 percent of its waste by using the landfill method, which has a very big severe impact on its land. In this case, Australia shipped its waste to China as well. But after the restriction on import from China, Australia shifted its waste to some less developed countries like India, Malaysia, Vietnam, and Indonesia to decrease its own domestic waste. = Asia = Some developed countries have started to transport the waste to other Southeast Asian countries such as Thailand and Malaysia to respond to the ban. Some Chinese manufacturers are also setting up factories in these countries to try to undertake these new projects. However, some of these countries do not have the capacity to respond to the entry of new waste and are already considering whether to impose policies to control the impact of foreign waste on the country. The existing marine pollution of Asia is dire enough, and there is no doubt that transporting waste to countries with no processing capacity will exacerbate this problem. According to the Financial Times, after the ban on China, the UK‚Äôs waste exports to Malaysia tripled, and the domestic recycling industry is still sluggish. In addition, China‚Äôs ban has caused more countries to focus on the development of a recyclable economy. The UK plans to impose a tax on plastic packers, and Norway also requires disposable plastic bottle manufacturers to pay environmental taxes. European authorities have realized the value of plastic waste, claiming that if recycling capacity quadruples, it could create 200,000 jobs by 2030. From April 2019 onwards, multiple Asian countries including Malaysia, the Philippines, Indonesia, Cambodia and Sri Lanka began sending illegally imported and mislabeled waste back to Western countries.https://www.businessinsider.com.au/southeast-asia-threaten-to- return-plastic-trash-to- west-2019-5https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/canada-takes-garbage- back-from-philippines-ending-long- dispute-11673640https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jul/09/indonesia- sends-rubbish-back-to-australia-and-says-its-too-contaminated-to- recyclehttps://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/17/cambodia-plastic-waste- us-canada-send-backhttps://www.bbc.com/news/world- asia-49100887https://www.businessinsider.com.au/sri-lanka-return-trash- britain-rotting-human-organs-2019-7?r=US&IR;=T The surrounding Asian countries like Thailand, Malaysia, Vietnam, and many other countries also influenced by China's ban policy. After the ban policy started in China and before the policy was learned by surrounding Asian countries, the imported trash increased about half times in Indonesia, two times in Vietnam, and tens of times in Thailand. The increasing waste caused many environmental problems such as waste pollution, air pollution, electronic waste pollution, and so on. These countries are big waste importing countries as well but don't have the abilities to recycle and deal with so many wastes, so many of them started to decrease and stop import wastes from western countries to alleviate serious environment problems. However, the waste recycling industry also gradually promote the economic growth in these developing countries. The recycling industry can also facilitate the boom of other related industries such as the waste disposal industry, sewage treatment industry, waste incineration power plants, and so on. The recently concluded Fourth United Nations Environment Programme called on governments to take action to reduce waste generation at the source, conduct sound management in their own countries, and minimize the transboundary movement of waste. It can be traded as general goods if it is a raw material obtained by the harmless processing of solid waste, meets the mandatory national product quality standards, does not endanger public health and ecological safety, and is not a solid waste.

A roommate was charged with his death in 2019. Life and career =Early life= Day was born in Las Vegas, Nevada, and later moved to Downey, California. He started acting at age six and after auditioning with his sister, was a Mouseketeer for the first two seasons of The Mickey Mouse Club in 1955‚Äì1957. At age 11, he appeared in a minor uncredited role in the film A Lion Is in the Streets (1953) with James Cagney. He came out as gay to his family and moved to San Francisco when he turned 18, though he later told a Rolling Stone interviewer in 1971 that he was bisexual and had used drugs. He continued to work as an actor and dancer, including at Theatre La MaMa in New York and in Los Angeles. =Later life= Day married Henry Ernest Caswell, his partner since the early 1970s, in 2009. Day and Caswell at one time ran a guesthouse for gay actors in San Francisco; from the 1960s until the early 1980s, Day worked for the Living History Centre, producing Renaissance and Dickens Christmas fairs, playing Newington Butts at the Renaissance fairs and also coaching other actors. They moved in the mid-1980s to Oregon, first settling in Ashland, and then in Phoenix, where they had a house. Caswell also worked for the Oregon Shakespeare Festival, while Day made and sold wine jelly and worked seasonally for Harry & David. Disappearance and death Day was reportedly last seen on July 17, 2018 after Caswell, who has dementia, was admitted to the hospital after a fall. Day reportedly left on foot, telling a third housemate, a live-in handyman, that he was going to visit friends, but his cat and dog were left behind, and the dog was found roaming by neighbors. One neighbor had a letter written by Day mentioning being assaulted by the handyman, who told police that Day was also exhibiting signs of mental problems. After Day was reported missing, his car was found in the possession of people approximately away in Coos County, who, according to police, said that they had permission to take it, possibly in exchange for helping the handyman. In August 2018, police searched the property after neighbors complained of a \\"bad smell\\". Friends began asking for help locating him starting in November that year, and in February 2019, after his family learned of his disappearance, his case was featured on an episode of Dateline NBC. In March 2019, his case was profiled on the podcast The Vanished. Police had searched Day's residence and elsewhere, but in early April 2019 human remains were discovered on the property. On June 6, 2019, it was announced that the remains were confirmed as those of Day, though a cause of death was not announced. On July 5, 2019, Oregon State Police arrested the former handyman in connection to Day's death. The man, 36-year-old Daniel James Burda, was charged with several crimes in connection with Day's death, including manslaughter, criminally negligent homicide, and identity theft.

The peak lies east of Mount Degenhardt, and west of McMillan Spires. Terror Glacier remnants lie to the south of the peaks, and the McMillan Cirque glaciers hang on the north slopes. The first ascent of Inspiration Peak was made in 1940 by Fred Beckey and his brother Helmy via the West Ridge. Inspiration Peak can be seen from the North Cascades National Park Newhalem visitor center, weather permitting. Climate Inspiration Peak is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach the North Cascades, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades (Orographic lift). As a result, the west side of the North Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer.Beckey, p. 16 Because of maritime influence, snow tends to be wet and heavy, resulting in high avalanche danger. Geology The North Cascades features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks, spires, ridges, and deep glacial valleys. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to the various climate differences. The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape leaving deposits of rock debris. The \\"U\\"-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the North Cascades area.

In 2010, Guatemala \\"ranked second in the world on the Global Climate Risk Index, which indicates the level of exposure and vulnerability to extreme events.\\" Both commercial agricultural production and subsistence farming have declined, and thus subsistence farmers find it more difficult to find work as day laborers when their own harvests fail. About 300,000 subsistence farmers reported crop loss due to drought in 2018. About half of Guatemala's workforce is in the agricultural sector. Poor crop yields due to climate change have been identified as a factor in migration to the United States.  Erratic weather patterns and crop loss  A report by the Guatemalan System of Climate Change Sciences in 2019 indicated that rainy season is starting later as a result of climate change, putting subsistence farmers and indigenous people in poor communities at risk of food shortages resulting from poor harvests. Guatemalan farmers have experienced extreme weather events such as hurricanes, as well as erratic weather patterns with spikes and drops in temperature, torrential rains, drought, and unexpected frost. One crop affected has been potatoes, which suffer from fungus. The problem of food security and famine has increased, especially in the ‚Äúcorredor seco\\" (an area extending from the departments of Izabal and Baja Verapaz in the north to Santa Rosa and Jutiapa in the south).  Impact on nature  Populations of Guatemala's edible giant winged leaf-cutter ant are declining. \\"Guatemala's zompopos, yellow ants, of May are now the zompopos of June,\\" according to Dr. Edwin Castellanos, of the Universidad del Valle de Guatemala. Greenhouse gas emissions \\"Guatemala emitted 40 million metric tons (MtCO2e) of greenhouse gases in 2011, with the land-use change and forestry sector contributing 40 percent to overall emissions. Greenhouse gas emissions grew by 38 percent from 1990 - 2011 with significant contribution from the land-use change and forestry, energy and agriculture sectors.\\" Adaptation and foreign assistance  US humanitarian aid for projects related climate and agriculture has focused on helping farmers adapt so that they can remain on their land. USAID support for Guatemala has included development of \\"early- warning systems for floods and fires, as well as promoting soil and watershed conservation, rain water harvesting, and other adaptive practices.\\" According to the GAO, the mandate for studies to determine the impact of these programs on migration has been rescinded. A third round of cuts to US aid has been proposed for FY2020. US based NGOs which have been active in climate-related projects in the forestry and agricultural sectors have experienced funding cuts under the Trump Administration. Guatemala has joined the V20, a group of 48 developing economies working together with development banks towards climate resilience and 100% renewable energy.  Impact on immigration  In 2019, Palm Beach County, Florida saw an increase in Guatemalan immigrants from the \\"Dry corridor\\", seeking to escape hunger caused by periods of drought followed by torrential rains that had impacted their crops.

They are contrasted with referential questions (or information-seeking questions), a type of question posed when the answer is not known by the questioner at the time of inquiry. Both question types are used widely in language education in order to elicit language practice but the use of referential questions is generally preferred to the use of display questions in communicative language teaching. Display questions bear similarities to closed questions in terms of their requirement for short and limited answers and they can be classified under convergent questions. On the other hand, referential questions and open questions are similar in their requirement for long, often varied, answers, and can be grouped under divergent questions. Both display and referential questions are subcategories of epistemic questions.  Epistemic questions  Epistemic questions are questions that seek information. Subcategories of it includes display, referential, rhetorical and expressive questions.  Context of usage  = Language education classrooms = Long and Sato (1983) first applied the terms display and referential questions in the field of second language pedagogy, differentiating them according to the actions each type of question performs.  Examples  Richards and Schmidt give the following example of a display question: :Q: Is this a book? :A: Yes, it's a book. Omari gives the following examples of a referential question: :Q: Which character in the story you admire most and why? :Q: What would you do if you were in the judge‚Äôs place?  Brainstorming  Referential questions are employed at higher rates when brainstorming a topic and gathering responses. As there is no one fixed answer to referential questions, they can be used to instigate genuine communication, thereby facilitating less restricted discourse and promoting greater creativity in the classroom.  Eliciting existing knowledge  Display questions work best for eliciting short and low-level answers that correspond to the answer already expected by the teacher. Since referential questions serve to request for new information, answers can be subjective and varied based on the students' opinions, judgement and experiences. Students answer referential questions with the goal of assisting teachers in filling the information gaps.  Checking on understanding  Display questions are mainly used as a means to evaluate whether the listener has understood what is needed. There is a tendency for display questions to be employed when addressing groups of people, such as in a classroom setting, and referential questions when addressing individuals. In addition, students' language proficiency greatly affects the chances of being asked display questions by the teacher. Teachers are more likely to pose display questions to the student with a lower proficiency on the topic being discussed. The teachers' teaching skills also correlates to the frequency at which display questions are asked. Less experienced teachers tend to ask more display questions. A study by Barnes (1983) found that in universities, about 80% of the questions asked by the teachers are to recall facts. Questions by teachers tend to be display questions while student-initiated questions are referential (Markee, 1995).  Online communication  A study by Blanchette (2007) shows that in online communication, the teacher asked both referential and display questions while students asked only referential questions. This finding agrees with Markee‚Äôs (1995) conclusion that the majority of student- initiated questions are referential. However, this is not because the participants only asked questions for which they did not know the answer for. These questions can bring numerous possible responses and therefore it reflects the higher cognitive levels in the questions. = Other institutional settings = Asymmetrical conversation is characteristic of institutional talk as opposed to everyday interactions among participants of equal status. As the use of display questions tend to reproduce asymmetrical conversation, they can be found in several institutional settings. Display questions may sometimes be used by media interviewers and courtroom attorneys in the presence of an overhearing audience to assert their views or opinions. In a counsel-witness interaction, a counsel's question is directed at the witness with other participants acting as indirect receivers, and the witness's response is not in actual fact directed at the counsel, who typically already know the answer to their own questions, but at the judge and jury. This kind of interaction can be seen as a display talk. Similarly in media interviews, the follow-up is usually left to the listener or viewer following the interviews, unlike situations like classrooms and quizzes where a follow-up from the questioner on whether the answer is correct is present. Doctors also often use known- information questions when interacting with patients. Even though they usually already possess the information, these questions are asked only to evaluate the patient through their responses. While the doctor might ask the patient for something in particular, the patient would understand the content of the question but they might not understand the point of it since the doctor already knows the answer.  Communicative performance  Display questions are more directive than authentic questions, and they promote greater ability in thinking by spurring students to have to back up their contribution. Utilising display questions that build on previous statements made by the students in a rephrased or simplified form facilitates the production of a more elaborate dialogue. As output is an important part of language learning, pushed output is necessary in classrooms to engage the students and encourage them to talk in the language they are learning. There is a need to determine the effects of the question types on communicative classroom interaction and student output. Its effectiveness correlates to the authenticity in the second language classroom. Referential questions are often seen as a way to add meaningful usage of a language. Output from the students solicited from referential questions appear three times as much than other question types, especially so for beginner classes, even though beginner language students were expected to interact less due to the limited knowledge of the language. When learners were asked referential questions, responses are found to be significantly longer and syntactically complex. Non-verbal communication and the need to use a dictionary also increased when responding to referential questions. Learners themselves are found to be more interested in referential question activity and agree that it is more conducive in bringing higher quality and quantity output, and also motivated interaction. However, there are also studies that found no increase in learner response with referential questions. Where learners have little collective knowledge, bombarding students with questions is unlikely to garner increased output. There is some evidence that imply that display questions are not as injurious as many think. Kachur & Prendergast (1997), cited in Boyd (2006), found that asking 70% of authentic questions resulted in a lack of student participation, while lowering the amount to 32% resulted in the students being more engaged. This is explained as due to the ethos of mutual respect that is further studied by Christoph & Nystrand (2001). It is stated that in a classroom with mutual respect, the teachers and students are not inclined to introduce new topics. Instead, they extend topical episodes by being invested in listening and responding to the utterances of others.  Cognitive effects  When pitted on an intellectual scale, display questions are deemed to be posed at low cognitive levels because such questions require only basic recollection of factual information, which is at the lowest level of the hierarchy. In contrast, referential questions, in calling for evaluation or judgement, are associated with the highest cognitive levels. Finding the correct answer to display questions involves higher-level cognitive thinking. Beyond eliciting known information (on the asker‚Äôs part) and recognizing the content of questions (on the askee‚Äôs part), answering display questions also involves active consideration and interpretation of the way the questions are organised as each display question is designed with a specific answer in mind. Questions that require lower cognitive levels to answer are seen as injurious, even though questioning holds a major role in classroom interaction. This type of question does not encourage participation nor does it stimulate student thinking. Studies by Barnes (1983), Fischer and Grant (1983) as cited by Blanchette (2007) have found that instructors at the post-secondary level tend to ask questions of lower cognitive levels.  Pragmatics and discourse  = Nature of interaction = Classroom interaction features heavily in communicative language teaching, as it provides an avenue for language learners to practice conversing in the target language without judgement. The type of questions used to steer interaction is critical as it determines the types of responses that will be garnered.  Forced vs Natural  In cases of classroom interaction where more display questions are used as opposed to referential questions, participation appears forced and unnatural. This was found to be true regardless of whether the teacher doing the asking is experienced or otherwise. The exclusive or excessive use of display questions generally leads to lower instances of classroom communication. Referential questions are seen as an effective method of increasing oral participation because it creates opportunities for students to voice their opinions. The added bonus that there is no one specific answer encourages students to be less afraid of making mistakes and be more productive.  Type of feedback  Display and referential questions form part of a question-answer sequence consisting of an initiation, response, and follow-up (IRF). A follow-up with an evaluative function, commenting on the response to a question, is a distinguishing element of classroom conversation, and the difference between sequences with evaluative follow-ups compared to those serving as acknowledgements has been regarded as a major difference between display and referential questions. An example of responding with an acknowledgement: :Speaker A: What time is it, Denise? :Speaker B: 2:30 :Speaker A: Thank you, Denise An example of responding with an evaluation: :Speaker A: What time is it, Denise? :Speaker B: 2:30 :Speaker A: Very good, Denise The IRF sequence is commonly found in classroom discourse, of which display questions are a distinguishing feature. Feedback is important to a learner, so a teacher's follow-up would normally evaluate the learner's response with words like right or yes, sometimes including a repetition of the response for others to hear. Feedback is also important when students provide technically-correct answers but they are not what the teacher is looking for. An absence of feedback from the teacher can also be an indication to the student that his or her answer is wrong. IRF sequences in everyday discourse seldom include evaluative follow- ups, and responses in casual conversations often carry relational functions such as showing agreement or expressing a particular emotion. There are opposing views on the use of IRF exchanges in the classroom setting. It has been seen as a poor and unproductive model for spoken interaction in the target language outside the classroom due to its failure in enabling students to learn the demands of everyday conversation. Too often, follow-ups are carried out by teachers, leading to learners having to take on the role of passive respondents without getting sufficient experience in performing requests and using listener follow-ups. This can be improved by allowing students to participate in peer-to-peer interactions as platforms to generate appropriate listener responses. In contrast, typical IRF exchanges could still be useful in classroom situations where teachers assign the kind of interactional status that helps learners be actively involved in the interactions. Productive use of conversational responses in peer-to-peer speech practices could be eventually achieved if teachers provide exposure to and guidance on the use of follow-ups. = Turn-taking = Display questions are mostly found in the classroom in the three-turn sequence of initiation- response-evaluation (IRE). In this sequence, the teacher asks a question in the first turn, following a reply from the students in the second turn. Upon going back to the teacher in the next turn, the teacher gives feedback on the adequacy of the students‚Äô response. This sequence is considered structurally robust. Teachers can continuously go through interactional revision when continuing the conversation with a student using this sequence. This allows for methodical revision and negotiation between speakers. As the teacher analyses the student's replies and reformulates the following question, each question becomes a repair of the one before and thus becomes an interpretive resource based on the teacher's analysis and decisions derived from the prior exchange.  Frequency of turns  The use of referential questions in classroom discourse promotes a significantly higher number of speaking turns as compared to the usage of display questions. It is often assumed that display questions are less engaging than referential questions. However, depending on the process of how the teacher uses the display questions, and what they achieve from those processes, display questions can become an effective teaching variable in lessons.  Duration between turns  Responses to display questions have been found to be rather prompt in requiring only factual recall. Referential questions are known to elicit higher-order responses resulting from critical thinking. Thus, there is typically a longer wait-time between turns where referential questions are involved. However, responses to referential questions do not always take the form of complex utterances. The following example is a case in point: :Teacher: Can you swim? :Student: Yes, I can. In the same vein, display questions do not always garner immediate responses because the language learner may have the knowledge but lack the vocabulary to express it, thereby contributing to a longer-wait-time.

She had spent the night at a local nightclub and several house parties, before accepting a ride to a fast food restaurant from a man she had just met. Although Young has never been found, her disappearance is being investigated as a homicide.  Early life  Lisa Marie Young was the eldest child and only daughter of Don Young and Marelene \\"Joanne\\" Martin. She has two younger brothers, Brian and Robin. Martin was a member of Tla-o-qui-aht First Nation on the west coast of Vancouver Island and both of her parents attended Kakawis Residential School on nearby Meares Island. Young was close with her family. Martin described her as an independent woman who was a hard worker with a hard head, and had \\"inner strength that was totally awesome.\\" Dallas Hulley, an acquaintance of Young and the last person to hear from her, described Young as \\"outgoing, confident, bubbly,\\" and said \\"She was somebody you noticed right away, at a party or a gathering, or whatever it was. She just had a light about her.\\" At the time of Young's disappearance, her father was helping her move into her own apartment in northern Nanaimo, something she was excited about. Young was also preparing to start a job at a call center within two days of her disappearance, and considered pursuing higher education, with the hopes of becoming a television sports broadcaster.  Disappearance  On the night of June 29, 2002, Young left her parents residence at 11:00 P.M. to go to a nightclub with several friends. Her parents found it strange, as Young had a busy schedule for the week. Young spent the night at a nightclub in Downtown Nanaimo called Jungle (now known as Evolve NightClub) where she and several friends celebrated the birthday of their friend, Hulley. After the nightclub closed at 2:30 A.M. on June 30, 2002, one of Young's friends began a conversation with Christopher William Adair, who offered them a ride to a house party in southern Nanaimo in his red Jaguar. Despite just meeting him, Young and friends accepted the offer. The group spent an hour at the first house party before moving onto a second house party. At the second house party, Young became hungry, but could not find anything to eat at the party because she was a vegetarian. Christopher William Adair offered to take her to a nearby sandwich shop, which Young accepted. The last time Young was seen was around 3:00 A.M., where she was leaving the house party with Christopher William Adair. Not long after Young left the party, Hulley received a phone call from her. She told him Christopher William Adair did not take her to a fast food restaurant nor drop her off at home, but instead she was sitting in his car in a driveway and Adair would not let her leave. The final time Young contacted Hulley was at 4:30 A.M., when she sent him a text message reading: \\"come get me, they won't let me leave.\\" Young's final phone signals were from the Departure Bay area of Nanaimo. Family members of Young have never heard anything about her cellphone being traced down and do not know what happened to it.  Investigation  232x232pxOn June 30, 2002, Young's parents failed to hear from her. At first, they thought it was possible Young was too busy to answer her cell phone, but grew concerned when Young's former roommate visited to ask of Young's whereabouts. After calling every phone number in her phone book, Young's parents contacted the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) detachment in Nanaimo. In the beginning, Young's parents were told to call when she had been missing for over 48 hours, however an RCMP officer came over to the Young's household later that evening to ask questions and get Young's picture. A few days later, the RCMP told Young's parents that her disappearance was being investigated by their Serious Crime Unit. Christopher William Adair was interviewed two months after Young's disappearance. Adair was previously convicted of assault, fraud, and theft in Kamloops, British Columbia and unauthorized use of credit cards in Edmonton, Alberta. Young's mother spoke with Adair in a police interrogation room. Prior to the meeting, she was asked to bring pictures of Young as a child, with the hopes of guilt tripping him into confessing. She asked him of Young's whereabouts, where he responded with: \\"I can't. I'm sorry, I don't mean to disrespect your family.\\" Authorities refuse to confirm the validity of this conversation. Adair's car belonged to his grandmother, Geraldine \\"Gerry\\" Adair, who was a prominent member of the business community in Qualicum Beach, British Columbia. She died in 2011.  Aftermath  Allison Crowe, a friend of Young's, has since produced and released a song titled \\"Lisa's Song\\" in memory of Young. Young's mother experienced health complications after Young vanished. Before Martin died on June 21, 2017, she had been taking dialysis, suffered from hypertension, and was on a waiting list for a kidney transplant. Martin's family members believe the cause of her deteriorating health was from the stress of not knowing what happened to her daughter. Martin's sister, Carol Frank, revealed that Martin tried to hide her and Young's First Nations ancestry from the public, out of fear that Young would be assumed to be a sex worker, an alcohol or drug addict, or living on the streets. Hulley, the last person to hear from Young, died on March 25, 2018. While walking along British Columbia Highway 19A with a 27-year-old female friend at 1:00 A.M., he stepped into the northbound lane to retrieve something he had dropped, only to be struck by a car. He was pronounced dead at 6:15 A.M. the same day. Although the 62-year-old female driver was driving at least ten kilometers under the speed limit, she was unable to avoid him, due to the lack of reflective clothing. He was 38-years-old at the time of his death. In May 2020, 'Where is Lisa?' a new in-depth podcast about Lisa Marie Young's case was published.

She became the first Druze woman to anchor a Hebrew-language news program on Israeli television in 2017. In April 2019, she was elected to the Knesset as a member of the Blue and White alliance, making history as the first Druze woman to become a Member of the Knesset. She was subsequently elected to the Knesset as part of the Blue and White alliance in the September 2019 and March 2020 elections. She left Blue and White on 29 March 2020 and joined Yesh Atid. Early life and education Gadeer Kamal-Mreeh was born in Daliyat al-Karmel, Israel, a village on Mount Carmel, to a Druze family. Her father is a building contractor. Like other Druze, her family is loyal to the State of Israel. Mreeh remembers her father decorating their car with Israeli flags every Independence Day. Kamal-Mreeh has been interested in broadcast journalism since her youth; at the age of 12, she volunteered for a local radio station, and also presented programs on cable television. She earned her bachelor's degree in social science and medical imaging at Bar-Ilan University, and began her career as a vascular ultrasound technician. Later, she studied for her master's degree in international relations, with a speciality in negotiation, at the University of Haifa. Journalism career In 2012, Kamal-Mreeh was hired by the Israeli Public Broadcasting Corporation to present a television magazine program in Arabic. In 2015, she was chosen to anchor an Arabic-language news program on Channel 33. In February 2017, Kamal- Mreeh became the anchor of the Channel 1 Hebrew-language weekend edition, becoming the first non-Jewish woman to anchor a Hebrew-language news program on Israeli television. She was a temporary replacement for regular anchor Michal Rabinovich, who returned to the program seven months later. Kamal-Mreeh spent three months training with a teleprompter to deliver the news in Hebrew. However, she made a point of pronouncing Arabic names with an Arabic accent. Some community leaders complained to her parents about her new job, saying that a Druze woman should not be working in the evenings and at odd hours, but Kamal-Mreeh received positive support from her parents and husband, as well as from the community's spiritual leader, Sheikh Mowafaq Tarif. Political career Prior to the April 2019 Knesset elections, Kamal-Mreeh joined the Israel Resilience Party, a member of the Blue and White alliance, and was placed 25th on the Blue and White list. When she joined the faction, she stated that one of her goals was to amend Israel's Nation-State Bill, which specifies the nature of the State of Israel as the nation-state of the Jewish people. Kamal-Mreeh was elected to Knesset when the Blue and White alliance won 35 seats in the election. She is the first Druze woman to become a Member of Knesset. Personal life She is married to Shadi Mreeh, an electrical and electronics engineer. The couple has two sons, and reside in her hometown of Daliyat al-Karmel. While Kamal-Mreeh's mother and grandmother are religious, stay-at-home mothers, she identifies as secular.

On 28 July 2002, the Ilyushin Il-86 aircraft operating the flight crashed after take-off from Sheremetyevo. 14 of the 16 crew members on board (and the only occupants of the aircraft) were killed. This is the deadliest aviation accident involving the Ilyushin Il-86.  Aircraft  The aircraft involved was a 21-year-old Ilyushin Il-86 registered as RA-86060, (factory no. 51483203027, serial no. 027) The aircraft was produced by the Voronezh Aircraft Manufacturing Company (VASO) on 29 October 1983 and was delivered to Aeroflot on 23 November the same year. The aircraft was then transferred to Pulkovo in 1992. The aircraft was powered by four Kuznetsov NK-86 turbojet engines and had flown 18,363 hours up until the day of the accident.  Crew  The flight crew included: * The captain was 51-year-old Konstantin Ivanovich Ivanov. He had over 13,000 hours of flight experience, including more than 5,900 hours on the Il-86 (4,000 hours as captain). * The first officer was 52-year-old Vladimir Andreevich Voronov, who had 11,300 flight hours, including more than 2,200 hours on the Il-86. * The flight navigator was 51-year-old Valery Andreevich Shcherbina, who had over 13,000 flight hours, including more than 7,100 hours on the Il-86. * The flight engineer was 60-year-old Boris Nikolayevich Kushnerov, who had more than 14,000 flight hours, including more than 6,000 hours on the Il-86. 10 flight attendants were on board and two engineers were also on board.  Crash  After a chartered return flight between Moscow, St. Petersburg and Sochi, the flight took off from Sheremetyevo Airport in Moscow at 15:25 MSK, bound for Pulkovo Airport in St. Petersburg with 16 crew members on board. According to Vadim Sanjarov, the Administrative Director of Sheremetyevo Airport, the plane took off at a speed of and began to climb normally. Two seconds after takeoff however, both horizontal tail stabilizers suddenly moved to the stick-trim fully aft position. The pilots did not have time to rectify the situation and use the backup stabilizer control. According to various sources, the plane fell from a height of , with decreased engine power. The aircraft then banked left, stalled, and crashed into the ground, exploding and bursting into flames on impact. However, one of the flight attendants stated that there was no explosion. 14 of the 16 crew members, including all four flight crew members, both engineers, and 8 of the 10 flight attendants, were killed. The two survivors were flight attendants Tatiana Moiseeva and Arina Vinogradova.  Investigation  The accident was investigated by the Interstate Aviation Committee (IAC). Investigators considered how the horizontal tail stabilizers switched to the nose-heavy position, which caused a steep angle during takeoff, causing the aircraft to enter a stall and crash. The version of failure of one of the aircraft engines was also expressed. According to her, due to the lack of cargo and passengers, engine speed exceeded the permissible rate, which led to its breakdown. Flight attendant Arina Vinogradova stated that the aircraft encountered turbulence before the crash. Although shaking could be a sign of exceeding the maximum allowable angle of attack and loss of speed, which immediately preceded the stall. Weather conditions and ornithological conditions at the time of the disaster were normal. The IAC was unable to determine how the stabilizers switched to the nose-down position. The main version stated that it was caused by pilot error.  Aftermath  The IAC temporarily suspended the Il-86's type certificate. According to Vladimir Kofman, the Chairman of the Commission for the investigation of aviation accidents, a post-crash analysis of 2,000 flights of the ill-fated aircraft revealed frequent flight safety violations, including improper use of the stabilizers.  Memorial  The mass grave of nine of the 14 flight crew members of flight 9560 The memorial at the crash site Nine of the victims were buried in a communal grave in St. Petersburg. At crash site, a cross was installed. The cross nameplate that lists the names of all the victims.

She commissioned the paintings in an attempt to sway public opinion regarding her right to rule. Due to her foreign heritage, the French saw her as undeserving of her position as a ruler.

As strong winds and heavy snowfall were anticipated to produce widespread reductions in visibility, a blizzard warning was issued from northeastern Colorado to southwestern Minnesota, including several large cities. Denver, Cheyenne, Mitchell and Kearney are all included. Winds gusted as high as 107 mph (172 km/h) at Pueblo West and more than 30 inches (76 centimeters) of snow fell in Wallace, South Dakota. Meteorological history The storm developed over the Pacific Northwest on April 9, hitting the Rockies with intense snowfall April 10. Afterwards, the area of low pressure tracked into the Northern Plains, spreading blizzard conditions from Northeastern Colorado up into Minnesota. Soon afterward, the winter storm bombed out and became a powerful bomb cyclone, reaching its peak intensity early on April 11. As the blizzard approached the Great Lakes region, the storm started weakening and most winter weather-related warnings previously issued by the National Weather Service were discontinued on April 12. Impacts =California= Before the storm reached Colorado, and developed into a powerful Colorado low, strong winds cut power to 50,000 in Los Angeles. =Nevada= The same powerful winds that affected California kicked up dust storms in Nevada. =Colorado= Heavy snowfall, accompanied by lightning and thunder in some localities, dumped up to 30 inches (75 centimetres) of snow in the Rocky Mountains. Meanwhile, official blizzard conditions occurred in the Northeast quadrant of the state. Portions of I-70 closed as messy roads caused car accidents. =New Mexico= Wind gusts exceeding hurricane-force (74 mph, 119 km/h) affected the state April 10th as the storm's large circulation passed to the north. Officials were on high alert for brush fires because of these hot, dry winds. =Wyoming= Cheyenne was put under a blizzard warning in anticipation of widespread reduced visibility as a result of high winds and heavy snowfall. Many of Laramie County's offices had to be closed. According to the Laramie County School District administrator, Mary Quast, the schools would have an early release, and status regarding the re-opening of the district would be communicated by six in the morning on the 11th. Gillette, on the other side of the state, reported 6 inches of snow while Wheeler reported 16 inches. =Nebraska= Interstate 80 was closed in parts of the Nebraska panhandle as roads became unpassable. =South Dakota= As many parts of the state were under blizzard warning or winter storm warning, concerns were growing for the potential of flooding following the storm due to snowmelt. The storm may have caused several hundred million dollars in damage. Up to 30 inches fell in eastern South Dakota. =Minnesota= Nearly 25 inches (62.5 centimetres) fell in the southwestern part of the state, near Madison, ice accretion of half an inch accumulated in southern Minnesota and winds frequently gusted in excess of 40 mph. The combination of high winds and significant icing resulted in over 89,000+ power outages across the Midwest, mostly in Minnesota.

It is a weak, low shrub with elliptic to egg-shaped leaves with finely toothed edges and up to three pink, white or green four-petalled flowers arranged at or near the ends of the stems. Description Boronia parviflora is a weak, low shrub that grows to a height of and has glabrous branchlets. The leaves are simple, sessile, elliptic to egg-shaped, long and wide with fine teeth along the edges. The leaves are sometimes reddish or purplish, especially on the lower side. The flowers are arranged singly or in groups of up to three in the upper leaf axils or on the ends of the branches, on a pedicel long. The four sepals are more or less triangular, green or red, glabrous and long. The four petals are pale to bright pink, white or sometimes green, about the same length as the sepals and have their bases overlapping. The stamens are hairy and the stigma is minute. There are eight stamens in the flowers of plants in Queensland, New South Wales and Tasmania but sometimes only four or six in those of western Victoria and South Australia. Flowering mainly occurs from August to March. The fruit is a glabrous capsule long and wide. Taxonomy and naming Boronia parviflora was first formally described in 1798 by James Edward Smith and the description was published in his book Tracts relating to natural history. Smith gave it the common name \\"pale-flowered boronia\\". The specific epithet (parviflora) is derived from the Latin parvus meaning \\"small\\" and -florus meaning \\"-flowered\\". Distribution and habitat Swamp boronia grows in seasonally wet areas of heath, woodland, sedge and wallum. It is the most widely distributed boronia and is found in near-coastal areas south from the Sunshine Coast in Queensland, through New South Wales as far inland as Boonoo Boonoo, in Tasmania and in scattered locations in southern Victoria, and south-eastern South Australia. Conservation This boronia is classified as \\"very restricted\\" in South Australia. The main threats to the species in that state are grazing, trampling and competition from introduced pasture species.

The Romanisation process affected different regions differently, meaning that there is no singular definition for the concept, however it is generally defined as the spread of Roman civilisation and culture throughout Italy and the provinces as an indication of a historical process, such as acculturation, integration and assimilation. Generally, the Romanisation process affected language, economics, cultural structures (art, religion, entertainment, recreation), family norms and material culture. Rome introduced its culture mainly through conquest, colonisation, trade, and the resettlement of retired soldiers. Romanisation, as a term, was first coined in 1885 by Theodore Mommsen who held the imperial view that Roman culture was superior to provincial ones. The main viewpoints can be categorised into two groups. The traditionalist perspective sees Romanisation as representing the cultural transformation with evident Roman civilisation, cultural and political. The Post-processualists and structuralists define Romanisation as a concept born from Mommsen's school of thought, and is a construct of this school to understand the process. The study of historiography is a relatively new phenomenon and is defined as study of how history is constructed, meaning \\"When you study 'historiography' you do not study the events of the past directly, but the changing interpretations of those events in the works of individual historians.\\" The expanse of the Roman Empire in 117 AD. The historiography of Romanisation involves many contentions and varied opinions as time goes on and the influencing context, views and values of historians evolves. The study of the historiography of Romanisation is important as it reveals cultural development and change that can be applied to other historical events and has major impacts on other disciplines, such as archaeology, as it shapes how events and findings are interpreted. One of the current major contentions to the more traditional view of Romanisation as a process where native cultures are replaced with the more superior Roman culture is its association with imperialism and colonialism due to the present post-colonial, post-modern views of many modern historians.  Antiquity Perspectives  In regards to Britain ancient figures saw these unknown lands as being filled with barbarians who possessed no culture or civilisation. Many in antiquity, such as Caesar, Pliny the Elder, Propertius, Ovid and Martial, use the Britons dying their bodies with woad (to produce blue and green) as an indication of their otherness. Cassius Dio describes the tribes from northern Britain as being \\"fond of plundering\\", \\"naked and unshod\\", and \\"possess[ing] their women in common\\" It is argued that the image of Britain presented was a propaganda invention to promote imperial power and prestige. Strabo viewed that Britain was \\"virtually Roman property\\", meaning there was no need for a conquest. Their perspectives of Gaul and Germania were much the same. Gaius Cornelius Tacitus = Tacitus = The Roman orator and historian Tacitus (56 ‚Äì 120 AD) lived in the Roman Empire during the 1st century CE. His major works Germania, Agricola, Histories, and the Annals all reveal his imperial perspective of the Romanisation process. In them he describes how Roman culture was deliberately promoted as \\"a tool of imperialism\\". in his Agricola, a biography of his father-in-law's and his command in Britain, stating that the introduction of Latin, baths, \\"sumptuous banquets\\", and togas was \\"in their ignorance they called culture, when in fact it was just one facet of their enslavement\\" Tacitus's opinion on the superiority of Romans can be seen in his use of language in his construction of history, such as \\"primitive\\", to describe provincial peoples. However, he also has passages that sustain the idea of the noble savage. Statue of Ovid in Constanta (formally Tomis) = Ovid = Ovid, the Roman poet from the period of Augustus's reign presented a Rome-centred, imperial perspective in this writing, stemming from his context within the Roman Empire. His poems Tristia (\\"Sorrows\\") and Epistulae ex Ponto (\\"Letters from the Black Sea\\") written during his exile to a remote city called Tomis on the Black Sea has been interpreted by historians, such as Thomas Habinek, to display Rome as the \\"necessary centre of the empire\\", as the root of artistic and political authority and Tomis as an uncivilised, mostly barbarian and culture less city. His poem Metamorphoses is a display of the adoption of Greek culture being adopted and adapted so that it is Romanised by Romans.  18th Century Perspectives  = Edward Gibbon = Edward Gibbon (1737‚Äì1794), an upper class British historian, writer and member of Parliament during the Imperial British Empire, wrote an imperial, Rome centred history of Rome and the Romanisation process. His most notable work is The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire.  19th Century Perspectives  Theodor MommsenDuring the 19th Century the dominate perspective was focused around a military theme, with most historians stressing the evidence of the Romans as \\"military settlers\\", with few natives adopting their identity and culture. = Theodor Mommsen = Credited with coining the term 'Romanisation' in 1885, the German historian, classicist and archaeologist Theodor Mommsen (1817‚Äì1903) was influenced by his imperial perspective and held the view that Roman culture was superior to native cultures. He did not define the term but his view of the spreading for Roman power falls in-line with the later definition by his pupil, Francis Haverfield. Mommsen argued that the introduction of Roman culture was a social advancement for native populations. His review of epigraphic evidence aided in modifying earlier understanding of Roman social change into something more dynamic and accurate. His approach had a major influence on the archaeology of Roman-Britain during the twentieth century.  20th Century Perspectives  = Francis Haverfield = Many consider Francis Haverfield (1860‚Äì1919) the 'father of Romano-British studies' and as one of the first to study the process of Romanisation his perspective remained widely accepted for almost a century. He was the first to define the term 'Romanisation' with influence from Mommsen. Heavily influenced by Mommsen, who was his academic advisor, he held the view that the Roman provinces were ‚Äúgiven a civilization‚Äù by the Romans, a very colonial perspective, and states that the Roman empire's \\"long and peaceable administration of dominions\\" gave its provinces \\"its gifts of civilisation, citizenship, and language.\\" He believed that out of the \\"stable and coherent order\\" the Roman empire provided, modern Europe emerged. He perceived Roman Britain to be only a province in a global empire and should therefore be studied in its relation to Rome, stating that \\"It is no use to know about Roman Britain in particular, unless you also know about the Roman empire.\\" Roman Baths in Bath, England. An example of Romanisation in Britain. He supported the traditional perspective of Romanisation where it falls under the acculturation theory in order to express the process of native cultures being replaced by the Roman culture with complete acculturation and homogenisation of cultures, with a linear transfer of values, opinions and practices. His major focus on the elite in provincial societies meant that the larger amount of society was neglected and largely unincluded in his studies. His focus on the elite stems from his use of the classics and ancient historians, such as Tacitus, who held imperial perspectives. Haverfield argued that Romanisation was a top-down process, meaning that once the elite of provincial societies had been romanised then those in the lower classes would also adopt Roman culture, dismissing the common assumption that they held their native culture at a dormant level. Additionally, he argues that Rome itself lost their cultural distinction through the Romanisation process as they too absorbed some aspects of provincial cultures. His main work on Romanisation is The Romanization of Roman Britain (1905). = R.G. Collingwood = R.G. Collingwood The English philosopher, historian, archaeologist, and student of Haverfield, R.G. Collingwood (1889‚Äì1943) held the view that a 'fusion' of cultures was produced during the process of Romanisation, rather than dominance. Using the example of Roman Britain, he displays that the Roman culture that was introduced was not purely Roman, and instead a blend of Roman and Celtic elements to make a hybrid culture that was uniquely Romano-British. Collingwood's views have been criticised as many believe he did not understand the full strength of Rome's presence in the provinces. His works include Roman Britain (1923), The Archaeology of Roman Britain (1930), and Roman Britain and English Settlements (1936). = A.N. Sherwin-White = A.N. Sherwin-White (1911‚Äì1993), a British historian, suggests that the Romanisation process was led by the natives themselves. This view has been criticised due to the unlikeliness that native groups would willingly abandon their culture to adopt the Roman culture.  21st Century perspectives  = Richard Hingley = Richard Hingley suggests that the term ‚Äòglobalization' should be used as a replacement due to its more neutral connotations. Hingley believes that classical historians articulated a \\"deeply imperial comprehension of the relationship between colonizers and the colonized\\" in their writings and archaeological research. He has not only conducted studies into Romano-Britain but also into the impact of imperial Rome in a post-Roman context, especially since the Renaissance. His main works in regards to Romanisation are his journal article Not so Romanized? Tradition, reinvention or discovery in the study of Roman Britain (2008), and Globalising Roman culture: unity, diversity and empire (2005). = Martin Millet = The British archaeologist and historian Martin Millet (1955 ‚Äì ) argues that the Romanisation process was led by the provincial elite in a \\"native-led emulation\\" which then spread down to all levels of society. His view is that the natives were willing participants in the process as an act of assimilation. Millet's main works involving Romanisation are The Romanisation of Britain: an essay in archaeological interpretation (1990), Roman Britain (1995), Integration in the Early Roman West: the role of culture and ideology (1995), and Britons and Romans: advancing an archaeological agenda (2001). = Greg Woolf = The Dying Gaul statue from the Capitoline Museums With a focus on provincial Gaul, the British modern revisionist historian and archaeologist Greg Woolf believes that the changes inflicted by the Romanisation process affected different regions and communities differently, meaning that there cannot be a unified definition of the effects of Romanisation. His ‚ÄúBeyond Romans and Natives‚Äù explores the changes in both Gallic and Roman cultures, noting at that Roman culture was not uniform throughout its empire due to the effect of native cultures. Woolf argues that both imperial approaches and new theories, such as the acculturation theory, ‚Äúshare the same fundamental assumption‚Äù in that they assume that ‚Äúa conflict between peoples entails a conflict between cultures‚Äù. His major works that involve Romanisation are his article \\"Becoming Roman, staying Greek: Culture, identity and the civilising process in the Roman East\\" (1994), Becoming Roman: the origins of provincial civilisation in Gaul (1998), and Tales of the barbarians: ethnography and empire in the Roman West (2011). = Jane Webster = The historical archaeologist Jane Webster believes that Romanisation \\"is simply acculturation\\" and that the term 'Romanisation' is an inaccurate label, suggesting 'creolization' is a more appropriate and accurate term to describe the process. She uses examples from modern history, such as African-American and Africa-Caribbean societies, to mirror to the Romanisation process, arguing that a creole perspective allows for a 'bottom-up' perspective of the \\"negotiation of post-conquest identities\\", rather than from the traditional perspective of the elite. She views the process as a \\"multicultural adjustment\\". She hold a very post-colonial, post-imperial perspective. Webster's main works regarding Romanisation are her articles \\"Creolisation\\" (2016), \\"Rome and the 'Barbarians'\\" (2007), \\"A negotiated syncretism: readings on the development of Romano-Celtic religion\\" (1997), \\"Necessary comparisons: a post-colonial approach to religious syncretism in the Roman provinces\\" (1997) and her books Roman imperialism and provincial art (2003) and Roman imperialism: post-colonial perspectives (1996). Mary Beard = Mary Beard = Mary Beard (1955‚Äì) is a classicist who uses archaeology & material evidence heavily in her construction of Romanisation. She points out that the local population was significantly contributing to their own development as a Roman province, and not as a result of the power and occupation of Rome. The material evidence that Beard uses to support her argument, such as pottery, foods, clothing and other everyday items, that it was the native population that made their own choice to emulate the Romans. Beard's main works contributing to her view of the Romanisation process are SPQR: A History of Ancient Rome (2015) and Religions of Rome (1998).

Its aim is to increase performance, achievement and well-being in individuals, teams and organisations by utilising evidence-based methods grounded in scientific research. Coaching psychology is influenced by theories in various psychological fields, such as humanistic psychology, positive psychology, learning theory and social psychology. Coaching psychology formally began as psychological sub-discipline in 2000 when the first \\"coaching psychology\\" course was offered at the University of Sydney. Since then, learned societies dedicated to coaching psychology have been formed, and peer-reviewed journals publish research in coaching psychology. Applications of coaching psychology range from athletic and educational coaching to leadership and corporate coaching.  History  = Early history = Early applications of psychological theory and practice to coaching (in particular, athletic coaching) can be traced to the 1920s. In 1926, Coleman Griffith published The Psychology of Coaching: A Study of Coaching Methods in the Point of View of Psychology. Based on observations of football and basketball teams, Griffith discussed a wide variety of aspects of coaching such as spectator effects, over-coaching problems, principles of learning. Griffith has been noted as \\"America's first sport psychologist\\" and a pioneer applying the science of psychology to coaching. Years later, more texts on coaching psychology began to emerge. In 1951, John Lawther of Penn State University published Psychology of Coaching. The earliest book in WorldCat with the term \\"coaching psychology\\" in the title is Modern Coaching Psychology by Curtiss Gaylord, published in 1967.WorldCat search, 29 September 2019. = 21st century = Despite these early developments, contemporary coaching psychology was only formally established at the beginning of the 21st century. In January 2000, Anthony Grant implemented the first \\"coaching psychology\\" unit of study at the University of Sydney and his doctoral dissertation set the stage for further research to establish the field of coaching psychology as an evidence-based discipline.Grant, A.M., 2001. Towards a psychology of coaching. Unpublished manuscript, Sydney.Boniwell, I. and Smith, W.A., 2018. Positive psychology coaching for positive leadership. In Positive Psychology Coaching in Practice (pp. 159-175). Routledge. Because of this, many coaching psychologists consider Grant as a pioneer in the field. The logo of the Australian Psychological Society (APS), which founded the Interest Group in Coaching Psychology (IGCP). Further development began in 2006 when the Australian Psychological Society (APS) held a conference that founded the Interest Group in Coaching Psychology (IGCP). Outside Australia, Stephen Palmer of the British Psychological Society (BPS) formed the Special Group in Coaching Psychology (SGCP). Both the IGCP and the SGCP aimed to further develop the profession of coaching psychology in terms of theory and application by providing a platform for sharing relevant research and experiences among coaching psychologists. Since the establishment of the IGCP and SGCP, more international societies dedicated to coaching psychology have been established in Europe, the Middle East and South Africa. On December 18, 2006, the International Society for Coaching Psychology (ISCP) was founded in order to promote the international development of the field. Currently, there are a number of peer-reviewed journals dedicated to literature and research on coaching psychology. For instance, The Coaching Psychologist (since 2005) is provided by the SGCP. The IGCP and IGCP jointly publish the International Coaching Psychology Review (since 2006). Coaching Psychology International (since 2009) is published by International Society of Coaching Psychology.  Theoretical influences  = Humanistic psychology = The humanistic approach to psychology is regarded as a large contributor to coaching psychology. Both humanistic and coaching psychology share the common view of the human as self-actualising. That is, whenever given the opportunity, humans will seize the capacity to improve themselves. Coaching psychology looks at this development as a process consisting of concrete positive changes in one's life. Furthermore, this process of growth is undertaken by both the client and the coach who facilitates self-actualisation in their clients. In Carl Rogers' person-centered therapy, the client-therapist relationship is a key element in facilitating growth. Thus, the relationship between the coach (the facilitator) and the client (the learner) is crucial. In particular, Rogers identified three key qualities in a good coach-client relationship: \\"realness\\" (genuineness), trust, and empathetic understanding. Additionally, an important distinction is made between working on the client and working with the client. A coach must be willing to collaborate and actively engage with the client in order to understand their experiences and make choices that promote growth. When this is achieved, the coach-client relationship becomes an active partnership. Additionally, according to Rogers, growth in a client is attained through unconditional positive regard. Coaches must empathise with their clients in order to understand their experiences and viewpoints. To achieve this, the coach must be able to understand their clients not only on an intellectual level, but also on an emotional level. Along with empathy, coaches must be able to accept their clients for who they really are since individuals need to feel valued for their \\"true selves\\" in order to self- actualise. = Positive psychology = Martin Seligman is a psychologist who studies positive psychology. Positive psychology (developed by Martin Seligman and others) dwells on the positive aspects of human characteristics such as strength and competency. At its core, coaching psychology shares this focus; effective coaching entails improving the performance and well-being of the client. Positive psychology thus provides a foundation for coaching. Coaching psychology has been considered a type of applied positive psychology. Positive emotions motivate individuals to enhance their abilities and competencies. The broaden-and-build theory by Barbara Fredrickson posits that positive emotions can play a role in sparking not just motivation, but also actions that are productive and beneficial. In coaching, encouraging positive emotions is emphasised in order to inspire clients to take concrete action towards their goals. Aside from emotions, full engagement in activity is also a factor in maximising one's performance. Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi described this level of maximal involvement in a task as flow. In other words, individuals experiencing flow are \\"in the zone\\". Coaches play a role in setting an environment that induces flow. This can be achieved through clear and consistent goal-setting. Providing clear and immediate feedback also keeps the client informed about whether their actions are helping achieve their goals. Coaches also help strike a balance between challenge and skills as tasks that are too easy or too difficult for the client may hinder goal-achievement. = Theories of learning = Operant conditioning (as described by B. F. Skinner) views learning as a process involving reinforcement and punishment. Coaches are encouraged to always reinforce healthy and productive behaviours through verbal reinforcement, such as motivational words and images. Intrinsic reinforcement (i.e. reinforcement from within the individual) can also play a huge role in improving performance and encouraging goal-directed action. Though punishment can direct clients towards desired behaviours, performance may be hindered by unwarranted side effects, such as anxiety and resentment towards the coach. David A. Kolb's experiential learning theory posits that individuals learn through their experiences. Experiential learning is facilitated by self-reflection, self-assessment and action. Coaches can encourage critical self-reflection of experiences through \\"coaching logs\\" wherein coachees analyse their thoughts and emotions in various incidents and circumstances. This helps clients examine and challenge their own beliefs, attitudes and behaviours. Insight gained from this aids in transformative learning where trainees develop an action plan for further self-improvement and increased performance based on their own experiences. 253x253px Lev Vygotsky described the zone of proximal development (ZPD) as a space between what a person knows (an action that can be performed easily) and what a person doesn't know (what is considered difficult). Vygotsky theorised that learning is most effective within this zone. Coaches facilitate effective learning by providing coachees with activities within the ZPD, which are neither too easy nor too challenging (this is a process called scaffolding). Social learning theory also influenced coaching psychology. According to Albert Bandura, observational learning occurs when individuals learn from the people around them (called models). Coaches should be aware of their coachee's models as this can shape their attitudes and behaviour. Additionally, coaches should assess factors affecting observational learning in their trainees, such as attention and the frequency of the observed behaviour. = Other influences = Gestalt theory explains that people perceive events around us in a way that conforms to their personal ideas, beliefs and experiences. Coachees must be guided in their awareness of their own attitudes and experiences, which shape their perception of the world. Concepts in social psychology such as interpersonal influence and compliance emphasise the powerful role that social interactions play in shaping thinking, performance, and behaviour in coachees. Cultural psychology assists coaches in facilitating growth and learning in clients from various cultural backgrounds. Study of psychopathology may also be important in developing the proper methods of coaching for mentally unhealthy individuals.  Models  Coaching psychology has a large number of models and frameworks derived from psychological theories and evidence. These models are used in order to guide the practice of coaching psychology and to ensure that coaching is informed by scientifically-proven concepts. = GROW = The GROW model is considered as one of the most popular behavioural coaching models. Its four stages outline the process of problem-solving, goal- setting and improvement of performance. The name of each stage varies slightly depending on the source. = PRACTICE = Stephen Palmer developed the PRACTICE model as a guide to problem-solving and solution-seeking. The issues are identified during first stage is Problem identification. Next, Realistic goals are developed with regards to the issues. Afterwards, Alternate solutions that work towards the goals are brainstormed. The possible outcomes of the solutions are then critically evaluated during the Consideration of consequences. Following this, the best options are chosen during Targeting the most feasible solution(s). Then comes the Implementation of the Chosen solution(s). The final step is the Evaluation where coaches and coachees discuss the effectiveness of the solution and any lessons learned from the experience. = SPACE = 257x257px The SPACE model is a bio-psycho-social framework based on cognitive-behavioural psychology. Its purpose is to guide the coach in assessing and understanding the behaviour of their clients during specific situations. SPACE is an acronym that stands for Social context, Physiology, Action, Cognition and Emotion. It can be further subdivided into smaller frameworks: ACE and PACE. The ACE framework examines the relationships between the action, emotions and cognitions of the individual. The PACE framework then takes the ACE model and considers the physiological or biological response that accompanies cognitions, emotions and behaviour. Finally, the main SPACE model takes into account the social context in which the behaviour occurs. = Other models = Other approaches such as the ABCDE cognitive model for problem-solving have been developed. The OSKAR, ACHIEVE and POSITIVE models stem from the GROW model that focuses on goal-setting, solution-seeking, as well as nurturing coaching relationship. For leadership coaching, LASER (which stands for Learning, Assessing, Story-making, Enabling and Reframing) outlines a five-step process for effective coaching. The transtheoretical model of change (developed by James O. Prochaska and others) and appreciative inquiry focus on understanding the process of change and encouraging clients to act towards positive change.  Coaching education   Applications  = Athlete coaching = Coaching psychology influences training methods for athlete development. It aims not only to improve performance in sports, but also to develop athletes holistically. Thus, factors affecting development such as athlete motivation have been studied through cognitive, social and emotional theories. One study found that athlete narcissism impacts the effectiveness of performance expectations set by the coach. Physical and mental skill enhancement are also studied with cognitive- behavioural theories. Research has shown that effective goal-setting improves performance in sport. Additionally, self-efficacy is also an important factor affecting athlete development. Thus, coaches are encouraged to increase self- efficacy in athletes through positive feedback and being a model of self- confidence themselves. Even coaches' own beliefs about their skill level in coaching affect the development of self-efficacy in athletes. = In education = Coaching psychology can also be applied in schools. It examines the most effective ways of educating students grounded in psychological theory. For instance, theories on motivation focus on the effects of self-efficacy and motivation on student performance. Improving teacher confidence and self- efficacy is also an area of study for coaching psychologists. Coaching psychology also guides students, teachers and staff in effective goal-setting and goal-attainment. Additionally, coaching methods like reciprocal peer coaching (the process of teachers evaluating each other's performance) are encouraged because they cultivate support and trust among educators. Peer coaching in the classroom also provides a collaborative environment for students, which is conducive for learning.

These comedic performers are characterised by feelings of deprivation and isolation in their early lives, where comedy evolves as a release for tension, removing feelings of suppressed physical rage through a verbal outlet. A series of psychological experiments first published in 1981 by Fisher indicated certain behavioural traits exclusive to comedians, not matched in regular actors. Later work conducted by Kaufman and Kozbelt re-interpreted these results drawing the understanding that whilst comedy serves as a coping mechanism to hide trauma it may also motivate a comedian to use humour as a way of forming relations and gaining acceptance. Humour has been shown to develop from a young age, fostered by parental behaviour. A parents immature nature can lead to additional responsibilities forced onto children which can evoke issues of self-worth and a need for acceptance. The constant search for approval may cause mental health issues such as anxiety or depression and when untreated can lead to suicide in extreme situations. Laughter can evolve as a medium for self- preservation, detaching the individual from any adversity faced allowing for perceived control over uncomfortable situations. Sad clown paradox is characterised by a cyclothymic temperament, which encourages the creation of light-hearted humour in a professional setting, despite inner turmoil. The use of humour as a form of self-medication provides short periods of satisfaction, repeatedly needing to deal with inner turmoil. There is an ever present anxiety amongst comedians that their popularity may disappear tomorrow and hence are driven to exhaustion in their work. TOC  Influences  = School experiences = Comedic performers frequently show humorous tendencies early in life, often identified as the 'class clown' throughout school. Comics recalled mocking the strict nature of school, taking great pleasure in the laughter from their peers. Tommy Smothers commented that during his schooling experiences;\\"I got a big kick out of them laughing, but I didn‚Äôt know what it was that made them laugh, but I knew I could make people laugh.\\" Johnny Carson also emphasised the role of school in a comedian‚Äôs life stating that: Despite comedians often being of high intelligence, the school environment was detested and frequently avoided. Comics explained that their teachers lacked understanding and acceptance, identifying their mannerisms as a form of personal exclusion. Woody Allen commented that school \\"was boring, frightening. The whole thing was ugly. I never had the answers. I never did the homework.\\" Even though a school‚Äôs orientation to order and discipline conflicts with the nature of a comic, it can serve as an initial arena for an individual to realise their ability to produce laughter. This discovery creates mixed feelings as frequently the laughter can be directed at themselves with undertones of ridicule or mockery. Regardless of the unpleasantness involved comic's are attracted to the ability of 'making' someone laugh and the power it holds. The talent for creating humour directs the individual towards a career in the entertainment industry. It was found that comedians did not directly enter the industry as a comic, rather a large proportion began through some form of musical performance. Fisher believed this trend among comedians to have a musical background was derived from their pursuit to create a more cheerful, welcoming world for the audience. = Family relations = 293x293px Relationships formed with family members is key in adolescent development, particularly for future satisfaction with life. Studies have shown that comedic performers tend to be raised in distant, somewhat disjointed family settings, characterised by family animosity. Prasinos and Tittler interpreted that this 'family distance' caused individuals to identify as victims of neglect and hence associate as an alienated group. Sad clown paradox can evolve from these incohesive environments from a young age, where a child desires social contact, using humour to obtain intimacy and somewhat relate from a distance. Norman Lear commented on his painful childhood due to the constant conflict from his parents stating that; \\"the only defence against that was to laugh at it, find out what was funny in it.\\" A study conducted by Fisher found humour-orientated individuals to identify their mothers as demanding, unsympathetic and distant. They were seen to avoid the nurturant role, commonly falling on the father to fulfil this role for the family. An inkblot test for parents of comedians, revealed their tendency to identify a child-like view of the world, describing protocols with juvenile imagery. Fisher concluded that these views were linked with a parents reluctance towards responsibilities, associated with a general tone that \\"happiness prevails.‚Äù Parents of comics were found to avoid solemn ideas, identifying negative images in Rorschach tests then denying negative elements, such as:\\"this is a wolf. I thought it was ferocious. But I heard that it is not.\\" This childlike view of the world and rejection of family obligations can cause comedians to embody a greater sense of responsibility and a feeling of obligation to protect others, a compensation of their parents‚Äô unconscious rejection of adult responsibilities. This burden of responsibilities has been shown to evoke issues regarding self-worth that foster the development of the sad clown paradox. It has also been concluded that humour may serve as an attempt to relate to people from a distance, evoked by a childhood desire for social contact. Typically humour is described as an emotional and cognitive state and its absence has been found to cause depression and anxiety. Comedians have been found to identify the importance of a caregiver and are worried of not being a good enough parent. A study conducted by Janus revealed that the sampled comedic performers were more prone to wanting larger families. This was associated with a comics need to provide and form connections that can be fulfilled by the family setting.  Social context  The early lives of comedians are characterised by suffering, isolation and feelings of deprivation, where humour is used as an outlet or defence against experienced anxiety. German philosopher Nietzsche once described it as; \\"man alone suffers so excruciatingly in the world that he was compelled to invent laughter.\\" The inability to exhibit direct aggression results in expression through the socially acceptable manner of humour. Humour provides the ability to assert control and invincibility in a situation, revealed by Bill Cosby that you can survive anything if you can find humour in it. An example is the British comedian Spike Milligan who suffered from a long cycle of manic-depressive states that were onset by severe mental breakdowns.Spike Milligan and Anthony Clare, Depression and How to Survive It, first edition, 1994. Milligan was capable of creating light-hearted humour and outrageous ideas, despite his manic state. Finding laughter served as motivation to remedy a depressed mental state and effectively function as self-medication. This process has been described as a safeguard against the formation of hopelessness and subsequent depression. Additionally, affiliative and self-enhancing humour can be used to predict symptoms of depression, with higher levels shown to correlate with lower levels of depression. Recounts from psychiatric treatments revealed some patients to be overwhelmed by negative aspects of their life. However, when these issues were confronted the psychiatrist was met with laughter, followed by the patient dismissing the severity of the issue. The laughter can hide feelings of frustration, disappointment, grief, remorse or even joy in an effort to defend against adversity and allow for self preservation.  Scientific studies  = Rorschach test = The use of inkblot imaging reveals certain characteristics and worries of comedic performers that are not matched in regular actors. Fisher identified four key trends that were common for comedians' Rorschach Tests; * The identification of 'not-bad' imagery. This involves a traditional, negative idea that has been misunderstood and is a victim to preconceived views. Responses were similar to: * Comedian's association with ideas of purity vs evil leads to identification of things bearing moral importance. Fisher concluded this significance was due to comedians need to mock societal standards and hence blur the line between good and bad. *Comedic duo Abbott and Costello who used physical comedyImportance of scale. Describing objects with reference to their magnitude. This disparity in size serves as a reliable source of humour. Charlie Chaplin utilised an iconic costume of; large baggy pants, a small bowler hat, enormous shoes and his small moustache. Comedic duo's such as Abbott and Costello or Laurel and Hardy played off their height and weight differences for comedic effect. * Importance of up versus down, with more concern placed on who or what is down. The use of up-down imagery was frequently implemented by Buster Keaton where his characters were seen falling from great heights or hanging from balconies. A recurring message of failure was linked to the looming threat of falling, negated by a last minute escape and triumph. Fisher suggested that these traits are directly linked to the comics perception of self, believing a need to convince others of their value. Comedians were commonly shown to not hold themselves in high regard, providing more self-depreciating remarks than regular actors in a controlled context. These feelings of unworthiness are defended against in the comics mind by their role in society of helping people and providing laughter. This intent to help people is only momentarily satisfied by audience recognition and approval.This is contrasted against regular actors who were seen to find validation in identifying with figures and concepts larger than themselves. = Aptitude/personality tests = A study conducted by Janus found comedians worked to exhaustion to ensure they remained relevant and funny. He found that from his sample of comedic performers, eighty percent have been involved in psychotherapy and feared its effect on their ability for humour. Comedians were shown to be critical towards the motives of others and feared the longevity of their popularity as celebrities. Most participants from Janus‚Äô study revealed an inescapable sense of depression which they faced alongside their work. The manner in which comedy momentarily alleviates their depression and anxiety allows them to function. However, comedians function for short periods of time, constantly requiring admiration and acknowledgement for their work. Comedians have also been shown to display high levels of psychotic personality traits, scoring high in introvertive anhedonia and impulsive non- conformity. The instability between depressive traits and more extroverted, manic states is traditionally described as cyclothymic temperament. British comedian Stephen Fry confessed to the common mental state he experiences when performing; \\"there are times when I'm doing QI and I'm going 'ha ha, yeah, yeah', and inside I'm going 'I want to fucking die. I... want... to... fucking... die.'\\" Fry's comments indicate the idea of manic defence, where opposite emotions are used to distract and cope with uncomfortable feelings.  Performance  The sad clown paradox can be seen embodied in a performer's performance on stage, such as their characterisation or jokes. = Pagliacci joke = A joke dating from at least the 19th Century exemplifies the sad clown paradox, where a clown that a doctor recommends his patient visits to cure his depression is, in fact, the patient himself.  Origins  One of the first forms of the joke can be seen in the Spanish poem 'Re√≠r Llorando' (Laughing While Crying) by the late 19th century Mexican poet Juan de Dios Peza. The poem tells of an English actor called 'Garrick' that a doctor recommends to his patient as the only cure for his loss of interest in life, whereupon the patient reveals that he indeed, is Garrick. It has been suggested that this Garrick was the entertainer Joseph Grimaldi. The poem was then seen as a story in the 1910s, again, with the performer called 'Grimaldi', and again from the 1930s, featuring a clown called 'Grock', suggested as being the Swiss clown Charles Adrien Wettach.  In Popular Culture  = Watchmen = The user of the poem/story as a joke became popular in popular culture after being featured in the graphic novel, Watchmen, where Rorschach recalls: 'Man goes to doctor. Says he's depressed, says life seems harsh and cruel. Says he feels all alone in a threatening world where what lies ahead is vague and uncertain. Doctor says \\"Treatment is simple. Great clown Pagliacci is in town tonight. Go and see him. That should pick you up. Man busts into tears. Says \\"But doctor, I am Pagliacci\\"'  See also  * List of people with an anxiety disorder * Creativity and mental illness * Wise fool  References   Sources       External links  Psychoanalysis Psychological concepts Mental health Comedy Humour ","title":"Sad clown paradox"},{"id":"60457360","text":"Political repression in South Korea refers to the physical or psychological maltreatment, including different levels of threats suffered by individuals or groups in South Korea for different kinds of political reasons. The origins can be traced back to the tyranny of emperors in the early times during the Joseon Period, especially the notorious despot named Yeonsangun. And then the break-out of the Korean War brought inestimably huge repression on the populace for the following period. After that, Syngman Rhee, as an anti‚Äîcommunist, conducted severe political repression against some perceived opposition and was also guilty of embezzlement of millions of dollars and electoral corruption, which eventually triggered the April Revolution. It culminated in the 1970s, known as the \\"Dark age for democracy\\" in Korea when Park Chung-hee tried to prolong his rule and strengthen his power by deliberately rigging election results and changing relevant legislation. Following that came the Bu-Ma Democratic Protest and Gwangju Uprising. And it continued to exist as a consequence of the reveal of Park Geun-hye's political scandal, when she turned out to have a large reliance on her cronyism. In terms of online daily life, South Korea has set severe limitations on Internet by establishing substantial and complicated Internet censorship. It blocks the accessibility to information from foreign websites and keeps an eye on domestic critical arguments and anti-action. Whist, \\"endless\\" protests and demonstrations under repression also reflect the political democracy in this country to some extent. TOC Origins and early South Korea times -tyranny of emperor  Early on, there were five main existing methods used to tortured and punished criminals during the period of Joseon Period according to Everyday Life in Joseon-Era Korea: beating with a light stick (tae), beating with a heavy stick (jang), penal servitude (do), banishment (ryu), and execution (sa). They were conducted on criminals in line with the severity of their crimes. A light stick beat was a punishment for the minor crimes while execution was the harshest and most horrible type of punishment. The degree incremented in order. alt=It is a picture in Joseon Period with some staff whipping the criminal In terms of Joseon king's ruling styles, there were three kinds of them: a king ordering directly without considering others' opinions which was named as Arbitrary Decision (AD), a king discussing an issue with the officials and then conducting his order named Discussion and Order (DO) and a king discussing an issue with the officials and then deciding to take their suggestion called Discussion and Follow (DF). Yeonsangun who was evaluated as a tyrant turned out to have the highest high number of AD. Also, unlike other previous emperors, his increasing the tax burden on commoners and adding pressure on peasantry consequently contributed to the widening wealth gap between rich and poor areas during his reign, which reflected on the tyranny of this emperor. Repressions in territories -The Korea War began  The peasantry suffered a lot both physically and mentally, became starving and homeless due to Korea War. Influenced by the Cold War between the Soviet Union and the United States both with their alliance in regards to communism and capitalism to a large extent, North Korea invaded the South, trying to unify the whole territory. Syngman Rhee, as an anti-communist, also worked closely with other Korean Protestant clergy to spread ideas about \\"militant anti- communism\\" with the attempt to eliminate them and unify this country. Although supported by more than three millions communist soldiers from China and Soviet Union, North Korea ended up to be defeated when sixteen UN nations supplied fighting units to help Republic of Korea to terminate this war. The whole process including the actual armed conflicts and the negotiation on the governmental basis lasted over five years and eventually ended up when the Korean Armistice Agreement was signed. Korea suffered catastrophically with losing more or less 3 million of lives, conjointly making 5 million citizens become homeless and experience the separation from loved ones. More seriously, it made irretrievable ruin on economy of both North Korea and South Korea.  April 19 Revolution - strike-back of students  The suddenly bizarre death of the democratic candidate named Choung Pyong-ok cleaned obstacles lying in front of Syngman Rhee who was, at that time, already 85 years old. Considering that the power of the vice presidency would become another potential threat to him, he then selected Lee Ki-poong, who failed the election four years ago and was a comparatively weak rival. Also, Rhee deployed police to interfere with the whole election, attempting to prolong his rule in the way of rigging election results step by step. Segments of the Korean populace were infuriated as a consequence of this foregone conclusion and hence started the protests against Rhee. To put down the opposed students' demonstration, police shot upon innocent citizens and the corpse of a high school student discovered by a fisherman triggered this April Revolution. People, especially students from colleges and universities, gathered together to protest the inhumane and arbitrary rule of Rhee. In the end, Rhee resigned on 26 April 1960 and Lee along with his family died. \\"Dark age for democracy\\" in Korea  During the period of Park Chung Hee's presidential rule in 1970s when he thought he might lose his power and fail the election, he brought several legislation and regulations into force to make his \\"legal dictatorship\\" come true. What's worse, he suspended the president election combined with deliberately changing the domestic policy called Yushin Constitution (Revitalization Reform) to reign for unlimited number of six-year terms, leading Korea to the Fourth Republic. He also empowered the military to take armed action when necessary. Therefore, political repression conducted by entitled local police during that period such as unreasonable arrests, mental and physical torture, surveillance abuse and imprisonment of political opponents, particularly university students were quite common. = Bu-Ma Democratic Protests = Due to the unsatisfactory result of 1978 South Korean legislative election, there was a spontaneous strike held by female workers from YH Trading Company in the place of New Democratic Party headquarter. The settlement of this strike was indicated by the expelling of Kim Young-sam from National Assembly. More and more unbearable political repression suffered by citizens then triggered the Bu-Ma Democratic Protest. Thousands of university students and citizens from Pusan and Masan appealed to abolish the Yushin regime. Unfortunately, lots of students and civilians got injured and 66 people were under arrest and referred to military court. In the end, Park was shot dead by Kim Jae-gyu. = Gwangju Uprising = Students in Gwangju Uprising After the assassination of Park Chung Hee on 26 October 1979, the new junta attempted to seize the power and maintain the Yusin regime by taking armed action and killing opponents. On 18 May, students gathered together in Chonnam National University to demonstrate and protest while soldiers clubbed or even charged at them. The government even sent paratroopers to take control of this political revolt. With the circumstance getting more severe, the army started to shoot on innocent onlookers. This merciless and cruel suppression led to hundreds of drivers to join in the protest by driving their cars one by one. The armed forces then brutally assaulted them when they were trying to take injured people to hospital. According to official statistics from Martial Law Command, more than one hundred citizens died during this protest and thousands of people got injured. They suffered a loss at that time but benefited from this uprising in the long term thanks to their bravery to fight back the unreasonable political repression.  South Korean illegal surveillance incident  This surveillance scandal started as a result of widely-watched online video clip made by a Korea civilian named Kim Jong-ik who criticized the current president ironically and implicitly. Then the administration officials noticed him and monitored him, following the instructions of Cheong Wa Dae. This incident eventually erupted when this man could not bear the political repression any more and then stood out to publish his opinions. There is also evidence that one official for Lee Myung-bak even tried to cover up the truth by bribing the staff who knew relevant information. The former prime minister Chung Un-chan tried to reconstruct the ethic department but failed in the end. Involved staff were arrested in the end.  Park Geun-hye's political scandals  =Sinking of MV Sewol= Citizens mourned for the sinking of Sewol. The sinking of MV Sewol brought indelibly huge impacts to South Korea society not only for that more than half of the passengers the majority of whom were high school students were dead or missing but also for that the captain thought about his own safety first rather than rescuing others. When this tragedy happened, the government under Park Geun-hye's instruction failed to respond timely and organically. What is worse, the administration even tried to downplay the protests against president Park, cover up this administration as a simply ferry accident and set up a new commission responsible for monitoring critiques about her. Conjointly, Park made a blacklist with many artists' and litterateurs' names on it which was intended to forbid them to participate in any events to do with the sinking of Sewol. =Terminal High Altitude Area Defense= On 17 October 2013, the South Korea military showed primary intention to install Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) to strengthen its military power to defend itself against North Korea. The US and South Korea government decided to deploy this anti- missile system by the end of 2017. Residents in Soseong-ri strongly opposed THAAD due to the constant huge noise of the generators and that of helicopters' shuttling supplies. Moreover, peasants worried about that waves from radar would damage their corps. \\"No Nukes, No THAAD\\" was a popular slogan at that time. There were also complaints that Park was too obedient to the United States government and was so self-righteous that she seldom listened to citizens' opinions. There is no denying that the operation of THAAD ignores the health of residents and affects income sources of local farmers. =2016 South Korean political scandal ‚Äì cronyism Choi Soon-sil = Citizens gathered together to protest against Park Geun-hye on the street. Choi Soon-sil, the \\"closest\\" friend of Park, was convicted of taking advantage of power to grab large bribes from several big companies, tamper with official documents arbitrarily and give way to her daughter by changing the admission of Ewha Womans University. Also, Choi was reported to have access to confidential government information and frequently meet different officials to discuss about president Park's issue in her own office. Feeling cheated and made use of, approximately one million citizens marched into Gwanghwamun Square, in central Seoul, to demonstrate and protest. It is also known as South Korea's biggest candlelit protest in the recent years. In the end, Park Geun-hye, the first female president of South Korea, was sentenced to prison along with her friend Choi Soon-sil.

She served for eleven years as assistant secretary, superintendent, and reporter for the press, and manager of county, state and inter-state fairs. In addition to publishing a volume of poems, she served as secretary of the Western Art Association of Omaha, Nebraska, retiring on January 1, 1891. Briggs was active in organizing woman's work, and also a writer of descriptive matter of the expositions and like areas in which she was interested. Her best known exposition work was for the world's fair at Chicago, where she was one of the two Nebraskans on the board of lady managers and did much toward organizing the Nebraska women for their work for the state and children's building. She managed getting up the representation for her state at New Orleans. Early years and education Mary Elizabeth Blatchley was born in Valparaiso, Indiana, January 1, 1846. She was of Scotch, English and Dutch descent. Her mother was a native of Ohio, and her father of Pennsylvania. The father was a practicing physician and surgeon. She had at least two sisters. Her family migrated from Indiana to Council Bluffs, Iowa, where her early school-days were spent in the public schools, and in the young ladies' seminary, receiving prizes for excellent scholarship. In August, 1861, her family removed to Quincy, Illinois, where she attended the public high school until she was nineteen years old. Career Mary Briggs, 1892 She married John S. Briggs at Council Bluffs, on December 24, 1867. Thereafter, they resided in Omaha, Nebraska. Mr. Briggs was born in Ohio, but was reared in Iowa, removing to Nebraska in 1856. He was the son of Ansel Briggs, first governor of the State of Iowa. John, along with Dr. Miller, was one of the founders of the Omaha Herald. Briggs filled many important public positions. For eleven years, she served as assistant secretary, superintendent, reporter for the press, and manager of county, State and inter-state fairs. While on a visit to Idaho, she and her husband prepared a collection of minerals, stalactite, and calcareous deposits, which, at the suggestion of the officials of the Union Pacific Railroad, was sent to the New England Manufacturers' and Mechanics' Institute in Boston, Massachusetts. Briggs was interested in art and served as secretary of the Western Art Association, which has 300 members. In literature, she is remembered for her poems, one volume of which compiled and published. Briggs was selected by Bertha Palmer as one of the six representative women of the West to serve on the executive committee of the Board of Lady Managers of the World's Columbian Exposition in 1893. She was appointed a member of the bylaws judiciary committee, was elected an honorary and corresponding member of the woman's branch of the World's Congress Auxiliary, and served on several committees. She possessed an intimate knowledge of Nebraska, its history, its resources, its development and its people. Personal life Briggs had three children: John, Ansel, and Nannie. In religious belief, she was a Presbyterian, and a member of Knox Presbyterian church, later known as the North church. She was vice president of the Douglas County Pioneer's association. In September 1909, in Jackson County, Iowa, she attended the ceremony at the unveiling of the Briggs monument, honoring her late husband. Briggs died suddenly in Washta, Iowa in November 1910, age 64, while visiting her son-in-law and daughter, Mr. and Mrs. A. D. Robertson. Four weeks earlier, she was made ill by pneumonia, but she rallied, saw a number of friends and seemed on the way to recovery. Burial was at Prospect Hill Cemetery.

Managed by the agency's Directorate of Science, The programme funds the development, launch, and operation of missions led by European space agencies and institutions through generational campaigns. Horizon 2000, the programme's first campaign, facilitated the development of eight missions between 1985 and 1995 including four \\"cornerstone missions\\" ‚Äì SOHO and Cluster II, XMM-Newton, Rosetta, and Herschel. Horizon 2000 Plus, the programme's second campaign, facilitated the development of Gaia, LISA Pathfinder, and BepiColombo between 1995 and 2005. The programme's current campaign since 2005, Cosmic Vision, has so far funded the development of ten missions including three flagship missions, JUICE, ATHENA, and LISA. The programme's upcoming fourth campaign, Voyage 2050, is currently being drafted. Collaboration with agencies and institutions outside of Europe occasionally occur in the Science Programme, including a collaboration with NASA on Cassini‚ÄìHuygens and the CNSA on SMILE.  Governance  The Science Programme is managed by the European Space Agency (ESA)'s Directorate of Science, and its goals include the proliferation of Europe's scientific presence in space, fostering technological innovation, and maintaining European space infrastructure such as launch services and spacecraft operations. It is one of ESA's mandatory programmes in which each member state of ESA must participate. Members contribute an amount proportional to their net national product to ensure the long-term financial security of the programme and its missions. The programme's planning structure is a \\"bottom up\\" process that allows the European scientific community to control the direction of the programme through advisory bodies. These bodies make recommendations on the programme to the Director General and the Director of Science, and their recommendations are independently reported to ESA's Science Programme Committee (SPC) ‚Äì the authority over the programme as a whole. The programme's current advisory structure consists the Astronomy Working Group (AWG) and the Solar System and Exploration Working Group (SSEWG), who report to the senior Space Science Advisory Committee (SSAC) that reports to the agency's directors. Membership on the advisory bodies last three years, and the chairs of the AWG and SSEWG are also members of the SSAC. Ad hoc advisory groups may also be created to advise on certain mission proposals or the formulation of planning cycles. Missions in the programme are selected through competitions in which members of the European scientific community submit proposals to ESA. During each competition, the agency outlines one of four mission categories for which proposals need to meet the criteria of. These are the \\"L\\"-class large missions, the \\"M\\"-class medium missions, the \\"S\\"-class small missions, and the \\"F\\"-class fast missions, each with differing budget caps and implementation timelines. The proposals are then reviewed by the AWG, SSEWG, engineers at ESA, and any relevant ad hoc working groups, as part of a feasibility study known as \\"Phase 0\\". Missions which require new technologies to be developed are reviewed during these studies at the Concurrent Design Facility at the European Space Research and Technology Centre. After the study, up to three proposals are selected as finalists in \\"Phase A\\", in which a preliminary design for each candidate mission is formulated. The SPC then makes a final decision on which proposal proceeds to phases \\"B\\" through \\"F\\", which include the development, construction, launch, and disposal of the spacecraft used in the mission. During Phase A, each candidate mission is assigned two competing contractors to build their spacecraft, and the contractor for the winning mission is chosen during Phase B.  History  = Background = The European Space Agency (ESA) was established in May 1975 as the merger of the European Space Research Organisation (ESRO) and the European Launcher Development Organisation. In 1970, the governing Launch Programme Advisory Committee (LPAC) of ESRO made a decision not to execute astronomy or planetary missions, which were perceived as beyond the budget and capabilities of the organisation at the time. This meant that cooperation with other government space agencies and institutions was necessary for large-scale scientific missions. This policy was effectively reversed in 1980, when ESA's then-Director of Science, Ernst Trendelenburg, and the agency's new authoritative Science Programme Committee (SPC) selected the Giotto flyby reconnaissance mission to comet Halley and the Hipparcos astrometry mission for launch. In addition to the selection of the International Ultraviolet Explorer observatory in March 1983, the three were the first European science missions launched aboard Arianespace launch vehicles, which gave Europe autonomy over its launch services. This, in addition to the lack of a long-term plan for scientific missions, along with budget setbacks from NASA on the collaborative International Solar Polar Mission (later named Ulysses), spurred the development of a long-term scientific programme through which ESA could sustainably plan missions independent of other agencies and institutions over lengthier periods. The leadership and advisory structure of ESA's Directorate of Science changed immediately prior to the programme's establishment. In the 1970s, ESA's Science Advisory Committee (SAC), which succeeded the LPAC, advised the Director General on all scientific matters; the Astronomy Working Group (AWG) and the Solar System Working Group (SSWG) also reported directly to the Director General. In the early 1980s, the SAC was replaced with the Space Science Advisory Committee (SSAC), who were tasked to report to the Director of Science on developments in the AWG and SSWG. In addition, former SAC chair Roger-Maurice Bonnet replaced Trendelenburg as Director of Science in May 1983. = Horizon 2000 =  Formulation  In November and December 1983, ESA made the first open call for mission proposals to the European scientific community, based on an idea for a community-driven programme presented by Bonnet to the SPC in late 1983. The call yielded 68 proposals ‚Äì 30 in the field of astronomy and 34 in the field of solar physics, with 4 miscellaneous concepts also submitted. An ad hoc \\"survey committee\\" led by then-SRON Director Johan Bleeker was convened, consisting members of the SSAC, CERN, the European Science Foundation, the European Southern Observatory, and the International Astronomical Union, to examine the proposals submitted. Throughout early 1984, the survey committee formulated plans for a series of missions divided into three categories ‚Äì \\"cornerstones\\" which would cost two annual budgets over a long implementation timeline, medium-size missions which would cost one annual budget, and small-size missions that would cost half an annual budget. The budget for the Science Programme was 130 million accounting units (MAU) annually in 1984, and a 7% annual increase until 1991, when the budget would be fixed at 200 MAU per year onwards, was proposed. Medium-size and small-size categories would later be merged into a single medium-size category that would represent missions costing half a budget. This category was internally referred to as the \\"blue missions\\", named after their representation as blue boxes in a publicised diagram of the plan. Each of the original three cornerstones of the plan were assigned a specific field of science that competing proposals would aim to fill, while the objectives of medium-sized missions were left open to be competitively selected alongside mission proposals. The cornerstones selected were a comet sample-return mission, an X-ray spectroscopy mission, and a submillimetre astronomy mission. Cornerstone objectives that were not selected due to financial and technical shortcomings, but mentioned by the survey committee as possibilities beyond Horizon 2000, included a solar probe, a Mars rover, and a two-dimensional interferometry mission. The survey committee's final meeting was held on San Giorgio Maggiore, Venice in June 1984, where the \\"Horizon 2000\\" plan was presented to ESA's then-Director General Erik Quistgaard, and leading members of the European scientific community. The broad objectives of Horizon 2000 were to expand scientific knowledge, establish Europe as a developmental centre of space science, provide opportunities to the European scientific community, and spur innovation in the space technology industry. At the meeting, an additional fourth cornerstone presented by the SSWG was adopted ‚Äì the Solar-Terrestrial Science Programme (STSP) consisting the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory and Cluster proposals, which became the first missions to be selected for launch under Horizon 2000. Quistgaard presented the Horizon 2000 plan at the 1985 Ministerial Council in Rome, where it was approved with only a 5% annual increase of the budget through to 1989, instead of the requested 7% through to 1991. This was only enough to fund around half of Horizon 2000's objectives. However, an extension of the 5% annual increase through to 1994 was approved at the 1990 Ministerial Council in The Hague, which allowed all Horizon 2000 missions to be fully funded.  Implementation  The selection of SOHO (pictured) and Cluster was challenged early in development due to financial concerns The X-ray Multi- Mirror Mission (XMM) was conceived as the X-ray spectroscopy cornerstone mission at an ESA workshop in Lyngby in June 1985, consisting a space observatory with twelve low-energy and seven high-energy telescopes. Due to practical constraints, the mission's payload was reduced to seven telescopes overall by 1987, though the success of EXOSAT inspired mission planners to improve the efficiency of the mission's observations by placing the spacecraft in a highly eccentric orbit, allowing the payload of the spacecraft to be reduced to its final design of three large telescopes ‚Äì each with a reflecting area of 1,500 cm2. By 1986, the cost of the STSP cornerstone was forecast to exceed its allocated 400 MAU budget, and in a February 1986 meeting, the SPC was presented with the possibility of cancelling the cornerstone in favour of a medium-size mission selection between SOHO, Cluster, and the Kepler Mars orbiter proposal, which had gained popularity among members of the SSAC. The Space Shuttle Challenger disaster, which occurred the month before, had an effect on proceedings, as SOHO was intended to be launched via the Shuttle. Despite this, the SSWG, SSAC, and SPC reaffirmed a commitment to the STSP cornerstone by descoping SOHO and limiting Cluster to three spacecraft, and reaching a collaboration agreement with NASA in October 1986 that would reduce the mission's cost ‚Äì they would provide testing, launch services, and operations of SOHO and contribute various scientific instruments, while cancelling their Equator mission in favour of a fourth Cluster spacecraft on which American scientific instruments would be flown. The first medium-class mission was selected from proposals formulated by ESA in 1982, prior to Horizon 2000. A Titan Probe that would piggyback on the American Cassini spacecraft was proposed by a group of American and European scientists, and was selected alongside the American-European LYMAN ultraviolet and QUASAT very-long-baseline interferometry observatories as finalists. The European- Soviet Vesta multiple-flyby minor planet mission and GRASP gamma-ray observatory competed, but were rejected by the AWG and SSWG. After budget cuts resulting from the Challenger disaster forced NASA to retract its support for LYMAN and QUASAT, the Titan Probe was selected by the SPC in November 1988, and renamed Huygens in honor of Christiaan Huygens, who discovered Titan in 1655, per the suggestion of Swiss astronomers at the meeting. In the competition for the second medium-class mission in June 1989, a consortium of American and European institutions proposed INTEGRAL, a gamma-ray observatory that combined GRASP with the American Nuclear Astrophysics Explorer (NAE), which had lost selection for NASA's Explorers Programme that year. NASA supported the proposal, and the Russian Academy of Sciences later offered launch aboard a Proton launch vehicle in exchange for observation time on the mission. Despite concerns about NASA's commitment to the mission and their funding sources, INTEGRAL was selected by the SPC in June 1993, with NASA contributing Deep Space Network services and a spectrometer. In response, INTEGRAL was selected by NASA as an Explorers mission without competition. This, along with concerns about the sensitivity of the spectrometer designed for the mission, proved controversial among NASA's advisory bodies. In September 1994, ESA and NASA resolved to end NASA's involvement with the spectrometer, citing a lack of financial support. CNES promptly assumed the financial burden, and led the design and manufacturing of a new spectrometer. Rosetta and FIRST were selected in November 1993 as the third and fourth cornerstone missions, with the latter mission eventually being rechristened the Herschel Space Observatory. COBRAS/SAMBA, later rechristened Planck, was selected as the third medium-sized mission in July 1996. As of December 2016, four Horizon 2000 missions, including three cornerstone and one medium-sized mission, remain operational. = Horizon 2000 Plus = The Gaia astrometry mission was launched as one of three missions in the Horizon 2000 Plus campaign. Horizon 2000 Plus was an extension of Horizon 2000 programme prepared in the mid-1990s, planning missions in the 1995‚Äì2015 timeframe. This included two further cornerstone missions, the star-mapping GAIA launched in 2013, and the BepiColombo mission to Mercury launched in 2018; and also a technology demonstrator LISA Pathfinder launched in 2015, to test technologies for the future LISA. All of the Horizon 2000 and Plus missions were successful, except for the first Cluster which was destroyed in 1996 when its launch rocket exploded. A replacement, Cluster 2, was built and launched successfully in 2000. = Cosmic Vision = Cosmic Vision 2015‚Äì2025 is the current programme of ESA's long-term planning for space science missions. The initial call of ideas and concepts was launched in 2004 with a subsequent workshop held in Paris to define more fully the themes of the Cosmic Vision under the broader subjects of astronomy and astrophysics, Solar System exploration and fundamental physics. By early 2006 the formulation for a 10-year plan based around 4 key questions emerged: * What are the conditions for planet formation and the emergence of life? * How does the Solar System work? * What are the fundamental physical laws of the Universe? * How did the Universe originate and what is it made of? In March 2007 a call for mission ideas was formally released, which yielded 19 astrophysics, 12 fundamental physics and 19 Solar System mission proposals.  Large class  Large class (L-class) missions were originally intended to be carried out in collaboration with other partners with an ESA-specific cost not exceeding 900 million euros. However, in April 2011 it became clear that budget pressures in the US meant that an expected collaboration with NASA on the L1 mission would not be practical. The down-selection was therefore delayed and the missions re-scoped on the assumption of ESA leadership with some limited international participation. Three L-class missions have been selected under Cosmic Vision: JUICE, a Jupiter and Ganymede orbiter planned for launch in 2022; ATHENA, an X-ray observatory planned for launch in 2031; and LISA, a space-based gravitational-wave observatory planned for launch in 2034.  Medium class  Euclid near-infrared observatory, planned for launch as the second Cosmic Vision M-class mission. Medium class (M-class) projects are relatively stand-alone projects and have a price cap of approximately 500 million euros. The first two M-class missions, the Solar Orbiter heliophysics mission to make close-up observations of the Sun, and the Euclid visible to near-infrared space telescope, aimed at studying dark energy and dark matter, were selected in October 2011. PLATO, a mission to search for exoplanets and measure stellar oscillations, was selected on 19 February 2014, against EChO, LOFT, MarcoPolo-R and STE-QUEST After a preliminary culling of proposals for the fourth M-class mission in March 2015, a short list of three mission proposals selected for further study was announced on 4 June 2015. The shortlist included the THOR plasma observatory and the XIPE X-ray observatory. ARIEL, a space observatory which will observe transits of nearby exoplanets to determine their chemical composition and physical conditions, was ultimately selected on 20 March 2018. The competition for the fifth M-class mission is currently underway, with the SPICA far-infrared observatory, THESEUS gamma-ray observatory, and EnVision Venus orbiter chosen as finalists. The winning candidate will be selected in 2021.  Small class  Small class missions (S-class) are intended to have a cost to ESA not exceeding 50 million euros. A first call for mission proposals was issued in March 2012; the winning proposal would need to be ready for launch by 2017. Approximately 70 letters of Intent were received. CHEOPS, a mission to search for exoplanets by photometry, was selected as the first S-class mission in October 2012 and will launch in Fall 2019. SMILE, a joint mission between ESA and the Chinese Academy of Sciences to study the interaction between Earth's magnetosphere and the solar wind, was selected as the second S-class mission from thirteen competing proposals in June 2015 and will launch in 2023.  Fast class  At the ESA Science Programme Committee (SPC) Workshop on 16 May 2018, the creation of a series of special opportunity Fast class (F-class) missions was proposed. These F-class missions will be jointly launched alongside each M-class mission starting from M4, and would focus on \\"innovative implementation\\" in order to broaden the range of scientific topics covered by the mission. The inclusion of F-class missions into the Cosmic Vision program will require an increase of the science budget. F-class missions must take under a decade from selection to launch and weigh less than 1,000 kg. The first F-class mission, Comet Interceptor, was selected in June 2019.  Missions of Opportunity  Occasionally ESA makes contributions to space missions led by another space agency. Missions of opportunity allow the ESA science community to participate in partner-led missions at relatively low cost. The cost of a mission of opportunity is capped at ‚Ç¨50 million. ESA missions of opportunity include contributions to Hinode, IRIS, MICROSCOPE, PROBA-3, XRISM, ExoMars, Einstein Probe, and MMX. A contribution to SPICA (Space Infrared Telescope for Cosmology and Astrophysics), a Japanese JAXA mission, was evaluated as a mission of opportunity within Cosmic Vision. It is no longer considered within that framework, though SPICA is now one of the mission proposals being considered for M5. = Voyage 2050 = The next campaign of the ESA science programme is Voyage 2050, which will cover space science missions operating from 2035 to 2050. Planning began with the appointment of a Senior Committee in December 2018 and a call for white papers in March 2019. Three Large class and six to seven Medium class missions are currently anticipated in this plan, as well as smaller missions and missions of opportunity. It will be the responsibility of the Senior Committee and assisting topical teams to evaluate white papers and publish a final report detailing the Voyage 2050 plan by the end of 2020.

Her work is included in the collections of the Whitney Museum of American Art and the Smithsonian American Art Museum.  Biography  Stone was born in 1928 in Toronto, Ontario. She had two older sisters. When she was two years old, Stone, her siblings, and her mother left Stone's father in the middle of the night. Her mother was unable to support her children on her own. Stone was subsequently sent to Children's Aid homes while her sisters were sent to help on local farms. At the age of six, Stone was placed back with her mother and sisters. The Great Depression severely impacted the family, and they were forced to move several times. It was during this time that Stone began to draw. Stone went to a high school for the arts called Central Tech. During this period she lived alone, as her sisters married and her mother had moved out west. Her mother sent her rent money during this time, and after school Stone worked at Woolworth's. At the age of sixteen, Stone was forced to start working full time in order to support herself. She often worked night shifts in order to still go to school during the day. Stone moved to New York in 1946 at the age of seventeen. At the age of twenty-two Stone married and had a child. She continued to practice art during this time, which displeased her husband's family. This ultimately led to their divorce. During this time Stone studied with Harry Sternberg, Morris Kanto, and Vyclav Vytlacil. In 1959, Stone first met the painter Al Held. The two married ten years later in 1969. They divorced in 1986.
