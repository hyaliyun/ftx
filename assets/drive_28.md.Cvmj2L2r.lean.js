L-17 Masang was a two-seat, single engine, low wing monoplane aircraft designed and built in the Philippine Republic in the mid-1950s. It was intended for both touring and training. Design and development In the mid-1950s the Philippine Institute of Science and Technology (I.S.T.) designed aircraft to explore the possibilities of local aircraft production from indigenous materials. The single engine, tricycle undercarriage, low wing monoplane L-17 was one of them. Its wing was a single-piece wooden structure with 5¬∞ of dihedral and a straight-tapered plan. It was plywood-covered and had split flaps inboard of the ailerons. The cantilever tail unit was similarly constructed with the straight-tapered horizontal surfaces on top of the extreme aft fuselage; the single-piece elevator carried an offset trim tab. The vertical tail was tall and straight-edged; the bottom of the horn balanced rudder was above the elevator and just aft of its hinge, with a small cut-out to allow for elevator deflection. The L-17's fuselage was a plywood- skinned wooden semi-monocoque, the cockpit seating two side by side under a single piece canopy. A 108 hp (80 kW) Lycoming O-235 flat-four engine drove a two-blade propeller. The fixed tricycle undercarriage had rearward-sloping oleo legs mounted to the wings, giving a track of 2.40 m (7 ft 10 in). The first flight of the L-17 was scheduled for May 1956.

Biography Serge Achille Rivarde was born in New York City to a Spanish father and an American mother. He studied under Felix Simon, Henryk Wieniawski and Jos√© White Lafitte.Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians, 5th ed, 1954, Vo. VII, pp. 185-6 At the age of eleven, he became a pupil of Charles Dancla at the Paris Conservatoire, sharing the first prize with Franti≈°ek Ond≈ô√≠ƒçek in 1879. He returned to America for three years 1881-84. In 1885, aged only 19, he returned to Paris to become principal violinist with the Orchestre Lamoureux. He remained in that post till 1891. In 1893, in Paris, he and Harold Bauer premiered Frederick Delius's Violin Sonata in B major. He made his debut in London in 1894. In 1895 he gave √âdouard Lalo's Symphonie espagnole its UK premiere. His American debut came at Carnegie Hall in November 1895 (where he was described as \\"a Spanish violinist\\". He was also said to have \\"just entered his 28th year\\", but he was in fact 30). The New York Times critic said he \\"combines artistic sensibility with a lovely, fluent, polished execution\\", and also noted a resemblance to Pablo de Sarasate, both in his playing and his physical appearance. (A photograph of Rivarde can be seen here.) Some sources say he was also a pupil of Sarasate. In 1899 he became a professor at the Royal College of Music. Apart from occasional appearances as a soloist in London and abroad (he shared the stage with Pablo Casals at a 1913 concert), he remained a teacher at the RCM till 1936 and was held in great esteem. Carl Flesch referred to him as \\"an important violinist and pedagogue\\". His pupils there included Anthony Collins, Eugene Goossens, the violinist and instrument valuer Robert Lewin, and Margaret Harrison (sister of Beatrice Harrison; she was aged only 4 when she entered the RCM to study with Rivarde). Eugene Goossens wrote a piece for violin and piano called Old Chinese Folk Song 'To Achille Rivarde, Esq.' Op. 4/1. Fritz Kreisler dedicated to Rivarde his transcription of Dvo≈ô√°k's 1st Slavonic Dance. In 1922 Rivarde published The Violin and Its Technique As a Means to the Interpretation of Music, a small manual of his own method in which he advocated elasticity of movement in every bar. In 1924 he started a separate school of violin playing in London. He died in 1940 in London, aged 74.

The Infantes of Aragon (Spanish: Los Infantes de Arag√≥n) is an appellation commonly used by Spanish historians to refer to a group of 15th- century infantes (princes) of the House of Trast√°mara, specifically the sons of King Ferdinand I of Aragon and his wife Eleanor of Alburquerque: * Infante Alfonso (1396‚Äì1458) - became Alfonso V of Aragon (f. 1416), also king of Sicily and Naples (f.1442) * Infanta Maria (1396‚Äì1445) - Maria of Aragon, first wife of John II of Castile (m.1420) * Infante Juan (1398‚Äì1479) - King of Navarre (f.1425), later King John II of Aragon (f.1458). * Infante Enrique (1400‚Äì1445) - Henry of Aragon, Duke of Villena, Count of Albuquerque, Count of Emp√∫ries and Grand Master of the Order of Santiago (f.1409) * Infanta Leonor (1402‚Äì1445) - Eleanor of Aragon (Queen of Portugal), consort of Edward I of Portugal (m.1428) * Infante Pedro (1406‚Äì1438) - Peter of Aragon, Count of Alburquerque and Duke of Noto * Infante Sancho (1410‚Äì1416) - infant master of the Order of Alc√°ntara, died prematurely  History  The death of King Henry III of Castile in 1406 left the Crown of Castile in the hand of an infant son, John II of Castile. In his will, Henry III had appointed his brother Infante Ferdinand of Antequera as regent for the young king. Ferdinand used the position to secure advancement for his own children. After the death of the childless king Martin of Aragon in 1410 left the Crown of Aragon without heirs, the estates, by the Compromise of Caspe in 1412, elected the Castilian prince Ferdinand of Antequera as King Ferdinand I of Aragon, Valencia and Barcelona. After Ferdinand's premature death in 1416, he was succeeded by his eldest son as Alfonso V of Aragon. But the ambitious younger sons, particularly the Infantes John and Henry - the 'Infantes of Aragon' - were already entrenched with vast estates in Castile and sought to dominate political life during the reign of their impressionable cousin, king John II of Castile. In July 1420, Infante Henry engineered a coup in Tordesillas, dispossessed opposing nobles and seized effective control of Castilian government. In November of that year, the Infantes arranged the marriage of their sister Maria of Aragon to John II of Castile, thus consolidating their power (they also arranged the reciprocal marriage of John II's sister Maria of Castile to their eldest brother Alfonso V). But John II of Castile turned to Castilian grandee √Ålvaro de Luna, soon made Constable of Castile, to engineer a counter-coup and force Infante Henry into exile in Aragon. But by 1427, √Ålvaro de Luna had fallen out of the king's favor, and Infante Henry returned to Castile and recovered much of his old powers. In 1425, Infante John married Blanche I of Navarre, and became consort-King of Navarre. Their younger sister Eleanor, was married to King Edward of Portugal in 1428. The Trastamara brood had a hand in every Iberian kingdom, in addition to their extensive estates within Castile itself. The position of the 'Infantes of Aragon' seemed unassailable. But John II of Castile turned to the constable √Ålvaro de Luna once again to dislodge them. The Infantes had the support of the high Castilian nobility and (of course) Aragon and Navarre, but the Constable knit a coalition of smaller nobles and burghers against them. The protracted political and military struggles between √Ålvaro de Luna and the Infantes of Aragon, with its series of successes and reverses, characterized much of John II's reign. The Infantes were finally defeated at the First Battle of Olmedo in 1445, where Infante Henry died from his wounds. √Ålvaro de Luna enjoyed a brief period of dominance, until 1454, when John II's second wife, Isabella of Portugal, secured his dismissal. The eldest Trastamara brother, Alfonso V of Aragon, died in 1458, and was succeeded by his younger brother Infante John of Navarre, who ascended as King John II of Aragon. John II (of Aragon) died in 1479. His son Ferdinand II of Aragon married John II (of Castille)'s daughter Isabella I of Castile, ushering in (with some difficulty) the reign of the Catholic Monarchs of Spain.

Biography From an early age, Khemir was fascinated by classical Arabic culture and by storytelling. He has cited the One Thousand and One Nights as a particular influence, saying, \\"I am a child of these stories.\\" However, in spite of this interest and a similar, lasting passion for film, Khemir initially planned a career as a painter and sculptor - a path he has, throughout his life, continued to pursue; his art has been exhibited at, among other institutions, the Centre Pompidou and the Museum of Modern Art in Paris. In 1966, at the age of eighteen, he was awarded a UNESCO fellowship to study film in Paris. In 1975, he completed his first film, L‚ÄôHistoire du pays du Bon Dieu (The History of God's Country), shot in his hometown of Korba and featuring the desert setting and spiritual overtones that would figure prominently in his later work. Released in 1984, his first feature film, Les baliseurs du d√©sert (Wanderers of the Desert), garnered international acclaim. The film, which tells the story of a schoolteacher's arrival in a strange and haunting desert town, was awarded the Grand Prix at the Festival des Trois Continents. Khemir's second feature, Le collier perdu de la colombe (The Dove's Lost Necklace), was released in 1991. The dialogue of the film is in Classical Arabic. Its narrative, reminiscent of a fairy tale, concerns a young calligrapher in Al-Andalus who embarks on a quest to find the missing fragments of a manuscript that he believes will reveal to him the secrets of love. Le collier perdu de la colombe was the recipient of several awards, including a Special Jury Prize at the Locarno International Film Festival. Les baliseurs du d√©sert and Le collier perdu de la colombe are considered to form the first two parts of a \\"Desert Trilogy.\\" The third part, Bab'Aziz: le prince qui contemplait son √¢me (Bab'Aziz: The Prince Who Contemplated His Soul) was released in 2005. Bab'Aziz tells the story of an elderly dervish who, accompanied by his young granddaughter, encounters several mysterious strangers as he journeys to a large and joyful Sufi gathering in the desert. Khemir has described Bab'Aziz as \\"a highly political film, and deliberately so,\\" saying: > \\"I would explain it with this allegory: if you are walking alongside your > father and he suddenly falls down, his face in the mud, what would you do? > You would help him stand up, and wipe his face with your shirt. My father‚Äôs > face stands for Islam, and I tried to wipe Islam‚Äôs face clean with my movie, > by showing an open, tolerant and friendly Islamic culture, full of love and > wisdom . . . an Islam that is different from the one depicted by the media > in the aftermath of 9/11.\\" The film was co-produced by eight countries, including Germany, France, Switzerland, and Iran. It was the recipient of a Golden Dagger at the Muscat Film Festival. In addition to his work as an artist and filmmaker, Khemir has performed as a storyteller at the Th√©√¢tre national de Chaillot, and has produced work for Swiss, French, and Tunisian television. He is the author of a number of books, including several for children.

General Information =Overview and Purpose= MONAHRQ - My Own Network, Powered by AHRQ - is a free, downloadable software product that helps organizations quickly and easily generate a health care reporting website suitable for the public, providers, or policymakers. It is a product of the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), part of the United States Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS). The MONAHRQ software tool supports web-based public reporting of healthcare quality measures. It enables host users to automatically generate their own interactive healthcare reporting website, which they then host as they wish. Parts of the reporting website are designed for consumers, while other parts are designed for the more sophisticated data user. While the MONAHRQ software is available to anyone, its primary host users ‚Äì those interested in generating and hosting a MONARHQ reporting website ‚Äì may be state data organizations, chartered value exchanges, and hospital organizations. To generate the website, host users must provide the appropriate input data: hospital administrative data and/or any of the other publicly available measure results that MONAHRQ is able to load and report. Minimal technical knowledge is required to use MONAHRQ. The software itself is free. =History= AHRQ initiated the MONAHRQ project in 2008 to facilitate transparency and public reporting in healthcare. MONAHRQ builds on preexisting AHRQ products, primarily the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP), which collects voluntarily submitted all-payer hospital administrative data from most states in the US, and the AHRQ Quality Indicators, which are a widely used set of standardized healthcare quality measures based on hospital administrative data. Previous Versions of MONAHRQ MONAHRQ version 1.0 was publicly released in June 2010. This version requires hospital administrative data as input. The software uses this data to calculate a subset of the hospital-level and county-level AHRQ Quality Indicators, hospital-level utilization statistics, and county-level utilization statistics. It then generates a website that reports this information. MONAHRQ 1.1 was publicly released in November 2010. It is similar to MONAHRQ 1.0 but includes a newer version of the AHRQ Quality Indicators software updated for fiscal year 2010, the Quality Indicators software for Windows version 4.2. MONAHRQ version 2.0 was publicly released in July 2011. Its major new feature is the ability to report Hospital Compare inpatient measure results. These measure results are publicly available from the CMS Hospital Compare website. They consist of the Hospital Compare inpatient mortality and readmissions measures, inpatient process measures, and HCAHPS patient satisfaction measures. Version 2.0 also includes an updated user interface for the MONAHRQ- generated reporting website. MONAHRQ version 3.0 was released in June 2012. It includes the ability to report Hospital Compare outpatient measure results (outpatient imaging measures and outpatient process measures), the ability to report AHRQ Quality Indicators composite measures, a new Nursing Sensitive health topic, and a number of additional customization and convenience features for host users. It also includes a newer version of the AHRQ Quality Indicators software for Windows, version 4.3a. MONAHRQ version 4.0 was released in August 2012. The major update is that the MONAHRQ software no longer embeds the AHRQ Quality Indicators software. Instead, host users will calculate the AHRQ QI separately and load the results in a standard format into MONAHRQ. Current Version of MONAHRQ MONAHRQ version 5.0 was released in May 2014. Version 5.0 represents a complete redesign of the software as well as the websites than can be generated. Technical Description =Using the software= MONAHRQ is a desktop software program that runs under Microsoft Windows Operating System. It uses the free Microsoft .NET Framework and free Microsoft SQL Server Express database software. The MONAHRQ Download Site provides information on specific version compatibilities. To use MONAHRQ, host users must download the MONAHRQ software onto their own local computer. They then use MONAHRQ to load their own data sets, process the data, and generate website pages onto their own local machine. They are then free to host the generated website as they wish. MONAHRQ is not a service. AHRQ does not collect users‚Äô data, calculate measures, or host reporting websites. AHRQ provides the MONAHRQ software tool and technical assistance for using it. =The MONAHRQ-generated reporting website= The MONAHRQ-generated reporting website can report four types of information. Reports are shown as tables, maps, and/or bar charts. The website also provides search features and help information. 1\\\\. Hospital quality measures. Specific information about which quality measures can be reported by MONAHRQ is available at the MONAHRQ Website. 2\\\\. A subset of area-level AHRQ Quality Indicators. These are reported at the county level. Specific information on which area-level AHRQ Quality Indicators can be reported is available at the MONAHRQ Website. 3\\\\. Provider-level utilization statistics (number of hospital stays, costs, and length of stay). These are reported at the hospital level. Specific information is available at the MONAHRQ Website. 4\\\\. Area-level utilization statistics (rates and costs). These are reported at the county level. Specific information is available at the MONAHRQ Website. The MONAHRQ-generated reporting website supports interactive querying. However, it does not connect to a backend database. All webpages are static. They use relatively simple client-side technologies such as HTML, Cascading Style Sheets, and JavaScript. This design makes it technically easy to host a MONAHRQ-generated website. However, in order to update the data in the website, the website must be regenerated. Links to known, publicly available MONAHRQ-generated websites can be found at the MONAHRQ website under Websites Generated Using MONAHRQ. =Methods= MONAHRQ calculates the AHRQ Quality Indicators using an embedded version of AHRQ's Quality Indicators software for Windows. Details on technical specifications and methods used by this software are available on the AHRQ Quality Indicators website. Utilization statistics are calculated directly by MONAHRQ. Details on technical specifications and methods are available on the MONAHRQ Website. =Software components= The MONAHRQ software contains the following components. Many are preexisting AHRQ products. 1\\\\. AHRQ's Quality Indicators software for Windows (in MONAHRQ versions 1.0 to 3.0) 2\\\\. AHRQ's Cost-to-Charge Ratio (CCR) files 3\\\\. AHRQ's Clinical Classification Software (CCS) 4\\\\. AHRQ's Comorbidity Software 5\\\\. AHRQ's Prevention Quality Indicators Mapping Tool 6\\\\. AHRQ-produced website builder software 7\\\\. Proprietary risk adjustment software from 3M (APR-DRGs, embedded in the risk adjustment for the AHRQ Quality Indicators) 8\\\\. Proprietary DRG grouper software from Innovative Resources for Payors (IRP) 9\\\\. Nationwide benchmarks for the AHRQ QI and for rates and utilization information, calculated from AHRQ's HCUP databases 10\\\\. US Census population files 11\\\\. State and county Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) codes 12\\\\. State and county shape files =Licensing and costs= The MONAHRQ name and logo are registered trademarks. As a product of the U.S. Federal government, the MONAHRQ software itself has no licensing requirements. The executable is available as a free download from AHRQ at monahrq.ahrq.gov. MONAHRQ can be run using only free software: AHRQ-produced software, the Microsoft .NET framework, and the Microsoft SQL Server Express database. Technical assistance, assuming resource availability, is provided by AHRQ. Contact information can be found on the MONAHRQ website News and Support =MONAHRQ website= The main MONAHRQ Website provides software downloads, user documentation, a live demo site of the MONAHRQ-generated website, a fact sheet, presentations, \\"What‚Äôs New?\\" announcements, a FAQ page, and links to known MONAHRQ-generated websites. =MONAHRQ listserv= The MONAHRQ Listserv emails announcements about new releases, documentation updates, and other events such as the release of new MONAHRQ-generated websites. Interested parties may sign up on the MONAHRQ home page. =MONAHRQ technical assistance= Assuming resource availability, MONAHRQ technical support is available from the MONAHRQ Technical Assistance Team. =MONAHRQ Learning Network= A MONAHRQ Learning Network was organized by AHRQ in 2010. Its purpose was to encourage MONAHRQ adoption and to facilitate communication between MONAHRQ users, potential users, and AHRQ. Activities included a password-protected extranet, discussion forums, webinars, networking and feedback opportunities, and in-person meetings. The Learning Network included 36 participating organizations. The final meeting of the Learning Network was held in early June 2011, and the Network formally ended in June 2011. =MONAHRQ Host User Group= A MONAHRQ Host User Group was organized by AHRQ in June 2012. Its purpose and activities are expected to be similar to the former MONAHRQ Learning Network. Potential new members may express interest in joining by emailing MONAHRQ technical support. =MONAHRQ recognition= MONAHRQ was selected as one of six finalists in the Fall 2010/Winter 2011 round of the HHSinnovates competition. The US Department of Health and Human Services launched this competition in 2010 in order to recognize and encourage innovation within the department. MONAHRQ is also listed as a data tool on the http://www.Healthdata.gov and https://web.archive.org/web/20110423110823/http://www.healthindicators.gov/ websites, both launched in February 2011, under the federal government's current open data initiatives. Because MONAHRQ is a software program that creates web-based hospital performance reports that is used by organizations, often when a MONAHRQ website is made public, the host organization is recognized by media, as opposed to AHRQ. The MONAHRQ project, however, has been directly covered by the media. MONAHRQ Adoption A list of statewide, public MONAHRQ-generated websites can be found at the main MONAHRQ Website. MONAHRQ is currently used for public reporting of healthcare quality in several states. As of December 2014, 13 states have statewide, public MONAHRQ websites. The majority of MONAHRQ Host Users are private users, which may use the software for healthcare quality reporting to members, for data quality assurance, and for internal hospital quality and performance reporting.

Two MACs are explicitly designated under New York law. Best known is the MAC for New York City, created in response to the city's fiscal crisis of the mid-1970s. The corporation was born of a recommendation made by a special panel composed of Simon H. Rifkind, Felix G. Rohatyn, Richard M. Shinn and Donald B. Smiley. The majority of appointees to the corporation‚Äôs board were made by the Governor, initially by New York Governor Hugh Carey. As part of the creation of MAC, the state passed legislation that converted the city‚Äôs sales and stock transfer taxes into state taxes. In 2008, having sold almost $10 billion in bonds to keep the city solvent through its worst fiscal crisis, MAC settled its final accounts and voted itself out of existence.

They believe that they originally lived on Mohdipahar and have descended from the union of Vedbansi prince with a Munda girl. The other view is that a section of the Kurmis were outcastes and came to be known as the Bedia or Wandering Kurmis. The 2011 Census of India for Uttar Pradesh, where they were classified as a Scheduled Caste under the name Beriya, showed their population as 46,775. They speak Awadhi and are found mainly in the districts of Bahraich, Barabanki, Basti, Agra, Faizabad, Gonda and Kanpur. After independence, they were denotified in 1952, when the Criminal Tribes Act was repealed.People of India Uttar Pradesh Volume XLII Part One edited by A Hasan & J C Das pages 235 to 239 Manohar Publications  Origin  They are a nomadic tribe, that had been notified under the Criminal Tribes Act. According to their own traditions, they were originally Rajputs, who lost status, after their defeat at the hands of the Mughals. The community was connected with some bad works, as well as petty theft. According to early British scholars, they were one of the many nomadic tribes found in North India, and were of the same stock as the Rajputs. The word bedia is a corrupt form of the Hindi word behara, which means a forest dweller.  Present circumstances  The Bedia who have settled down in West Bengal, are also known as the Bedia Kudmi, Choto Kudmi or San Kurmi. They speak in Kurmali, an Indo-Aryan language, at home and Bengali for inter-group communication. The Bengali and Devanagari scripts are used. The Bedia are divided into three territorial groupings, the Nathotiya, Jogiara, and Gangaparia. Each of these groups is strictly endogamous. There is also a further division between those who still follow their traditional occupation of bad works and those who are now settled agriculturists. A number of Bedia have given up their nomadic lifestyle, and are now settled agriculturists. However, the majority are mainly sharecroppers and agricultural labourers. Those Bedia who are still engaged in their activity often employ. They live in multi-caste villages. Each of their settlements contains a formal caste council known as biradari panchayat. The panchayat resolves most intra-community disputes. These biradari panchayats are each headed by a headman known as a chaudhary. The position of the chaudhary is hereditary, and these families exercise considerable influence over the community.

The name of the village was originally like the Bach Eberbach, and it has been known as Erbach only since 1313. The name probably originated from the name of a monastery in the same district. It was probably during the 12th century that the community developed into its own district. There has been a magistrate Erbach since 1119, and it has been documented that the town hall and the church Siegel have been in existence since 1429. The detachment from the judicial function of Eltville only took place between 1419 and 1429. Between 1770 and 1816 Erbach seat was one of two Amtsv√∂gte of the Rheingau  Townscape  The intersection of the Rheingau Chaussee with the Rhine crossing and leading to Eberbach path formed in the center square of the medieval settlement to lay a wreath of larger farms.

The fire complex began as two separate fires, the Bear Butte Fire and the Booth Fire. The two fires were reported on the same day and eventually burned together, forming a single fire area that stretched along the crest of the Cascade Mountains between Mount Jefferson and Mount Washington. On the western side of the Cascades, the fire consumed mostly Douglas-fir and western hemlock. On the eastern side of the mountains, the fire burned mostly Ponderosa pine, lodgepole pine, and jack pine. Most of the burned area was on public land administered by the United States Forest Service including within the Mount Jefferson Wilderness. The fire also burned forest land on the Warm Springs Indian Reservation and small areas of state and private land. Firefighters battled the blaze for 34 days. At the peak of the firefighting effort, there were over 2,300 personnel working on the fire. Although the cost of fire suppression was over $38 million, no lives were lost and no homes burned as the fire was largely in wilderness areas.  Origin  The weather in the central Cascade Mountains in the area where the B&B; Complex Fires occurred is highly seasonal and heavily influenced by local topography. In early August 2003, a series of thunderstorms passed over the central Cascades. Lightning strikes were recorded on 4, 5, 6, and 7 August. Over the next several weeks, a number of fires resulted from this lightning activity.\\"Weather\\", B&B; Complex, Oregon Websites and Watersheds Project, www.orww.org, Philomath, Oregon, 2004. Following the storms in early August, local temperatures in central Oregon ranged from 80 to 90 degrees with relative humidity dropping below 20 percent. During this period, winds were to , peaking on 19 August at approximately . This combination of hot dry weather and high winds created extreme fire conditions. As a result, creeping fires ignited by the early August lightning storms began to burn more actively. On 15 August a small fire was reported on the Warm Springs Indian Reservation. On 18 August, two more small fires were reported south of Santiam Pass near Hoodoo Ski Area. All three fires were quickly contained. The B&B; Complex Fires occurred in August and September 2003 in the central Cascades, west of Sisters, Oregon. The fire complex began as two separate wildfires; both were caused by lightning striking in early August. The Bear Butte Fire started at the north end of the Mount Jefferson Wilderness area (), approximately northwest of Sisters. It was reported by a helicopter crew from Warm Springs on 19 August at 1309 PDT. The Booth Fire started near Henkel Butte (), about west of Sisters. It was reported by the Henkel Butte Lookout the same day at 1523 PDT. The next day, the fire suppression efforts on these two fires were consolidated because of their size and proximity, creating the B&B; Complex Fires.\\"B & B Complex Fire\\", Deschutes and Ochoco National Forests, United States Forest Service, United States Department of Agriculture, Bend, Oregon, 11 July 2005.\\"Fire Briefs 08/22/03 to 08/20/03\\" , Historical / Archived Website, Pacific Northwest National Incident Management Team 3, Pacific Northwest Wildfire Coordinating Group, Portland, Oregon, 30 April 2006.\\"B&B; Complex Forest and Fire History\\", Oregon Websites and Watersheds Project, Philomath, Oregon, 4 January 2011.

The team consisted of archaeologists, botanists, geologists, hydrologists, soil scientists, and forest engineers. The team assessed the environmental damage caused by the fire and related fire suppression activities. Following their report the Forest Service allocated $1.5 million for emergency stabilization and recovery of the affected area.\\"Fire Rehabilitation Work Begins on B and B Complex\\", Local Area News Release, Deschutes National Forest, United states Forest Service, United States Department of Agriculture, Sisters, Oregon, 2 October 2003. Crew rehabilitating a fire line in September 2003Shortly after the fire, smokejumpers and professional timber fallers cut hazard snags along Forest Service roads. Approximately 950 fire-killed trees were removed, allowing survey teams and rehabilitation crews to safely conduct their work. The next stage of the recovery work focused on high and moderate severity burn areas where there was an increased risk of runoff damage. Special attention was given to preventing water pollution and soil degradation in the Metolius River watershed. Forest Service crews removed fire debris from the banks of Abbot Creek, Bear Valley Creek, Bush Creek, Canyon Creek, Davis Creek, First Creek, Link Creek, and Jack Creek. They also replaced a number of small culverts with larger ones. This helped minimize drainage onto roads and ensured streams were able to accommodate increases flow from surface runoff. This was especially critical in streams with native bull trout, which are a threatened species. Crews also cleared forest recreation sites and hiking trails. This included a project that improved drainage along of the Pacific Crest Trail in order to reduce surface erosion. Finally, the Forest Service posted 40 new signs warning visitors of post-fire hazards.

To deal with this problem, the Deschutes National Forest implemented a program to prevent the spread of noxious weeds especially along roads, trail, and in heavy use areas. These efforts helped encourage the return of native grasses and herbaceous shrubs throughout the burned areas. In 2005, the Forest Service approved a plan for salvage logging on burned by the B&B; Complex Fires. The plan allowed commercial loggers to harvest trees killed by the fire. There was some criticism of the plan; however, the Forest Service determined that in the specific areas identified for post-fire timber harvest, the prescribed operations would utilize valuable timber assets, prevent the build-up of light fuels in burned areas, and help prevent soil degradation by encouraging rapid reforestation.\\"Decision and Rationale for the Decision\\", B&B; Fire Recovery Project Record of Decision, Sisters Ranger District, Deschutes National Forest, United States Forest Service, United States Department of Agriculture, Sisters, Oregon, August 2005, pp.18-31.\\"B&B; Complex Policy and Management Issues\\", Oregon Websites and Watersheds Project, www.orww.org, hilomath, Oregon, 2004.

The MacDowell Club of Allied Arts of Los Angeles was established in 1918. In Cincinnati, not a club, but the Cincinnati MacDowell Society was founded in 1913, which formed significant ties with the MacDowell Colony. At the peak of their popularity before and during the World War II, about 400 independent clubs functioned in the nation. In 1955, Marian MacDowell wrote in a letter, \\"I suppose in the last forty years there must have been nearly 400; probably there are 300 now.\\" War-time entry of women into the workforce and later social developments decreased the membership, and combined with advances in transportation and communication diminished the role of MacDowell Clubs both as social hubs and entertainment venues. In 2008, fifteen MacDowell Clubs continued to operate, including, in Altus, Oklahoma; Dyersburg, Tennessee; Jackson, Mississippi; Louisville, Kentucky; Canton, Ohio; Chickasha, Oklahoma; Janesville, Wisconsin; and Milwaukee, Wisconsin.For a full list of active MacDowell Clubs as of 2008, see: Yackley, Marian MacDowell and the Macdowell Clubs. p. 97.

A typical small club gathering would feature a privately held meeting with invited talks, piano and vocal solos and duets of local performers.Final Meeting of MacDowell Club, The Lodi Sentinel (Lodi, California), June 8, 1922. Bigger clubs were able to organize academic lectures, concerts, recitals (including Marian MacDowell's or other well-known national performers) and art exhibitions opened to the general public, as well as private dinners, pageants, and balls. Several organizations, including clubs in New York City, Los Angeles, Austin, Illinois, Green Bay, Wisconsin, Canton, Ohio, Chattanooga, Tennessee, Oklahoma City, and Altus, Oklahoma, among others, established student funds and scholarships for youth and developed outreach programs through Junior MacDowell Clubs while continuing to support financially the MacDowell Colony. Several clubs established their own choruses, as in New York City, Boston and Milwaukee; other ‚Äî vocal ensembles. In Boston, the MacDowell Club Orchestra consisting mainly of amateur and semiprofessional female musicians gave performances in Copley Hall; the MacDowell clubs of New York, Milwaukee, and Los Angeles also formed their own orchestras. All employed well-known conductors, such as Georges Longy, and Arthur Fiedler in Boston; in New York, orchestra was formed in 1929, led by David Mannes, a concertmaster of the New York Symphony Orchestra, and held concerts in Madison Square Garden and the Metropolitan Opera House. All clubs were responsible for adopting their own bylaws and acted differently in defining their membership: some were accepting musicians only, as the MacDowell Club of Green Bay in Wisconsin, or the Macdowell Club of Mountain Lakes in New Jersey,Baldwin, Marcella V.

However, most of the MacDowell clubs were \\"female-only organizations.\\" Many clubs joined the National Federation of Music Clubs.  MacDowell Club of New York  The MacDowell Club of New York City was established in 1905 and disbanded in 1942. It was among the biggest clubs by the same name around the country honoring the legacy of Edward MacDowell and supporting the MacDowell Colony, the artists' retreat in Peterborough, New Hampshire. The Club funded and awarded a resident scholarship at the MacDowell Colony and made regular financial contributions.Guide to the MacDowell Club of New York City Records, 1905-1942, New York Historical Society The club charter declared the main goals of the club as following: In a few years the membership of the club grew to 600. Club membership included writers, musicians, performing and visual artists, theate and film actors, sculptors, and architects: Hamlin Garland, Richard Watson Gilder, Edwin Arlington Robinson, James Harvey Robinson, John Dewey, Leonora Speyer, Herbert Adams, Robert Aitken, Hobart Nichols, Irving Ramsey Wiles, Ivan Olinsky, F.

In 1911, the Club moved to a spacious building at 108 W 55th Street,An Art Exhibition Without a Jury System of Award, _The New York Times_ , May 14, 1911 which featured a large vaulted gallery.Richard H. Love, Carl W. Peters: American Scene Painter From Rochester to Rockport, pg. 183, col. 2, University of Rochester Press (1999) In 1924, the MacDowell Club purchased the old converted Marquand stable -- located at 166 East 73rd Street -- from the Joseph Pulitzer estate. Richard Morris Hunt had designed the original building for art collector Henry Gurdon Marquand in 1883. Shortly after Marquand's death in 1902, the building had been sold to Joseph Pulitzer, then publisher of the New York World, who lived several blocks to the east at 73rd and Park. A fire swept the building in 1935 and destroyed prints by Whistler, Hassam and others.On a Block of Stables, an Unexpected Restoration, _The New York Times_ , June 3, 2007 In 1979, the Landmarks Preservation Commission proposed 12 of the 13 stable and garage buildings on the block for designation, excluding the Marquand building. A year later Halina Rosenthal, head of the block association and later founder of the Friends of the Upper East Side Historic Districts, lobbied the commission to include the Marquand stable in the designation, which it did in 1981. = MacDowell Chorus = The MacDowell Chorus was formed in November 1909, under the direction of Kurt Schindler. Two months after its founding, Gustav Mahler, then the conductor of The New York Philharmonic Orchestra, invited the chorus to perform with the orchestra.Gustav Stickley, The MacDowell Chorus, A New Music Development in New York, The Craftsman, Vol. 19, pg. 316, Oct 1910‚ÄìMar 1911, New York In 1912, Schindler changed the name to Schola Cantorum. Schindler continued to conduct the Schola Cantorum until January 1926, when he accepted an offer to take charge of the Roxy Theatre. Hugh Ross later became the director of the chorus. = Student Fund Committee = The MacDowell Club established a scholarship fund to support aspiring talented young artists, and funded a resident scholarship in Professor George Baker's Drama Workshop at Harvard University, and a resident fellowship at the MacDowell Colony. = Notable art exhibitors = In 1911, John W. Alexander, the Club's second president, instituted a revolutionary for the time change by introducing an open exhibition, or no jury policy. Group of artists started to select works for exhibition in the MacDowell Club galleries by themselves. Many talented, but previously unrecognized artists, such as Stuart Davis, Edward Hopper, Yasuo Kuniyoshi, among others, received an opportunity to promote their works. Among the notable art exhibitors were: * Edward Hopper, 1912 * Colin Campbell Cooper, 1912 * George Bellows, 1917 * C.K.

It is endemic to Central Florida, where there are about 100 known populations remaining, many of which are within the bounds of the Ocala National Forest.Center for Plant Conservation The plant has declined in recent decades primarily due to the development of its habitat, which is being converted to urban zones and citrus groves.The Nature Conservancy This is the primary reason that the plant was federally listed as a threatened species in 1987.USFWS. Determination of threatened status for Bonamia grandiflora (Florida bonamia). Federal Register November 2, 1987. This native Florida wildflower is a perennial vine which trails along the ground to a maximum length around 3 meters. There is a deep root and multiple underground stems. The hairy stem is lined with leathery, gray-green leaves up to 5 centimeters long. The inflorescence is a single showy flower borne on a short, erect peduncle. The flower corolla opens in the morning, spreading 7 or 8 centimeters wide and up to 10 centimeters long. It is pale to bright blue- purple with a white throat. At the center of the funnel-shaped corolla are five stamens tipped with yellow anthers. The fruit is a capsule around a centimeter in length containing a few seeds. The plant occurs in Florida scrub habitat on deep, dry, white sand in clearings among sand pines (Pinus clausa) and other scrub flora. Other rare plants in the region include highlands scrub hypericum (Hypericum cumulicola), papery whitlow-wort (Paronychia chartacea), scrub plum (Prunus geniculata), and scrub lupine (Lupinus aridorum). It is adapted to the occasional wildfire that naturally occurs in the scrub habitat. Fire clears brush and heavy forest canopy which shade out the morning glory, providing the clearings that it requires. Fire suppression efforts are generally detrimental to the species. Controlled burns and other methods of clearing excessive vegetation are part of the recovery plan. Where the morning glory is provided appropriate habitat, it can become plentiful and even abundant. It has the capacity to introduce itself into newly cleared, sandy plots and take hold vigorously; however, it does not tolerate much disturbance once established.

In 1984, the old building was closed and a new light was built on Ringflua, a tiny rock in the fjord, just off the shoreline.

He was appointed by Pope Benedict XV on 27 November 1915 and died in office on 11 October 1943. He was the first New Zealander by birth to be made a Catholic bishop.Death of Bishop Brodie, The Press, Tuesday, 12 October 1943, p. 4. He was noted for his interest in promoting the general well-being of all. Early life Brodie was born in Coromandel, New Zealand in 1871. His parents were Irish immigrants to New Zealand. He received his early education in Coromandel and at the \\"Pitt St School\\" (St Peter's School).Sacred Heart College Auckland 75 Year's Jubilee 1903-1978, Auckland, 1978, p. 19. He was then sent to Sydney for his secondary education at St Joseph's College, Hunters Hill and he then trained as a priest at St Patrick's College, Manly where one of his professors was Michael Verdon. He was ordained a priest for the Diocese of Auckland in St Patrick's Cathedral, Auckland by Bishop Lenihan on 20 December 1896. Priesthood Brodie first served as curate at St Benedict's Church, Newton, Auckland and then at the village of Puhoi. He was the first Parish Priest at Waihi. Brodie was at Waihi at the time of the 1912 Waihi miners' strike and he made personal efforts which contributed to its settlement.\\"The Late Bishop Brodie: Requiem Mass celebrated\\", The Press, Friday 15 October 1943, p. 6 He was effective because he was respected by all the parties.\\"Death Claims a Great Prelate\\", Zealandia, 14 October 1943, pp. 1 and 6 After leaving Waihi, he was Administrator at St Patrick's Cathedral and then Parish Priest at Parnell.

Episcopacy Brodie was consecrated a bishop on 27 February 1916 in the Cathedral of the Blessed Sacrament, Christchurch by the Apostolic delegate, Cardinal Cerretti, assisted by Archbishop Redwood and Bishop Verdon. His appointment there was received with joy. However, as the first secular bishop in what had been regarded as a Marist diocese, he had lengthy disputes with Marist superiors about the order's tenure of parishes. His relations with individual Marists, however, were at all times courteous.Michael King, God's Farthest Outpost: A History of Catholics in New Zealand, Penguin Books, Auckland, 1997, p. 142 Brodie was notable for his keen interest and support of Catholic education, especially of St Bede's College, Christchurch. Brodie also supported Nazareth House and the Sisters of the Good Shepherd at Mt Magdala, especially their orphanage of St Joseph. Brodie introduced the Carmelite nuns to Christchurch and he advanced the Holy Name Society, the Legion of Mary and the Catholic Women's League. He also encouraged the establishment of the Grail movement for women. Brodie proved to be a popular, long-serving and hard-working prelate in Christchurch. Public concern As Bishop, Brodie always \\"showed himself in the front rank in any movement connected with the well-being of the community in general\\". This was especially in the context of the Great depression. He also supported the Order of St John. Brodie, cooperating with the Anglican Archbishop West-Watson, mediated to promote the settlement of the Tramway Strike of 1932. He met with the parties till dawn in working for a peaceful settlement. In 1935, he was awarded the King George V Silver Jubilee Medal.

The aircraft is no longer offered on the company website and seems to be out of production. Design and development The Talon was developed from the Maxair Drifter and introduced into the market in 1989. The aircraft shares the Drifter's main fuselage tube, used as the aircraft's spine. The rudder pedals attach to the front of the tube, the seat and wing support structure to the center and the tail to the rear of the tube. The main improvements over the original Drifter include strut-braced wings with jury struts, flaps, streamlined baggage area, optional enclosed cockpit, wheel pants and brakes. The addition of many options and extras over the basic Drifter design means that the Talon cannot be constructed in the US FAR 103 Ultralight Vehicles category, due to exceeding the maximum category empty weight and must instead be registered as a homebuilt aircraft in the USA. In other countries, such as Canada, the Talon fits the ultralight or microlight aircraft category. The aircraft's structure is made from 6061-T6 aluminum, with the main landing gear struts of 4130 steel. The aluminum frame wing is covered in pre-sewn Dacron envelopes. Construction time from the kit is reported as 120 hours. The basic Talon design has been developed into a series of single and tandem two seaters, with varying powerplants.

Civil War and death On June 16, 1864, on a freight hauling trip to Piedras Negras, Coahuila, Martin and his niece's husband Eugene Frantzen had gold hidden beneath a load of bacon. They were ambushed at Eagle Pass and hanged by deserters from the Confederate States Army. His wife was informed of the incident and recovered the bodies. When she moved back to Fredericksburg, she had the bodies buried in a common grave in Der Stadt Friedhof. In 1971, Martin's home was moved to the National Ranching Heritage Center. Personal life Martin married Elisabet Arhelger. She emigrated with her family from Rittershausen, on the Hershel October 16, 1845.Hershel, November 23, 1844, Galveston Historical Foundation Immigration DatabasePioneers in God's Hills (1960), P.240 The family was of the Catholic faith, and services were sometimes held in their home. The couple had eight children. Their daughter Hedwig was the first white child born in Fredericksburg.

Background & education Arthur Frederick Parker-Rhodes was born in Newington, Yorkshire on 21 November 1914. He was educated at Marlborough College and Magdalene College, Cambridge, from where he graduated in 1934 and subsequently received his PhD. Being of independent means, he was able to pursue a variety of interests. He married author and political activist Damaris Parker-Rhodes and the couple earned a reputation as \\"bohemians\\" and eccentrics. They were both members of the Communist Party (Klaus Fuchs stayed with them in Cambridge, Alan Nunn May was a local friend), they became disillusioned with communism and in 1948 joined the Society of Friends. They had three boys (one of whom died aged 12) and a daughter, Oriole. Plant pathology and mycology During the Second World War, Parker-Rhodes worked as a plant pathologist at Long Ashton Research Station from where he published a series of research papers on the mechanism of fungicidal actions. His personal interest, however, was in the larger fungi, particularly agarics (mushrooms and toadstools), and he was a familiar figure at forays of the British Mycological Society in the 1940s and 1950s. He even published a statistical survey of these forays. For nearly 30 years Parker-Rhodes tutored a course on fungi at the Flatford Mill Field Studies Centre in Suffolk and, in 1950, published a popular book, Fungi, friends and foes.Fungi, friends and foes Paul Elek (1950) Subsequently, he produced papers studying the kinetics of fairy rings and a series surveying the larger fungi of Skokholm, an island off the western coast of Wales. He described several taxa new to science, including the species now known as Trechispora clanculare (Park.-Rhodes) K.H. Larss. which he found in a puffin burrow. Mathematical linguistics and computer science Parker-Rhodes was an accomplished linguist and was able to read at least 23 languages, claiming that they became \\"easier after the first half- dozen\\". He was introduced to Chinese and formal linguistic syntax by Michael Halliday at Cambridge. Parker-Rhodes was also a mathematician, with a particular interest in statistics and applications of lattice theory. Both these areas of expertise were of use to him when he joined the Cambridge Language Research Unit, an independent research centre established in 1955 by Margaret Masterman. The unit was said to house \\"an extraordinary collection of eccentrics\\" engaged in research on language and computing, including information retrieval. Parker-Rhodes' colleagues at CLRU included Roger Needham, Karen Sp√§rck Jones, Ted Bastin, Stuart Linney, and Yorick Wilks. Parker-Rhodes was \\"an original thinker in information retrieval, quantum mechanics and computational linguistics.\\" He wrote A Sequential Logic for Information Structuring in \\"Mathematics of a Hierarchy of Brouwerian Operations\\" with Yorick Wilks (Fort Belvoir Defense Technical Information Center 01 MAY 1965). Parker-Rhodes also co-authored papers with Needham on the \\"theory of clumps\\" in relation to information retrieval and computational linguistics. He wrote a book on language structure and the logic of descriptions, Inferential Semantics, published in 1978.Inferential Semantics, Humanities Press (1978) The work analyzes sentences and longer passages into mathematical lattices (the kind in Lattice Theory, not crystal lattices) which are semantic networks. These are inferred not only from sentence syntax but also from grammatical focus and sometimes prosody. Each node the network is a concept in one or more structured conceptual dimensions (called base domains, which are also lattice structures); this places a description into a resulting abstract lattice of possible descriptions, ordered from general to specific. This structure can be used for automated inference in artificial intelligence and machine translation. He factors some of the dimensions (base domains, like a quantifier lattice, a (deep) case lattice, et al.) into sublattice-factors. Division of the lattice of possible descriptions into factors acts to divide- and-conquer the abstract lattice of all possible descriptions into simpler, independent semantic \\"factors\\" or \\"dimensions\\". Physics In physics, he is remembered partly for his founding contribution to combinatorial physics, based on his elucidation of \\"combinatorial hierarchy\\", a mathematical structure of bit-strings generated by an algorithm based on discrimination (exclusive-or between bits). He published some of his ideas in fundamental physics (based on a logical \\"level below physics\\") in the book The Theory of Indistinguishables (1981).The Theory of Indistinguishables: A Search for Explanatory Principles below the level of Physics, Springer (1981) It identifies a logic based on adding to equality and inequality a third fundamental relationship which is neither one: indistinguishability-in- principle. For example, even with infinite knowledge, the three dimensions of a completely empty space are totally indistinguishable from one another, but they are still three, not one (contradicting Leibniz's Identity of Indiscernibles). It applies to cases of total symmetry. This logic is used to develop particle physics (see indistinguishability) and explain quantum phenomena. At the time of his death, Parker-Rhodes was completing his last book, The Inevitable Universe, which combines elements of metaphysics with mathematics, resulting in actual physics. It claims that one can infer various facts of modern physics solely by using logic and mathematics with very few assumptions. Most simply, Statement 1. \\"Something exists.\\", and Statement 2. \\"Statement 1. conveys no information.\\" lead to the rest. The universe and much of its fundamental physics are inevitable (they are derivable a priori ), not contingent, empirical or a happenstance. He says that this theory is inconsistent with, among other things, the anthropic principle. The manuscript has been exchanged for years among interested physicists and others, and cited, but as of 2017 it remained unedited and unpublished. He was a member of the Alternative Natural Philosophy Association, a group of physicists and mathematicians who met up in Cambridge in the 1960s and created a semi-formal association in 1979. Other key members included H. Pierre Noyes, Ted Bastin, Clive W. Kilmister, and John Amson. The association sponsored an annual series of Parker-Rhodes memorial lectures, the first being given by John Amson in 1987. His Times obituarist, Ted Bastin, says of Parker-Rhodes' personality and scientific contribution: \\"One must say, in sum, that Parker-Rhodes leaves us with an enigma ‚Äì a situation to which he brought his characteristic gentle and slightly amused acquiescence.\\". Spiritual and other writings Parker-Rhodes had published a pamphlet, Wholesight: The Spirit Quest (1978), that explored mythical tales and parables in an attempt to bring science and religion together. He also produced a long poem, The Myth of the Rock, of a spiritual nature. His daughter, Oriole Parker-Rhodes, has electronically published some of the stories he told to his children, entitled Tales from the Sink. That and the Myth of the Rock are available free online at Archive.org. The library of the Society of Friends in London holds a typescript of: The Wheel of Creation : An essay in Wholesight, towards a coherent model of the place of mankind in the cosmos\\" \\"The wheel of Creation\\" ‚Äì found in Catalogue of the Library of the Society of Friends.

It is located northwest of Ajo, Arizona. It was closed in 1969 by the Air Force, and the radar site turned over to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). Today the site is part of the Joint Surveillance System (JSS), designated by NORAD as Western Air Defense Sector (WADS) Ground Equipment Facility J-29A. History Ajo Air Force Station came into existence as part of Phase III of the Air Defense Command Mobile Radar program. On October 20, 1953 ADC requested a third phase of twenty-five radar sites be constructed. Ajo was one of the most expensive ADC radar stations to be constructed, with costs mounting to approximately $7.4 million for 100 structures located within housing, cantonment, operations, ground-air transmitter-receiver (GATR) areas. This site became active in January 1958 with the 612th Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron being assigned to the new station under 34th Air Division. Initially, 612th AC&W; Squadron operated AN/FPS-20A and AN/FPS-6 radars, and initially the station functioned as a Ground-Control Intercept (GCI) and warning station. As a GCI station, the squadron's role was to guide interceptor aircraft toward unidentified intruders picked up on the unit's radar scopes. The Ground Air Transmitting Receiving (GATR) Site for communications was located at , approximately 0.8 miles north-northwest from the main site. Normally the GATR site was connected by a pair of buried telephone cables, with a backup connection of dual telephone cables overhead. The Coordinate Data Transmitting Set (CDTS) (AN/FST-2) at the main site converted each radar return into a digital word which was transmitted by the GATR via microwave to the Control Center. During 1961 Ajo AFS joined the Semi Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE) system, feeding data to DC-21 at Luke AFB, Arizona. After joining, the squadron was re-designated as the 612th Radar Squadron (SAGE) on 15 October 1961. The radar squadron provided information 24/7 the SAGE Direction Center where it was analyzed to determine range, direction altitude speed and whether or not aircraft were friendly or hostile. On 31 July 1963, the site was redesignated as NORAD ID Z-181. By 1963 an AN/FPS-7C had assumed search duties, and height-finder radar chores were being performed by AN/FPS-6A and AN/FPS-26 radars. On 31 July 1963, the site was redesignated as NORAD ID Z-181. In addition to the main facility, Ajo operated an AN/FPS-14 Gap Filler site: * Covered Wells, AZ (TM-181B): The 612th Radar Squadron was inactivated on December 31, 1969. Housing units were moved to Gila Bend, and the remaining buildings were abandoned. After the site's closure, the buildings and other structures of the former Ajo AFS sat abandoned and deteriorated for decades. Today, all buildings and structures of the original Air Force Station, except for the AN/FPS-26 height-finder radar tower, have been removed. The National Park Service demolished the station site in 1994 and restored it to its natural state, including removal of thee concrete building pads. A minimal Air Force and FAA presence was kept to operate some instrumentation and radio- signal relay equipment. The radar site has since re-opened as a Joint Surveillance System (JSS) FAA facility (J-29A) replacing the JSS site at Humboldt Mountain (Phoenix), AZ. It operates an ARSR-4 radar and a communications site for the Barry M. Goldwater USAF Range (formerly known as Luke-Williams Range). The former Air Force radar site also hosts an Air Combat Maneuvering Instrumentation (ACMI) antenna on top of old AN/FPS-26 radar tower.

The group established its base camp on a farm across the √ëancahuaz√∫ river, a seasonal tributary of the Rio Grande, 250 kilometers southwest of the city of Santa Cruz de la Sierra. The guerrilla was intended to work as a foco, a point of armed resistance to be used as a first step to overthrow the Bolivian government and create a socialist state. The guerrillas defeated several Bolivian patrols before they were beaten and Guevara was captured and executed. Only five guerrillas managed to survive and flee to Chile. Background =Congo Crisis= Che Guevara at his basecamp holding a local African infant and standing next to a fellow Afro-Cuban soldier in the Congo during the Congo Crisis, 1965. Che Guevara was committed to ending American imperialism, and he decided to travel to the Congo during its civil war to back the anti- capitalist guerrilla groups. Guevara's aim was to export the revolution by instructing local anti-Mobutu Simba fighters in Marxist ideology and foco theory strategies of guerrilla warfare. In his Congo Diary, he cites the incompetence, intransigence and infighting of the local Congolese forces as key reasons for the insurgency's failure.Ireland's Own 2000. On November 20, 1965, in ill health with dysentery, suffering from acute asthma, and disheartened after seven months of frustrations and inactivity, Guevara left the Congo with the Cuban survivors (six members of his 12-man column had died). At one point, Guevara considered sending the wounded back to Cuba, and fighting in Congo alone until his death, as an ideological example. After being urged by his comrades and pressed by two emissaries sent by Castro, at the last moment, Guevara reluctantly agreed to leave Africa. In speaking about his experience in the Congo months later, Guevara concluded that he left rather than fight to the death because: \\"The human element for the revolution in the Congo had failed. The people have no will to fight. The revolutionary leaders are corrupt. In simple words... there was nothing to do.\\"Kellner 1989, p. 87. A few weeks later, when writing the preface to the diary he kept during the Congo venture, he began: \\"This is the story of a failure.\\"Guevara 2000, p. 1. At a meeting in Madrid, Juan Per√≥n, who was sympathetic to Guevara but disapproved of Guevara's choice of guerrilla warfare as antiquated, warned Guevara about starting operations in Bolivia. Guerrilla operations Guevara as \\"Adolfo Mena Gonz√°lez\\" in 1966. Guevara to the place where he was shot. Today it is a tourist circuit. Che Guevara entered Bolivia with the pseudonym \\"Adolfo Mena Gonz√°lez\\" on November 3, 1966. Three days later, he left the capital city of La Paz for the countryside. He planned to organize a foco with Bolivia as his target. Planning to start a guerrilla campaign against the military government of President Ren√© Barrientos, he assembled a band of 29 Bolivians, 25 Cubans, and a few foreigners which included Guevara himself, one woman from East Germany named Tamara Bunke, and three Peruvians. This small but well-armed group carried out two successful ambushes against two army patrols in the spring of 1967, but failed to gain significant support from fellow opposition groups in Bolivia's cities or from local civilians, some of whom willingly informed the authorities of the guerrilla's movements. By mid 1967, Guevara's men soon became fugitives, hunted down by Bolivian special forces and their American advisers. In the last few months of the venture, Guevara wrote in his diary that: \\"Talking to these peasants is like talking to statues. They do not give us any help. Worse still, many of them are turning into informants.\\" On August 31, 1967, a small group of Guevara's soldiers, totaling eight men as well as Tamara Bunke, were ambushed and killed by Bolivian soldiers while they were attempting to cross the Rio Grande in Bolivia. On October 8, 1967, most of Guevara's surviving soldiers were surrounded and destroyed as a fighting force. Still, some were still active across Bolivia during the rest of October and November 1967. Barrientos was very concerned with Guevara's rising insurgency there, and clamped down in the area with some very heavy-handed measures (such as the Massacre of San Juan). Guevara felt that such an atrocity by the Bolivian Army and Air Force would be the tipping point in his favour in rallying the miners to his Communist cause, but eventually the miners signed with government-owned mining company, COMIBOL, an agreement which Guevara felt undermined his reason for being there. =Crackdown= F√©lix Rodr√≠guez, a Cuban exile turned CIA Special Activities Division operative, advised Bolivian troops during the hunt for Guevara in Bolivia.Shadow Warrior: The CIA Hero of 100 Unknown Battles, Felix Rodriguez and John Weisman, Simon & Schuster, October 1989. In addition, the 2007 documentary My Enemy's Enemy, directed by Kevin Macdonald, alleges that Nazi war criminal Klaus Barbie aka \\"The Butcher of Lyon\\", advised and possibly helped the CIA orchestrate Guevara's eventual capture.Barbie \\"Boasted of Hunting Down Che\\" by David Smith, The Observer, December 23, 2007. On October 7, a local informant apprised the Bolivian Special Forces of the location of Guevara's guerrilla encampment in the Yuro ravine.Green Beret Behind the Capture of Che Guevara by Richard Gott, The Age, September 8, 2010 On October 8, they encircled the area with 1,800 soldiers, and Guevara was wounded and taken prisoner while leading a detachment with Simeon Cuba Sarabia. Che biographer Jon Lee Anderson reports Bolivian Sergeant Bernardino Huanca's account: that a twice wounded Guevara, his gun rendered useless, shouted \\"Do not shoot! I am Che Guevara and worth more to you alive than dead.\\"Anderson 1997, p. 733. Guevara was tied up and taken to a dilapidated mud schoolhouse in the nearby village of La Higuera on the night of October 8. For the next half day, Guevara refused to be interrogated by Bolivian officers and would only speak quietly to Bolivian soldiers. One of those Bolivian soldiers, helicopter pilot Jaime Nino de Guzman, describes Che as looking \\"dreadful\\". According to de Guzman, Guevara was shot through the right calf, his hair was matted with dirt, his clothes were shredded, and his feet were covered in rough leather sheaths. Despite his haggard appearance, he recounts that \\"Che held his head high, looked everyone straight in the eyes and asked only for something to smoke.\\" De Guzman states that he \\"took pity\\" and gave him a small bag of tobacco for his pipe, with Guevara then smiling and thanking him.\\"The Man Who Buried Che\\" by Juan O. Tamayo, Miami Herald, September 19, 1997. Later on the night of October 8, Guevara, despite having his hands tied, kicked Bolivian Officer Captain Espinosa into the wall, after the officer entered the schoolhouse in order to snatch Guevara's pipe from his mouth as a souvenir. In another instance of defiance, Guevara spat in the face of Bolivian Rear Admiral Ugarteche shortly before his execution. The following morning on October 9, Guevara asked to see the \\"maestra\\" (school teacher) of the village, 22-year-old Julia Cortez. Cortez would later state that she found Guevara to be an \\"agreeable looking man with a soft and ironic glance\\" and that during their short conversation she found herself \\"unable to look him in the eye\\", because his \\"gaze was unbearable, piercing, and so tranquil.\\" During their short conversation, Guevara pointed out to Cortez the poor condition of the schoolhouse, stating that it was \\"anti-pedagogical\\" to expect campesino students to be educated there, while \\"government officials drive Mercedes cars\\" ... declaring \\"that's what we are fighting against.\\" Later that morning on October 9, Bolivian President Ren√© Barrientos ordered that Guevara be killed. The order was relayed by F√©lix Rodr√≠guez to the Bolivian army unit holding Guevara, reportedly despite the US government's desire that Guevara be taken to Panama for further interrogation.Grant 2007 The executioner was Mario Ter√°n, a sergeant in the Bolivian army who had requested to shoot Che on the basis of the fact that three of his friends from B Company, all named \\"Mario\\", had been killed in an earlier firefight with Guevara's band of guerrillas.Taibo 1999, p. 267. To make the bullet wounds appear consistent with the story the government planned to release to the public, F√©lix Rodr√≠guez ordered Ter√°n not to shoot Guevara in the head, but to aim carefully to make it appear that Guevara had been killed in action during a clash with the Bolivian army.Grant 2007. Ren√© Barrientos has never revealed his motives for ordering the summary execution of Guevara. Gary Prado, the Bolivian captain in command of the army company that captured Guevara, said that the possible reasons Barrientos ordered the immediate execution of Guevara is so there would be no possibility that Guevara would escape from prison, and also so there would be no drama in regard to a trial.Almudevar, Lola. \\"Bolivia marks capture, execution of 'Che' Guevara 40 years ago.\\" San Francisco Chronicle. Tuesday October 9, 2007. Retrieved on November 7, 2009. Before Guevara was executed he was asked by a Bolivian soldier if he was thinking about his own immortality. \\"No\\", he replied, \\"I'm thinking about the immortality of the revolution.\\"Time magazine 1970. A few minutes later, Sergeant Ter√°n entered the hut and ordered the other soldiers out. Alone with Ter√°n, Che Guevara then stood up and spoke to his executioner: \\"I know you've come to kill me.\\" Ter√°n pointed his M2 carbine at Guevara, but hesitated in which Guevara spat at Ter√°n which were his last words: \\"Shoot, coward! You are only going to kill a man!\\"Anderson 1997, p. 739. Ter√°n then opened fire, hitting Guevara in the arms and legs. For a few seconds, Guevara writhed on the ground, apparently biting one of his wrists to avoid crying out. Ter√°n then fired several times again, wounding him fatally in the chest at 1:10 pm, according to Rodr√≠guez. In all, Guevara was shot by Ter√°n nine times. This included five times in the legs, once in the right shoulder and arm, once in the chest, and finally in the throat. Months earlier, during his last public declaration to the Tricontinental Conference,Message to the Tricontinental A letter sent by Che Guevara from his jungle camp in Bolivia, to the Tricontinental Solidarity Organisation in Havana, Cuba, in the Spring of 1967. Guevara wrote his own epitaph, stating \\"Wherever death may surprise us, let it be welcome, provided that this our battle cry may have reached some receptive ear and another hand may be extended to wield our weapons.\\"Obituary: Che Guevara, Marxist Architect of Revolution by Richard Bourne, The Guardian, October 11, 1967 Aftermath After he was killed, Guevara's body was lashed to the landing skids of a helicopter and flown to nearby Vallegrande, where photographs were taken of him lying on a concrete slab in the laundry room of the Nuestra Se√±ora de Malta.Almudevar 2007 and Gott 2005. As hundreds of local residents filed past the body, many of them considered Guevara's corpse to represent a \\"Christ-like\\" visage, with some of them even surreptitiously clipping locks of his hair as divine relics.Casey 2009, p. 179. Such comparisons were further extended when two weeks later upon seeing the post- mortem photographs, English art critic John Berger observed that they resembled two famous paintings: Rembrandt's The Anatomy Lesson of Dr. Nicolaes Tulp and Andrea Mantegna's Lamentation over the Dead Christ.Casey 2009, p. 183. There were also four correspondents present when Guevara's body arrived in Vallegrande, including Bjorn Kumm of the Swedish Aftonbladet, who described the scene in a November 11, 1967, exclusive for The New Republic.The Death of Che Guevara by Bjorn Kumm, The New Republic, Originally published on November 11, 1967. Bolivia had defeated its last major insurgency to date. President Barrientos himself died on April 27, 1969, in a helicopter crash. Most of Guevara's men were killed, wounded, or captured in the campaign. On February 17, 1968 five surviving guerrillas, three Cubans and two Bolivians, managed to get to Chile. There they were detained by policing carabiniers and sent to Iquique. On February 22, the guerrillas applied for asylum. While in Iquique they were visited by Salvador Allende, then president of the senate of Chile. After the guerrilla's meeting with Allende and other prominent leftist politicians the interior minister of the Christian Democrat government Edmundo P√©rez Zujovic decided to expel the guerrillas from Chile. Due to problems in obtaining transit visas the journey to Cuba was done via Tahiti and New Zealand.Salvador Allende, internacionalista. Punto Final. May 16, 2008. After the failure of Guevara's guerrilla, radical leftists in Bolivia began to organize again to set up guerrilla resistance in 1970 in what is known today as the Teoponte Guerrilla. Fernando G√≥mez, a former member of the √ëancahuaz√∫ Guerrilla, led the formation of Salvador Allende's informal bodyguard prior to the 1970 Chilean presidential election. By the time of the election, the bodyguard had expanded with the addition of more ex-√ëancahuaz√∫ Guerrillas volunteering to provide security to Allende and, later, members of the Revolutionary Left Movement (MIR). On one of Allende's first public appearances after his inauguration, a Chilean journalist inquired of the president who the armed men were accompanying him, to which Allende replied \\"a group of personal friends\\", giving the group the moniker from which it would thereafter be known.

In 1923‚Äì24 Goodner recorded six sides for Ajax Records in New York City. Some of these recordings are notable because they reveal a contradiction in the roles women sang about playing in early blues.

Sandplains are quite flat. There may be dune systems, and given time and the right conditions these may form eolianite ridges, but other than that there is little to give a sandplain any topographical character. Inland sandplains are often extremely infertile, because the sand is often low in nutrients when deposited, plus the good drainage means any nutrients are rapidly leached away. Coastal sandplains in intertidal zones like those seen in the Wadden Sea in western Europe for example, are wet with nutrients added continuously, so they can often support a very rich and important fauna of birds, worms, mussels, etc.. In North America, sandplains are often vegetated by pine barrens. In Western Australia, kwongan is the dominant vegetation.

Repertoires can be transitory; consider the disappearance of rough music, popular in the 18th century Great Britain. railway lines leading to a coal mine to limit climate change (Ende Gel√§nde 2016). Repertoire of contention refers, in social movement theory, to the set of various protest- related tools and actions available to a movement or related organization in a given time frame.  Description  Repertoires are often shared between social actors; as one group (organization, movement, etc.) finds a certain tool or action successful, in time, it is likely to spread to others. However, in addition to providing options, repertoires can be seen as limiting, as people tend to focus on familiar tools and actions, and innovation outside their scope is uncommon (see diffusion of innovations). Actions and tools that belong to common repertoires of contention include, but are not limited to: creation of special-purpose associations and coalitions, public meetings, solemn processions, vigils, rallies, demonstrations, sit-ins, petition drives, statements to and in public media, boycotts, strikes and pamphleteering. Repertoires change over time, and can vary from place to place. They are determined both by what the actors know how to do, and what is expected from them. Early repertoires, from the time before the rise of the modern social movement, included food riots and banditry. The changing nature of repertoires of contention can be seen in a sample element of the mid-18th century British repertoire of contention, the rough music: a humiliating and loud public punishment inflicted upon one or more people who have violated the standards of the rest of the community. For yet another example, consider that in the recent years, Internet-focused repertoires have been developed (see hacktivism). Recent scholarship has introduced a notion that in addition to the \\"traditional\\" and \\"modern\\" repertoires, a new, \\"digital\\", repertoire may be emerging. In the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic modes of contention at the intersection of physical and digital evolved, described by Yunus Berndt as peopleless protests. While the term is used most often in the social movement theory context, it can be applied to any political actors. Repertoires of contention also existed before the birth of the modern social movement (a period most scholars identify as the late 18th to early 19th century). The term is attributed to Charles Tilly.

Three Presidents belonging to the Concordance (Agust√≠n Justo, Roberto Ortiz, and Ram√≥n Castillo) were in power from 1931 to 1943, a period known in Argentina as the \\"Infamous Decade.\\" Overview =Formation of the alliance= A coup d'√©tat deposed the aging President Hip√≥lito Yrigoyen on September 6, 1930. His country's first leader elected via universal suffrage (though without the participation of women), Yrigoyen had strained alliances within his own centrist Radical Civic Union (UCR) through frequent interventions against unwillful governors and had set business powerhouses such as Standard Oil against him through his support of YPF, the state-owned oil concern founded in 1922.Todo Argentina: Yrigoyen Staging its first coup since 1861, the Argentine military, then dominated by conservative, rural interests, called on Jos√© F√©lix Uriburu, a retired general and member of the Supreme War Council, to assume the role of Provisional President. The ailing Uriburu called general elections for November 1931.Todo Argentina: Uriburu Generals Uriburu and Justo formed the Concordance with right-wing politicians who shared their distrust of the electorate. Yrigoyen's opponents within the UCR during the 1920s, who referred to themselves as \\"Antipersonalists\\" (in reference to their belief that the populist leader was advancing a personality cult) became divided by the 1930 coup. Opponents of the coup itself would support former President Marcelo Torcuato de Alvear, while more conservative UCR figures supported former Senate President Leopoldo Melo. These latter, in turn, joined Conservative and Democratic leaders (successors of the National Autonomist Party (PAN) that had controlled Argentine politics from 1874 to 1916) following a meeting in the Hotel Castelar in downtown Buenos Aires, and the resulting agreement became known as the \\"Concordance.\\"Luna, F√©lix. El antipersonalismo. Academia Nacional de Ciencias Morales y pol√≠ticas, 2004. Enjoying President Uriburu's support, the Concordance did not run as such, but rather on the National Democratic ticket, as well as a number of smaller ones. Initially rejected by Yrigoyen's supporters and moderates alike, National Democrats openly defended the 1930 coup, arguing that the country's social, economic and institutional fabric had been at risk of unraveling.Rock, David. Authoritarian Argentina. University of California Press, 1993. Their opposition initially rallied behind Alvear's UCR Renewal Front. Uriburu, however, had him deported, and with his supporters' boycott of the election, opposition to the Concordance organized behind the Civil Alliance (the Democratic Progressive Party (PDP) and the Socialist Party). Melo and other Concordance chose as their standard-bearer General Agust√≠n Justo, who was not from the landed oligarchy to which most Concordance leaders belonged, and had been President Alvear's War Minister. Uriburu employed less pretense, however, and established the Argentine Civic Legion, an armed fascist organization, to intimidate the opposition. Amid widespread irregularities, Justo was elected, and took office in February 1932. Much of Justo's cabinet reflected the alliances that had created the Concordance: * Former C√≥rdoba Governor Julio Roca was the son of the late PAN leader, Julio A. Roca, and had led the Democratic Party. He would now serve as Vice President. * Leopoldo Melo, the Antipersonalist leader, was handed the powerful Interior Ministry, which oversaw law enforcement and the administration of elections, among other key functions. * Ram√≥n Castillo, a feudal landowner and old-line PAN Conservative, was named Minister of Justice. * Antonio de Tomaso and Federico Pinedo, founders of the splinter Independent Socialist Party, were appointed ministers of Agriculture and the Economy, respectively.Rock, David. Argentina: 1516 ‚Äî 1982. University of California Press, 1987. =Legacy= The Concordance was organized by leaders with agricultural interests, and owed its existence in no small measure to Standard Oil and other trusts (which lobbied the Argentine military for a coup against Yrigoyen).Wirth, John. The Oil Business in Latin America. Beard Books, 2001 The regime's economic policies were more pragmatic than these ties might have suggested, however, and reflected both nationalism, as well as a priority on recovering the Argentine economy from the effects of the Great Depression (GDP fell by one fourth between 1929 and 1932).Lewis, Paul. The Crisis of Argentine Capitalism. University of North Carolina Press, 1990. The new headquarters of the Ministry of Public Works reflected an emphasis on development projects. Tax, tariff and trade policies were formulated to reduce the public debt, to discourage the import of consumer goods, and to secure bilateral trade agreements with nations best positioned to supply Argentina with the capital goods needed for industrialization. The goal of import substitution industrialization guided these and other domestic policies, including a more conciliatory stance towards labor unions than had been expected when Uriburu left office. Uriburu's deep cuts in public works and other spending were, likewise, reversed. The National Highway Bureau, commodity Regulatory Boards (Juntas) and the Central Bank were established. The economy recovered from the depression, albeit slowly, and by 1943, value added by manufacturing exceeded that of agriculture for the first time in the historically agrarian country's history. The Concordance administration also practiced client politics for traditionally powerful interests in Argentina, however. Railways and abattoirs with ties to the government were left unregulated, and national interests were to some extent subordinated to those of the British Empire. Among the era's most controversial policies in this regard was the Roca-Runciman Treaty, which exempted British imports from protectionist barriers applied to other suppliers', penalized local competitors of the Anglo-Argentine Tramway service, and mandated the deposit, in escrow at the Bank of England, of any Argentine surpluses earned in the bilateral trade, while freeing restrictions on the repatriation of factor income earned by British firms in Argentina. Though founded by agrarian interests, the Concordance encouraged industrialization, and courted the labor vote. The regime was authoritarian in numerous ways. The chief party in opposition in the regime's early years, the Democratic Progressive Party (PDP), was repeatedly denied victories at the provincial and congressional level alike. Certain abuses, such as the use of presidential \\"intervention\\" to remove opposition governors, had become routine in Argentine politics; indeed, the deposed Yrigoyen ordered no less than 18 gubernatorial removals during his tenure (including numerous ones from his own party).Intervenciones federales durante la primera presidencia de Hip√≥lito Yrigoyen The Concordance regime resorted to unprecedented electoral fraud, however, and where ballot stuffing, voter intimidation, the arrest of voting precinct officials, and violence were not employed to guarantee Concordance majorities, results could be annulled (as occurred in Buenos Aires and Santa Fe Province, the nation's two largest at the time). At least one political assassination took place, as well (that of Senator Enzo Bordabehere).Todo Argentina: Fraude Patriotico Historia Politica: Antipersonalismo en Santa Fe Justo sought a patina of legitimacy over his government, and made a gentlemen's agreement with Alvear in 1935, whereby the UCR leader could return to Argentina and campaign for the presidency on fair terms. The 1937 elections, however, included the names of so many deceased that, according to one observer, \\"democracy was extended to the hereafter,\\"Cronista and the Concordance candidate, Roberto Mar√≠a Ortiz, was handily elected. One of the beneficiaries of the system, Buenos Aires Governor Manuel Fresco, was himself removed by President Ortiz at the behest of ultraconservatives.Walter, Richard. The Province of Buenos Aires and Argentine Politics, 1912-1943. Cambridge University Press, 2002. This practice, made explicitly illegal by the S√°enz Pe√±a Law of 1912, was openly defended by numerous Concordance figures, who believed it to be the only alternative to mob rule. The rhetoric used in its defense caused the policy to become known by a term of bitter humor coined by activist Deodoro Roca: \\"patriotic fraud.\\"Caras y Caretas: el fraude patri√≥tico (1939) The Concordance administration ended when, on June 4, 1943, President Ram√≥n Castillo's decision to be succeeded by Salta Province Governor Robustiano Patr√≥n Costas (who, like Castillo, represented feudal interests), resulted in the former's military overthrow.

The ship's complement was 224 officers and ratings.Lenton, p. 169 The ships mounted six 4.7-inch (120 mm) Mark XI guns in twin-gun mounts, two superfiring in front of the bridge and one aft of the superstructure. The aft torpedo tubes were replaced by a single QF 4-inch Mk V anti-aircraft gun. Their light anti-aircraft suite was composed of one quadruple mount for 2-pounder \\"pom- pom\\" guns, two single Oerlikon 20 mm cannon and two quadruple and two twin mounts for 0.5 inch Vickers Mark III anti-aircraft machinegun.

It was first described and named in 1964 by Zakharov. The material consisted of a series of four-toed footprints about long and wide found in Cenomanian sediments at Tajikistan, noting that they were made by a bipedal four-toed dinosaur and not a quadrupedal animal. More later, in 2006 Sennikov re-examined these footprints and concluded that a therizinosaurid dinosaur likely made those tracks. He compared Macropodosaurus with the feet of Erlikosaurus and Therizinosaurus noting that in a plantigrade position they match the morphology of the tracks. He considered these tracks to be more associated with therizinosaurids and proposed a plantigrade stance for them. Macropodosaurus has also been discovered in the Maastrichtian strata of Poland in 2007. This footprint is reminiscent of the tracks described by Zakharov and was assigned to Macropodosaurus sp. This discovery may indicate the presence of therizinosaurids in Europe. Molina-P√©rez and Larramendi also supported a therizinosaurid assignment to the footprints described by Zakharov and proposed an animal around and for a long footprint. In 2017 Masrour with colleagues reported more Macropodosaurus footprints in what is now Morocco, further expanding the biogeographical range of therizinosaurids.

Background  Born in 1950, he studied at Johns Hopkins University and at the University of Chicago. Notable as Haiti's Minister of Finance and Governor of the Bank of the Republic of Haiti, he also served as consultant at the World Bank, the Inter-American Development Bank and USAID. He was dubbed as \\"all-powerful\\" in Le Monde Diplomatique. He died of cancer on 24 March 2001 in Miami, Florida, United States. His widow has since married Haiti's President Ren√© Pr√©val and his family maintains influence in Haiti.  Power in Haiti  His first notable job in Haiti was working in 1982 for Finance Minister Marc Bazin under the administration of Jean-Claude Duvalier. Bazin became favoured in international circles for an anti-corruption drive that he held as Finance Minister but was removed from his post after five months. After Jean-Claude Duvalier was ousted on 7 February 1986, Delatour was chosen to be Minister of Finance starting in April 1986 under the dictatorship of General Henri Namphy. There, he subjected Haiti to neoliberal reforms and argued that as Haiti would always be dependent on someone so it might as well be dependent on the United States. This was not popular in Haiti. Popular leader Jean-Bertrand Aristide dubbed this the \\"death plan\\". In June 1986 five days of major protests took place throughout Haiti, the protesters demanding Delatour's resignation. Henri Namphy said that this led to \\"almost a civil war\\" and promised to hold elections as a result. A November 1986 general strike followed, again with Delatour's dismissal demanded. Namphy had believed that as he led a provisional government, that it had no business carrying out sweeping reforms. Delatour believed otherwise. These reforms damaged a peasantry that had already suffered the 1982 destruction of their Creole pigs by U.S. orders as a response to an outbreak of African Swine Fever. There was an account that, at one point, Delatour became part of a hit list of Aristide's Interior Minister, Brigadier General Mondesir Beaubrun due to his position of taxing the elite. The minister has been accused of carrying out assassinations of Aristide's political opponents. In the 1960s Fran√ßois Duvalier closed all Haiti's ports except that of Port-au-Prince; Delatour had them reopened and contraband poured into the country. He reduced tariffs on imported rice and reduced the budget of the government agricultural agency in the rice-producing Artibonite by 30%. He reasoned that Haitians were wasting their time with inefficient agriculture, that the law of comparative advantage dictated that Haiti move much of its rural population to the cities where they could serve as cheap labour for industrial assembly plants as part of the global supply chain. He thus accelerated the neoliberalism introduced under Jean-Claude Duvalier whilst weakening the Haitian state, arguing that he was removing the means through which corrupt officials could steal development aid and sabotage profitable planning. He argued further that his reforms were reducing prices for food and other essentials. Haiti's sugar industry was hit hard by his policies as Haiti's sugar company Hasco was shut down in April 1987 days after the Usine Sucri√®re des Cayes announced it was closing; these two events cost over 40,000 jobs. Delatour had shut down both state-owned sugar mills; the Usine Sucri√®re Nationale de Darbonne in the L√©og√¢ne area in the autumn of 1986 and also the Usine Sucri√®re Citadelle in Cap-Ha√Øtien. The flooding of contraband Dominican sugar into the Haitian market promoted by Delatour's policies helped seal the fate of Haiti's sugar industry. Delatour explained that these sugar companies were not productive, citing that those owned by the government such as the Darbonne Sugar Refinery and Edible Oils producing plant ENAOL were running inefficiently and swallowed an unnecessarily large amount of government funds. These two corporations were partly funded by the Telephone Company. His decision to open the country up to subsidised American rice helped drive domestic producers out of business and to the capital, Port-au-Prince, and most notably in the rapidly expanding shantytown of Cit√© Soleil. They could not all be absorbed into the cheap labour industrial sector so many ended up working in the informal sector, most notably in the charcoal trade helping to denude the hills further. The new imports of U.S. subsidised rice were protected by military convoys to protect it from peasants who tried to stop its transportation, part of the unrest his policies were causing. For this, the New York Times described him in 1987 as \\"reviled\\" in Haiti but celebrated by the U.S. government and by the International Monetary Fund and World Bank. As such, after he left his post in February 1988 upon the end of the provisional military government, his presence as an advisor to governments became an important consideration for international aid and loans to be made available. To appease these forces who distrusted him based on his left wing reputation, Jean-Bertrand Aristide, who had previously denounced Delatour's \\"death plan\\", was compelled to make him part of his team in 1991 after he won the Haitian presidency. In September 1991, Delatour openly condemned the coup d'√©tat that deposed Aristide and brought Raoul C√©dras and Michel Fran√ßois into power. His support for the deposed president was a very important factor in permitting Aristide to be restored to office in 1994. Shortly before Aristide's restoration, Delatour and Leslie Voltaire had presented to the powers a plan titled the \\"Strategy of Social and Economic Reconstruction\\", a set of neoliberal reforms, dubbed in Haiti \\"The American Plan\\", which helped convince the U.S. to proceed with Aristide's restoration. In October 1994, after Aristide was restored to the presidency, Delatour threatened to not be involved in the government in order to force the neoliberal Smarck Michel, whose businesses included the rice importation that was damaging the Haitian peasantry, into the premiership. After Aristide capitulated to this demand, Delatour accepted the post of Governor of the Bank of the Republic of Haiti where he raised the interest rates consistent with his Chicago School ideological position. The reform programme he started in the mid-1980s was deepened under President Ren√© Pr√©val, elected in December 1995, with the rice tariff slashed to 3%. With his help, Haiti became the most open country to trade in the whole Caribbean area. The cement factory and the flour mill were privatised in 1997 under the terms of his plan; both were since shut down, leaving Haiti without a flour mill nor with a cement factory. He left midway through President Ren√© Pr√©val's first term in 1998. He died in 2001. His widow is now Ren√© Pr√©val's wife and his brothers Lionel Delatour and Patrick Delatour occupy important roles in the Haitian economy.  Legacy  In 2007, Haiti's most valuable state-owned asset, Teleco, was privatised for a mere $59 million and 2,800 lost their jobs. Haiti is now described as \\"the most privatised country in the world\\". The collapse of Haitian agriculture and the expansion of Port-au-Prince's population is one of his most lasting legacies, and the mass casualties in the 2010 earthquake and the enfeebled government's inability to cope with it thus were brought about with his help. Haiti no longer produces cement so it is forced to pay to import cement from abroad for its reconstruction. The new plans for rebuilding Haiti are all drawn up according to Delatour's own frameworks and his brothers have key roles in executing these plans. Delatour's pro-globalization anti-nationalism and Haiti's economic decline under his influence also helped in promoting nostalgia for both Duvaliers and their respective regimes. As a result of his policies, in 2000, Haiti's per capita income had declined to $329 from $600 in 1980 during the height of Jean-Claude Duvalier's dictatorship. Haiti also lost its self-sufficiency in rice under his influence and it became increasingly vulnerable to international food price fluctuations as it was required to import its food. The 2008 food riots caused by international speculators too is part of Delatour's legacy.

History Gur Sikh Temple The first Sikh pioneers came to the Abbotsford area in 1905 and originally worked on farms and in the lumber industry.() First plans to build a temple were made in 1908. After a property situated on a hill was acquired the settlers carried lumber from a local mill on their backs up a hill to construct the gurdwara. When the Gurdwara opened on February 26, 1911 Sikhs and non-Sikhs from across British Columbia attended the ceremony and a local newspaper reported on the event.Satwinder Bains: Gur Sikh Temple (archived) at canadiansikhheritage.ca (retrieved 7 April 2011) The temple was a two floor building, that from the outside looked like the contemporary wood houses of seen in local frontier towns. Features and decoration typical for Sikh architecture and design were only used in the interior. The first floor contains the Langar and common dining room for the community, and the second floor contains the prayer hall. The building was extended twice in 1932 and in the 1960s. Until 1975 the gurdawa belonged to the Khalsa Diwan Society Vancouver (founded in 1905), then it was transferred to the Khalsa Diwan Society Abbotsford, who wished for a greater autonomy.\\"Budh Singh and Kashmir Kaur Dhahan\\" (Archive).

Various species through their footprints that are characterized by the association of two impressions left by hand and foot. The acquisition of a specific family is complex, but now in most cases, they have been considered diplodocoids and similar animals. The reason is that their traces left are large, but in proportion to the size, from animals, seem very light because the depth of imprint is low. Farlow, in 1992, had given a criterion for classifying sauropod tracks. Traces are distinguished wide as Brontopodus (Farlow et al., 1989) and the narrow track related to Breviparopus (Dutuit et al., 1980 cf. Farlow, 1992). As the Parabrontopodus track ratio is 1:5, it is considered narrow by Lockley.  Species recognized  *P. mcintoshi - It was built on the basis of abundant fossil tracks at the Purgatoire site southeast of Colorado, but the holotype is a pair of hands and feet (CU-CTM 190-5).

Writing for The Guardian, Michael Moorcock situated the book within the tradition of steampunk fiction. The New Yorker called it ‚Äúthe kind of mannered fantasy that might result if Wes Anderson were to adapt Kafka.‚Äù A reviewer for The Observer compared it to The Third Policeman by Flann O'Brien, and described it as ‚Äúimaginative, fantastical, sometimes inexplicable, labyrinthine and ingenious.‚Äù An abridged version of the novel, read by Toby Jones, was broadcast on BBC Radio 4 Extra in January 2013. Berry‚Äôs short stories have appeared in Conjunctions, Chicago Review, Ninth Letter, and other magazines. He has taught at the MFA Program for Poets & Writers at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, and he currently teaches at Bard College.

He was a Kurdish Alevi Muslim. He has been the first chief editor of the party's newspaper Serxweb√ªn. In 1979, he had planned to leave Turkey towards Syria, but was arrested and after serving time in the infamous Diyarbakir No. 5 prison. Mazlum Doƒüan committed suicide in protest of the Turkish coup d'√©tat and the inhumane conditions he and other prisoners were facing inside of the penitentiary. Today he is seen as a hero and a martyr for the Kurdish resistance movement.  Early life  Mazlum was raised by his mother, Kebre, and his father, Kazim Doƒüan, in the village of Teman village in the Karako√ßan, El√¢zƒ±ƒü Province of Turkey. He had three older sisters, Arife, Hatice, and Bircan; and two brothers Fevzi and Delil. Delil was killed by special operation teams on 7 October 1980.  Education  Doƒüan began his high school studies in Eski≈üehir and Balƒ±kesir. After successfully passing the entrance exams, he enrolled at the prestigious University of Hacettepe in Ankara, Department of Economics, in 1974. While studying at university, he met other young Kurds who familiarized him with politics. He developed a passion for reading. Those who knew him well have said that he would read up to five-hundred pages or more a day. Through his readings, he became informed on oppression against Kurds. Determined to fight discrimination even if it meant with his own life, Doƒüan left the university in 1976 and went back to the Kurdish region to organize politically. There he joined the Kurdish student movement, which was the precursor of the Kurdistan Workers' Party.  Founding of the Kurdistan Workers' Party  The Kurdistan Workers' Parties (PKK) origins can be traced back to 1974 when Abdullah √ñcalan and a small group of leftist students, including Doƒüan, from the underground student movement Revolutionary Youth Federation of Turkey (Dev Gen√ß) decided to develop a Kurdish-based left wing organization. In 1971 √ñcalan joined the underground movements trying to overthrow the government, which he saw as an oppressive and fascist; this occurred when he was a student at the Ankara University Political Sciences Faculty. There, √ñcalan met Mazlum Doƒüan who was studying economics. √ñcalan and Doƒüan used the skills and the social network that they had developed during this period to become youth leaders. Like \\"Dev- Gen√ß\\", Apocus was a splinter organization of Dev-Gen√ß. The core of the organization was established with sixteen members and led by √ñcalan. The original sixteen members became known as the Ankara Democratic Association of Higher Education (ADY√ñD). During this period, √ñcalan, Doƒüan, and the rest of their supporters were generally known as Apocus (or Turkish \\"Apocular\\") or also the Kurdistan Revolutionaries. The group included current leaders of the PKK like Cemil Bayƒ±k, Ali Haydar Kaytan and Duran Kalkan. What made Apocus, later the PKK or Kurdistan Workers' Party, different was that it decided to move its activities from Ankara, the capital city, to the southern border towns of Turkey. Unlike most Kurdish political parties, which adopted a rather conservative outlook and were organized around tribal leaders and structures, they had strong convictions and a disciplined but decentralized organization which contributed to a steady rise and growing effectiveness. Much of the early development was inspired by the rise of decolonization movements and their potential to be adapted to the Kurdish question. Transferring to southern border towns with a radical left rhetoric gave the Apocus movement initial resources during a time when Turkey had problems with Syria. Mazlum Doƒüan and other leftist actors under the lead of Abdullah √ñcalan who were participating in the Kurdish student movement continued to organize and eventually developed into an official political party on 25 November 1978 in the village of Fis near Lice. As a result of his determination and devotion, Doƒüan became a member of the Central Committee of the party. The official name of the party, Partiya Karker√™n Kurdistan√™, or Kurdistan Workers' Party, was decided on later, in April 1979, during a meeting of the central committee. The meeting in Fis is also later referred to as the First Congress of the PKK. Doƒüan also became the first chief editor of the party's newspaper Serxweb√ªn. Shortly after the founding of the party in 1978, forecasting the military coup d‚Äô√©tat of Turkey in 1980, thousands of Kurdish and Turkish left- revolutionaries were jailed, leading many of the existing groups to lose their organizational structures. However, the PKK was able to withstand despite suffering many arrests including Mazlum Doƒüan. But following imprisonment, the captured PKK members set up an elaborate resistance organization that would operate even behind bars. This organization became famous for their hunger strikes. They also smuggled in guns and communication equipment into prison. Recruitment and training became commonplace for imprisoned PKK members.  Arrest  In the fall of 1979, Mazlum Doƒüan had gone to Viransehir, ≈ûanƒ±urfa, Turkey to assemble the Kurds for political rights activism. He had planned on leaving Turkey and head towards Syria, but was arrested on 30 September over accusations of founding and leading the Kurdistan Workers' Party, what the Turkish coup d'√©tat labeled a terrorist organisation, taking part in the liberation of a comrade from a state hospital in Diyarbakƒ±r, and identity document forgery. While facing the court board during his trial, Doƒüan lashed out expressing his beliefs, something his father urged him not to do. He shrieked in front of the Turkish military court explaining that he will never surrender to them, and that he will never stop asking for Kurdish rights. Doƒüan began screaming, \\"Serhildan jiyan e Berxwedan jiyan e\\", meaning, \\"resistance means I am alive\\". Following his trial, Turkish military police began beating and torturing him. As the military police beat him, Doƒüan repeated his words, \\"Serhildan e Berxwedan \\", until he collapsed and fell unconscious. As a political prisoner, he was required to wear a prison uniform but he continuously refused. He was beaten and told it would stop only if he sung the Turkish national anthem but he refused to sing leading to further beating and torture.  Suicide  On 21 March 1982, the day the Kurds celebrate Newroz by igniting bonfires, Mazlum Doƒüan set his prison cell on fire and hanged himself in protest against the Turkish government and the relentless conditions inside Diyarbakir prison and other penitentiaries across Turkey. Prior to taking his life, he lit three matches, placing them on the table in his cell leaving the message, \\"Surrender is Betrayal, Resistance Brings Victory\\". With the inhumane conditions of the prison-torture system of Diyarbakir prison, where prisoners were subject to horrifying forms of abuse, such as, sexual violence, rape, psychological terror, beatings, electro- shocks, and being forced to eat dog excrement, the state tried to break all belief in the prisoners' ideals, dreams and utopias. The headline 'Diyarbakir Cezaevinde Katliam' (Massacre in Diyarbakir Prison) was used by Serxweb√ªn to announce the death of Doƒüan in June 1982. His death sparked the Diyarbakir prison resistance movement. This triggered popular support and prompted the PKK's definite decision to take up guerrilla warfare against the state on 15 August 1984. Following Mazlum Doƒüan's action, four inmates, Ferhat Kurtay, E≈üref Anyƒ±k, Necmi √ñnen and Mahmut Zengin lit themselves on fire in protest.  Commemoration  After Doƒüan's death, the PKK magazines Serxweb√ªn and Berxwedan published an obituary in 1982. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, Serxweb√ªn and Berxwedan continued to publish commemoration articles regarding the acts of resistance from Doƒüan as well as other important figures such as G√ºlnaz Karata≈ü and Zekiye Alkan. PKK articles remembering Mazlum Doƒüan and other influential Kurdish figures are not uncommon even today. Doƒüan is honored in the form of many commemoration days by the Kurdish Movement. Since 1997, every year a Kurdish youth festival bearing his name is held. In a statement regarding her son, Doƒüan's mother explained that he lived not just for the Kurds, but for all of humanity. He dreamed of a Middle East that was free of oppression. He had visualized an idea of a confederation of the Middle Eastern community along with Kemal Pir.

The movie content was split into two stories, one about taking a day-off in the army, and one about a ghost bride's marriage. The movie also featured some cast members from Where Got Ghost?.  Plot  = Part 1: Only ghost will give you off - È¨ºÊâçÁµ¶‰Ω†OFF (Day-Off) = Sometime in the 1990s, late at night, two soldiers (played by Suhaimi Yusof and Khariudin Samsuddin) dig a shellscrape during a military exercise, encountering human hair buried in the ground. Attempting to pull it out of the dirt, the duo encounters a female ghost standing behind, which later apparently frightened them to death. Moving forward to the present-day, two reservist soldiers, Ah Nan (John Cheng) and Ah Lei, tries to get their on-the- ball commander, Lieutenant Chua (Chua En Lai), to grant them a day-off during their last unit exercise including stories about the female ghost by Ah Nan and telling that Ah Lei's grandmother passes away, which fails comically. Another soldier, Ah Tan (Dennis Chew), comes to see Lieutenant Chua to get a day-off or light duty too, citing ill health (he suffered for internal injuries), but gets rejected as well. Since the beginning, Ah Nan and Ah Lei didn't believe that Ah Tan felt ill, instead thinking that Ah Tan acted to get a day-off, including Ah Nan betting that Ah Tan will get rejected by Lieutenant Chua for a day-off or chop off his head. Ah Nan and Ah Lei encounters their Sergeant-Major, Warrant Officer Muthu (David Bala), after leaving the commander's office while chasing Ah Tan, who demands that Ah Lei (who dyed his hair yellow) either shave his head or get his hair dyed back to black. Later, during a chat with other reservist mates, it is revealed that Muthu had apparently died in a terrible car accident sometime back with his head knocked off, unsettling both Ah Nan and Ah Lei (it is later revealed that it was nothing more than a prank on the two by their fellow soldiers at a briefing before the exercise). During the exercise, Ah Tan, who is still sick, cooks his traditional Chinese medicine while he, Ah Nan and Ah Lei dig a fire- trench (only Ah Tan dig the fire-trench while the other two are cooking their meals). When Muthu comes to inspect their progress, he notices Ah Tan's medicine cooking and, citing a real wartime scenario, naggingly scolds the three soldiers for inadvertently exposing themselves to enemy fire by cooking in the field. Knowing that their training area is reputedly haunted, Ah Tan and Ah Lei attempt to spook their sergeant-major in the night as they encountered the same incident where two soldiers saw a buried human hair, leaving Ah Tan alone digging while still badly ill. Later that night, when Muthu returns to his field-post, he encounters the same ghost as at the start of the film, and while running away encounters disguised Ah Nan and Ah Lei (dressed up as long-haired ghosts), frightening him even more and leading him to inform Lieutenant Chua of his encounter with the spirit. Chua dismisses his claims and later meets with the trio (Ah Tan, Ah Nan and Ah Lei), where it is revealed that Ah Tan's illness gets worse and Muthu takes charge of sending Ah Tan back to the camp's medical centre (the medic attached for the exercise had reported sick previously). While driving out of the jungle, Muthu sees the same female ghost and in shock crashes the jeep. Shortly after, Muthu gets out of the wrecked vehicle and runs back to Lieutenant Chua to inform him of the accident and that Ah Tan was killed. Ah Tan, however, is standing behind Muthu and is visible to both officers, spooking Muthu. Meanwhile, Ah Nan and Ah Lei encounter Ah Tan standing alone in the jungle and are unconvinced he is a ghost (his pale face was pierced with glass shards and bleeding), mocking him for his acting and demanding him to frighten Chua to terminate the exercise. Later, the duo (joined by Muthu shortly after) went to their commander's tent, where they saw Ah Tan standing in front of Chua as Chua berates Ah Tan for malingering and his acting attempts to gain an off-day or light duty request, despite Ah Tan exposing many unnerving traits and behaviour (such as teleporting and showing a bloody face) to the officer. Eventually, the female ghost reveals herself through Ah Tan's body, frightening Chua enough, who then runs off into the woods where his screams echo throughout (his final fate is unknown). Ah Nan, Ah Lei and Muthu drive off in an army van out of the training area, all clearly spooked by what transpired. On their way out of the jungle, they pass by the accident site, encountering the police and the hearse handling Ah Tan's body beside the wrecked jeep. Suddenly, Ah Nan notices a second body-bag (aside from Ah Tan's) and alerts Ah Lei; it is soon revealed that it was Muthu's, shocking the duo. They then see Muthu's spirit looking down on his corpse and crying out that he was really dead (referring back to when the soldiers claimed he had died), smacking his forehead repeatedly until his head fly off, causing the two soldiers to scream and even louder after realising Muthu was still in their van, as is Ah Tan's ghost, who appears and tells Ah Lei that their commander has finally granted him a day-off. Suddenly, the female ghost appears behind and places her hands at the back of the van (with the duo still locked inside shouting fearfully, despite struggling to either get out or drive off) and pulls the vehicle back into the jungle as the men continue to scream, with their eventual fates left uncertain. = Part 2: Only ghost will marry you - È¨ºÊâçÂ´ÅÁµ¶‰Ω† (Ghost Bride) = Ong Kim Hui (or simply Ah Hui) (Henry Thia) is a middle-aged bachelor who has not been successful in his life, not being rich (and apparently having debts to loansharks) and having no luck with women (as he was dumped 20 times by his ex-girlfriends despite lowering his standards), despite his seniority in age. He encounters an apparent benefactor, Ah Hai (Mark Lee), who promises to make him rich through striking the first-prize in lottery. Ah Hai takes Ah Hui to Mount Vernon Columbarium and makes him pray to the spirits of the deceased there to gain luck for his gambling exploit. While leaving, he picks up a wallet, opens it up and chooses to wear a jade bangle contained inside it, despite the protests by Ah Hai, telling him that it was fate that he picked up and now owned the bangle. He also notices two sets of numbers for 4D lottery inside and bets on them, and it is later revealed he won on both bets. After he rejoices with Ah Hai, he quits his job as a dishwasher and pays off his debt in full, surprising the loansharks (noting that Ah Hui had been near broke a couple of days before) and also splurging his new-found wealth on massages and women. He also gets revenge on his ex-girlfriend (Tay Yin Yin) and her new boyfriend by shoving her into a cage and dumping a starving cobra inside while he counts (stretching out the time as he counted from 1 to 3, as he was said to be ‚Äúlong in everything‚Äù), leaving her to an uncertain fate. Later, he visits a gambling parlour and after winning $35,000 as Ah Hai expresses congratulations, chooses to continue his betting, which ultimately turns sour and causing him to lose a large portion of his money. After realising Ah Hai has left, he despondently walks to the carpark to his car, where an urn lands on his vehicle, soon followed by many hundreds sliding on the floor towards him. Spooked, he runs to the carpark exit ramp and believes himself safe, only to watch thousands more come from all directions on the ground and surrounding him, all rising into the air as three float near his face and explode. The next day, at a hawker centre, Ah Hui confides in Ah Hai of his encounter with the urns and Ah Hai questions Ah Hui on whether he had returned the favour to the spirits at the columbarium for their blessings to him, to which Ah Hui said he had not, revealing to Ah Hai that he had just $30 left after spending his money around wildly. Ah Hai seems concerned but tells Ah Hui he has a plan to save him, eventually stating to Ah Hui that a female spirit by the name of Chen Xiao Juan (or Xiao Juan), who died in her late teens (22 years old) and single, has now expressed her love for him, shocking Ah Hui. Ah Hai brings Ah Hui to Xiao Juan's home, where he introduces her parents, her sisters and their husbands to him. When Ah Hui asks to see Xiao Juan, her father (Henry Heng) expresses his surprise to Ah Hai that Ah Hui claimed to have never met him (Ah Hai) before, sparking confusion between Ah Hui and Xiao Juan's family, and once the big picture begins to set in for Ah Hui, he is stunned to realise that Ah Hai and Xiao Juan are the one and same person. Xiao Juan soon enters the living hall and the writing on the wall became clear: that Xiao Juan's human persona is none other than Ah Hai, and she was actually drawn and attracted to Ah Hui while she acted as a normal human being and was helping him to get rich. Ah Hui's initial shock from being told by her family for them to get married becomes disgust as he felt Xiao Juan was ugly and more man than woman (due to her coarse voice). Despite showing him her genitals (shocking her family), Ah Hui still refuses to accept her hand in marriage and in his insults to her enrages her parents, who attempted to kill him before Xiao Juan steps in and scares Ah Hui badly enough for him to marry her. Ah Hui returns home and tells his mother about his marriage to a ghost, which initially concerns her but she lets it go after hearing Xiao Juan's mother (Lin Ruping) promising to grant her riches through buying lottery and winning every time. Later, Ah Hui goes to a Chinese prayer-supplies store and at the insistence of Xiao Juan purchases a large quantity of luxury goods and items for the Afterlife (including a large 3-storey mansion, 3 iOne tablets (mock-up of iPad) and ten cars (all of the cars were mock-up of Mercedes-Benz E500), among others) and is later married at a temple ceremony to Xiao Juan before spending the first night together consummating their relationship. The next day, Ah Hui walks around in a daze and gets knocked down by a vehicle while crossing the road but is unaware he had been killed until he saw his bloodied corpse lying on the ground, surrounded by a large group of concerned passers-by. He turns around and to his horror realises that Xiao Juan, driving a hearse with his funeral portrait hung on the bonnet, had run him over and killed him. Smiling, Xiao Juan comes to greet her husband, who is angry that she had ended his life before he died a natural death as she had promised never to harm or kill him. Xiao Juan, however, dismisses it as mere deception and that Ah Hui had unwittingly fell for her lies. Unwilling to leave his corpse behind, he is eventually persuaded to leave with her for a ‚ÄúGreat Singapore Sale for Ghosts‚Äù, and gets into the hearse and the couple drive away, leaving Ah Hui's body laying there while the witnesses look on. This second part then ends with a phrase (in Mandarin) which states, ‚ÄúIf you choose to make a deal with the devil, you must be prepared to pay the ultimate price‚Äù, before the credits roll.

Best known for the originality of his formally demanding,The Guardian, 29 October 2015The Independent 2 November 2010 largely a-political theatre plays at the Royal Court in the 1980s and 1990s, state of the nation satires in the 1990s,Whats On And Where To Go, 23 April 1996, Roger Foss, Theatre can never be the same after this and later for his polemics about working class politics, A Working Class Alternative To Labour and Helping Themselves ‚Äì The Left Wing Middle Classes In Theatre And The Arts. He speaks fluent Swedish and is one of the chief translatorshttp://www.dramatiker.se/aktuellt/gregory- motton-arets-goran-o-eriksson-stipendiat of Strindberg's plays, known for his strict advocacy of translations rather than versions.The Guardian, 6 October 2014. Early life Gregory Motton was born in September 1961 in Wood Green in the London borough of Enfield the second child of Bernadette (n√©e Clancy) from Skibbereen in West Cork, Eire, a bar-maid, and David Motton, of Tottenham, London, a writer of children's comics. He attended St. Angela's Convent, St. Paul's School, and Winchmore Comprehensive. Early career Gregory Motton's first two plays went on in quick succession: Chicken (directed by Kate Harwood) at the Riverside Studios in April 1987, and then Ambulance (directed by Lindsay Posner) at the Royal Court in September 1987. His unconventional writing style soon dispersed the initial keen interest it had first awakened in managements and critics. His third play, Downfall, again directed by Lindsay Posner at the Royal Court in July 1988, contained 56 very brief scenes, 26 characters and a fragmented illogical structure. It brought fierce condemnation from the critics,London Theatre Record 1988, Vol VIII, issue 14 an empty theatre, and an end of the Royal Court's interest in Motton for several years. His fourth play, Looking at You (revived) Again commissioned originally by the National Theatre Studio, continued with the lyrical aspects of the previous plays but with a more economical technique . It followed a simple story but had a more or less non-naturalistic lyrical form. Rejected by Peter Gill, the then artistic director of the National Theatre Studio, it did not receive a rehearsed reading. It was produced by Simon Usher at the Leicester Haymarket in June 1989, during the period of David Gothard's co-artistic directorship. The play was transferred to the Bush Theatre by Jenny Killick, was unanimously disliked by the critics,London Theatre Record, 1989 Vol IX issue 13 and the theatre was empty once again. Consequently, it was not until a further three years later that two of Motton's plays were produced, almost simultaneously: A Message for the Broken Hearted, directed by Ramin Gray, March 1993, at the Liverpool Everyman; and The Terrible Voice of Satan, directed by James MacDonald, July 1993, at the Royal Court, now being run by Stephen Daldry. (Motton and Gray formed the Ducks and Geese Theatre Company to bring the former play to London, at the Battersea Arts Centre. They subsequently worked together directing a number of Motton's plays in France.) Both plays met with almost universal disapproval by the critics,The Independent, 16 March 1993London Theatre Record (1993) Vol XIII,issues 6 and 14 and Motton's brief career in Britain was effectively over. Excepting A Little Election Satire for one week at the Gate Theatre in 1997 under David Farr, it was to be another twelve years before one of his plays was produced there. His plays remained out of print in English until 1997 when James Hogan of Oberon Books began the re-publication of all his plays in several volumes. France During that period his plays were premiered in Paris.Archive LeMonde,Le Monde 3 April 2004, p31 Gregory Motton, theatre de sape,La Liberation Dec 1999, p77 Notable productions were by the director Claude Regy (Downfall 1992 and Terrible Voice of Satan Oct 1994), and also by the director √âric Vigner (Looking at You (revived) Again - \\"Reviens √† toi (encore)\\" 1994) at the Theatre de l'Odeon*, while the play was rejected by the NT Studio for a reading. (Also premiered in that theatre was Loue Sois le Progress 1998). During this period Motton wrote the \\"Gengis\\" series of satirical political plays (Cat and Mouse (Sheep), premiered at the Theatre de L'Odeon, Gengis Amongst the Pygmies, premiered at the Comedie Francaise, A Holiday in the Sun, premiered on Radio France Culture, and The Rape Of Europe). The first of these, Cat And Mouse (Sheep), was directed by Ramin Gray and Gregory Motton in English, and this production was seen briefly in Britain at the Gate Theatre under David Farr, a few months later. All four plays of that series have been the subject of public readings at the Royal Court, but never produced there. British critic Michael Billington noted Motton's presence abroad, which he interpreted in the following manner: \\"Ignored in his native Britain, Gregory Motton is widely performed in France and, watching the premiere (at the Comedie Francaise) of his latest piece, it is not difficult to see why. Motton studiously rejects naturalism and instead offers a comic- strip satire on capitalist consumerism in the style of Jarry, Ionesco or Vian. He is like an absurdist with Marxist tendencies\\".(Guardian 2004) Recent work Motton's relationship with the Royal Court began again in 2005, during Ian Rickson's tenure. Rickson was not a natural enthusiast for Motton's work and was reluctant to produce any of his characteristically unconventional plays to which there had always been significant opposition. He decided against producing A Holiday in the Sun. which he had commissioned and which was the subject of a reading. He was finally persuaded to produce The World's Biggest Diamond in 2005 which is a largely conventional drama about a lifelong love affair. This starred Jane Asher and Michael Feast and, perhaps surprisingly, earned the Royal Court the only 5 star review it had so far received during Rickson's term there.http://www.royalcourttheatre.com/whats- on/the-world-s-biggest-diamondSunday Times, John Peter, 13 November 2005. Ironically perhaps, Alex Sierz took this as a sign of a change in Motton's writing \\"The World's Biggest Diamond by Gregory Motton (Royal Court) Is Motton our English Strindberg? This account of two lovers who meet for a weekend after 30 years seethes with Scandinavian gloom. But whatever happened to Motton's distinctively weird personal vision?\\" (Alex Sierz)In Yer Face Theatre , whats on, 2005 Motton's plays have been produced only once in the past 17 years in Britain and never, in Britain, in a theatre with more than 90 seats. It is perhaps for this reason that he is considered by some commentators to have been rejected, along with some other writers, by the theatre establishment; Playwright Mark Ravenhill, wrote: \\"The English theatre has for some 50 years told itself that it is a writers' theatre. It's odd, then, that the English theatre should have produced a substantial list of playwrights who have become alienated from our theatres, often at the peak of their power.In my imagination there's a strange hinterland, an empty multi-storey car park standing at a point equidistant from both the Royal Court and the National Theatres, where the shades of once-celebrated playwrights such as Arnold Wesker, John Arden, Howard Barker and Gregory Motton wander up and down\\".The Independent 2 Nov 2010 Mark Ravenhill To others Motton is a natural dissident because of the form and the content of his writing. Dominic Dromgoole (\\"not a fan of Motton's work\\"The Full Room, the A-Z of Contemporary Playwriting Methuen Drama) calls him the Tony Benn or Dennis Skinner of playwriting. Most recently, Gregory Motton has begun writing musicals. He wrote the music, lyrics and books of three in less than three years, having composed more than 60 songs. They are; Nefertiti and Akhenaten, The Mystery Of Hill Street and Dracula. He wrote a fourth Tristan and Yseult in 2014. In 2014 he released a double CD album, called Damnation and Praise (Exile Music), containing a selection of 27 songs from 4 of his musicals. Awards In 2012, Strindberg's centenary year in Sweden, Motton was awarded the Swedish Writers Guild (Sveriges Dramatikerf√∂rbund) G√∂ran O Eriksson Award for his translations of Strindberg. This award was presented on the stage of Strindberg's Intima Teater, in Stockholm. The jury's motivation for the award was \\"Gregory Motton is a very many-sided translator whose work is valued by a great number of authors. His translations of dramatic works of widely differing genres and styles, display a faithfulness which points to the kind of sensitivity, integrity and precision, that comes of great professional skill.\\" Theatre and politics In various articles and interviews Motton has voiced some criticisms of British theatre, (\\"The Stage of Hollow Moralising\\") Guardian 16 April 1992, reprinted Theatre Forum Fall 1992, Guardian 16 April 1992, reprinted Theatre Forum Fall 1992, The Stage 1 April 1993, Whats On 5 May 1993, and most notably in the mid-1990s when he wrote an article about the high administrative staffing levels and low plays output of Britains regional theatres.Guardian 12 April 1998 Patrick Marmion wrote; \\"He stands aside from the mainstream orthodoxy of issue based writing....Now theatres are looking at his plays but remain edgy about what he may say in them.\\"(Patrick Marmion, Whats on.5 May 1993) Motton's comments about British theatre may have alienated theatres against him.(New Statesman, December 1992) More recently he wrote a book, ( Helping Themselves- the Left Wing Middle Classes in Theatre and the Arts ), criticising the influence of the middle class left in both the arts and politics, and their effect on working class representation in politics. It includes an examination of the working class identity of the Royal Court in the 1969s and 70s, with specific reference to the public school origins of many of their best known writersWho's Who 2008 OUP, December 2007, John Arden, John OsborneCambridge Guide to Women's Writing in English, Caryl Churchill, ,1999lancingcollege.co.uk Notable OLs David Hare Christopher HapmptonHelping Themselves, pp. 102-24 This book was commissioned by Oberon Books, but was rejected by them for publication. It is published by Levellers Press. It was accepted for sale in the Royal Court bookshop by the Royal Court Artistic Director Dominic Cooke, despite its robust criticisms of that theatre. In December 2013 Motton published A Working Class Alternative to LabourLevellers Press 2013 a book outlining a collection of policies designed to remove poverty, by the means of a high statutory minimum wage and a return to manufacturing. The central idea of the book is to shift money and economic activity from the top end of the economy to the lower end, and proposes a challenge to the predominance of large capital and its influence in our society, most notably by ending Britain's reliance on profits from investment in foreign industries (through investment banking) for the balance of payments. He proposes a return to what is called 'traditional banking'Franklin R Edwards, Fredrick S Mishkin, The decline of Traditional Banking, Implications for Financial Stability and Regulatory Policy, 1993 Columbia University, New York where money from current accounts is invested in domestic industries. He advocates free and untested access to grammar schools for all who want it, as a means of countering the predominance of a public school educated elite in positions of power. There is a section describing the workings of the European Union, and a critique of its lack of democratic accountability. He points out that the government of the EU (the executive) is not elected, and that the European Union elections, are only of MEPS and are therefore largely cosmetic since the executive is not drawn from the MEPS and cannot be removed by elections. Motton portrays the EU as a largely capitalist organisation designed to drive down working class wages. He characterises the EU's appropriation of political power, by-passing democracy, as a coup d'√©tat by the administrative classes of Europe. He gives evidence of a belief amongst EU leaders that political and economic decisions are best made without reference to democracy.

It is set in the Great World Amusement Park and was released in Singapore cinemas on 27 January 2011. The film features an ensemble cast of local singers, established MediaCorp artistes, a number of celebrities from Hong Kong and Taiwan and getai group \\"Babes in the City\\". A noted feature of the film is the heavy use of common Chinese dialects and many actors had dialogues in dialects they were not familiar with. Plot It's A Great Great World is set in Singapore's legendary amusement park named Great World, which was also known to locals by its Hokkien name 'Tua Seh Kai'. Spanning from the 1940s to the present day, the film presents four tales centred on attractions within these once famous walls. At present time, Ah Min finds four old pictures in her mother's photography studio and seeks out her mother's old friend Goh Ah Beng, who tells her the stories behind these photographs. These four stories include: * A clown on a quest to have his photo taken with English movie star Elizabeth Taylor and tells his experience to his ageing mother. * The tale of a carnival shooting gallery operator who experiences her first teenage love with a Malaysian medicinal oil seller's son. * A washed up diva of the Flamingo Nightclub who used to sing for her lost love, and rediscovers true support by her audience and her manager. * A lok-lok seller who narrates the story of his wedding dinner with his mute wife the night the Japanese invaded Singapore during World War II.

From 1836, it became the workhouse of the Strand Union of parishes. The building remained in operation until 2005 after witnessing the complex evolution of the healthcare system in England. After functioning as a workhouse, the building became a workhouse infirmary before being acquired by the Middlesex Hospital and finally falling under the NHS. In the last century it was known as the Middlesex Hospital Annexe and the Outpatient Department. It closed to the public in 2005 and it has since been vacated. On 14 March 2011 the entire building became Grade II Listed.  Origin  The Cleveland Street Workhouse was built on an H plan on the eastern side of Cleveland Street between 1775 and 1778 by the parish of St Paul Covent Garden, on land leased from the Bedford Estate. The construction of the building resulted from the intercession of the Duke of Bedford‚Äôs steward Robert Palmer, who together with Duchess Gertrude planned and realized the construction of Bedford Square and Gower Street. The original Act of Parliament was obtained in May 1775. The building was initially designed to accommodate 200 paupers, but the plan was modified prior to construction to accommodate a greater number. Construction began that same year and by 1778 the building was already completed and fully occupied. Shortly afterwards, permission was sought from the landowner the Duke of Bedford, to use part of the site as a burial ground for the parish, as authorized by the Parliamentary Act. The ground was consecrated in 1790. Survey of London. Volume 36, p. 61 That same decade the church of St Paul's, Covent Garden, which was built by Inigo Jones in 1631‚Äì33, was renovated (following a fire) by the eminent architect Thomas Hardwick. Hardwick was a famous church architect: he restored Sir Christopher Wren‚Äôs St James, Piccadilly and re-built George Dance the Younger's St Bartholomew-the-Less in West Smithfield (1823‚Äì25), and he is also famous for designing the church of St Mary the Virgin at Wanstead (completed in 1790 ‚Äì Grade I listed), St John's Church in St John's Wood High Street (1813‚Äì14) and the church of St Mary in Marylebone Road (1813‚Äì17), arguably his most notable work. In 1796, the trustees in charge of the restoration work of the church at Covent Garden employed Thomas Hardwick to design a new infectious ward and a new infirmary, built in 1802 and 1819. History In 1829 the workhouse became independently managed and in 1836 it was entrusted to the Board of Guardians of the Strand Poor Law Union. This was the first in a long series of name changes: over the course of its history the building has been known as: *St Paul Covent Garden Workhouse or simply Covent Garden Workhouse *Strand Union WorkhouseWorkhouses.org, Strand Union Workhouse *Central London Sick Asylum *Cleveland Street Infirmary *Middlesex Hospital Annexe *Middlesex Hospital Outpatient Department Despite its many names, the core function of the building has remained unaltered over more than two centuries: the vast majority of the paupers admitted while it was a workhouse were infirmJoseph Rogers, M. D: Reminiscences of a workhouse medical officer, London, Unwin, 1889 (fewer than 8 per cent were able-bodied). When the workhouse facility was relocated to Edmonton (1876), the building served as an asylum for the mentally ill, before becoming an infirmary. It was finally incorporated into the Middlesex Hospital in 1926, which came under the management of the NHS in 1948. Even during the workhouse era the core function was to tend and care for the sick and infirm, since ill-health and infirmity was the main cause of pauperism. The building represents a unique example of a purpose-built Georgian workhouse that has remained in service to the sick and poor of London for more than 200 years. Survey of London. Volume XXI, Tottenham Court Road and Neighbourhood (The Parish of St. Pancras, Part III) An account of the appearance of the building in 1856 by its medical officer Joseph Rogers survives, matching the appearance of the building in modern days: UCLH NHS Foundation Trust in 2010 proposed the building's demolition in a planning application (and conservation area consent) submitted to Camden London Borough Council to replace it with a large building mixing private accommodation with commercial space.Camden Council, Details Page for Planning Application ‚Äì 2010/2205/P Camden Council, Details Page for Planning Application ‚Äì 2010/2209/C However adjoining Westminster City Council raised objections on three grounds on 2 December 2010. The Cleveland Street Workhouse is of particular importance in light of the fact that Charles Dickens is known to have lived nearby in what is now 22 Cleveland Street. Dickens lived there as a young child between 1815 and 1816, and then again as a teenager in 1828‚Äì1831. His residence in the street has led to the suggestion by historian Ruth Richardson that the nearby workhouse was probably the inspiration for Oliver Twist.Lorna Bradbury (20 January 2011) \\"Oliver Twist‚Äôs Workhouse Discovered\\", The Telegraph =Strand Poor Law Union= When the building was used as the Strand Union Workhouse from 1836, it was the workhouse for the union of the parishes and places of St Mary le Strand, the Precinct of the Savoy, St Paul Covent Garden, St Clement Danes, and the Liberty of the Rolls. From 1837 to 1868 it also included St Anne, Soho and the parish of St Martin-in-the-Fields was added in 1868. In 1913 it was replaced by the City of Westminster Poor Law Union.

It was designed to capture and process data from onboard sensors before delivering it to ground troops. Spy capabilities The blimp was equipped with up to a dozen sensors, including listening devices, video cameras for use both during the day and at night, communications equipment and a system known as the \\"wide- area airborne surveillance system\\", which used several cameras to film areas several square miles in size, similar to the Gorgon Stare system. The sensor equipment was to be supplied by Mav6 LLC as the prime contractor and system integrator. To process the data collected, which would ordinarily be transmitted to analysts on the ground, the blimp used an onboard computer to analyze and store the data, which was to be available for troops to access. This would require fewer personnel to analyze the data, and would cause less strain on battlefield networks by transmitting only required information, rather than a constant stream of data. Design Total system cost was $211 million. The envelope for the system was completed by subcontractor TCOM LP in Aug. of 2011. The blimp was around long and 1.4 million cubic feet in volume. It was designed to be able to reach an altitude of and remain at altitude for up to a week. The aircraft's first flight was planned for 15 October 2011. Delays and cancellation Technical complications with the blimp's design that arose during 2011, including overweight tail fins, unexpectedly complex avionics systems and the inability of the original Argus network of cameras design to be integrated with other systems, and meeting flight requirements of the FAA forced the blimp's first flight back to 15 April 2012, with dramatically reduced capabilities. Since the original cameras, designed to be able to cover 64 square kilometers, were unable to be installed, a different camera pack design, called Angel Fire, was used, which can only cover four square kilometers. Despite the drop in capability, an Air Force analysis of operating costs estimated that the blimp would cost at least four times as much as estimated by MAV 6, another contractor for the project. In June 2012, the Air Force cancelled the project and ordered the airship to be dismantled and put in storage.Air Force cancels Blue Devil Block 2 - Wired.com, June 7, 2012 In 2013, the Inspector General of the Air Force determined that Air Force personnel did not properly manage the award of contracts for the Blue Devil Block 2 persistent surveillance system.http://www.dodig.mil/Reports/Compendium-of-Open- Recommendations/Article/1118967/air-force-and-army-corps-of-engineers- improperlymanaged-the-award-of-contracts/ In 2014, the Air Force banned one of its former generals from doing business with the Air Force because he tried to keep the project going after cancellation.Grandon, Rodney. \\"Notice of debarment\\" Air Force, http://www.safgc.hq.af.mil/shared/media/document/AFD-141112-053.pdf, 12 November 2014.

The prototype of the modern rally towel was created in 1975 by former Pittsburgh Steelers radio broadcaster Myron Cope and is known as the Terrible Towel. Since the Terrible Towel's debut, teams have used similar gimmicks, mainly using white towels (or towels with the team's colors) and giving them out to fans. The main time teams give rally towels is during league postseasons. Towels have gained much popularity as distractions to visiting players. Teams that use rally towels include the NFL's Seattle Seahawks, New England Patriots, and New York Jets, the NHL's Anaheim Ducks, Montreal Canadiens, Vancouver Canucks, San Jose Sharks, Pittsburgh Penguins, New York Rangers, New Jersey Devils and Dallas Stars, the NBA's Cleveland Cavaliers, Memphis Grizzlies and Oklahoma City Thunder, and the MLB's Detroit Tigers, San Francisco Giants, Toronto Blue Jays, Philadelphia Phillies, Texas Rangers, Minnesota Twins, Los Angeles Dodgers, New York Mets and the Washington Nationals. History Though not known as a rally towel at the time ‚Äî the concept had not been introduced yet ‚Äî one of the first recorded regular similar uses of a towel was at Western Kentucky University, where basketball coach E. A. Diddle waved a red towel on the sideline during games. Diddle, who coached at WKU from 1922 to 1964, originally used a plain white towel; the red towel came as a result of an effort to keep students from pilfering towels from the physical education department. A logo featuring the towel is now used by the school's sports teams, most prominently on football helmets. On December 27, 1975, the Pittsburgh Steelers entered the NFL playoffs against the Baltimore Colts. Two weeks prior to the game, the team's flagship radio station, WTAE, decided to create a gimmick to attract sponsors, with the help of Myron Cope, the Steelers radio broadcaster. They soon hit upon the idea of the Terrible Towel ‚Äì a gold or yellow towel with the words \\"The Terrible Towel\\" printed on the front ‚Äì which would be marketed to Steelers fans. The idea was criticized by the Steelers and the local press, but on the day of the game, as Cope later recalled: \\"...the Steelers gathered in the tunnel for introductions, whereupon the crowd exploded‚Äîand suddenly, by my estimation, 30,000 Terrible Towels twirled from the fists of fans around the stadium!\\" The Steelers not only won the game, but went on to win the Super Bowl for the second year running. Rally towels came to professional hockey by accident in 1982. Outraged by a string of unfavorable calls in a road game during the conference finals, Vancouver Canucks coach Roger Neilson draped a white towel over a player's stick and waved it above his bench in mock surrender. Neilson was ejected and the Canucks lost the game, but the incident restored the team's morale. Fans started waving white towels‚Äîfirst at the airport when the team returned to Vancouver, then at the next game‚Äîand \\"Towel Power\\" propelled the Canucks to victory in the series. The first rally towels in baseball came from the Minnesota Twins. The Homer Hanky first appeared during the Twins playoff run in 1987, when they won the World Series. Present day Steelers fans wave rally towels at Heinz Field ‚Äì October 15, 2006 Today, rally towels are seen in all four major American sports leagues (MLB, NBA, NFL, and NHL). They have also been seen in the MLS. Almost all MLB teams use rally towels now. =Baseball= The first rally towel, to be used in Major League Baseball (MLB) was the Homer Hanky (a handkerchief printed with the Twins logo) of the Minnesota Twins. It gained popularity throughout the 1987 pennant race as a promotional item created by the Minneapolis Star Tribune. The Twins would later go on to win the 1987 World Series. The Homer Hanky has been present in every Twins playoff run since, including during the Twins victory in the 1991 World Series. During the 2010 MLB postseason, five of the eight teams in the playoffs had rally towels. The two teams in the 2010 World Series, the San Francisco Giants and the Texas Rangers, both had rally towels. The Giants had orange \\"rally rags\\", but only for Game 2, while the Rangers used red, white, and blue rally towels for Games 3, 4, and 5, all of the home games in Arlington. This was the first World Series that both teams had rally towels since the 2006 World Series. In 2016, Major League Baseball added a rule (nicknamed the \\"Homer Hanky Rule\\") specifying that \\"in-stadium rally towels\\" may not be white in color due to potential hitter confusion. As a result, all rally towels and since 2016 have been in alternate colors, including the Twins' own 2019 Homer Hanky, which took the form of a small red terrycloth towel. In baseball, the teams that use rally towels that are common to hand out besides the Twins are usually the Colorado Rockies, Detroit Tigers, Philadelphia Phillies, and St. Louis Cardinals. The Toronto Blue Jays hand out rally towels as part of their \\"Fan Fridays\\" promotion, inaugurated in 2010. Along with the Giants and Rangers, the Cincinnati Reds also started in 2010. ;Teams that use rally towels * Arizona Diamondbacks (starting 2017 season) * Baltimore Orioles * Chicago Cubs * Chicago White Sox * Cincinnati Reds * Cleveland Indians * Colorado Rockies * Detroit Tigers * Houston Astros (starting 2015 season) * Kansas City Royals * Los Angeles Dodgers * Miami Marlins * Milwaukee Brewers * Minnesota Twins * New York Mets * Oakland Athletics * Philadelphia Phillies * Pittsburgh Pirates * San Diego Padres * San Francisco Giants * Seattle Mariners * St. Louis Cardinals * Texas Rangers * Toronto Blue Jays * Washington Nationals ;Teams that do not use rally towels * Atlanta Braves * Boston Red Sox * Los Angeles Angels * New York Yankees * Tampa Bay Rays =Basketball= Few NBA teams have rally towels. The most significant team with towels is the Cleveland Cavaliers. Fans used them in the playoffs, including when LeBron James returned to Quicken Loans Arena as a member of the Miami Heat. For the Heat, rally towels are given during their playoff runs with the phrase \\"White Hot\\". Other teams include the Oklahoma City Thunder and the Boston Celtics. The 2011 NBA Champions Dallas Mavericks gave out towels during their first-round series against the Blazers, and in their Western Conference Finals series against the Thunder during their championship run in 2011. The Grizzlies, Pacers, and 76ers also came into use in 2011. =Football= In the National Football League (American football), the Seattle Seahawks use rally towels as part of their 12th-man saga. In 2010, 12th-man rally towels were given out. The Chicago Bears, Dallas Cowboys, Denver Broncos, Indianapolis Colts, Minnesota Vikings, New England Patriots, New York Giants, and Philadelphia Eagles also hand out rally towels in the playoffs. the Pittsburgh Steelers also have their own rally towel, dubbed the \\"Terrible Towel\\". =Hockey= Towel Power in Vancouver during the Canucks' 2007 NHL Playoffs The NHL has many teams that use rally towels. The Jets use white towels during the playoffs for their \\"Winnipeg Whiteout\\" tradition. The Coyotes, who were the original Winnipeg Jets, have also used white towels for \\"Whiteout.\\" The Penguins have also used white towels until they switched to gold towels for \\"Gold-Out\\" for the 2016 Stanley Cup Playoffs. The Stars use them in the playoffs, especially when they won the Stanley Cup in 1999. As the Mighty Ducks, the Ducks referred to their towels as \\"Fowl Towels\\". The Ducks' towels are currently orange. The Blackhawks, Bruins, Canadiens, Capitals, Devils, Golden Knights, Kings, Predators, Rangers, Red Wings, Senators, and Sharks also have rally towels. The first team that used rally towels in hockey was in 1982 by the Vancouver Canucks. Canucks fans use the term Towel Power to describe the waving of rally towels by their fans. =Other= In other sports, rally towels are rarely used. In the Major League Soccer (MLS), rally towels were never used because of the popularity of scarves. The rally towel made a rare appearance in the 2010 MLS Playoffs, when Real Salt Lake gave rally towels to fans during a semi-final match against FC Dallas. The towels did not help the team, as FC Dallas won in the aggregate and went all the way to the MLS Cup Final. They are used in minor leagues as well. College teams also occasionally use rally towels. Texas A&M; began using \\"12th Man\\" Towels in 1985 with the 12th Man kickoff team to help boost student support at Kyle Field.

The Maryland State Fishery Force boats began operating under a contract in which they were under a free lease to the United States Navy in August 1917, serving as Squadron Number 8 of the 5th Naval District, patrolling their regular areas enforcing state conservation law and federal laws. They were under the command of a Conservation Commission member, George O. Haddaway, who was also a Lieutenant in the Navy and expenses, wages, supplies and repairs were paid by the federal government.A number of the boats used in conservation enforcement were private boats used for the season only.

During the nineteenth century, Curtis held such offices as Washington County Commissioner, associate judge, and Ohio state representative; his son Austin was later also elected to the Ohio House of Representatives. Earlier history Born in 1787, Walter and his family moved to Ohio in 1791 from Warren, Connecticut. After the family lived in Marietta for a time, the end of the Northwest Indian War prompted them to establish a farm southwest of Marietta in 1795. On this land,Dickinson, Cornelius Evarts, and Samuel Prescott Hildreth. A History of Belpre, Washington County, Ohio. Parkersburg: Globe, 1920. which he had purchased from land speculators in the previous year, Walter's father Ebenezer constructed a substantial two-story log house, which was seen as superior to all other houses in the surrounding area at the time of its completion. Walter acquired the entire farm after his father's death, buying the property that had been left to the other heirs and purchasing adjacent land from other owners. Here, he constructed the present Greek Revival house from bricks laid in common bond with a gabled roof. As the years passed, Curtis established himself in local society, both as a legislator and as a leading participant in the commerce of the nearby Ohio River. Along with his brother Horace, he operated a business that transported freight by keelboat between river ports such as Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Charleston, Virginia, and Cincinnati, Ohio. Later history Walter Curtis died in 1876; following his death, the farm passed into the hands of his descendants, who continued to own it into the 1920s. His family members changed their home very little; during the late twentieth century, architectural historians recognized it as one of southeastern Ohio's best examples of an early Greek Revival farmhouse. In 1980, the Walter Curtis House was listed on the National Register of Historic Places, qualifying because of its historically significant architecture and because of its place as the home of a leading local citizen. It is one of six Belpre Township sites to have received this designation: three houses and a bridge in the city of Belpre have also been so designated, as has the home of Walter's brother Horace in Little Hocking.

About the School The school began in 1986 on rented premises in the Public Hall in Wesburn when a local farmer, Alan Earle, agreed to have the school built on his property along the Little Yarra River. This land, considered partly unsuitable for long-term building development, was sold allowing for the purchase of a 20 hectare block on Little Yarra Road, two kilometres South of the centre of Yarra Junction. The school currently has over 250 students, ranging from Kindergarten to year 12.

Early years Ainsworth was born in Lambton, New South Wales. At the age of 15 he joined the Department of Public Instruction as an assistant teacher, but transferred to the Meteorological Branch of the Department of Home Affairs in the Australian Public Service in 1910. He was then seconded to Mawson‚Äôs Antarctic Expedition in the course of which he was in charge of the subantarctic Macquarie Island party for nearly two years ‚Äì from December 1911 to November 1913. His responsibilities on Macquarie included the establishment of a weather station, as well as a radio relay station on Wireless Hill which pioneered the first radio communications between Antarctica and the outside world.Gibbney (1979). Public servant In 1915, Ainsworth was commissioned in the Australian 62nd Infantry Battalion. In 1917 he joined the Counter Espionage Bureau and was made an honorary captain. In the same year he married Mary Catherine Statham at Murwillumbah. Following demobilisation in 1918 he became an inspector in the Commonwealth Police in Queensland. Transferring to the Prime Minister's Department in 1921, he served as foreign-affairs officer with the Australian delegation to the 1923 Imperial Conference in London, as well as being the sole Australian delegate attending the International Labour Organization meeting at Geneva the same year. Businessman Ainsworth‚Äôs rapid rise as a public servant was at least partly as a prot√©g√© of Billy Hughes, who was Prime Minister of Australia from 1915 to 1923, and whom he greatly admired. He resigned from the public service at the end of 1924 to enter the private sector as a business manager, first with the Melbourne-based motor-parts company Kellow-Falkiner, then as general manager with the Chrysler Corporation in New Zealand, and finally as general manager with Barnet Glass Rubber in Queensland, from which he resigned in 1935. He subsequently became State organiser for the United Australia Party, of which Billy Hughes was one of the founders. After incurring considerable financial losses through gambling on horse races, Ainsworth moved to Sydney in about 1937. There he lived in Vaucluse, New South Wales, ran a delicatessen in Leichhardt, and gave radio talks about his Antarctic experiences. During the Second World War he was briefly employed in meteorology again. Death Ainsworth died in Sydney‚Äôs Royal Prince Alfred Hospital of pyelonephritis and uraemia.

Two of his grandchildren, Lord Frederick Windsor and Lady Gabriella Windsor, are in the line of succession to the British throne. Life Reibnitz was a member of an ancient Reibnitz family, Silesian landowners, whose first recorded ancestor Henricus de Rybnicz was mentioned already in 1288. G√ºnther was the son of Baron (Freiherr) Hans Egon von Reibnitz (1856‚Äì1918), who, on 19 February 1887 had married Baroness Ida von Eickstedt, member of von Eickstedt family, in Gieraltowitz, Upper Silesia. Reibnitz was born on 8 September 1894 at Mistitz in the Prussian province of Silesia, now called Miejsce Odrza≈Ñskie, having since become part of Poland. He was educated at the Royal Prussian Military Academy at Berlin-Lichterfelde, from which he graduated at the end of 1913. =Commissioning= In March 1914 he was commissioned as an ensign into the Grand Duchy of Mecklenburg 2nd Regiment of Dragoons, No. 18, in Parchim. In August 1914, soon after the beginning of the First World War he was severely wounded and captured, remaining a prisoner of war of the French for most of the duration of the war. On 20 September 1918, shortly before Reibnitz was released in exchange for a French officer, his father died in Berlin. =Post First World War= After the war, in the lead-up to the plebiscite to resolve competing German and Polish territorial claims in Upper Silesia, Reibnitz and his brother Joachim founded two regiments of German irregulars (Freikorps), aiming to guard the border on the River Oder from Cosel to Ratibor.Obituary in The Sunday Telegraph dated 28 April 1985 =First marriage= On 12 Jul 1921, Reibnitz married firstly Margherita von Seherr-Thoss (1893‚Äì1962), the widow of Friedrich Ernst Graf von Seherr-Thoss (1881‚Äì1918), and a daughter of Gustav Schoen by his marriage to Elisabeth Wentzel.

In 1933 this activity ended when he was appointed to the honorary position of Regional Director of Hunting for Silesia. On 1 December 1930 Reibnitz joined the Nazi Party, becoming member number 412855. On 15 April 1933 he then became a member of the Cavalry SS, with the SS number 66010. Reibnitz and his first wife were divorced at Breslau on 15 April 1931.L'Interm√©diaire des chercheurs et curieux, vol. 29, (1979) p. 845 On 15 July 1937, his mother died at Gro√ü- Grauden, Silesia, now Grudynia Wielka in Poland. =Second World War= As an officer of the Army Reserve, Reibnitz was recalled to active service at the beginning of the Second World War. However, he was not a very loyal party member. In 1937 he had been summoned to appear before the highest party tribunal accused of denigrating the swastika flag. By reaffirming his loyalty, he was able to extract himself from the affair; he had also referred to the leader of the SS, Heinrich Himmler, as the \\"chicken farmer\\".Bundesarchiv Berlin, Oberstes Parteigericht, I. Kammer Soon after he rejoined the armed forces on active service, Reibnitz was sent back to the home front due to heart problems. He informed the SS of his marriage (on 17 December 1941 in Breslau) to his second wife Countess Maria Anna Szap√°ry von Muraszombath, Sz√©chysziget et Szap√°r (1911‚Äì1998), a daughter of the Austro-Hungarian diplomat Count Frigyes Szap√°ry (1869‚Äì1935), but he did not inform them of his intention to seek an annulment of his first marriage so that he could marry his second wife in a Roman Catholic ceremony, nor that the children of the marriage would be raised in that faith. This was interpreted by the regime as disloyalty. It was also seen as incriminating that he and his wife practiced their faith openly. Because his wife was already under observation by the Gestapo over her contacts before the war with supposed British Secret Service agents, as well as in connection with a range of essentially minor \\"transgressions\\", his situation became increasingly critical, and in 1944 he was dismissed from the Nazi Party, from the Cavalry SS, and from the post of Regional Director of Hunting for Silesia.Bundesarchiv Berlin, file Rasse- und Siedlungsamtfinding of the Appeals Tribunal for Upper Bavaria, Senat Moosburg- Dachau, Ber.

Under his direction, the Ecuadorian government started a series of important works such as the completion of the Trans-Andean Railway connecting Quito and Guayaquil. Furthermore, the new Liberal government unfolded a process of secularisation of the state. This is instanciated at the educational level in the construction of several of the first secular educational institutions of the country, the clearest example of this being the foundation of the Instituto Nacional Mej√≠a on June 1, 1897 by Alfaro's orders. Other important educational institutions founded by Alfaro include a School of Beaux Arts, the second foundation of the National Conservatory of Music of Ecuador, and the Manuela Ca√±izares High School. = Previous locations = antiguo Beaterio building, where the Instituto Nacional Mej√≠a was located in the early 20th century.alt=196x196px The Instituto Nacional Mej√≠a was originally located at the north side of the Metropolitan Cultural Centre and was later moved to an old building informally known as the \\"antiguo Beaterio\\", Spanish for \\"old nunnery\\", (which had formerly served for various purposes, from religious retreat to Catholic girls school), at the intersection of the streets Jos√© Joaqu√≠n de Olmedo and Sebasti√°n de Benalc√°zar. Both buildings were located at the heart of Quito's Old Town (\\"Centro Hist√≥rico\\"). In 1922, the high school administration commissioned a new, bigger building, to the German architect Wilhelm Spahr and the local architect Pedro Aulestia Sa√°, which was to be located at the, back then, northern edge of the city. Thus, the high school would remain at the antiguo Beaterio building only up until the early 1930s. The construction of a new building is also to be taken against the backdrop of the centenary celebrations for the Battle of Pichincha (May 24, 1822), which is conventionally seen as securing the separation of the territories of the then Real Audiencia of Quito from the Spanish Empire, an important antecedent for the construction of Ecuador as a republican nation-state. = Further expansions = The newly founded secondary school quickly acquired popularity and prestige within the country. Hence, following the limited availability of spaces to meet the increasing student demand, a new large building was built in the 1950s on the west side of the block occupied by the Edificio Central. The original purpose of this building was to house the students who came from the various provinces of Ecuador. Later its infrastructure was repurposed to make room for more student classrooms and laboratories. Thus, giving birth to the Edificio Internado. Later, in the 1970s, the School of Telecommunications of the Army of Ecuador ceded its building to the High School, establishing in this way the Edificio Sur. This last building occupies a second block, separated from the rest of the High School by the Antonio Ante street. Thus, this complex of buildings comprising the Instituto Nacional Mej√≠a is currently located at the north end of Quito's Old Town.  Buildings  Several buildings integrate the current architectural complex of the Instituto Nacional Mej√≠a. These include: = Edificio Central = Fa√ßade of the Central Building today In 1922, the administration of the Instituto Nacional Mej√≠a orders the construction of this building to the German architect Wilhelm Spahr, which would be later amended by the Ecuadorian architect Pedro Aulestia. This will become the future Edificio Central (Spanish for \\"Central Building\\"), located at the intersection of the Vargas and Juan Pablo Arenas streets. It was the second public Neoclassical style building of Ecuador, after the Teatro Nacional Sucre and became an icon of the architectural landscape of Quito, in the first half of the 20th century. The building was constructed on top of irregular terrain. Spahr used this irregularity to his advantage by adding some series of long stone staircases leading up to the Neoclassical fa√ßade, which added up to the monumentality of the whole structure. In this way, the fa√ßade of the school overlooks the entire Juan Pablo Arenas street. Two stone busts rest at the base of the first set of staircases. One depicting Mr. Eloy Alfaro, founder of the institution. The other representing Jos√© Mej√≠a Lequerica, patron of the institution. The Neoclassical style displayed by the Edificio Central is inspired by the architectural style of the 16th century Italian and English rural mansions designed by the Paduan architect Andrea Palladio. Characteristic of this Palladian style is the school's fa√ßade composed of tall columns of several floors high and its pediment. The walls of the Edificio Central are made out of brick and were originally left uncladded until the 1950s when several parts of the building were painted in white, in particular the fa√ßade. This lack of cladding would have been the result of a lack of funding. The building possesses a tiled roof and timber floors. Spahr originally envisioned the central part of the building (marked by the fa√ßade) as serving for administrative purposes, whereas the pavilions on both extremes were conceived as student accommodations, and the sections in between as spaces for laboratories and classrooms. But by 1928 this idea was abandoned and the pavilions at both ends of the Edificio Central were repurposed to fit more classrooms and laboratories. = Edificio Internado = = Edificio Sur = It was built in 1955, neighbouring the Edificio Central of the Instituto Nacional Mej√≠a, it originally lodged the Ecuadorian Army School of Telecommunications, and from 1968 it also housed the Ecuadorian Army Corps of Engineers. The building was ceded to the Instituto Nacional Mej√≠a in the 1970s, due to the latter's struggle to cope with its high demand of students. The building is nowadays part of a larger complex that occupies its entire block, separated from the rest of the educational centre by the Antonio Ante street. The original building presents Mudejar and Art Deco architectural elements. = Stadium =  Library  Eugenio Espejo's manuscript \\"Reflexions on Smallpox\\" (1785) is kept at the Library of the Instituto Nacional Mej√≠a. The library of the Instituto Nacional Mej√≠a holds about 45 000 books and is open to the public. The oldest of its books dates back to 1656 and was written by the Augustinian friar Gaspar de Villaroel. The collection also includes Reflexiones Acerca de las Viruelas (1785), \\"Reflexions on Smallpox\\", a medical manuscript by the prominent 18th century physician, writer, and lawyer Eugenio Espejo, who would become \\"the first scholar to address issues of prophylaxis and hygiene in the Real Audiencia of Quito\\". Following the expulsion of the Society of Jesus from Ecuador, its members abandoned the country leaving behind their entire library collections, which were then stored in several sacks. Then, during the presidency of Eloy Alfaro, founder of the high school, the Jesuits' book collections were distributed among the National Library, the Library of the Central University of Ecuador (UCE), and the Library of the Instituto Nacional Mej√≠a. This accounts for the latter's ownership of books that significantly predate the founding itself of the high school.  Museums  The Instituto Nacional Mej√≠a possesses two museums within its architectural complex: a natural history museum and an ethnographic museum. Both are open to the public. = Natural History Museum = Known as Museo de Ciencias Naturales (\\"Museum of Natural Science\\"), it is regarded as one of the first and most important of its kind in the country. It contains a collection of 2 847 animals comprising 2 246 birds, 293 mammals, 172 reptiles, 122 fish, and 14 amphibians. It was founded in 1905 by disposition of Mr. Eloy Alfaro, who ordered the purchase of 50 animal specimens from the Deyrolle house in Paris along with some national specimens. In 1920 there was an acquisition of an additional 1 000 specimens of Ecuadorian fauna. The collection was later transferred to the Edificio Central (Central Building) once its construction was completed, where it remains today. As the years progressed, the collection would continue to grow intermittently with the addition of private collections from leading families of the country. In 1936, Gustavo Orc√©s, regarded as the father of Zoology studies in Ecuador, insisted on identifying and classifying the ornithologic section held at the museum. During this work, the pioneer Ecuadorian zoologist managed to identify specimens pertaining to around 1 000 species of the 1 400 known in the country at the time. In 1943, he finished his taxonomic labour at the museum. In 1981, an agreement with the Central Bank of Ecuador ensured the funding for the restoration and rehabilitation of the museum. This intervention was scientific and museographic in character and it included once again the participation of Gustavo Orc√©s, along with other teachers of the high school such as Fernando Ortiz, Osvaldo B√°ez, and Bol√≠var Reinoso. As already established, the collection of birds is the most important and numerous of the museum. It includes birds as diverse as \\"curiquingues\\", \\"tayos\\", condors, and various species of tucans, owls, gavilans and parrots. In addition, there are embalmed species of Gal√°pagos tortoise, sharks, iguanas, snakes, and mammals like the jaguar, armadillos, bats, rodents and marsupials. = Ethnographic Museum = The Ethnographic Museum contains a collection of 57 wooden sculptures with traditional clothing and settings depicting several of the ethnic groups of the country, covering the three natural regions of the Ecuadorian mainland and divided into 18 rooms. It also serves as the de facto Anthropological Museum of Ecuador. In 1950, the pieces of the Anthropological Museum of Ecuador were owned by the National Institute of Anthropology and Geography, and were exhibited until 1952. In 1974 those pieces (22 wooden sculptures) were donated to the Instituto Nacional Mej√≠a, thus establishing its Ethnographic Museum. The author of the pieces was the sculptor Galo Tobar. A total of 21 ethnicities are depicted in the 18 rooms. The aim of the museum is to represent some of the multiple ethnic groups of Ecuador in their daily (traditional) activities. The groups represented include Shuar, Achuar, Cof√°n, Huaorani, Salasaca, Tsachila, Aw√°, Saraguro and Otavalo people among others. It also includes sculptures of Danzantes of Cayambe (also known as Danzantes of Aricucho), and Danzantes of Huachi. In addition, this museum possesses some original indigenous items such as head rings, and \\"tzantzas\\". It also displays some embalmed specimens of local animals, dioramas, and fragments of Ecuadorian megafauna bones.

Ortega, 480 U.S. 709 (1987), is a United States Supreme Court decision on the Fourth Amendment rights of government employees with regard to administrative searches in the workplace, during investigations by supervisors for violations of employee policy rather than by law enforcement for criminal offenses. It was brought by Magno Ortega, a doctor at a California state hospital after his supervisors found allegedly inculpatory evidence in his office while he was on administrative leave pending an investigation of alleged misconduct. Some of what they uncovered was later used to impeach a witness who testified on his behalf at the hearing where he unsuccessfully appealed his dismissal. Although lower courts had considered the issue, it was the first time the Supreme Court had. By a 5-4 margin, the Court ruled that public employees retain their Fourth Amendment rights. Justice Sandra Day O'Connor's plurality opinion established an \\"operating realities\\" test for future courts to consider when public employees challenged searches during investigations, reflecting the lower reasonable suspicion standard the government had to meet as an employer. That did not establish binding precedent, since Antonin Scalia argued in a separate concurring opinion that her standard was too vague, and that the same searches which would be reasonable for a private employer were proper when conducted by their public counterparts. Harry Blackmun wrote for four dissenting justices that the search was clearly an investigatory one and thus a breach of the doctor's privacy. Since it could not decide how to apply that standard to Ortega's case as the record at that time did not establish whether the entry into Ortega's office had been for search purposes or not, the majority remanded the case to the district court. Eleven more years of litigation followed. At some points during it Ortega had to represent himself, and the Court itself had taken the unusual step of inviting Joel Klein to argue Ortega's case before them. It went back and forth between the district and appellate courts twice. Ortega finally prevailed after a jury trial in the late 1990s, and the Ninth Circuit denied Ortega's superiors their appeal. Despite the two different standards resulting from the split five-justice majority, lower courts have generally followed O'Connor's \\"operational realities\\" test in future cases involving actual searches. Observers thought the justices might resolve the conflict the next time a similar case of public employees alleging a search violated their Fourth Amendment rights came before it. When it did, in 2010's Ontario v. Quon, they declined to do so, leaving the matter open for yet another future Court. Underlying dispute In March 1981, Dr. Ortega, for 17 years the head of the psychiatric residency program at Napa State Hospital, a mental hospital in Napa, California, purchased a new Apple II computer to use in running the program. Half of the money for it had been donated by some of the residents; Ortega covered the rest. A month later, he asked Dr. Dennis O'Connor, the hospital's executive director and his superior, to sign some thank-you letters to the residents who had made contributions, and to authorize some purchase orders for peripherals and other accessories for the computer. O'Connor was not sure whether the computer had been properly donated to the hospital, and hesitated to sign the letters. Two months later, Ortega suspended a resident for failing to report for a rotation. The resident complained to Dorothy Owen, the hospital's personnel director, that Ortega was retaliating against him for not only having not contributed to the purchase of the computer but advising other residents to ask him for their money back. In late July, Owen told O'Connor of the resident's complaint. O'Connor asked Richard Friday, the hospital administrator, to begin an investigation into the resident's allegations specifically and the purchase of the computer generally. He gave Friday and his investigative team broad authority, including permission to search Ortega's office. The hospital otherwise had no policy on such searches. O'Connor asked Ortega to take administrative leave the next day. Ortega instead received O'Connor's approval for two weeks of paid vacation, after which the administrative leave began. O'Connor told Ortega not to return to the hospital without his permission during his vacation. During the time Ortega was on vacation, Friday had the lock changed and kept the key in his own office. When Ortega's vacation ended, O'Connor sent a letter to Ortega informing him he was now on paid administrative leave, and extending the restriction on visits to the hospital. Before Ortega had received it, he returned to the hospital. Finding his office door locked and unable to open it himself, he took the computer, then in an unsecured nearby room, home to work with it there, as he had done on occasion in the past. Upon learning of this, O'Connor called the hospital police, believing that the computer was state property and thus Ortega had stolen it. At some other point during the time Ortega was on vacation and leave, a staff psychiatrist who ran a support group for residents told O'Connor about complaints of possible sexual harassment on Ortega's part from two female residents. It was not clear whether this took place before or after at least one thorough, highly intrusive search of Ortega's office. Materials were removed from Ortega's office, boxed and stored when the security guard performing the inventory found it too difficult to sort out Ortega's property from the state's. On a separate visit to Ortega's office, Friday found several items‚Äîa Valentine, suggestively posed photo and inscribed book of love poetry‚Äîsent to Ortega several years earlier by a former resident. After the hospital fired Ortega in September, he appealed to the State Personnel Board. When the former resident testified on Ortega's behalf during the hearing, these items were introduced in an attempt to impeach her. Owen asked Ortega after the firing if he wanted his personal possessions from his office returned. He did not. By spring of 1982 he had changed his mind. In response to another request, Asher Rubin, the deputy attorney general who had represented the state before the Personnel Board, told him he could make copies of his personal papers but could not keep the originals, nor any of his other personal property. Litigation Ortega retained an attorney and filed a Section 1983 suit against O'Connor (who had now become director of the California Department of Mental Health) Owen, Friday, other parties and the state shortly afterwards in federal court, seeking $750,000 in compensatory and punitive damages. In addition to the violation of his Fourth Amendment protections against unreasonable search and seizure, he made tort claims for invasion of privacy and breach of covenant of good faith and fair dealings under California law. The defendants argued that they had entered Ortega's office and gone through the contents of his desk purely to inventory property and separate state-owned items from the doctor's personal possessions, which it claimed was standard practice when employees had resigned or been terminated. Both sides moved for summary judgement, which Judge John P. Vukasin Jr. granted to the defendants on all claims. It found that the entry into Ortega's office had been for the purpose of securing state property for use by a successor. Ortega appealed to the Ninth Circuit. In 1985 a three- judge panel unanimously reversed the district court on the search but upheld it on the state-law tort claims. \\"The entry into the office seems to have been for no other purpose than to secure evidence for use in the ongoing investigation of Ortega,\\" Judge Dorothy Wright Nelson wrote.\\" While the state had said that the entry to the office was not intended as a search, she noted that at the time the doctor had not yet been fired or resigned but was merely on administrative leave. Nor did this seem to have been regularly undertaken in situations where it did apply. After that finding, Wright considered whether such a warrantless search was reasonable under the Fourth Amendment. She applied the two-pronged test from the Supreme Court's 1967 Katz v. United States decisionKatz v. United States, . to establish whether Dr. Ortega had a reasonable expectation of privacy over the contents of his desk and office. First, did he have a subjective expectation that they would be left undisturbed by others, and second, would that expectation be one that society would consider reasonable and respect? On the first prong, he had occupied the office for all 17 years of his employment. He kept within his desk not only personal papers and effects but confidential patient records. He had believed he had the only key, and was not aware of any other time during his employment at Napa in which his office had been entered without his permission. In Mancusi v. DeForte,Mancusi v. DeForte, . the Supreme Court had held that an employee can have a reasonable expectation of privacy over his or her desk at work from searches by law enforcement.The Court, in that case, overturned the conviction of a Long Island labor union official on corruption and racketeering-related charges since the principal evidence had been taken from his desk by investigators who only had a subpoena. Two cases from the Third Circuit, with direct similarities to Ortega's, argued for the reasonableness of his privacy expectation. In one, the presence of sensitive and confidential documents within a deskIn that case, a member of the Fair Lawn, New Jersey, school board had opened a guidance counselor's desk drawer and found the original draft of a pseudonymously published cartoon that ridiculed the board. was held to strengthen the privacy expectation; and in the other, the personal lock that a police officer had used for his department locker led to the suppression of a sawed-off shotgun seized by federal agents. In the latter case, the department had also lacked a formal policy on whether the lockers could be searched, as had been the case at Napa. This Wright used to distinguish it and Ortega's case from other precedentsUnited States v. Bunkers, 521 F.2d 1217 (9th Cir. 1975); United States v. Collins, 349 F.2d 863 (2d Cir. 1965), cert. denied, and where warrantless searches of public employees' lockers, jackets or backpacks had been upheld due to broadly disseminated and actively implemented policies that such searches could occur at any time. \\"Here, Napa had never instituted surveillance or searches and had no general inspection policy that might have defeated Ortega's expectation of privacy in his office,\\" she concluded. The appeals court ordered the district court to enter judgement in Ortega's favor on that issue and hold proceedings to fix damages. The pendent state-law claims had not been filed in a timely fashion, and the panel affirmed that part of the summary judgement. Before the Court The state of California's certiorari petition was granted by the Supreme Court in 1985. Since he was representing himself, Ortega filed his own brief. The Court invited Joel Klein, the future New York City Schools Chancellor then in private practice, to argue Ortega's case,. and he also filed an amicus curiae brief on Ortega's behalf. The appellants' brief was filed by California Attorney General John Van de Kamp and several of his assistants. Solicitor General Charles Fried filed an amicus brief on behalf of the federal government urging reversal. The American Civil Liberties Union and American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees urged affirmance in their amici. Oral arguments were held in October 1986. =Petitioners' oral argument= Jeffrey T. Miller, one of Van de Kamp's deputies, argued for the petitioners. He did not deny that government employees had Fourth Amendment rights, but \\"the activity that took place in this case did not constitute a search within Fourth Amendment jurisprudence\\". He insisted that the Court should follow the district court's lead in finding that Dr. Ortega's office had been inventoried, not searched, until he was reminded that the district court had merely found the action to be a securing of the property in case Ortega returned to remove something else, and had not even used the word \\"inventory.\\" It would not have been reasonable for the doctor to have imagined that no one else would or could have entered the office without his consent or knowledge in the 17 years he was employed at Napa. Likewise, a desk was a \\"common repository\\", likely to be used by many people besides the one regularly seated behind it. \\"It is foreseeable that a number of different people working for government, from clerical staff to supervisors to colleagues, will move into an office, that is, enter an office, open a desk for a variety of reasons.\\" When Justice Sandra Day O'Connor challenged him as to whether employees in the private sector would have a reasonable expectation of privacy over their desks, he agreed that they might but reminded her the Fourth Amendment does not apply to private employers. He asked that the Court follow the logic of its 1985 ruling in New Jersey v. T. L. O.New Jersey v. T. L. O., . in which it had held that only a reasonable belief that evidence of misconduct would be found was needed to justify a search of a student or possessions on school property during school hours. Chief Justice William Rehnquist asked Miller if he was arguing the Fourth Amendment did not apply at all in schools. \\"it seems to me there is certainly language in T.L.O. against you on that point.\\" That case, Miller responded, \\"had at least made the initial inquiry into whether the Fourth Amendment was applicable.\\" The other justices were not convinced that Ortega's office had been entered for inventory purposes. They pointed to facts in the record they saw as being at odds with the state's interpretation. Antonin Scalia asked if it were possible that the Court could rule that it was an inventory but the actions taken had exceeded the scope of those necessary to accomplish that. Miller said that would be moot as there was no expectation of privacy over the desk and office. He further explained that Ortega's key may have given him a subjective expectation of privacy, but not necessarily a reasonable one. Miller admitted to Thurgood Marshall that he did not know why the inventory could not have been done in Ortega's presence to better facilitate the sorting of property. He noted that most public agencies have an Inspector General or something similar, who \\"every now and then drops in on offices to see if employees have their own things in their office\\". When Justice Byron White asked if his position implied that a public agency could search its employees' desks or offices at any time of the day or night, he said yes. \\"It may give rise to work grievances, to state and common law tort remedies ... but it would not violate the Fourth Amendment in our view.\\" =Respondent's oral argument= \\"Our argument rests on three propositions\\", Klein told the justices. \\"[F]irst, that it is both customary and reasonable for a public employee to keep personal papers and effects in his work office and to expect that the privacy of such materials will be protected against arbitrary searches or seizures by his employer; second, that the application of the Fourth Amendment to office searches is not incompatible with the government's responsibilities as an employer.\\" Before he could get to the third, he was challenged by Scalia, who posited a situation where he might be working late and need to retrieve a document or file. He would find it on the desk of one of his clerks, who might have gone home for the day. \\"Now,\\" he asked, \\"have I conducted a Fourth Amendment search and seizure, and I am only immune from ... suit because it was reasonable? Klein conceded to another justice's follow-up question that it was understood that, in all offices, \\"our expectation is, in the evenings, when people go home, others may on the basis of need enter ... The Fourth Amendment does not apply in most situations to a routine office entry, that is, if an employer or co-worker walks into your office looking for a paper clip.\\" However, he said, that understanding did not defeat an expectation of privacy, likening it to a hotel room, where the Court had previously held there was an expectation of privacy even though hotel staff routinely enter for janitorial purposes. Scalia asked if it would be a Fourth Amendment violation if cleaning crews were to have looked through Ortega's desk and papers. \\"I don't think they would be exercising government authority in that situation\\", Klein answered, since the cleaning crews were presumably under instructions not to do so. O'Connor asked if it would be reasonable for a supervisor to enter an office and look through a desk to \\"discover whatever might be appropriate for work-related wrongdoing of some kind?\\" As an example, she suggested, a supervisor might want to assess an employee's progress toward a deadline. Klein did not think so, since normally such matters are handled by asking the employee to produce whatever work has been completed. To highlight his argument that the intrusion into Ortega's office had been a search rather than a property inventory, he used the example of the book of poetry, which was obviously personal property. \\"[I]f you pick up a book of poetry you don't have to open that book to find out who sent it to him.\\" It was suggested that perhaps he read poetry to his patients, but Klein responded that the state had not suggested that and that, even if he did the book was still undeniably personal property. He, too, compared the case with T.L.O., telling Justice White that he believed a search warrant might have been necessary to enter Ortega's office in this situation. \\"[L]et me just say that I think that they were looking for information to use against him to take his job away from him. He had been singled out\\", Klein said. \\"[E]ven if you take the T.L.O. standard, it is inconceivable that we could have a lower standard at the work place than we have at the school given the interests of employees and their adult age ... [T]here has to be reasonable suspicion when you go in to do the search that you will uncover evidence.\\" If the state or the hospital had really wanted the right to enter employees' offices, it could have followed the example of the Mint and the Customs Service and promulgated a regulation stating that employees' property could be subject to search. Decision Five months later, in March 1987, the Court handed down its decision. All nine justices agreed that public employees had Fourth Amendment protections during administrative searches in the workplace, and that routine work-related intrusions as discussed at oral argument did not constitute a violation. They differed as to whether Ortega's had been breached by the search. The five- justice majority believed it could not determine the purpose of the intrusion into Ortega's office and so remanded the case to the district court to do so. Justice O'Connor wrote for a four-justice plurality that the same reasonable suspicion standard it developed for T.L.O. was applicable to administrative searches of public employees' workspace or possessions, since the \\"operational realities\\" of a public work environment may substantially reduce or eliminate a standard expectation of privacy. In a separate concurring opinion, Justice Scalia rejected that as too vague to be useful to lower courts, and proposed instead that any search that would be reasonable for a private employer would be permissible for a public one. Justice Blackmun wrote for the four dissenting justices. He believed the majority had put too much weight on the different interpretations of the intrusion by the district and appellate courts, since he felt it was clearly an investigatory search for evidence against Dr. Ortega. Also, he charged, the majority had taken his concurrence in T.L.O. out of context to support its reasonableness standard. He did not feel, as they did, that outside of special cases such as the school system that it would have been detrimental to the operations of a public agency such as the hospital to have some sort of independent review and establish probable cause for an administrative search related to possible violations of policy. =Plurality opinion= After recounting the history of the case and the sweep of the Court's prior Fourth Amendment jurisprudence, O'Connor, joined by Chief Justice Rehnquist, Justice White, and Justice Powell, defined the boundaries of the workplace context as \\"those areas and items that are related to work and are generally within the employer's control.\\" Some items that passed through the workplace were personal, and as the Court had ruled in Mancusi, a reasonable expectation of privacy may exist there. \\"[W]e reject the contention made by the Solicitor General and petitioners that public employees can never have a reasonable expectation of privacy in their place of work,\\" she wrote. \\"Individuals do not lose Fourth Amendment rights merely because they work for the government, instead of a private employer.\\"O'Connor v. Ortega, , 712‚Äì17. She immediately qualified that holding. Moving from the general principle to the case at hand, O'Connor agreed that Ortega had that same reasonable expectation of privacy, but that since the record did not reflect the extent of whatever legitimate work-related reasons the hospital administrators might have had to enter the office, the Ninth Circuit should have remanded the case to the district court to determine that, as the majority was doing. Following T.L.O., she said the inquiry should not stop with determining the Fourth Amendment applied, but whether the context made the search reasonable. \\"We must balance the invasion of the employees' legitimate expectations of privacy against the government's need for supervision, control, and the efficient operation of the workplace.\\"O'Connor, at 719‚Äì20. There was, O'Connor admitted, \\"surprisingly little case law\\" on the subject. That which existed did seem to support the standard she proposed for work-related searches, most notably a 1973 case from the Seventh Circuit in which the surreptitious recording of an Internal Revenue Service's agent's conversations at his desk by the agency's internal investigators was held to be reasonable and work-related, and a 1951 case from the District of Columbia which held that although a search of the appellee's desk by local police with her government supervisor's permission was unconstitutional, a work-related search by her supervisor would not have been. She distinguished these from other cases that proposed other standards for public workplace searches by noting that those cases were either not work- related or involved criminal misconduct.O'Connor, 480 U.S. at 721. \\"In our view,\\" O'Connor continued, She quoted from Connick v. Myers, an earlier case which had considered the First Amendment rights of an assistant prosecutor fired for allegedly disruptive behavior: \\"[G]overnment offices could not function if every employment decision became a constitutional matter.\\"O'Connor, 480 U.S. at 722. O'Connor announced that the Court would consider only the constitutionality of work-related and investigatory searches \\"and leave for another day inquiry into other circumstances.\\" She found \\"the efficient and proper operation of the workplace\\" to similarly justify investigatory searches, since supervisors had different needs from law enforcement. \\"The delay in correcting the employee misconduct caused by the need for probable cause, rather than reasonable suspicion, will be translated into tangible and often irreparable damage to the agency's work, and ultimately to the public interest.\\" She again cited T.L.O. to justify this standard.O'Connor, 480 U.S. at 723‚Äì24. \\"Government offices are provided to employees for the sole purpose of facilitating the work of an agency. The employee may avoid exposing personal belongings at work by simply leaving them at home.\\"O'Connor, 480 U.S. at 725. Lastly O'Connor found the district court's finding on summary judgment that the intrusion was for the purposes of securing state property to be in error since there was a genuine dispute of fact. It followed then that the appellate court could not have made a definitive finding of fact either. The case was remanded to the district court with instructions to both determine what justified the search and seizure of Ortega's property and whether that search was reasonable in both its inception and scope.O'Connor, 480 U.S. at 726‚Äì29. =Scalia concurrence= Justice Scalia agreed that the case should be remanded, but felt it was not helpful to call for a case-by-case assessment, since it was difficult to make practical use of. He found fault with O'Connor's comment, justifying her \\"operating realities\\" test, that some public workplaces might be \\"so open\\" as to offer no reasonable expectation of privacy. \\"No clue is provided as to how open 'so open' must be; much less is it suggested how police officers are to gather the facts necessary for this refined inquiry ... [I]t is so devoid of content that it produces, rather than eliminates, uncertainty in this field.\\"O'Connor, 480 U.S. at 729‚Äì30 (Scalia, J., concurring). The plurality's standard could not be right if it led to a conclusion that the Fourth Amendment did not apply to a work-related entry into Ortega's office. Whether it was a supervisor or police officer entering the office, he said, only made a difference as to whether the search was reasonable, not whether the Fourth Amendment applies. When a firefighter enters a house where an alarm has gone off, he noted, \\"we do not ask whether the occupant has a reasonable expectation of privacy (and hence Fourth Amendment protection) vis-a-vis firemen, but rather whether‚Äîgiven the fact that the Fourth Amendment covers private dwellings‚Äîintrusion for the purpose of extinguishing a fire is reasonable\\",O'Connor, 480 U.S. at 730‚Äì31 (Scalia, J., concurring). citing the Court's Michigan v. Tyler ruling..That case had dealt with Fourth Amendment rights during the subsequent investigations of the fire, not the firefighters' initial entry. Scalia argued that the offices and desks of public employees were covered by the Fourth Amendment as a general matter, choosing his words to avoid the Katz rule that places exposed to public view are not covered by the Fourth Amendment since some government offices, as O'Connor had noted, were subject to unrestricted public access. \\"Government searches to retrieve work-related materials or to investigate violations of workplace rules‚Äîsearches of the sort that are regarded as reasonable and normal in the private employer context‚Äîdo not violate the Fourth Amendment.\\" Since the evidence in the case did not support a summary judgement, he joined his colleagues in ordering the case remanded.O'Connor, at 731‚Äì32 (Scalia, J., concurring). =Dissent= At the outset of his dissent, signed by Justices Brennan, Marshall and Stevens, Justice Blackmun said \\"The facts of this case are simple and straightforward. Dr. Ortega had an expectation of privacy in his office, desk, and file cabinets, which were the target of a search by petitioners that can be characterized only as investigatory in nature.\\" He disagreed with the plurality that there was anything special about a public workplace that justified a lower standard for such searches, and called the intrusion an unconstitutional search. Not only had it found what were to him clear facts in dispute,In his footnote 3, Blackmun accused the plurality of letting its opinion on this issue be shaped by its members' antipathy to public workers. it had nevertheless chosen to derive a standard from a case it had remanded to resolve that dispute. \\"As a result, the standard that emerges makes reasonable almost any workplace search by a public employer.\\"O'Connor, 480 U.S. at 732‚Äì34 (Blackmun, J., dissenting). As to the facts, Blackmun contended the plurality had been confused, partially relying on Ortega's removal of the computer as a reason to consider the intrusion reasonable when, he noted, the record itself had testimony from Friday that this had not triggered the search. Dr. O'Connor had further admitted in his deposition that there was an investigatory interest in the contents of Ortega's office. The searchers had also consulted with a lawyer and waited until the evening. \\"The search in question stemmed neither from a Hospital policy nor from a practice of routine entrances into Dr. Ortega's office\\", he wrote. \\"It was plainly exceptional and investigatory in nature. Accordingly, there is no significant factual dispute in this case.\\"O'Connor, 480 U.S. at 735‚Äì36. Blackmun began his disagreement with the plurality's embrace of the reasonable suspicion standard by agreeing with it that government employees retained their Fourth Amendment rights at work. He accepted as well that routine work-related intrusions might diminish their expectation of privacy. He did not accept that such intrusions would eliminate it.O'Connor, 480 U.S. at 737. The Court had always recognized Fourth Amendment rights in offices, he said, despite the understanding that it would be visited by others. The plurality did recognize, he conceded, another point: that a search unreasonable in one context might be reasonable in another.In his footnote 2, Blackmun responded to Scalia's criticism by quoting from other opinions, most by his fellow dissenters, to the effect that a case-by-case analysis might be the only way to create effective Fourth Amendment jurisprudence But Thus he thought it especially important that the context of the search be considered.O'Connor, 480 U.S. at 739‚Äì40. Justice Blackmun reminded the plurality that his concurring opinion in T.L.O., from which Justice O'Connor had drawn support for her \\"special need\\" argument, was meant to address an error he believed that case's plurality had made. The balancing test he had proposed there was not needed here, since \\"[t]here was no special practical need that might have justified dispensing with the warrant and probable cause requirements.\\" The time and effort required to get a warrant, he said, would not have detracted from the hospital's mission of providing quality patient care and educating new psychiatrists. An independent review by a magistrate might, he added, have helped make the search not only constitutional but more efficient, since they would have been forced to list and justify every aspect of the office and desk they wished to look through.O'Connor, 480 U.S. at 741‚Äì42. And even if there were a special need, the balancing test would still not be necessary. Despite claiming to have drawn well-defined standards from the facts of the case, the two categories of searches it had approved as not requiring warrants, they were, Blackmun felt, so broadly drawn that \\"it is difficult to imagine a search that would not fit into one or the other ...\\"O'Connor, 480 U.S. at 745‚Äì46. Reaction The case was closely watched by the parties to National Treasury Employees Union v. Von Raab, then on appeal to the Fifth Circuit and seen as likely to reach the Supreme Court (as it eventually did). It involved a challenge by employees of the United States Customs Service to a proposal by the agency that employees in certain positions submit to mandatory drug testing. The employees' union had sued to block it, arguing it was a violation of their Fourth Amendment protections. The union and the American Civil Liberties Union, which had also filed an amicus brief urging affirmance in O'Connor, praised the court's holding that public employees had Fourth Amendment rights in the workplace. They said it made their arguments in Von Raab stronger. The Justice Department maintained that it still believed the Customs Service's drug testing requirement would be held constitutional. Disposition Within two months of the Court's decision the Ninth Circuit formally remanded it to the district court. A new trial was held five years later, in 1992, again before Judge Vukasin. Dr. Ortega once again had to represent himself, and when the defense failed to receive his witness list the court sanctioned him by refusing to allow him to present them. As a result, he was largely limited to cross- examining the opposing witnesses, and when the defense was done presenting its case the court granted its motion for a directed verdict. Ortega appealed to the Ninth Circuit again, retaining his lawyer to do so. He challenged not only the sanctioning but the trial court's refusal to let him include Asher Rubin as a defendant. In late 1994 a three-judge panel heard the case; it announced its decision five months later. Circuit judge Diarmuid O'Scannlain wrote for a unanimous panel that the sanctions, while within limits of judicial discretion, had so adversely affected Ortega's case that the verdict was tainted. Reduced to merely cross-examining opposing witnesses, he could not present his own case-in-chief. And, further, they were unjustified as the trial record included a letter from Ortega to Paul Hammerness, the assistant attorney general handling the case, referring to \\"the enclosed witness list\\", that had been stamped as received by the court in November 1992. \\"The court appears to have overlooked this evidence of Dr. Ortega's compliance\\", O'Scannlain wrote. \\"Dr. Ortega's compliance is not negated by the fact that opposing counsel failed to receive the list.\\" Therefore, the sanctions against his witnesses had clearly been erroneous. The panel then affirmed the district court on its denial of the additional defendant, as the district court that had first heard the case dismissed that defendant on prosecutorial immunity grounds. Had Ortega wished to challenge that holding, the panel said, he had to have done so on his original appeal to the Ninth Circuit. On remand, O'Connor and Friday, the only defendants left, changed their strategy and asserted qualified immunity,Qualified immunity bars suits against those acting under color of law for actions that might have been illegal, or were later prohibited, but for which there was a lack of settled law at the time. for the first time, dropping their claim that the need to secure or inventory state property justified their intrusion. Instead, they said, the claims of misconduct, particularly the alleged sexual harassment, made it necessary. During pretrial motions, Judge Marilyn Hall Patel, who took over the case since Vukasin had died, barred the use of qualified immunity and ruled that sexual harassment could not have justified the search. As a result, both parties agreed not to introduce the book of poetry, photo and Valentine. A jury found for Ortega on all his claims. It awarded him $376,000 in compensatory damages, and $35,000 and $25,000 respectively against O'Connor and Friday respectively. Afterward, the district court awarded almost $32,000 in attorney's fees.Graham v. Ortega (Cal. Ct. App.) (unpublished). O'Connor and Friday appealed. A three-judge panel, including two of the judges who had been on the 1985 panel, found Patel's rulings on qualified immunity and the sexual harassment claims worthy of consideration. Stephen Reinhardt, one of those original judges, noted that Judge Vukasin had rejected the qualified immunuity defense at the first trial and that the jury instructions Patel and both sides had approved made such a defense possible even if the exact words \\"qualified immunity\\" were not used. Nor were the defendants correct in arguing that there was no settled law before the Supreme Court's ruling. \\"[I]t was clearly established in 1981 that, in the absence of an accepted practice or regulation to the contrary, government employees such as Dr. Ortega had a reasonable expectation of privacy in their private offices, desks, and file cabinets, thereby triggering the protections of the Fourth Amendment with regard to searches and seizures\\", Reinhardt wrote. He quoted explicit language to that effect from the Supreme Court's 1966 holding in Hoffa v. United States. and noted the Supreme Court plurality's citation of existing lower- court holdings saying the same thing. Even if it had not been, it was not \\"reasonable under the circumstances\\", as Terry v. Ohio. required. O'Connor and Friday had argued that, by denying them the opportunity to raise the sexual harassment claims as a justification for the search, Patel had improperly granted what amounted to sua sponte partial summary judgement against them. Reinhardt countered that they had had adequate time to develop their defense and so the judge was \\"procedurally free\\" to do that. He turned to whether such a ruling was justified and not an abuse of discretion. Even if he resolved an issue of disputed fact in their favor and assumed that O'Connor and Friday knew of the sexual harassment allegations before they went into Ortega's office, the allegations themselves were vague, and one of them was ten years old. Thus, he continued, they did not create a reasonable suspicion that he was harassing residents, and even if they did they could not have reasonably established a likelihood that evidence supporting them would be found there. \\"The search was, at best, a general and unbounded pursuit of anything that might tend to indicate any sort of malfeasance‚Äîa search that is almost by definition, unreasonable.\\" It had also been properly excluded since its prejudicial value outweighed its probative value. \\"It is now seventeen years since the search of Dr. Ortega's office occurred and his most personal letters and possessions were examined and seized. It is time to bring this matter to a conclusion\\", wrote Reinhardt. He dismissed the remaining grounds for appeal as meritless, and the panel unanimously upheld the district court. The appellate decision was not further appealed. After the state paid his claim, amounting to over $700,000 with interest, Dr. Ortega was sued by one of his former attorneys for unpaid bills. The two settled the claim in arbitration, but after Ortega refused to comply, the attorney sued him and won an adjustment to the arbitration award correcting some errors made in calculating the interest rate. A state appellate court upheld the trial court verdict in 2001, saying Ortega's \\"often rambling and incoherent narratives\\" in briefs he wrote himself left them with little in the way of substantive legal argument. Ortega died in 2009. Subsequent jurisprudence The first case after O'Connor to involve the Fourth Amendment rights of government employees at work was, as expected, National Treasury Employees Union v. Von Raab. A 5-4 majority held that the urine testing the Customs Service proposed for internal promotion to positions involving drug interdiction, carrying firearms or handling classified material was reasonable since it was \\"not designed to serve the ordinary needs of law enforcement.\\"National Treasury Employees Union v. Von Raab, . Scalia, in a dissent joined by Stevens, called the program \\"a kind of immolation of privacy and human dignity in symbolic opposition to drug use\\". The Customs Service, he said, had not introduced \\"real evidence of a real problem that will be solved by urine testing.\\"Von Raab, 489 U.S. at 681, Scalia, J., dissenting. Later, when turning down a 1997 challenge by employees of Puerto Rico Telephone to a proposed video surveillance plan, Judge Bruce M. Selya of the First Circuit called O'Connor \\"[t]he watershed case in this enclave of Fourth Amendment jurisprudence\\". His opinion surveyed a number of other district and circuit cases considering the \\"operating realities\\" of public workplaces to establish whether a legitimate expectation of privacy existed. A key issue was whether the workplace or portion in question was reserved for the employee's personal use. A judge in the District of Kansas had granted summary judgement to Johnson County Community College against its security guards who challenged its video surveillance of their locker room by noting that the locker area under view was not exclusive to any of them. This distinguished it from the Drug Enforcement Administration's surreptitious videotaping of two agents convicted of illegal wiretapping, where the Ninth Circuit suppressed the videos because it found the agents had exclusive use of their offices. In a New York case that echoed Scalia's questions to Klein at oral argument, the Second Circuit found it reasonable for a judge to have court officers seize the contents of his just-fired law clerk's desk since the relationship between the two required free and complete access to each other's papers. As in cases preceding O'Connor, a workplace policy on searches has been held to defeat or diminish expectations of privacy. The Ninth Circuit upheld a civilian engineer's discharge from the Naval Reserve was upheld on the grounds that regular workplace searches removed any expectation of privacy over documents revealing his bisexuality. An unenforced or absent policy has been held to create a legitimate expectation. =Ontario v. Quon= As Ortega's dispute with his lawyer was coming to an end, elsewhere in California the events were unfolding that would lead to the next case where the Court would consider the Fourth Amendment rights of public employees during administrative investigations. In 2000 the city of Ontario purchased 20 alphanumeric pagers for its police department SWAT team to carry on and off-duty. A department policy, never put in writing, said that \\"light personal use\\" was permitted but that the pager messages could be audited at any time. Several officers routinely exceeded the monthly character limit. The lieutenant in charge of the pagers at first allowed them to reimburse the city for the overage fees in exchange for not auditing the messages. Later, when he was \\"tired of being a bill collector\\", he and his superiors decided to audit the text messages to see if the character limit was too low. Transcripts of the pager messages, redacted to include those sent only during work hours, showed that many of them were not work-related, and some were sexually explicit. Two officers were disciplined. Afterwards, they sued the superior officers, the department, the city and the pager provider for violation of the Stored Communications Act and their Fourth Amendment rights. The district court held a jury trial, which determined the audit was work-related, and it ruled for the defendants. On appeal the Ninth Circuit reversed, calling the audit an unreasonable search.', ( 2008). After being denied their petition for an en banc rehearing, the defendants successfully petitioned the Supreme Court for certiorari.; U.S. Supreme Court. The Court would only consider the Fourth Amendment claim, so the wireless provider was dropped as a petitioner there. The case received much attention since it also was the first time the Court had considered Fourth Amendment rights in the rapidly expanding area of electronic telecommunications. Only Scalia and Stevens remained from the O'Connor court. As a result, it was also seen as a possible chance to resolve the conflict between the plurality's \\"operating realities\\" standard and Scalia's. In June 2010, the Court unanimously upheld the search. Instead of choosing one of the O'Connor standards, it applied them both. Anthony Kennedy wrote for a seven- justice majority that since the audit had had a legitimate work-related purpose and its scope was limited to the pager messages sent at work, it was reasonable enough for the plurality in that case, and it would have been reasonable for a private-sector employer as Scalia had proposed. Stevens and Scalia both wrote separate concurring opinions. The former felt that, under the case-by-case approach Blackmun had advocated in his O'Connor dissent, Quon in this case knew or should have known all his communications could have come under public scrutiny. Scalia's opinion of the \\"operational realities\\" test remained unchanged. He called it \\"standardless and unsupported\\" and said the Quon majority \\"underscores the unworkability of that standard\\". Analysis and commentary When considering what approach the Court would take in Quon, George Washington University law professor Orin Kerr, a Fourth Amendment scholar, noted that courts have generally used the plurality standard from O'Connor. \\"Exactly how you get there is sort of tricky, though\\", he commented. \\"So courts have mostly just figured that four Justices is more than one and that they should follow the analysis in the concurring opinion.\\" O'Connor biographer Ann Cary McFeatters writes that her and Scalia's separate opinions in this case were the first of many clashes between the two justices in their joint tenure on the Court. \\"It would not be the last time Scalia went after her with verbal venom. It would not be the last time his doctrinaire certitude conflicted with her case-by-case approach.\\" Notes See also *List of United States Supreme Court cases, volume 480 *List of United States Supreme Court cases by the Rehnquist Court *Special needs exception References External links * Category:United States Supreme Court cases Category:United States Supreme Court cases of the Rehnquist Court Category:United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit cases Category:United States Fourth Amendment case law Category:United States public employment case law Category:1987 in United States case law Category:Search and seizure case law Category:Napa, California ","title":"O'Connor v. Ortega"},{"id":"30573264","text":"Seminole County, Florida (located in Central Florida) operates a system of county roads that serve all portions of the county. The Seminole County Public Works Department, Engineering Division, is responsible for maintaining all of the Seminole County roads. Most of the county roads are city streets and rural roads. The numbers and routes of state roads are assigned by the Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT), while county road numbers are assigned by the counties, with guidance from FDOT. North-south routes are generally assigned odd numbers, while east-west routes are generally assigned even numbers. The majority of county road numbers reflect their former status as state roads before they were given to the county in 1980. Former SR 13 In the early 1950s, FDOT acquired part of the Kissimmee Valley Line of the Florida East Coast Railway in Orange and Seminole Counties for highway purposes. The proposed state road was numbered as an extension of the existing State Road 13. Maps of Seminole County indicate that Snow Hill Road, to the east of the former rail line (including the portion through the Little Big Econ State Forest), was designated SR 13 from Brumley Road in Chuluota north to Old Mims Road (original SR 46) near Geneva. It is labeled on maps through 1960, but does not appear in 1971. CR 15 (former SR 15) County Road 15 follows Country Club Road, Upsala Road, and Monroe Road from CR 427 north of Longwood north to US 17/92 (SR 15) near the St. Johns River and I-4 exit 104. It passes through central Lake Mary and overlaps CR 46A in western Sanford. The 1945 definition of SR 15 included an alternate route bypassing Sanford to the west, from north of Longwood to just south of the St. Johns River. During early Interstate Highway System planning, this was to be the route of what became I-4.State Road Department of Florida, 1953 Sufficiency Ratings on the Florida Primary Road System However, no road was ever built south of CR 427, and maps indicate that a portion in northern Lake Mary was not state maintained. This spur of SR 15 became CR 15 in 1980. CR 46A (former SR 46A) County Road 46A begins at the south end of CR 431 (Orange Boulevard) near Paola and runs east on H.E. Thomas Jr. Parkway (formerly 25th Street) to US 17/92 and SR 46 in Sanford. Along the way it crosses I-4 at exit 101A and SR 417 at exit 52. SR 46A was not part of the original 1945 plans, but it was added to the state highway system by the 1950s. It originally began at Paola, north of the west end of CR 46A, and, in Sanford, it followed Country Club Road and 20th Street to end north of CR 46A's east end. The more direct route along 25th Street was present by 1971. Maps do not indicate that SR 46A returned to SR 46 at its west end, but maps after 1980, when it became CR 46A, show that route continuing west end north on Longwood Markham Road to SR 46 near the Wekiva River. This extension is not currently signed by Seminole County. CR 415 (former SR 415) County Road 415 is signed north-south, but travels directly east-west on 13th Street and Celery Avenue from US 17/92 / SR 46 in Sanford east (signed north) to SR 415 near the St. Johns River. CR 415 is part of the original SR 415 alignment defined in 1945, hence the north- south signage. When the current SR 415 was built from the St. Johns River south to SR 46 in the late 1970s, it was initially numbered State Road 415A. This route remained in 1980, but by 1984 it had become part of SR 415, and former SR 415 west into Sanford had been given to the county. Former SR 418 State Road 418 from the 1945 plan connected SR 46 (then on Old Geneva Road) north of Geneva with the community of Osceola on the St. Johns River. If it was actually taken over as a state road, it had a brief lifetime, as there is no SR 418 on the 1955 county map. CR 419 (former SR 419) County Road 419 is a part of the original SR 419 from 1945, beginning at the Orange County line and extending north and northwest through Chuluota to Oviedo. SR 419 now begins in Oviedo and continues in a northwesterly direction to US 17/92 near Lake Mary. CR 425 (former SR 425) County Road 425 follows Sanford Avenue from the north end of CR 427 (Ronald Reagan Boulevard), just north of Lake Mary Boulevard, north to SR 46 in Sanford. The current FDOT county map shows two more sections, but Seminole County does not post signs on either. One is on Dean Road from SR 426 south to Orange County, where it is also known as CR 425\\\\. The other follows Airport Boulevard between US 17/92 and SR 46, providing a western bypass of central Sanford. CR 425 is a short piece of SR 425 as defined in 1945. The route began at SR 426 and followed the entire length of Tuskawilla Road (now inventoried as CR 4281). A crossing of Lake Jesup was never built, but SR 425 began again on the north shore at the south end of Sanford Avenue, finally picking up current CR 425 to end at SR 46\\\\. By the 1950s, the Airport Boulevard segment had appeared, but maps show that it was only a state road north of Country Club Road (the original alignment of SR 46A). The Tuskawilla Road segment disappeared from maps by 1971, as did shields on Sanford Avenue south of SR 427; the Dean Road segment was never shown as a state road (but Orange County maps showed it as such). SR 425 became a county road in 1980. CR 426 (former SR 426) County Road 426 is part of the original 1945 SR 426, extending northeast from the end of present SR 426 in Oviedo northeast to SR 46 in Geneva. CR 426A County Road 426A is an extremely short (about ) signed route, extending south on Hall Road from SR 426 to the Orange County line. No shields are shown on any FDOT maps of Seminole County, but Orange County maps show that it was formerly SR 436A, not SR 426A. Former SR 426A State Road 426A existed on Red Bug Lake Road (including current Slavia Road) from SR 426 at Slavia west towards Casselberry. It first appeared on maps in 1971, and did not receive a county road number in 1980. CR 427 (former SR 427) County Road 427 follows Maitland Avenue and Ronald Reagan Boulevard along the old Dixie Highway from the Orange County line to the south end of CR 425 (Sanford Avenue) just north of Lake Mary Boulevard. Along the way, it passes through downtown Altamonte Springs (where it overlaps SR 436) and Longwood. SR 427 was not defined in 1945, but by the 1950s it existed along the current extent of CR 427\\\\. (However, a short piece in southern Longwood was part of the original route of SR 434, from North Street (where Anchor Road formerly connected) to Warren Avenue.) In 1980 the road was given to Seminole County. CR 427A (former SR 427A) County Road 427A is signed along a portion of 27th Street in the southern outskirts of Sanford, from US 17/92 east to CR 425 (Sanford Avenue). A second piece, following Airport Boulevard from CR 425 east to the Orlando Sanford International Airport, appears on the current FDOT map but is not signed. SR 427A was designated on 27th Street in the mid-1950s. The Airport Boulevard portion appeared by 1971, and both were given to the county in 1980. CR 431 (former SR 431) County Road 431 is signed on Orange Boulevard through Paola, extending north from CR 46A. No signs are posted elsewhere along the route, but FDOT GIS data indicates that the north end is at SR 46\\\\. Orange Boulevard was not the original segment of SR 431, which is now SR 434 south of Forest City. This portion appeared on the 1971 county map, extending from Paola (where SR 46A ended) north to SR 46 (then on Wayside Drive). In 1980 it became a county road, and now extends on former SR 46A to the south end of Orange Boulevard. CR 431B (former SR 431B) County Road 431B is an unsigned designation along Rinehart Road between Lake Mary Boulevard and SR 46, according to FDOT GIS data. It crosses SR 417 at exit 54. SR 431B was created by 1971, extending north only to SR 46A. The roadway north of SR 46A did not yet exist in 1980, when SR 431B was given to the county. Former CR 520 (ex-SR 520) SR 520 was extended by 1955, from its original (and current) west end east of Bithlo along SR 50 and north on Alafaya Trail to Oviedo. The road became CR 520 in 1980, but by 1984 it had returned to the state road system as an extension of SR 434\\\\.

The external power supply is the AC electric power adapter that converts household AC electricity voltages to the much lower DC voltages needed to charge a mobile phone's internal battery. Although compliance is voluntary, a majority of the world's largest mobile phone manufacturers agreed to make their applicable mobile phones compatible with Europe's common external power supply specification (EN 62684:2010). Purpose Mobile phone charger plugs According to the European Commission, a common external power supply / \\"charger\\" standard is desirable because, History In June 2009, many of the world's largest mobile phone manufacturers signed an EC-sponsored memorandum of understanding (MoU), agreeing to make most new data-enabled mobile phones marketed in the European Union compatible with a to-be-specified common EPS. All signatories agreed to develop a common specification for the EPS \\"to allow for full compatibility and safety of chargers and mobile phones.\\" 14 mobile phone manufacturers and technology providers signed the MoU ‚Äì the original 10 signatories, Apple, LG, Motorola, NEC, Nokia, Qualcomm, RIM, Samsung, Sony Ericsson, and Texas Instruments as well as Atmel, Emblaze Mobile, Huawei Technologies and TCT Mobile (Alcatel). To develop and formalize the needed technical standards, the Commission issued a standardisation mandate to CEN, CENELEC and ETSI on a common \\"charging capability for mobile telephones.\\" In response, CENELEC created a task force to develop the interoperability specifications of a common external power supply. In line with the Dresden agreement signed in 1996 by both CENELEC and the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC), work was transferred into the IEC. The aim was to develop the IEC International Standard, IEC 62684:2011. The standard was published in December 2010 as EN 62684:2010 \\"Interoperability specifications of common EPS for use with data-enabled mobile telephones\\" by CENELEC and in January 2011 by the IEC as IEC 62684:2011 (international publication was slightly delayed due to French translation) with a technical update to the IEC standard in 2018. The original Common EPS memorandum of understanding expired at the end of 2012. The Commission reported at the time that all of the fourteen MoU signatories, \\"have met their obligations under the MoU.\\" Eight of the original MoU signatories signed a 2013 Letter of Intent (LoI) to extend the 2009 MoU another year and, in 2014, five of those companies (Apple, Blackberry, Huawei, Samsung and Sony) again signed a second Letter of Intent, effectively extending the MoU through the end of 2014. Technical specifications =Reference to USB battery-charging specification= The common EPS specification relies heavily on existing USB electro-mechanical standards ‚Äì especially the USB Battery Charging Specification. By the mid-2000s, many mobile phone manufacturers (as well as manufacturers of other small battery- powered devices) had already begun designing their products with the ability to use a USB port's 5 V DC power to recharge batteries. The USB Implementers Forum, recognizing this trend, updated the USB standard in 2007 to better accommodate this popular battery-charging application of USB ports, primarily by defining \\"charging ports\\" which can provide more current allowing faster re-charging of batteries.USB Battery Charging specification released in March 2007 (version 1.0) with updates in 2009 (version 1.1) and 2010 (version 1.2) permits appropriately designed USB devices to, \\"... draw current in excess of the USB 2.0 specification for charging and/or powering up ...\\" In November 2010, the IEC signed an agreement with the USB Implementers Forum, which led to the IEC incorporating USB specifications into the IEC 62684:2011 International Standard. In March 2011, the USB Implementers Forum agreed to allow CENELEC \\"... to make reference to USB technology in its European Standard EN 62684:2010 and ... to grant download access to USB technical specifications free of charge and at any time to manufacturers implementing this European [common EPS] Standard.\\" =Cabling, connectors and adapters= EU common external power supply components EU common external power supply with captive cable A common EPS must include a cable with a micro USB-B (2.0) connector for connecting to a mobile phone. This cable can be either captive (permanently attached to the power supply) or detachable. If detachable, the cable must connect to the power supply via a standard USB type-A plug. The MoU which defines the common external power supply as well as the related EC standardisation mandate both allow for the use of the common external power supply also with phones not equipped with a micro-USB receptacle. \\"... [MoU] 4.2.1 ... if a manufacturer makes available an Adaptor from the Micro-USB connector of a Common EPS to a specific non-Micro-USB socket in the Mobile Phone, it shall constitute compliance to this article\\" and, \\"... An Adaptor can also be a detachable cable.\\" The type of AC \\"plug\\" provided on a common EPS can vary depending on the intended market of use. \\"Per regulatory requirements for each market. ... preferred supplied input voltage range should be at least 90‚Äì264 V\\" (100‚Äì240 V ¬± 10%). Reception The common EPS initiative was generally well received by the public, although at least one European consumer group bemoaned the voluntary nature and narrow scope of the initiative (as it applies only to mobile phones and only those that are \\"handheld\\" and \\"data-enabled\\") and the fact that the EU's EPS specification does not set aggressive energy efficiency no-load consumption requirements. Some observers, noting Apple's continued use of proprietary, non-micro USB charging ports on their smartphones, suggested Apple was not in compliance with the 2009 Common EPS Memorandum of Understanding. The European Commission however, confirmed that all MoU signatories, \\"have met their obligations under the MoU,\\" stating specifically, \\"Concerning Apple's previous and present proprietary connectors and their compatibility with the agreement, the MoU allows for the use of an adaptor without prescribing the conditions for its provision\\" and \\"The Commission does not have evidence that Apple has breached the [MoU] agreement. The iPhone 5 can be used with an adaptor allowing it to be connected to the common charger.\\" Pending/future European legislation In a 2013 amendment to a \\"Proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament ‚Ä¶ relating to the making available on the market of radio equipment\\", the European Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection included a recommendation for \\"... A renewed effort to develop a common charger ... [being] highly desirable and consequently ... beneficial in particular for consumers and other end-users.\\" The parliamentary proposal applies to all radio equipment (any \\"product which intentionally emits or receives radio waves for communication\\") including mobile phones, tablet computers, car door openers, modems, etc. Yet, the draft law (Directive 2014/53/EU), approved overwhelmingly by the European Parliament on 13 March 2014, stipulates that it will be up to the European Commission to decide which specific types of radio equipment will have to be compatible with common chargers.MEPs push for common charger for all mobile phones Once formally approved by the Council of Ministers, member states will have two years to transpose the new regulations into national laws and manufacturers will have an additional year after that to comply. In 2020, January, the European Parliament passed a resolution, calling upon the European Commission to adopt rules on the mandatory introduction of common chargers for all mobile devices.https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/agenda/briefing/2020-01-13/13/call- to-introduce-common-charger-for-all-mobile-phones Specifically the resolution calls upon the European Commission to, \\"...take action to introduce the common charger by adopting the delegated act supplementing Directive 2014/53/EU on radio equipment defining a standard for a common charger for mobile phones and other small and medium-sized radio equipment by July 2020, or, if necessary, by adopting a legislative measure by July 2020 at the latest;...\\" Similar regional and global industry initiatives for mobile phone charging Other mobile phone power supply and charging standards have been implemented in other parts of the world (e.g., Korea and China). Proposals for a global/industry-wide mobile phone charging solution have also been promoted by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) and by industry organizations GSMA and OMTP. The ITU and the GSMA/OMTP proposals are very similar to the European and Chinese charger standards although the GSMA/OMTP proposal is less flexible and has not been adopted by as many phone manufacturers as has the EU standard. =Charger and interface standard in South Korea= In March 2001, the Korean Telecommunications Technology Association (TTA) released a \\"Standard on I/O Connection Interface of Digital Cellular Phone\\".\\"Standard on I/O Connection Interface of Digital Cellular Phone\\" TTAS.KO-06.0028 released in March 2001. Later updated in 2002 (/R2), and in 2007 (/R4) This standard describes the electromechanical interface specifications for cellular phone charging, wired data communication, analog audio, etc. and was released together with related test and certification specifications.Related test and certification standards published (TTAS.KO-06.0029 and TTAS.KO-06.0030). The main feature of the standard is the specification of a 24-pin connector/socket for mobile phones to handle connections for power input (battery charging) and output, data communication (USB and other digital signals), analog audio inputs and outputs (for hands-free microphone, earphone) and other signals. The 2007 revision of the standard(2007 revision = TTAS.KO-06.0028/R3) specified a smaller 20-pin connector to succeed the 24-pin connector and added analog (composite) video output support, among other changes. Chargers with the new 20-pin connectors started appearing in 2008 and phone manufacturers were urged to include 24-to-20-pin adapters with new phones sold in Korea to enable the charging of new phones with the older 24-pin chargers. =Charger and interface standard in China= In December 2006, the Chinese Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MII) released a new China Communications Standards Association (CCSA) standard, \\"Technical Requirements and Test Method of Charger and Interface for Mobile Telecommunication Terminal Equipment\\".\\"Technical Requirements and Test Method of Charger and Interface for Mobile Telecommunication Terminal Equipment\\" (CCSA YD/T 1591‚Äì2006, later updated to YD/T 1591‚Äì2009) This standard describes the electromechanical requirements for a common mobile device battery charger equipped with a USB type-A socket providing power at 5 V DC. All new mobile phones requesting network access approval in China from June 2007 are required to support charging from the new common chargers. The original 2006 regulation is flexible regarding the interface on the mobile phone itself, allowing for the use of adapter cables if the mobile device is not equipped with a standard USB connector. Among other things, the 2009 update adds references to USB On-The- Go (OTG) support and the use of USB micro-B, micro-AB, mini-B; and Mini-10-pin and cylindrical (\\"barrel\\") type connectors on the terminal (phone) for charging. =GSMA universal charging solution (UCS) and OMTP common charging solution (CCS)= OMTP's common charging solution (CCS) components In February 2009, the GSM Association (GSMA), together with six mobile phone manufacturers and technology providers, and eleven mobile service providers, announced their commitment to implementing a cross-industry standard for a common/universal charging solution for new mobile phones and chargers. The aim of the GSMA initiative is \\"...to ensure that the mobile industry adopts a common format for mobile phone charger connections and energy-efficient charger...\\". Universal charging solution (UCS) chargers are required to use micro-USB as the common universal charging interface and have a four-star or higher efficiency rating (standby energy use ‚â§ 0.15 W). The Open Mobile Terminal Platform industry forum (OMTP) specified the requirements of the GSMA's Universal Charging Solution and published these requirements under the title \\"Common Charging and Local Data Connectivity\\" in 2009. This document specifies the three components of a common charging solution (CCS): a charging and local data connector (CLD) on the \\"terminal\\" (e.g., a mobile phone) consisting of a micro-B or micro-AB receptacle; a common power supply (CPS) with a type-A receptacle; and a detachable type-A to micro-B cable to connect the power supply with the mobile phone. (Final revision V1.1 published in 2010) As of early 2011, an additional 10 service providers and one additional mobile phone manufacturer have joined the agreement. In April 2009, the industry trade group The Wireless Association (CTIA) announced its support of the GSMA's Universal Charging Solution. =ITU Universal power adapter and charger solution= The International Telecommunication Union (ITU, the UN specialized agency in the field of telecommunications, information and communication technologies) announced in October 2009 that it had also embraced the universal charging solution standard‚Äîbased on input from the GSMA‚Äîas its \\"energy-efficient one-charger-fits-all new mobile phone solution.\\" The ITU published Recommendation ITU-T L.1000, specifying a charger similar in most respects to that of the GSMA/OMTP proposal and of the Chinese charger and the EU's common EPS. The ITU specifies that the OMTP's more aggressive \\"preferred\\" no load consumption requirement be mandatory after a three-year \\"transition period\\" but is more flexible in allowing the use of captive cables and USB micro-B adapters in its \\"target solution\\" ‚Äì similar to the European common EPS standard. The ITU recommendation was expanded and updated in June 2011. Other higher power charging standards for mobile devices =USB Power Delivery and Type-C specification= In 2012, the USB Power Delivery (PD) specification was released. Power Delivery provides the ability for 5 V devices to draw more than 7.5 W of power (the limit specified by USB Battery Charging) from USB PD-aware ports when using PD-aware USB cables. The specification also allows PD ports to provide even greater power at higher voltages over PD-aware cables; up to 36 W at 12 V and 60 W at 20 V (for micro- USB connectors) and up to 60 W at 12 V and 100 W at 20 V (for type-A/B connectors). In August, 2014, the USB 3.0 Promoter Group announced the completion of the USB Type-C connector and cable specification. Type-C cables and connectors are reversible and are electrically backward compatible, but not physically backward compatible, with previous USB plugs and receptacles. New-to-existing cables and adapters have been defined. Some USB Type-C cables and connectors can support \\"USB performance at SuperSpeed USB 10 Gbps (USB 3.1) and USB Power Delivery up to 100W\\" although USB Type-C cables are only required to support USB 2.0 (non-SuperSpeed) data rates and 3 A (60 W at 20 V) of current. Such minimum-specification USB Type-C cables are sometimes referred to as \\"charge\\" cables because, for most mobile device battery charging applications, 60 W is more than sufficient and a higher data transfer speed is less important than minimizing cable cost and maximizing cable length. =IEC 63002:2016, identification and communication interoperability method for external power supplies used with portable computing devices= IEC 63002:2016 defines interoperability guidelines for external power supplies used with portable computing devices that implement IEC 62680-1-2:Universal Serial Bus Power Delivery Specification with the IEC 62680-1-3: Universal Serial Bus Interfaces for data and power-Common Components-Type-CTM Type-C Cable and Connector Specification. It was published in October 2016. =IEC Technical Specification 62700: DC Power supply for notebook computer= =IEEE P1823, universal power adapter for mobile devices (UPAMD)= IEEE P1823 is a proposed global standard for a universal power adapter for mobile devices (UPAMD) that require between 10 W and 240 W. E.g., Laptops, larger tablets and other mobile devices that can require much more power than the (non-Power Delivery) USB battery charging specification limit of 7.5 W at 5 V.

Heda The need for the ship arose when Putyatin's fleet was damaged in a tsunami, following the powerful Ansei-T≈çkai earthquake of 23 December 1854. The flagship Diana sank on its way from Shimoda to Heda as it was sailing there for repairs. Following the signature of the Treaty of Shimoda with the Russians, the Japanese government decided to help the Russians return to their country by building a western-style ship. Three hundred Japanese carpenters worked with the Russian sailors to build a Western-style ship in two months, with the help of plans salvaged from the Diana. It was a two-masted schooner, weighing 100 tons, with a length of 24 meters. The ship was named in honour of the Japanese city that helped with its construction. Kimizawagata One of the Kimizawagata ships, derived from the design of Heda. Soon, the Japanese government ordered six more ships to be built on the model of the Heda, thereby contributing to the development of western-style shipbuilding in Japan. The new ship type was named Kimisawagata (ÂêõÊ≤¢ÂΩ¢). Other, were built on the same model: four ships of 500 tons of the Toyoshimagata type (Ë±äÂ≥∂ÂΩ¢), and six ships of 30 tons of the Nirayamagata type (ÈüÆÂ±±Âûã). These efforts contributed to the development of Japan's first home- built Imperial Navy steam warship, the Chiyodagata (ÂçÉ‰ª£Áî∞ÂΩ¢ÔΩ£). Other Bakufu arsenals Shipbuilding would also occur in other locations during the Bakumatsu period. For example, Uraga built the H≈ç≈ç Maru (È≥≥Âá∞‰∏∏), the Mito Domain built the Asahi-maru (Êó≠Êó•‰∏∏), the Satsuma Domain built the Shohei-Maru (ÊòáÂπ≥‰∏∏) and the Houzui-Maru (È≥≥Áëû‰∏∏), as well as Saga Domain.

Behaviour  This worm is fast-moving, and is able to swim by undulating its body.  Diet  Pseudobiceros bedfordi feeds on ascidians and on crustaceans that are small enough to swallow.  Reproduction  Two specimens of Pseudobiceros bedfordi about to engage in penis fencing Like all flatworms in the genus Pseudobiceros, they are hermaphroditic and have two penises. During mating, they fence with one another, using their penises, attempting to stab and inject sperm in their opponent, while avoiding being fertilized by their opponent.

An Aeroflot Antonov An-12BP cargo aircraft operated by the Soviet Air Force flying from Cuito Cuanavale to Luanda was shot down, allegedly by South African Special Forces, and crashed approximately east of Menongue in Angola's Cuando Cubango province. The incident took place in the aftermath of the Soviet Union-backed People's Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola's (FAPLA) operation 2 Congresso do Partido conducted against units of the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA, which received support from South Africa). The transport was carrying eight crew members, 13 passengers and two tank diesel engines in need of repairs. According to eyewitnesses from the local populace and investigative reports the aircraft was shot down by a surface-to-air missile (SAM). All people on board the aircraft died in the crash. Flight overview The aircraft involved in the incident was an Antonov An-12BP, a large Soviet- built four-engine turboprop transport, tail registration SSSR-11747. Officially a civil aircraft, it was part of an air transportation military detachment consisting of several An-12 transports and their crews, under the direct command of the Soviet Chief Military Advisor in Angola. The detachment was part of the 369th Military Transport Aviation Regiment, 7th Military Transport Aviation Division, Military Transport Aviation, based at that time in the city of Jankoi/Dzhankoy, Crimea, Ukrainian SSR. The An-12s were primarily used to support FAPLA and its military operations. All eight crew members and four of the passengers were Soviet nationals. Nine other passengers were Angolans. Crash According to eyewitness reports and the black box recordings, the An-12BP took off from Cuito Cuanavale at 11:20 am. About 15 minutes into the flight at the altitude of approximately 10,000 feet (3,000 m) the pilot reported an explosion to air traffic control on the aircraft's port side next to the wing and engines. Seconds later the pilot also reported that the transport was experiencing problems with engines three and four and stated his intention to turn towards Menongue airport, located less than away, for an emergency landing. After the explosion, the cargo of two massive tank engines came loose and shifted, altering the aircraft's center of gravity and causing it to bank to the port side. The black box recordings indicated that the crew tried to level the An-12 and turn it towards Menongue's airport for an emergency landing; however, 47 seconds after the missile detonated, the port wing exploded and separated from the aircraft. The burning aircraft then crashed in a field about away from Menongue, with the main part of the widespread wreckage landing in close proximity to the Menongue-Cuito Cuanavale road. The next day, several officers from the Soviet Military Mission in Menongue, accompanied by Cuban and Angolan troops, arrived at the crash site where they found all 21 bodies - the crew of 8 and 13 passengers - at the scene. The human remains were first transported to Menongue for identification and later to Luanda. Coffins containing the remains of the Soviet crew and passengers were then transported to the Soviet Union. =Alleged shootdown= Civilians from local villages and members of the local people's defense organization (ODP ‚Äì Organiza√ß√£o de Defesa Popular), who had witnessed the midair explosion and the crash, said they had heard and seen what they believed to be a surface-to-air missile being launched immediately before the accident. They described the sound and fume trails that originated from the ground to the point of impact in midair. The recordings of the An-12BP crew's air traffic conversation with Menongue air-defense radar operators were obtained by Angolan authorities. These were later passed on to Soviet investigators conducting their own probe into the crash. The recordings revealed that the crew had reported a missile explosion on the aircraft's port side. In the Soviet Union a specially designated commission under the direct supervision of the Chief of the Air Military Transportation Command of the Soviet Armed Forces was created to establish the cause of the crash. The commission's examination of parts of the aircraft's fuselage revealed multiple traces of an explosive matter and fragments from the surface-to-air missile. In his book Journey Without Boundaries, SADF Colonel Andr√© Diedericks, a former South African Special Forces officer, claims that he was the person who gave the order to launch the missile that brought down the An-12. During the early summer of 1985 one of the previously captured Strela-l (SA-9) systems, manned and operated by a South African Recce group under the command of then- Captain Diedericks, crossed into the Cuando Cubango province, Angola, and with UNITA's help, protection and escort was secretly deployed around the Menongue area. The main mission of the group was to carry out covert combat operations, code names \\"Catamaran 1\\" and \\"Catamaran 2\\", with the goal of disrupting air traffic in Cuando Cubango province by shooting down both Cuban and Angolan transports, combat aircraft and gunships with the Strela-l (SA-9). Diedericks' account is reiterated by Koos Stadler, another Reconnaissance Regiment soldier (colloquially known as the \\"Recces\\") in his 2015 book, RECCE: Small Team Missions Behind Enemy Lines . Casualties Crew of SSSR-11747 All 21 air force crew and military passengers were killed in the crash: * Five Soviet Air Force officers * Two Soviet Air Force warrant officers * A Soviet Military Institute of Foreign Languages translator * Four Soviet Army officers * Nine FAPLA officers In 1987, a commemorative monument, featuring images of the An-12BP's crew members and their names, was erected in the city of Dzhankoy (currently disputed between Ukraine and Russia due to the 2014 Russian annexation of Crimea), where most of them were stationed and had lived. Reactions and aftermath In the 12 hours after the crash, the after- midnight news reports issued by the BBC, the Voice of America African Service and UNITA's radio station Galo Negro made almost identical announcements: UNITA was reported as having shot down a Cuban military cargo aircraft with Cuban personnel on board, in the same area that the An-12BP was shot down, using a surface-to-air missile. The next day, on November 26, 1985, UNITA officially claimed responsibility for shooting down the aircraft. However, several months later information obtained through various intelligence sources indicated that the An-12 was brought down by a missile launched from a Soviet- made 9K31 Strela-1, a vehicle-mounted short-range guided surface-to-air missile system. Several Strela-1s had been captured by the South African Defence Force (SADF) during a prior incursion into Angola. In the aftermath of the crash, on December 5, 1985, a Mil Mi-8 helicopter was shot down. Two Mi-8 crews were tasked to provide close air support to a Cuban-reinforced infantry battalion that had orders to secure the crash area for the arrival of a team to conduct on-site investigation and help remove the wreckage for further investigation. As the battalion approached the area of the crash, it was ambushed by a far superior combined SADF/UNITA force deployed along the Menongue-Cuito Cuanavale road. A fierce fight ensued, resulting in a high number of dead and wounded from both sides. The two Mi-8s, both manned by Soviet Air Force crews, were called in to provide support for the Cuban battalion. On their arrival they came under heavy anti-aircraft ground fire. One was shot down; it crashed and burst into flames, killing the Soviet crew. There were also two Angolan soldiers from the newly formed 29th Airborne Assault Brigade, manning door-mounted guns on the helicopter, who also died in the crash.

It is based on the Chinese legend, Legend of the White Snake. Production started in September 10, 2010 and ended on January 16, 2011. The film is in 3-D and was shown out of competition at the 68th Venice International Film Festival on 3 September 2011. It was released in mainland China on 28 September 2011 and Hong Kong on 29 September. Plot Abbott Fahai and his assistant Neng Ren meet an ice harpy at the top of a mountain. The harpy turns the impetuous Neng Ren into an ice statue. Unrepentant, Fahai is forced to capture her with a demon trapper, which releases Neng Ren from the transformation. Neng Ren is then tasked to confine the ice harpy at Lei Feng Pagoda, confining it in a magic circle along with other trapped demons. On the other side of the mountain, two female snake demons (Qingqing and Susu) are playing around when they spot a physician, Xu Xian, picking herbs at the foot of the mountain with his friends. Qingqing, being a playful snake, scares him, causing him to fall into the lake below. Susu, being gentler, assumes human form and kisses Xu Xian, which allows Vital Essence to flow from her into his body thus saving him. When Xu Xian wakes up he tells his friends about the kiss, which only makes them laugh. After finding a victim of a bat demon, Fahai and Neng Ren leave the temple to subdue the bat demon. Xu Xian comes across them and offers a boat ride to the city. Susu starts thinking about the day she kissed Xu Xian and decides to head to the city to find him. Meanwhile, while Qingqing is exploring the city, she comes across Neng Ren and decides to help him subdue the bat demon by revealing its location. Neng Ren defeats the bat demon's cohorts, but is unable to subdue the bat demon king and is bitten. Though he is subsequently saved by Fahai, Neng Ren starts turning into a bat demon himself the next day and decides to run away. Meanwhile, Xu Xian recognizes Susu and they spend the night together, oblivious to the fact that she is a snake in human form. Neng Ren is found by Qinqing and the two befriend each other. They realize that Neng Ren, despite becoming a bat demon, still has all his human taste for human food, and most of his human qualities. Meanwhile, Xu Xian and Susu wed. Fahai gives Xu Xian a dagger that can kill demons, anticipating that Susu is a demon since she is able to counter the poison of the fox demon and confronts and defeats her but spares her as she had helped save others with a warning to leave Xu Xian as their union will only cause pain and threatens to kill her otherwise. When she doesn't, Fahai and his disciples attack her and Xu Xian's cottage. Susu fights the battle in snake form, but is stabbed by Xu Xian, who is unaware of her true identity. Susu escapes but is gravely injured. Xu Xian, after realizing what he has done, decides to get the spirit root to heal her. Helped by Susu's friend, a mouse, Xu Xian manages to retrieve a root kept inside the Lei Feng Pagoda, but is possessed by demons since the root was the thing that kept the demons in place. Fahai and the other monks capture Xu Xian and prepare to cast spells to banish the demons from his body. When Susu recovers, she goes to find Xu Xian along with Qinqing. They are confronted by Fahai, who tries to explain to them that the spell should not be broken before it is complete. Susu, however, does not believe him and accuses him of trying to separate them. The two sisters battle Fahai and after Fahai breaks their swords, they retaliate by unleashing a tidal wave on Jinshan that Fahai is able to cut in two to prevent too much damage only to be attacked by their true forms. Susu releases Xu Xian from the spell, but he does not have any memory of Susu. Susu blames this on Fahai and they battle. Despite managing to repel Susu's fierce snakes and incapacitate Qingqing, Fahai is left defeated as he questions whether he was too driven on his demon-hunting and fierce defense of Buddha as despite all his efforts, disasters would continue on without stopping. When Susu recommences the battle, Fahai is empowered by his faith in Buddha and manifesting many divine arms around him, easily deflects all of Susu's attacks before he is able to trap Susu in Lei Feng Pagoda. At this point, Susu repents and asks to see Xu Xian just one last time. Buddha implores Fahai to fulfill Susu's wish and Fahai, filled with the divine spirit, obeys and lifts up the pagoda, temporarily freeing Susu. After an emotional talk with Xu Xian, Susu kisses him, causing him to remember everything. Susu is then sucked back into the temple as Fahai lets go of the temple, trapping Susu there again much to Xu Xian's sadness. Qingqing, watching all this from a distance with Neng Ren, tells him that she doesn't want to love anyone as her sister loved Xu Xian, and leaves saying that he will never be a true bat demon anyway. In the epilogue, Xu Xian picks herbs around the pagoda, while Susu has returned to her snake form trapped inside the temple. Fahai is seen walking around the mountainside when suddenly Neng Ren (now a complete bat demon) appears alongside him. Throwing him an apple, Fahai tells him that he has grown used to his new look, and they journey together again.

He also escaped in World War II, this time as a general (see next section). *July 4, 1915 ‚Äì Gunther Pl√ºschow escaped from a POW camp at Donington Park, Leicestershire, England and made his way back to Germany. This was the only successful escape from Britain in either world war. *September 2 and 12, 1918 ‚Äì John Donaldson and another prisoner escaped, but were recaptured. The pair were joined by three others for a second try. They reached the Netherlands, marking the first successful American(?) escape of the war. *February 1917 ‚Äì October 1918 ‚Äì E. H. Jones, a Welsh lieutenant in the Indian Army, and C. W. Hill, an Australian officer in the Royal Flying Corps, escaped from a Turkish prisoner-of-war camp at Yozgad. Having first pretended to be psychic, the pair spent over a year conning the camp's commandant. Eventually they persuaded their Turkish captors they were insane and, after being moved to a hospital for the mentally ill in the summer of 1918, the two men played their roles as lunatics so successfully they also fooled the doctors and were returned home. *February 14, 1918 ‚Äì French fighter pilot Roland Garros escaped to rejoin the French army after several attempts. *July 23/24, 1918 ‚Äì Holzminden officers' prisoner-of-war camp. Ten of 29 British officers made their way to freedom, making this \\"the most successful escape from a German prison camp during the First World War\\". *1918 ‚Äì US Navy Lieutenant Edouard Izac was taken prisoner aboard the U-boat which sank his ship in May 1918. On the trip to Germany, he learned important information about enemy submarine movements. As a result, he made several attempts to escape, finally succeeding on the night of October 6‚Äì7, 1918, with several others. He made his way to Switzerland and then London to pass along the information, though by then the war was nearly over. For his actions, he was awarded the Medal of Honor. Spanish Civil War *On May 22, 1938, 792 or 795 prisoners of war and political prisoners escaped from Fort San Crist√≥bal, near Pamplona, Spain. Only three managed to reach the French border. The Nationalists recaptured or killed the rest. World War II =Allied= *Mass escapes from German POW camps *List of attempts to escape Oflag IV-C (better known as Colditz Castle). Fifty-four prisoners reached freedom. *January 5, 1942 ‚Äì Airey Neave and Anthony Luteyn successfully escaped from Colditz Castle, Germany, Neave being the first British officer to accomplish this feat. *April 17, 1942 ‚Äì French General Henri Giraud, reprising his World War I escape, got out of the high-security K√∂nigstein Castle by climbing down a homemade rope. This escape took two years of preparation (versus two months for his World War I escape). He reached Switzerland, then returned to Vichy France, where he would play a major role during the rest of the war. *August 30, 1942 ‚Äì Two Australian and two British soldiers were recaptured and executed after escaping from Changi Prison, Singapore, during the Selarang Barracks incident. *October 30, 1942 ‚Äì Camp 57, Italy. Fourteen Australians and five New Zealanders escaped through a tunnel, but were all recaptured. *November 1942 to March 1944 ‚Äì Australian flying ace Nicky Barr was shot down in 1942 in North Africa.

This was the only successful mass escape from a Japanese camp. The escape is detailed in the 2010 book Escape from Davao. * October 29, 1943 ‚Äì The Wooden Horse escape. Flight Lieutenant Eric Williams and Lieutenant Richard Michael Codner came up with the idea to construct a vaulting horse and dig a tunnel underneath it. Pilot Officer Oliver Philpot was the escape co-ordinator for the hut in which they lived, and joined their escape plot. Once outside of Stalag Luft III, Philpot split off from the other two, as previously agreed upon. All three managed to reach first Sweden, then Britain. Their exploit was the basis of the 1950 film The Wooden Horse, which was written by Williams. * September 1944. Major Digby Tatham-Warter was wounded by shrapnel and captured during the Battle of Arnhem, but escaped from the hospital with his second-in- command, Captain Tony Frank. With the help of the Dutch Resistance, they joined a large group of escaped soldiers hiding out. On the night of 22‚Äì23 October, 138 of them were rescued by Operation Pegasus, including Tatham- Warter. *Captain Charles Upham, the third and last person to be awarded the Victoria Cross twice, attempted so many escapes that he was sent to Oflag IV-C, better known as Colditz Castle, in October 1944. =Axis= Of the hundreds of thousands of POWs shipped to the U.S., only 2,222 tried to escape. There were about 600 escape attempts from Canada during the war, including at least two mass escapes through tunnels. Four German POWs were killed attempting to escape from Canadian prison camps. Three others were wounded. Most escapees tried to reach the United States when it was still neutral, though Karl Heinz-Grund and Horst Liebeck made it as far as Medicine Hat, Alberta, before being apprehended by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. The two men had planned to travel to Vancouver, British Columbia, and leave Canada courtesy of the Japanese merchant marine. The Angler breakout was the single largest escape attempt orchestrated by German POWs (28) in North America during the war. The December 23, 1944, breakout of 25 Kriegsmarine and merchant seamen from Papago Park, Arizona, was the second largest. In both instances, all escapees were recaptured or killed. *October 7 and December 20, 1940, January 21, 1941 ‚Äì On his first (solo) attempt from camp Grizedale Hall, Franz von Werra was recaptured on October 12. His second involved four others, who were quickly caught. He was recaptured while trying to steal an airplane. He was then shipped from Great Britain to Canada, where, on his third attempt, he jumped out the window of a moving train. Seven others were recaptured. Von Werra made his way first to the United States, still neutral at that time, then to Mexico (before he could be extradited back to Canada), and eventually to Nazi Germany. He is the only German World War II POW to escape and return to Germany. (However, see below the April 29, 1944 escape to Tibet.) *April 18, 1941 ‚Äì Twenty-eight Germans escaped from Angler, Ontario through a tunnel. Originally over 80 had planned to escape, but Canadian guards discovered the breakout in progress. Two prisoners were killed and the rest recaptured. *November 23, 1941, December 1941 and February 18, 1942 ‚Äì Luftwaffe Oberleutnant and ace Ulrich Steinhilper escaped from Bowmanville, Ontario, and managed to make it to Niagara Falls within two days. Steinhilper unknowingly spent 30 minutes in the neutral United States clinging beneath a train car as it sat idle in a Buffalo, New York, railyard. In less than three weeks, he escaped again and made it as far as Montreal, Quebec. Within four months, Steinhilper would attempt a third escape. On February 18, 1942, Steinhilper and a friend, disguised as painters, used a ladder to escape over two barbed wire fences. The pair would make it as far as Watertown, New York, before being arrested by police. Steinhilper was soon sent to Gravenhurst, Ontario, where he attempted two further escapes. *November 24, 1941 ‚Äì RAF Carlisle, United Kingdom. Luftwaffe pilots Heinz Schnabel and Harry Wappler stole a Miles Magister trainer aircraft and flew to several other RAF airfields before being recaptured. *April 17, 1942 and October 1943 ‚Äì Dornier Do 17 bomber pilot Oberleutnant Peter Krug made it as far as San Antonio, Texas from the Bowmanville, Ontario POW camp. The young Luftwaffe pilot was aided in his flight by Axis sympathizers in the United States whose addresses may have been procured from outside Abwehr sources. His second escape was from Gravenhurst, Ontario; he was reported caught after 24 hours in the October 5, 1943 North Bay Nugget. *November 1, 1942 ‚Äì Four German prisoners ‚Äì Bruno Dathe, Willy Michel, Hermann Runne and Johannes Grantz ‚Äì escaped from Fort Stanton, New Mexico, and were captured two days later after a brief skirmish with a posse of ranchers and cattlemen. One escapee was wounded. *January 1943 ‚Äì Camp 354, Kenya. Italian POW Felice Benuzzi convinced two of his fellow inmates, Dr. Giovanni Balletto and Enzo Barsotti, to try an unusual escape route: climbing nearby Mount Kenya. After 18 days, they gave up and sneaked back into camp. After the war, Benuzzi wrote of his experience in No Picnic on Mount Kenya. *January 6, March 13, April 18 and another attempt, all in 1943 ‚Äì Karl Rabe of U-35 made four separate escape attempts from Lethbridge, Alberta, Canada, including one using a home-made hot air balloon. Previously he had escaped from a Toronto hospital, subsequently stealing a small row boat with the intention of crossing Lake Ontario to the American shore, but beached the craft too soon, mistakenly thinking he was already on the American side. He was immediately recaptured by Canadian soldiers. *August 26, 1943 ‚Äì Nineteen German POWs escaped through a large drainage pipe from Kingston, Ontario, Canada. All were soon recaptured. *1943 ‚Äì Bowmanville POW camp, Canada. In Operation Kiebitz, Admiral Karl D√∂nitz sent the submarine U-536 to pick up four U-boat commanders, including noted ace Otto Kretschmer, who were to break out at the right time. The Canadians were aware of the attempt, but let it proceed, hoping to lure in the U-boat. However, the plan was aborted when the part of a tunnel collapsed, revealing its exit to the guards. Instead, another U-boat commander, Wolfgang Heyda, escaped over a barbed wire fence and made his way 1,400 kilometres (870 mi) to the rendezvous point. Here he was captured, while the authorities waited for the U-boat to surface. Despite being spotted by three destroyers, it got away. * On April 29, 1944, Heinrich Harrer, Peter Aufschnaiter, Hans Kopp and four others escaped from a British camp in Dehradun. Harrer and Aufschnaiter reached Lhasa and stayed with the Dalai Lama for seven years, finally escaping from Tibet ahead of the People's Liberation Army in 1950. Rolf Magener and Heins von Have went east, passing through Burma and across the front line to reach Japanese troops. They reached Japan after four months on the run, but only returned to Germany two years after the end of the war. *August 5, 1944 ‚Äì Cowra breakout, Australia. 359 Japanese POWs escaped in one of the largest breakouts of the war. All who were not killed or did not commit suicide were caught. *August 8, 1944 ‚Äì Von Werra's Swanwick digging partner, Luftwaffe Lieutenant Walter Manhard, successfully escaped from a Gravenhurst, Ontario, POW camp. Presumed drowned, he gave himself up to New York state authorities in 1952. By then, he was married to a United States Navy officer. *c. August 30, 1944 ‚Äì Deutsches Afrikakorps (DAK) soldier Max Weidauer escaped from Medicine Hat, Alberta after he came under suspicion by Nazi elements controlling the camp and the subsequent murder of fellow DAK prisoner August Plaszek. After explaining the circumstances of his escape and the fact that he feared for his life, Weidauer was hidden by a local farmer but was soon once again behind barbed wire, though in a different camp. *December 24, 1944 ‚Äì Papago Park, United States. Twenty-five prisoners got out through a tunnel, but all were recaptured, U-boat commander J√ºrgen Wattenberg being the last on January 28, 1945. *March 10, 1945 ‚Äì Island Farm, United Kingdom. Seventy, possibly more, escaped, but all were recaptured. *September 22, 1945 ‚Äì German POW Georg G√§rtner escaped from Camp Deming, New Mexico, after the war had ended by crawling under two gates and jumping onto a passing freight train. Gaertner, who spoke good English, was able to pass for an American and worked as a ski instructor in the winter and a tennis instructor in the summer and married an American woman. In 1985 he finally turned himself in, after 40 years of freedom. No charges were filed against him, and he was allowed to remain in the United States and become a naturalized citizen. Korean War *June 14, 2008 ‚Äì Kim Jin-soo. Captured in 1953 by North Korea, this South Korean soldier eventually settled down, married and raised a family. Fifty-five years after his capture, the 74-year-old Kim escaped to China. Vietnam War Dieter Dengler *June 29, 1966 ‚Äì Dieter Dengler, Pisidhi Indradat, Duane W. Martin, Eugene DeBruin, Prasit Promsuwan (a Thai), Prasit Thanee (a Thai), and Y. C. To (a Nationalist Chinese) escaped from a Pathet Lao camp in Laos. U.S. Navy pilot Dengler was rescued on July 20. Martin was killed (according to Dengler) outside of a Laotian village. The others were recaptured. Indradat, a civilian, was freed by Laotian soldiers later; the remaining prisoners were never seen again. *April 10, 1967 and May 10, 1969 ‚Äì U.S. Air Force Captain John A. Dramesi bailed out of his stricken aircraft over North Vietnam on April 2, 1967. Eight days later he eluded his North Vietnamese captors by dismantling the side of his cell. He was recaptured the following day. After a year of planning, Dramesi and another POW aviator escaped again, by slipping through a hole in the roof. After traveling 3 miles in 12 hours, Dramesi and his companion were recaptured. He was released in 1973. Dramesi had plans for a third escape. He wrote a memoir, Code of Honor, telling of his escapes and time held captive. *September 1967 ‚Äì U.S. Air Force Major Bud Day was shot down and captured by the local North Vietnamese militia. After days of torture, he escaped, making his way back to South Vietnam. He was however recaptured within sight of an American base camp, and endured five years and seven months more of captivity.

He was one of the most important players in the history of FK Vojvodina. Early life He was born in a town mostly populated by German minority named ≈†ove (currently known as Ravno Selo) in Vojvodina, then still part of Austro-Hungary in a wealthy latifundial family. He made his college studies in Novi Vrbas and has soon begin to show his passion towards football. While visiting an agricultural fair in Budapest in 1929 he had the chance to assist to his first football match played between Hungary and his country, the Kingdom of Yugoslavia.Jo≈æef Velker voƒëa milionera at fkvojvodina.com. NAK Novi Sad In 1931 he met an American named Cathy that was visiting her family in ≈†ove and married her. In same year his football skills are spotted by scouts of NAK Novi Sad and he began playing for them. FK Vojvodina, the city rivals, immediately start following the new star of NAK in what will become in one of the longest chases ever, and will last for long six years. Curiously, Velker would have always great performances against Vojvodina and in consequence, instead of hating him, and specially because of his fairness and gentleman character, Vojvodina fans started appreciating him more and more. In Autumn 1937 the growing forces of nazism and fascism were bringing fear and anxiety to people in Europe, but Novi Sad was in a state of agitation not because of the economical speculation, or the international politics, but because of the long-expected sensational transfer of Velker to FK Vojvodina. FK Vojvodina The club was by then bringing many good players into the team in what would be known as the \\"Millioners team\\". Since then, Vojvodina begin having serious pretensions to win the Yugoslav First League. That goal was in the view of the club direction unreachable without Velker, so an enormous effort was made to bring him into the club, and after long and difficult negotiations, to enormous disappointment of NAK, Velker finally signed. From 1937, all the way until 1951, he would become a crucial player of the club. This is how a newspaper \\"Sportska revija\\" from 15 May 1940 described him: > \\"Velker, the attacking player of Vojvodina, is always one of the best > players. All other players, even the best ones, can disappoint, even be > unnoticed, but that rarely happens to him. He is the engine of the team. > Technician \\"per excellence\\". In the matches of Vojvodina he stands out by > his devoted, skillful and fair style of play. That is Velker. He represents > what a footballer should be, the way a true footballer is, a real sportsman. > He doesn¬¥t protest referees' decisions, he doesn¬¥t reply opponents hard play > and he doesn¬¥t quarrel with other players. During the match, you won¬¥t even > hear him, but you will see him a lot. Despite his skills allowing him to > play in any club in the league, he stays unpretentious. And that is what you > rarely find in a star. Velker is the best, more disciplined and more humble > player in Novi Sad. And he has definitely deserved to play for long time now > in the national team squad.\\" The national team was a wound for the players of Vojvodina because there was no place for them in it. All places were reserved for players from Belgrade, Zagreb and Sarajevo so all nationalities in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia would be satisfied. Velker had offers from clubs from Zagreb and Belgrade that would eventually open a way for him into the national team, but he stayed loyal to Novi Sad and FK Vojvodina. The \\"Millioners team\\" failed to immediately make an impact, but in the season 1940/41 was fighting for the top. The final stage of the championship was interrupted by the beginning of the Second World War, and the Axis bombing, mobilization and country's capitulation made the competition to continue to be impossible. During German occupation, the new authorities closed the club and confiscated its property. Velker returned to Ravno Selo. German Wehrmacht begin recruiting Germans from Vojvodina into the SS units, and Velker was recruited into Vrbas. He soon escaped and was for some time on the run. Because of that, his family's house was vandalised by local German youth. But the information about his desertion also came to Novi Sad, to his former club NAK, and the club president; simultaneously the local police chief, agreed to give him an amnesty in exchange of him becoming a NAK player. In order to avoid going into concentration camps, other former Vojvodina players such as Marjanoviƒá, Plac, Avramoviƒá, Jovanoviƒá, Medariƒá and ≈Ωivkoviƒá also joined the club. He played with NAK, now known as Ujvideki AC, in the Hungarian Championship four seasons, scoring 38 goals in the 76 appearances he made in those seasons between 1941 and 1944.Welker J√≥zsef stats at nela.com After liberation by Allies began, in Autumn 1944, the renewal of FK Vojvodina began. In 1945 the Championship was not played by clubs but by country's regions, and Velker played in the team of Vojvodina, made of players of FK Vojvodina and FK Spartak Subotica, finishing fourth. The club for a short period was named Sloga and initially played in the Second Yugoslav League. Many critics in Novi Sad believe that the club was dropped out from the top league because of the national representation and some animosity that the new communist authorities had towards the former burgeoise club. Velker was known in this period for his heroic performances even in a fixed-match games. The club suffered some difficulties in this period, and it is known that Velker financially supported, on several occasions, the travels that the club needed to make to play against opponents. However Vojvodina soon recovered, and in 1948 it returned to the First League. International career Between 1938 and 1940, Velker made three appearances for the Yugoslavia national team, scoring two goals. Retirement Velker played his last season in 1951, having played 30 league matches and scoring 15 goals. His fairway match was a friendly match against FK Sarajevo. After retiring, he moved to Cleveland, Ohio, US, where his wife's family lived. It was there that he died on 29 November 1995.Josip Velker at Reprezentacija.rs He was sometimes known as Josip Velker, and his surname was also spelled occasionally as Welker. He is still today considered by FK Vojvodina fans as part of the best club team ever.

Biography Harry Revier was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in 1890. Some sources state that he gained early experience as a cinematographer in Europe, but his name is absent from passenger lists from that time. His earliest known screen credit is as the director of the Victor Film Company‚Äôs The Imp Abroad (1914), starring James W. Horne. Although Revier worked in the film industry for about 40 years, he only occasionally worked for any of the major studios. Most of his output consisted of low-budget programmers distributed on the \\"states rights\\" market, one-shot features or serials often made for companies organized only to make that one film, distributed haphazardly if at all (then, as now, it was much easier to actually get a film made than to get it distributed). Two exceptions are the Tarzan films that Revier co-directed for Edgar Rice Burroughs; one of these, The Son of Tarzan (1920), was a considerable hit. Shortly afterward he discovered actress Dorothy Revier, whom he married and launched in her film debut, The Broadway Madonna (1922). Though she did go on to some popularity in the 1920s, it was without her husband as they divorced in 1926. With the dawn of sound, Harry traveled to England to make a \\"quota quickie\\"‚Äîlow-budget films made to satisfy a British government requirement that a certain percentage of films shown in Britain had to be made in Britain‚Äîand worked on a couple of routine westerns. He scored notoriety of a sort with the infamous \\"Poverty Row\\" serial The Lost City (1935) featuring William \\"Stage\\" Boyd, an actor known for his alcoholism who died shortly after the film‚Äôs completion (in one famous incident, he was arrested in a drunken escapade and a newspaper story covering it the next day mistakenly published a photo of actor William Boyd, later to become famous as \\"Hopalong Cassidy\\"; the mistake put a screeching halt to his at the time rising career)--the film is regarded many many aficionados as \\"the worst serial ever made\\". In 1936 Revier discovered some ethnographic footage of flagellant monks shot in New Mexico several years previously and built a racy feature around it, with star Marie DeForrest presented in a nude crucifixion scene. The resulting film, which was now called Lash of the Penitentes, became infamous and played on the states-rights market for years afterward. The notorious Child Bride followed. The film‚Äîthe first produced by exploitation-film legend Kroger Babb, who marketed it as an \\"educational\\" picture‚Äîwas a somewhat cheesy tale of early-teen and pre-teen girls being married off to elderly men, a long-standing practice in some of the more backward areas of the American South. Its signature scene was a lengthy skinny-dipping sequence featuring pre-pubescent starlet Shirley Mills. Afterwards, Revier disappears from the rolls of feature production, but reappears for a final time in 1953 with Planet Outlaws. Through the use of creative editing Revier converted the 1939 sci-fi serial Buck Rogers into an Atomic Age, Cold War context. Harry Revier died in Winter Park, Florida, in 1957 at age 67. Legacy The Lust of the Ages (1917) The Grain of Dust (1918) The Challenge of Chance (1919) Harry Revier did the bulk of his film work in the silent era, and most of that output is lost. Confirmed extant is the serial The Son of Tarzan (1920) and the melodrama What Price Love? (1927) starring Jane Novak. Among the missing is the predecessor to The Son of Tarzan, The Revenge of Tarzan (1920); The Challenge of Chance (1919) starring prizefighter Jess Willard; and at least one of his talkies, Convict's Code (1930). (A short surviving portion of Convict's Code was preserved by the Academy Film Archive in 2013.) Some of his sound films are, to some extent, lost as well; censors butchered Lash of the Penitentes and in its longest known version‚Äîkept in the Library of Congress‚Äîonly 42 minutes remain of its original 65-minute running time. Moreover, one of the feature-length condensations of his serial The Lost City‚Äîthere were at least four-‚Äîhas been lost as well. Although Revier's remaining output is slim, his films are quite unlike others of the time; his work, while lacking technical polish, is completely without regard for the production code in effect at the time. In that respect he precedes by a number of years the far better known work of Ed Wood and his films share the somewhat careless scripting and handling of actors evident in Wood's pictures, though he had little‚Äîif any‚Äîof Wood's artistic ambition.

History and collections  Until 1934, the museum was housed in the building of the local commercial high school. In 1934, the museum acquired the archaeology collection from Mihai Dimitriu, the first custodian of the institution, and a coleoptera collection belonging to Professor Alecu Ales√Ænschi (lost after the 1965 reorganization). In 1974, the museum heritage was enriched by archaeological finds coming from the campaigns of 1926 - 1951 undertaken by Professor Radu Vulpe and Ecaterina Vulpe in the site of Poiana-Nicore»ôti (Piroboridava) until then kept in the deposits of the Bucharest Institute of Archaeology. The present building is a monument of architecture built in the second half of the 19th century. The exhibits include pottery from Neolithic (axes, knives, hand mills, and pottery belonging to Cucuteni and Cri»ô cultures), from the Bronze Age (Monteoru culture pottery), the Iron Age (food vessels); jug bearing god Dionysius' mask, Dacian ornaments and weapons deposits (4th - 3rd centuries BC), the gilded bronze hoard of Callatis (3rd century BC), glass pot bearing a Greek inscription (4th century) etc. The museum owns goods listed in the National Cultural Heritage Treasure.

She represented her country at four Winter Olympic Games. Speed skating career Noh began skating at the age of 11. Five years later, she represented her country in the women's 1500 metres and the women's 3000 metres at the 2006 Winter Olympics. At the 2007 Asian Winter Games, she placed 4th in the women's 1500 metres and 5th in the women's 3000 metres. Her first major medal came at the 2007 World Junior Speed Skating Championships, where she attained gold in the allround competition. She then won silver in the women's team pursuit with Lee Ju-yeon and Kim Yoo-rim at the 2009 Winter Universiade. While she did not finish near the medals at the 2009 World Single Distance Speed Skating Championships, she did manage to set a new national record of 1:56.38 in the women's 1500 metres during the 2009‚Äì10 ISU Speed Skating World Cup. Noh again represented her country in the women's 1500 metres and the women's 3000 metres at the 2010 Winter Olympics. She was also a member of the South Korean women's team pursuit team with Lee Ju-yeon and Park Do-yeong that finished last of eight. At the 2011 Asian Winter Games, she won gold in the women's mass start and women's team pursuit. She also came in second in the women's 1500 metres. Her next major medal would come at the 2013 World Championships, where Noh won bronze in the women's team pursuit with Park Do- yeong and Kim Bo-reum. At the 2014 Winter Olympics, Noh marked her third attempt at the women's 1500 metres and the women's 3000 metres. The South Korean women's team pursuit team of Noh, Kim Bo-reum and Yang Shin-young would again finished last of eight. Her final podium was at the 2017 Asian Winter Games in the women's team pursuit, with the South Korean team of Noh, Kim Bo- reum and Park Ji-woo finishing in second behind the Japanese team. Noh qualified for the South Korean team pursuit team at the 2018 Winter Olympics in October 2017. However, because International Skating Union rules state that skaters in the team pursuit must also compete in an individual event, Noh's position in the team was uncertain up until two weeks prior to the Olympics. The Korea Skating Union attributed this to an administrative error on their behalf. Two Russian skaters withdrew and Noh was entered into the women's 1500 metres, where she finished 14th. After failing to make the semi-finals in the women's team pursuit, her teammates Kim Bo-reum and Park Ji-woo appeared to blame her for the poor result. She was later seen crying and comforted by team coach Bob de Jong. =Personal records= Personal life She is the sister of late short track speed skater Noh Jin-Kyu.

Denno, 388 U.S. 293 (1967), was a case decided by the Supreme Court of the United States that held that a pretrial identification not covered by the Sixth Amendment right to counsel should be excluded if it was so unnecessarily suggestive as to violate due process.R.A Allen, J.L. Hoffman, D.A. Livingston & W.J. Stuntz. Comprehensive Criminal Procedure, Second Edition. Aspen Publishers, New York: 2005, p. 257-58 Factual background Dr. Paul Behrendt was stabbed to death on August 23, 1961. Dr. Behrendt's wife was injured in the attack. A shirt and keys left at the scene led to Theodore Stovall's arrest on August 24, 1961. After Mrs. Behrendt underwent surgery, Stovall was brought to her hospital room on the afternoon of August 25, 1961. Stovall had not yet been appointed counsel. Mrs. Behrendt identified Stovall as her attacker. Stovall was convicted and sentenced to death.. The New York Court of Appeals affirmed Stovall's conviction.People v. Stovall, 13 N.Y.2d 1094 (1963) Stovall filed a petition of habeas corpus, alleging that his Fifth, Sixth, and Fourteenth Amendment rights were violated. The Southern District of New York dismissed his petition, and Stovall appealed to the Second Circuit. A three judge panel reversed Stovall's conviction on the basis that Mrs. Behrendt's identification was made in violation of Stovall's Sixth Amendment right to counsel. The Second Circuit reheard the case en banc and affirmed the district court's dismissal of Stovall's petition. The Supreme Court granted certiorari.. Decision =Majority opinion= Stovall was decided on the same day as United States v. Wade and Gilbert v. California, two cases dealing with the Sixth Amendment right to counsel in pretrial stages. The Court observed that the rule of Wade, where the absence of counsel at a post-indictment lineup was held to be a violation of the Sixth Amendment, would dictate the finding of a Sixth Amendment violation in the present case. The Court, however, held that the rule of Wade should not be applied retroactively. The Court noted that police departments had relied on Sixth Amendment jurisprudence as it was before Wade, and that the absence of counsel at the identification did not jeopardize Stovall's right to a fair trial seriously enough to justify retroactive application.Stovall, 388 U.S. at 296-301. Even without application of the Wade rule, Stovall could prevail if he could show that his due process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment were violated. The due process test as described by the Court was that Stovall could prevail if the identification procedure was \\"so unnecessarily suggestive and conducive to irreparable mistaken identification that he was denied due process of law.\\"Stovall, 388 U.S. at 302. The Court held that the identification procedure, though suggestive, was necessary because of Mrs. Behrendt's injured state and affirmed Stovall's conviction. =Douglas' dissent in part= Justice Douglas dissented from the Court's refusal to retroactively apply the rule of Wade to find a Sixth Amendment violation.Stovall, 388 U.S. at 303 (Douglas, J., dissenting in part) =Fortas' dissent= Justice Fortas asserted that the identification of Stovall was a violation of due process rights and that the case should be reversed and remanded. Fortas would not have reached the issue of the retroactive application of Wade.Stovall, 388 U.S. at 303 (Fortas, J., dissenting). =White's concurrence in part= Justice White, joined by Justices Harlan and Stewart, wrote separately to emphasize that there was no Sixth Amendment violation.Stovall, 388 U.S. at 303 (White, J., concurring in part). =Black's dissent= Justice Black dissented from the Court's refusal to retroactively apply Wade. Black also dissented from the Court's holding that a defendant can mount a due process challenge to their conviction in the absence of a violation of a specific Amendment. Black would reverse and remand to determine if the admission of the lineup without counsel was harmless error.Stovall, 388 U.S. at 305-06 (Black, J., dissenting). Subsequent history The holding of Stovall that refused to apply the rule of Wade retroactively was overruled in Griffith v. Kentucky.. Impact Until its overruling in Griffith, Stovall, along with the case Linkletter v. Walker, established a three factor test for determining if a law should be applied retroactively that examined purpose, reliance, and effect. Lawyers, judges, and academics fashioned rules based on the Linkletter/Stovall test to encourage predictability and fairness in the retroactive application of new precedents.John Bernard Corr.

The integrated field that studies the combination of sensors, actuators and algorithms is called guidance, navigation and control (GNC).  Aircraft attitude control  An aircraft's attitude is stabilized in three directions: yaw, nose left or right about an axis running up and down; pitch, nose up or down about an axis running from wing to wing; and roll, rotation about an axis running from nose to tail. Elevators (moving flaps on the horizontal tail) produce pitch, a rudder on the vertical tail produces yaw, and ailerons (flaps on the wings that move in opposing directions) produce roll.  Spacecraft attitude control  A spacecraft's attitude must typically be stabilized and controlled for a variety of reasons. It is often needed so that the spacecraft high-gain antenna may be accurately pointed to Earth for communications, so that onboard experiments may accomplish precise pointing for accurate collection and subsequent interpretation of data, so that the heating and cooling effects of sunlight and shadow may be used intelligently for thermal control, and also for guidance: short propulsive maneuvers must be executed in the right direction. =Types of stabilization= There are two principal approaches to stabilizing attitude control on spacecraft: *' is accomplished by setting the spacecraft spinning, using the gyroscopic action of the rotating spacecraft mass as the stabilizing mechanism. Propulsion system thrusters are fired only occasionally to make desired changes in spin rate, or in the spin-stabilized attitude. If desired, the spinning may be stopped through the use of thrusters or by yo-yo de-spin. The Pioneer 10 and Pioneer 11 probes in the outer solar system are examples of spin-stabilized spacecraft. *' is an alternative method of spacecraft attitude control in which the spacecraft is held fixed in the desired orientation without any rotation. **One method is to use small thrusters to continually nudge the spacecraft back and forth within a deadband of allowed attitude error. Thrusters may also be referred to as mass-expulsion control (MEC) systems, or reaction control systems (RCS). The space probes Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 employ this method, and have used up about three quarters of their 100 kg of propellant as of July 2015. **Another method for achieving three-axis stabilization is to use electrically powered reaction wheels, also called momentum wheels, which are mounted on three orthogonal axes aboard the spacecraft. They provide a means to trade angular momentum back and forth between spacecraft and wheels. To rotate the vehicle on a given axis, the reaction wheel on that axis is accelerated in the opposite direction. To rotate the vehicle back, the wheel is slowed. Excess momentum that builds up in the system due to external torques from, for example, solar photon pressure or gravity gradients, must be occasionally removed from the system by applying controlled torque to the spacecraft to allowing the wheels to return to a desired speed under computer control. This is done during maneuvers called momentum desaturation or momentum unload maneuvers. Most spacecraft use a system of thrusters to apply the torque for desaturation maneuvers. A different approach was used by the Hubble Space Telescope, which had sensitive optics that could be contaminated by thruster exhaust, and instead used magnetic torquers for desaturation maneuvers. There are advantages and disadvantages to both spin stabilization and three-axis stabilization. Spin-stabilized craft provide a continuous sweeping motion that is desirable for fields and particles instruments, as well as some optical scanning instruments, but they may require complicated systems to de-spin antennas or optical instruments that must be pointed at targets for science observations or communications with Earth. Three-axis controlled craft can point optical instruments and antennas without having to de-spin them, but they may have to carry out special rotating maneuvers to best utilize their fields and particle instruments. If thrusters are used for routine stabilization, optical observations such as imaging must be designed knowing that the spacecraft is always slowly rocking back and forth, and not always exactly predictably. Reaction wheels provide a much steadier spacecraft from which to make observations, but they add mass to the spacecraft, they have a limited mechanical lifetime, and they require frequent momentum desaturation maneuvers, which can perturb navigation solutions because of accelerations imparted by the use of thrusters. =Articulation= Many spacecraft have components that require articulation. Voyager and Galileo, for example, were designed with scan platforms for pointing optical instruments at their targets largely independently of spacecraft orientation. Many spacecraft, such as Mars orbiters, have solar panels that must track the Sun so they can provide electrical power to the spacecraft. Cassini's main engine nozzles were steerable. Knowing where to point a solar panel, or scan platform, or a nozzle ‚Äî that is, how to articulate it ‚Äî requires knowledge of the spacecraft's attitude. Because a single subsystem keeps track of the spacecraft's attitude, the Sun's location, and Earth's location, it can compute the proper direction to point the appendages. It logically falls to the same subsystem ‚Äì the Attitude and Articulation Control Subsystem (AACS), then, to manage both attitude and articulation. The name AACS may even be carried over to a spacecraft even if it has no appendages to articulate.  Geometry  Attitude is part of the description of how an object is placed in the space it occupies. Attitude and position fully describe how an object is placed in space. (For some applications such as in robotics and computer vision, it is customary to combine position and attitude together into a single description known as Pose.) Attitude can be described using a variety of methods; however, the most common are Rotation matrices, Quaternions, and Euler angles. While Euler angles are oftentimes the most straightforward representation to visualize, they can cause problems for highly-maneuverable systems because of a phenomenon known as Gimbal lock. A rotation matrix, on the other hand, provides a full description of the attitude at the expense of requiring nine values instead of three. The use of a rotation matrix can lead to increased computational expense and they can be more difficult to work with. Quaternions offer a decent compromise in that they do not suffer from gimbal lock and only require four values to fully describe the attitude. Changing orientation of a rigid body is the same as rotating the axes of a reference frame attached to it.  Sensors  =Relative attitude sensors= Many sensors generate outputs that reflect the rate of change in attitude. These require a known initial attitude, or external information to use them to determine attitude. Many of this class of sensor have some noise, leading to inaccuracies if not corrected by absolute attitude sensors. Gyroscopes Gyroscopes are devices that sense rotation in three-dimensional space without reliance on the observation of external objects. Classically, a gyroscope consists of a spinning mass, but there are also \\"ring laser gyros\\" utilizing coherent light reflected around a closed path. Another type of \\"gyro\\" is a hemispherical resonator gyro where a crystal cup shaped like a wine glass can be driven into oscillation just as a wine glass \\"sings\\" as a finger is rubbed around its rim. The orientation of the oscillation is fixed in inertial space, so measuring the orientation of the oscillation relative to the spacecraft can be used to sense the motion of the spacecraft with respect to inertial space. Motion reference units Motion reference units are a kind of inertial measurement unit with single- or multi-axis motion sensors. They utilize MEMS gyroscopes. Some multi-axis MRUs are capable of measuring roll, pitch, yaw and heave. They have applications outside the aeronautical field, such as: * Antenna motion compensation and stabilization * Dynamic positioning * Heave compensation of offshore cranes * High speed craft motion control and damping systems * Hydro acoustic positioning * Motion compensation of single and multibeam echosounders * Ocean wave measurements * Offshore structure motion monitoring * Orientation and attitude measurements on Autonomous underwater vehicles and Remotely operated underwater vehicles * Ship motion monitoring =Absolute attitude sensors= This class of sensors sense the position or orientation of fields, objects or other phenomena outside the spacecraft. Horizon sensor A horizon sensor is an optical instrument that detects light from the 'limb' of Earth's atmosphere, i.e., at the horizon. Thermal infrared sensing is often used, which senses the comparative warmth of the atmosphere, compared to the much colder cosmic background. This sensor provides orientation with respect to Earth about two orthogonal axes. It tends to be less precise than sensors based on stellar observation. Sometimes referred to as an Earth sensor. Orbital gyrocompass Similar to the way that a terrestrial gyrocompass uses a pendulum to sense local gravity and force its gyro into alignment with Earth's spin vector, and therefore point north, an orbital gyrocompass uses a horizon sensor to sense the direction to Earth's center, and a gyro to sense rotation about an axis normal to the orbit plane. Thus, the horizon sensor provides pitch and roll measurements, and the gyro provides yaw. See Tait-Bryan angles. Sun sensor A sun sensor is a device that senses the direction to the Sun. This can be as simple as some solar cells and shades, or as complex as a steerable telescope, depending on mission requirements. Earth sensor An Earth sensor is a device that senses the direction to Earth. It is usually an infrared camera; nowadays the main method to detect attitude is the star tracker, but Earth sensors are still integrated in satellites for their low cost and reliability. Star tracker EBEX 2012, a high-altitude balloon-borne cosmology experiment launched from Antarctica on 2012-12-29 A star tracker is an optical device that measures the position(s) of star(s) using photocell(s) or a camera. It uses magnitude of brightness and spectral type to identify and then calculate the relative position of stars around it. Magnetometer A magnetometer is a device that senses magnetic field strength and, when used in a three-axis triad, magnetic field direction. As a spacecraft navigational aid, sensed field strength and direction is compared to a map of Earth's magnetic field stored in the memory of an on-board or ground-based guidance computer. If spacecraft position is known then attitude can be inferred.  Attitude determination  Before attitude control can be performed, the current attitude must be determined. Attitude cannot be measured directly by any single measurement, and so must be calculated (or estimated) from a set of measurements (often using different sensors). This can be done either statically (calculating the attitude using only the measurements currently available), or through the use of a statistical filter (most commonly, the Kalman filter) that statistically combine previous attitude estimates with current sensor measurements to obtain an optimal estimate of the current attitude. For some sensors and applications (such as spacecraft using magnetometers) the precise location must also be known. While pose estimation can be employed, for spacecraft it is usually sufficient to estimate the position (via Orbit determination) separate from the attitude estimation. For terrestrial vehicles and spacecraft operating near the earth, the advent of Satellite navigation systems allows for precise position knowledge to be obtained easily. This problem becomes more complicated for deep space vehicles, or terrestrial vehicles operating in Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) denied environments (see Navigation). = Static attitude estimation methods = Static attitude estimation methods are solutions to Wahba's problem. Many solutions have been proposed, notably Davenport's q-method, QUEST, TRIAD, and singular value decomposition. = Sequential estimation methods = Kalman filtering can be used to sequentially estimate the attitude, as well as the angular rate. Because attitude dynamics (combination of rigid body dynamics and attitude kinematics) are non-linear, a linear Kalman filter is not sufficient. Because attitude dynamics is not very non-linear, the Extended Kalman filter is usually sufficient (however Crassidis and Markely demonstrated that the Unscented Kalman filter could be used, and can provide benefits in cases where the initial estimate is poor). Multiple methods have been proposed, however the Multiplicative Extended Kalman Filter (MEKF) is by far the most common approach. This approach utilizes the multiplicative formulation of the error quaternion, which allows for the unity constraint on the quaternion to be better handled. It is also common to use a technique known as dynamic model replacement, where the angular rate is not estimated directly, but rather the measured angular rate from the gyro is used directly to propagate the rotational dynamics forward in time. This is valid for most applications as gyros are typically far more precise than one's knowledge of disturbance torques acting on the system (which is required for precise estimation of the angular rate). Control algorithms Control algorithms are computer programs that receive data from vehicle sensors and derive the appropriate commands to the actuators to rotate the vehicle to the desired attitude. The algorithms range from very simple, e.g. proportional control, to complex nonlinear estimators or many in-between types, depending on mission requirements. Typically, the attitude control algorithms are part of the software running on the hardware, which receives commands from the ground and formats vehicle data telemetry for transmission to a ground station. The attitude control algorithms are written and implemented based on requirement for a particular attitude maneuver. Asides the implementation of passive attitude control such as the gravity-gradient stabilization, most spacecraft make use of active control which exhibits a typical attitude control loop. The design of the control algorithm depends on the actuator to be used for the specific attitude maneuver although using a simple proportional‚Äìintegral‚Äìderivative controller (PID controller) satisfies most control needs. The appropriate commands to the actuators are obtained based on error signals described as the difference between the measured and desired attitude. The error signals are commonly measured as euler angles (Œ¶, Œ∏, Œ®), however an alternative to this could be described in terms of direction cosine matrix or error quaternions. The PID controller which is most common reacts to an error signal (deviation) based on attitude as follows T_c (t) = K_\\\\text{p} e(t) + K_\\\\text{i} \\\\int_0^t e(\\\\tau) \\\\,d\\\\tau + K_\\\\text{d} \\\\dot{e}(t), where T_c is the control torque, e is the attitude deviation signal, and K_\\\\text{p}, K_\\\\text{i}, K_\\\\text{d} are the PID controller parameters. A simple implementation of this can be the application of the proportional control for nadir pointing making use of either momentum or reaction wheels as actuators. Based on the change in momentum of the wheels, the control law can be defined in 3-axes x, y, z as T_cx = -K_\\\\text{q1} q_1 + K_\\\\text{w1} {w_x}, T_cy = -K_\\\\text{q2} q_2 + K_\\\\text{w2} {w_y}, T_cz = -K_\\\\text{q3} q_3 + K_\\\\text{w3} {w_z}, This control algorithm also affects momentum dumping. Another important and common control algorithm involves the concept of detumbling, which is attenuating the angular momentum of the spacecraft. The need to detumble the spacecraft arises from the uncontrollable state after release from the launch vehicle. Most spacecraft in low earth orbit (LEO) makes use of magnetic detumbling concept which utilizes the effect of the earth's magnetic field. The control algorithm is called the B-Dot controller and relies on magnetic coils or torque rods as control actuators. The control law is based on the measurement of the rate of change of body-fixed magnetometer signals. m = -K\\\\dot{B} where m is the commanded magnetic dipole moment of the magnetic torquer and K is the proportional gain and \\\\dot{B} is the rate of change of the Earth's magnetic field. Actuators Attitude control can be obtained by several mechanisms, specifically: =Thrusters= Vernier thrusters are the most common actuators, as they may be used for station keeping as well. Thrusters must be organized as a system to provide stabilization about all three axes, and at least two thrusters are generally used in each axis to provide torque as a couple in order to prevent imparting a translation to the vehicle. Their limitations are fuel usage, engine wear, and cycles of the control valves. The fuel efficiency of an attitude control system is determined by its specific impulse (proportional to exhaust velocity) and the smallest torque impulse it can provide (which determines how often the thrusters must fire to provide precise control). Thrusters must be fired in one direction to start rotation, and again in the opposing direction if a new orientation is to be held. Thruster systems have been used on most manned space vehicles, including Vostok, Mercury, Gemini, Apollo, Soyuz, and the Space Shuttle. To minimize the fuel limitation on mission duration, auxiliary attitude control systems may be used to reduce vehicle rotation to lower levels, such as small ion thrusters that accelerate ionized gases electrically to extreme velocities, using power from solar cells. =Spin stabilization= The entire space vehicle itself can be spun up to stabilize the orientation of a single vehicle axis. This method is widely used to stabilize the final stage of a launch vehicle. The entire spacecraft and an attached solid rocket motor are spun up about the rocket's thrust axis, on a \\"spin table\\" oriented by the attitude control system of the lower stage on which the spin table is mounted. When final orbit is achieved, the satellite may be de-spun by various means, or left spinning. Spin stabilization of satellites is only applicable to those missions with a primary axis of orientation that need not change dramatically over the lifetime of the satellite and no need for extremely high precision pointing. It is also useful for missions with instruments that must scan the star field or Earth's surface or atmosphere. See spin-stabilized satellite. =Momentum wheels= These are electric motor driven rotors made to spin in the direction opposite to that required to re-orient the vehicle. Because momentum wheels make up a small fraction of the spacecraft's mass and are computer controlled, they give precise control. Momentum wheels are generally suspended on magnetic bearings to avoid bearing friction and breakdown problems. To maintain orientation in three dimensional space a minimum of three must be used, with additional units providing single failure protection. See Euler angles. =Control moment gyros= These are rotors spun at constant speed, mounted on gimbals to provide attitude control. Although a CMG provides control about the two axes orthogonal to the gyro spin axis, triaxial control still requires two units. A CMG is a bit more expensive in terms of cost and mass, because gimbals and their drive motors must be provided. The maximum torque (but not the maximum angular momentum change) exerted by a CMG is greater than for a momentum wheel, making it better suited to large spacecraft. A major drawback is the additional complexity, which increases the number of failure points. For this reason, the International Space Station uses a set of four CMGs to provide dual failure tolerance. =Solar sails= Small solar sails (devices that produce thrust as a reaction force induced by reflecting incident light) may be used to make small attitude control and velocity adjustments. This application can save large amounts of fuel on a long-duration mission by producing control moments without fuel expenditure. For example, Mariner 10 adjusted its attitude using its solar cells and antennas as small solar sails. =Gravity-gradient stabilization= In orbit, a spacecraft with one axis much longer than the other two will spontaneously orient so that its long axis points at the planet's center of mass. This system has the virtue of needing no active control system or expenditure of fuel. The effect is caused by a tidal force. The upper end of the vehicle feels less gravitational pull than the lower end. This provides a restoring torque whenever the long axis is not co-linear with the direction of gravity. Unless some means of damping is provided, the spacecraft will oscillate about the local vertical. Sometimes tethers are used to connect two parts of a satellite, to increase the stabilizing torque. A problem with such tethers is that meteoroids as small as a grain of sand can part them. =Magnetic torquers= Coils or (on very small satellites) permanent magnets exert a moment against the local magnetic field. This method works only where there is a magnetic field against which to react. One classic field \\"coil\\" is actually in the form of a conductive tether in a planetary magnetic field. Such a conductive tether can also generate electrical power, at the expense of orbital decay. Conversely, by inducing a counter-current, using solar cell power, the orbit may be raised. Due to massive variability in Earth's magnetic field from an ideal radial field, control laws based on torques coupling to this field will be highly non- linear. Moreover, only two-axis control is available at any given time meaning that a vehicle reorient may be necessary to null all rates. =Pure passive attitude control= There exist two main passive control types for satellites. The first one uses gravity gradient, and it leads to four stable states with the long axis (axis with smallest moment of inertia) pointing towards Earth. As this system has four stable states, if the satellite has a preferred orientation, e.g. a camera pointed at the planet, some way to flip the satellite and its tether end-for-end is needed. The other passive system orients the satellite along Earth's magnetic field thanks to a magnet.Attitude and Determination Control Systems for the OUFTI nanosatellites. Vincent Francois-Lavet (2010-05-31) These purely passive attitude control systems have limited pointing accuracy, because the spacecraft will oscillate around energy minima. This drawback is overcome by adding damper, which can be hysteretic materials or a viscous damper. The viscous damper is a small can or tank of fluid mounted in the spacecraft, possibly with internal baffles to increase internal friction. Friction within the damper will gradually convert oscillation energy into heat dissipated within the viscous damper.

It aired on Fox in the United States on February 13, 2011. The episode follows Peter and Brian as they are forced to join Alcoholics Anonymous, due to their excessive drinking, much to their chagrin. Soon, however, Peter crashes his car while driving home drunk, and is approached by Death, who shows him what his life will be like if he continues to drink alcohol, as well if he had never drank at all. Death persuades Peter that he has the willpower to put the bottle down sometimes. The episode was written by Brian Scully and directed by John Holmquist. It received mostly mixed reviews from critics for its storyline and many cultural references. According to Nielsen ratings, it was viewed in 5.99 million homes in its original airing. The episode featured guest performances by H. Jon Benjamin, Adam Carolla, Carrie Fisher, Phil LaMarr, Jessica Stroup and Laura Vandervoort, along with several recurring guest voice actors for the series. It was first announced at the 2010 San Diego Comic-Con International. Plot When Brian and Peter decide to go and see The Sound of Music together, Peter sneaks in liquor, and the two become extremely intoxicated, disrupting the entire audience. Joe is then called upon to arrest them. In court, the two are ordered to attend Alcoholics Anonymous for thirty days, much to their annoyance. At the first meeting, Peter is told that alcohol is a bad part of his life, with Brian becoming reluctant to give up drinking. Realizing that the people in Alcoholics Anonymous have nowhere to drink without being judged, Brian and Peter decide to bring several cases of beer to their next meeting. Joe is once again called upon, under a noise complaint, causing everyone to transform the center into a church and spring into a large musical number, in order to trick Joe into leaving. Afterwards, Peter decides to drive home drunk, and ends up passing out at the wheel and crashing into a tree, killing him instantly. Death arrives, and Peter's soul exits his body. Death decides to give Peter a second chance, and takes Peter into the future, where he sees what will result from his continued excessive drinking: an abusive, drunken and filthy man who tortures his family with cigar burns (which Stewie enjoys) and has sex with his boss Angela while at work. After seeing this, Peter wishes that he had never touched a drop of alcohol in his life, so Death also shows Peter what his life would be like without alcohol: he is extremely cheerful, has a different voice and drinks milk with uptight friends at the Drunken Clam, and he also does not know Joe or Quagmire, but instead looks at them as noisy and uncouth. Peter also does not like this version of himself at all. Death explains to Peter that he doesn't need to give up alcohol altogether, but to drink responsibly, and persuades him that he can live his life without being totally dependent on alcohol. Afterwards, whenever Peter buys a 6-pack of beer, he takes three cans and throws them in the garbage, thus allowing him to drink in moderation, much to Lois' delight. The episode ends at a landfill site, where the seagulls become extremely intoxicated from drinking the beer that Peter threw away. Production and development Seth MacFarlane announced the episode at the 2010 San Diego Comic-Con. First announced at the 2010 San Diego Comic-Con International by series creator and executive producer Seth MacFarlane, the episode was written by series regular Brian Scully and directed by series regular John Holmquist during the course of the ninth production season. Series veterans Peter Shin and James Purdum, both of whom having previously served as animation directors, served as supervising directors for the episode, with Andrew Goldberg, Alex Carter, Elaine Ko, Spencer Porter and Aaron Blitzstein serving as staff writers for the episode. Composer Walter Murphy, who has worked on the series since its inception, returned to compose the music for \\"Friends of Peter G\\". In addition to the regular cast, voice actor H. Jon Benjamin, actor and radio host Adam Carolla, actor Chris Cox, actress Carrie Fisher, voice actor Phil LaMarr, actress Jessica Stroup and actress Laura Vandervoort guest starred in the episode. Recurring guest voice actors Ralph Garman, writer Steve Callaghan, writer Danny Smith, writer Alec Sulkin and writer John Viener made minor appearances throughout the episode. Cultural references Peter refers to Rolf in The Sound of Music as \\"Ian Ziering.\\" In a cutaway, a 19th-century poet writes the lyrics to \\"Gold Digger\\" by Kanye West.

It was designed by Matthew Carter and is of the 'transitional' style from around 1800, based on the \\"Scotch Roman\\" type which originates from types sold by Scottish type foundries that later became popular in the United States. It is named for William Miller, founder of the long-lasting Miller & Richard type foundry of Edinburgh. The general purpose versions of Miller are Miller Text and the Miller Display optical size for display printing, though since their release they have given rise to a number of variants, including Miller Daily, Miller Headline and Miller Banner, as well as some variants commissioned for use in specific publications. The Miller family is widely used, mostly in newspapers and magazines. Miller is closely related to Carter's previous Scotch Roman revival, the very popular Georgia family for Microsoft. Carter had been working on plans for what became Miller when contacted by Microsoft but put them temporarily on hold to work on Georgia, which is adapted to digital display. Font Bureau in marketing have called Miller \\"the debonair cousin of Georgia\\". Background The Miller family was designed by Matthew Carter and developed with the assistance of the Font Bureau's Tobias Frere-Jones and Cyrus Highsmith, and the encouragement of James Mosley, a librarian at the St Bride Library of the history of printing in London. Miller is a \\"Scotch Roman\\"--a style which originated in types sold by Scottish type foundries of Alexander Wilson and William Miller in the period of 1810-1820\\\\. According to Thomas Curson Hansard these were mostly cut by punchcutter Richard Austin of London. This attribution is accepted by Austin's biographer Alastair Johnston (Hansard was writing in 1825, during Austin's lifetime) although Mosley had earlier expressed caution on the attribution. Although Miller remains faithful to the Scotch Roman style, it is not based on any single historical example. The flat-topped lowercase ‚Äút‚Äù is not original to Miller‚Äôs or Wilson‚Äôs types, but a ‚Äúwrong font‚Äù Didone sort introduced later ‚Äî possibly by mistake ‚Äî that became entrenched in the style in the latter half of the 19th century. Certain other letters, such as the lowercase ‚Äúk‚Äù and the Text cut‚Äôs default capital ‚ÄúR‚Äù, are drawn from other faces cut by Richard Austin, such as his type for John Bell. Mosley described Carter's revival of Miller as follows: > Matthew Carter's Miller is not a facsimile of Miller's Scotch Roman, any > more than his Galliard was a facsimile of any one type by Robert Granjon. > What it has done is to capture the good color, and the generous breadth and > modelling of its model, and to bring a valid version of 'Scotch Roman' back > into current use after a lapse [in England] of some decades. Miller was made > with current production needs in mind, of which the two versions, 'Display' > and the more robust 'Text' versions are evidence, and so is its relatively > large x-height. Speaking in 2013 about the development of Georgia and Miller, Carter said, \\"I was familiar with Scotch Romans, puzzled by the fact that they were once so popular...and then they disappeared completely.\\" Carter as a companion digitised a Greek typeface based on British printing of the same period, based on the spare Porson typeface cut (in this case certainly) by Richard Austin and based on the handwriting of British classicist Richard Porson. Miller's default numerals are historically appropriate \\"hybrid\\" or \\"semi-lining\\" figures, slightly shorter than upper-case and in some cases descending below the baseline, although alternative more conventional full-height lining or text figures styles are offered. Variants As well as the general purpose versions of Miller, Miller Text and Miller Display, numerous variants designed by Carter and others have been added to the Miller family.

History During the 19th century, a number of Benedictine monasteries had been founded in the United States by monks coming from monasteries in the German-speaking region of Switzerland. The fortunes of Roman Catholic institutions in Switzerland were turbulent, especially in the 19th century. All were dissolved as a consequence of the French Revolution in 1798, but were restored by Napoleonic decree in 1803, with the exception of the Abbey of St. Gall, where the Prince-Abbot refused to make the necessary political concessions. The anti-monastic policies of the Swiss cantons, however, later brought about the dissolution of monasteries in Pf√§fers (1838), Muri (1841), Fischingen (1848) and Rheinau (1863). The outlook for Swiss Roman Catholics during the Kulturkampf was so bleak that the ancient Abbeys of Einsiedeln and Engelberg began a program of establishing new monasteries in the United States, so that the remaining Swiss monasteries would have a refuge if they were all exiled. Those pioneer monks also were to serve the large number of German people who had emigrated there. As their offshoots, these new communities remained a part of the Swiss Confederation of Benedictine monasteries. By 1881 the number of such communities had grown that it was felt appropriate to separate them from the authority of the mother country. Accordingly, Pope Leo XIII authorized the creation of this congregation on April 5, 1881, under the patronage of the Immaculate Conception of the Blessed Virgin Mary.The Swiss-American Benedictine Congregation Current Status The Congregation, as of 2019, is composed of abbeys and priories throughout the United States, Mexico, Canada, and Guatemala.

In 2013, after having served on the New York City Civil Court, the New York Supreme Court, and the Appellate Division, Abdus-Salaam was nominated to the New York Court of Appeals (New York's highest court) and was unanimously confirmed as an Associate Judge by the New York State Senate. She was the first African-American female judge to serve on the New York Court of Appeals. Early life and education Sheila Turner was born on March 14, 1952, in Washington, D.C., where she grew up in a working-class family with six siblings. She attended public schools there. While researching her family history as a child, she learned that her great-grandfather was a slave in Virginia. Turner obtained a bachelor's degree from Barnard College in 1974 and graduated from Columbia Law School in 1977. Among her classmates at Columbia was Eric Holder, the future United States Attorney General. Career Turner took her first husband's surname, Abdus-Salaam, and retained it during her professional career. Before joining the bench, Abdus-Salaam worked as a staff attorney for Brooklyn Legal Services and served in the New York State Department of Law as an assistant attorney general in the civil rights and real estate financing bureaus. She subsequently served on the New York City Civil Court, from 1992 to 1993. Abdus-Salaam was elected a Justice of the New York Supreme Court in 1993, and served in that capacity from 1993 to 2009. In 2009, she was designated as a Justice of the Appellate Division of the New York Supreme Court, First Judicial Department by Governor David Paterson. She served as an Associate Justice of the Appellate Division from 2009 until 2013. On April 5, 2013, following the death of New York Court of Appeals Judge Theodore T. Jones, Abdus-Salaam was nominated by Governor Andrew Cuomo to fill the resulting vacancy on New York's highest court. She was confirmed by the New York State Senate without opposition in a voice vote held May 6, 2013. She became the first female African-American judge to serve on the New York Court of Appeals. Abdus-Salaam was seen as a liberal voice on the bench. In 2016, she authored the opinion of the Court in In Re Brooke S.B. v. Elizabeth A. C.C., a landmark decision allowing the domestic partners of biological parents to seek child custody or visitation in circumstances where the partners had decided to conceive and raise a child together. Personal life Abdus- Salaam's second husband, James Hatcher, was the son of Andrew Hatcher, who worked as a press officer for John F. Kennedy. Her third husband was Hector Nova, from whom she was divorced in 2005. Abdus-Salaam married her fourth husband, Episcopal priest Gregory A. Jacobs, in June 2016.Wedding of Canon Jacobs, Episcopal Diocese of Newark. Abdus-Salaam's religious affiliation has been the subject of conflicting reports. While it was widely reported that Abdus-Salaam was the first Muslim to serve as a judge of the New York Court of Appeals, it appears that these reports were incorrect. Following Abdus- Salaam's death, Court of Appeals spokesperson Gary Spencer stated that she had never converted to Islam, but had merely retained the last name of her first husband. However, in an article on Abdus-Salaam's death, NBC News described Abdus-Salaam as \\"the first Muslim woman to serve as a U.S. judge\\" and added that her family asserted that she \\"[had] not been a practicing Muslim for 20 years\\". Death Abdus-Salaam was found dead near West 132nd Street in Manhattan on the afternoon of April 12, 2017. Her fully clothed body was found floating in the Hudson River hours after she was reported missing from her home in Harlem. On April 13, police stated that the death of Abdus-Salaam appeared to be a suicide, and added that she had been struggling with depression. On April 18, however, police told reporters that the death was considered \\"suspicious\\" due to the lack of witnesses and lack of a suicide note. An autopsy, while reaching no conclusion about the cause of Abdus- Salaam's death, found bruises on her neck and water in her lungs; this data indicated that she had likely been alive when she entered the river. The bruising could have been caused by someone choking Abdus-Salaam, or could have resulted from the recovery of her body from the river. On April 21, police said they had recovered video from the night of April 11 that showed Abdus- Salaam, dressed in the clothes in which she was found dead, walking around Riverbank State Park along the Hudson River for hours. Police added that the final images captured by the camera showed her standing near the water. On May 3, the New York Police Department announced that its investigation into the death of Abdus-Salaam was complete, and that investigators believed she had committed suicide. The medical examiner concluded that the cause of death was drowning and that the manner of death was suicide. References Further reading * External links * Hon.

He was found not guilty on appeal also, formerly convicted of malfeasance in office () by arranging to have El Mahroug released from police detention during an incident in which she was briefly held on claims of theft. On 24 June 2013, the Court of First Instance sentenced Berlusconi to seven years in prison, and banned him from public office for life. Berlusconi appealed the sentence, and on 18 July 2014, an appeals court overturned Berlusconi's conviction, thus making him once again eligible to hold elected office. Theft arrest of El Mahroug On 27 May 2010, El Mahroug was arrested by the police in Milan after being accused of the theft of ‚Ç¨3000. Since she was not carrying any legal or identification documents, the officers took her to the local police headquarters to identify her and for questioning. Since she was a minor under eighteen, a judge ordered the police to direct her to a shelter for juvenile offenders. After a couple of hours, while she was being questioned, Berlusconi, who was at the time in Paris, called the head of the police in Milan and pressured for her release, claiming the girl was the niece of then-Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and that in order to avoid a diplomatic crisis, she was to be brought to the custody of Nicole Minetti. Following repeated telephone calls by Berlusconi to the police authorities, El Mahroug was eventually released and entrusted to Minetti's care. Minetti was known for previous associations with Berlusconi, having danced for Colorado Cafe, a show on one of Berlusconi's TV channels, and on Scorie, an Italian version of Candid Camera. In November 2009 she became a dental hygienist, and shortly afterward treated Berlusconi for two broken teeth and facial injuries after he was attacked with a marble statue at a political rally. In February 2010, she was selected as one of the candidates representing Berlusconi's The People of Freedom party, despite her lack of any political experience, and was seated on the Regional Council of Lombardy the following month. The Guardian reported that according to a series of media reports in October 2010, Berlusconi had met El Mahroug, then 17, through Nicole Minetti. Mahroug insisted that she had not slept with the then-74-year-old prime minister. She told Italian newspapers that she merely attended dinner at his mansion near Milan. El Mahroug said she sat next to Berlusconi, who later took her upstairs and gave her an envelope containing ‚Ç¨7000. She said he also gave her jewelry. Investigation In January 2011, Berlusconi was placed under criminal investigation relating to El Mahroug for allegedly having sex with an underage prostitute and for abuse of office relating to her release from detention. Berlusconi's lawyers were quick to deny the allegations as \\"absurd and without foundation\\" and called the investigation a \\"serious interference with the private life of the prime minister without precedent in the judicial history of the country\\". The Telegraph reported on 6 March 2011 that prosecutors were days from requesting charges against Emilio Fede, a television anchorman, and Lele Mora, a well-known celebrity agent, for procuring underage girls in a \\"vast pimping network\\" to attend \\"bunga bunga\\" sex parties with the prime minister. According to the prosecutors' dossier, Fede 'discovered' El Mahroug when acting as a judge at a beauty pageant in Sicily in September 2009, and passed her on to Mora's office in central Milan, which served as a \\"form of 'clearing centre' for women eager to enter the prime minister's circle in pursuit of money, gifts and help with their show business careers\\". While the investigators claim to have evidence from lawful interception of mobile phone conversations, Berlusconi denied the allegations through his lawyers, who called the investigation absurd and without foundation. Vote by parliamentarian majority took place on 5 April 2011, in order to assert ministeriality, but it was reversed later by Constitutional Court.in judgment no. 87/2012 the Constitutional Court does not even enter into the version that the President pro tempore had been misled by Ms. Karima to Marhoug about her being related to a foreign Head of State: Trial of Berlusconi On 15 February 2011, a judge indicted Berlusconi to stand trial on charges carrying up to 15 years in prison. Paying for sex with a minor in Italy is punished within a range of six months to three years' imprisonment, while the crime of malfeasance in office () is more severely punished, from four years to twelve years' imprisonment, as it is considered a type of extortion committed by a public officer. The fast-track trial opened on 6 April 2011 and was adjourned until 31 May 2011. El Mahroug's lawyer said that Mahroug would not be attaching herself to the case as a civil complainant and denies that she ever made herself available for money. Another alleged victim, Giorgia Iafrate, also decided not to be a party to the case. In January 2013, judges rejected an application from Berlusconi's lawyers to have the trial adjourned so that it would not interfere with Italy's 2013 general election in which Berlusconi participated. =Verdict and aftermath= On 24 June 2013, Berlusconi was found guilty of paying for sex with an underage prostitute (17-year-old Karima El Mahroug, also known by the stage name Ruby Rubacuori) and of abusing his office. He was sentenced by the Court of First Instance to seven years in prison, one more year than had been requested by the prosecution, and banned from public office for life. In January 2014, Silvio Berlusconi deposited an appeal against the judgment, requesting its complete absolution. The appeal process began on 20 June. On 18 July 2014, the Italian appeals court announced the appeal had been successful and the convictions against Berlusconi were being overturned. According to the court's published summary of the judgement, Berlusconi was acquitted from the extortion charges (abuse of power) because \\"the fact does not exist\\" and from the child prostitution charge because \\"the fact is not a crime\\". The more detailed court reasoning for acquittal will be published within 90 days, and the prosecutor stated he would then most likely appeal the decision to the Court of Cassation. In March 2015, Silvio Berlusconi's acquittal was upheld by high court. On 28 January 2017, an Italian court ordered Berlusconi to stand trial on 4 April 2017 on charges of allegedly bribing witnesses with ‚Ç¨10 million (US$11 million) in order to silence them over accusations he paid for sex with young women.

Airport terminals designed by major architects such as Renzo Piano (Kansai International Airport) or Richard Rogers (London Heathrow Terminal 5) require high quality seating to match the general quality of their interiors. Fire safety is a significant consideration at airports. Regulations now govern the contents of airport terminals and this affects the choice of materials used for the seating. Werner Sobek designed the airport chair Expression using only aluminium in a simple form. Recent firms and designers involved in the highly lucrative and competitive business include Porsche, Vitra, Sir Norman Foster, and Alberto Meda. Business travellers commonly wish to use laptop computers while waiting and so seating for them may incorporate a charging point and a form of desk. Robert Sommer studied the design of airport seating and concluded that the arrangement of chairs in rigid lines bolted to the floor was deliberately sociofugal ‚Äî discouraging social interaction such as conversation and encouraging the sitters to go to commercial locations such as shops and cafes. The provision of arms on the chairs increased the usage of the chairs, as compared with bench seats without arms. Strangers are more comfortable sitting adjacent each other if there is an arm to mark their personal space. The parallel orientation of the modular seat units also minimises face-to-face contact and this is less threatening for strangers.  History  While designing chairs of the Chicago O‚ÄôHare International Airport in 1962, Charles and Ray Eames took it upon themselves to design a chair that would not only be stylish, but also functional for the people occupying each seat. This seat was later deemed the Eames Tandem Sling Seat. Brian Alexander later updated the Eames seat by adding an occasional table in between seats and power outlets for convenient charging of mobile devices.  Variance in airport lounges  Traditional airport seating at Portland International Airport (PDX) in Portland, Oregon, USA gate Seating in airports plays a significant role in the satisfaction of travelling passengers as well as their overall experience in airports. Seating is an important aspect of airports due because it provides both a pleasant airport experience and visual appeal. = Purpose of seating styles = The design of the standard airport seating has not seen a significant change in over 50 years, and is fact known for its simplicity. The primary focus of today‚Äôs airport seating goes to the size and comfort of seating to fit the environment that the airport and airline caters to. Airport lounges provide greater comfort and services in a place separate from the standard airport environment to travelers with a membership. While standard domestic and international airport lounges include basic seating and access to charging stations, these membership-based lounges provides more comfortable and spacious seating. Primary features of airport lounges include refreshments and bars, entertainment, relaxation, and unique seating styles. = Types of seating = Dubai International Airport (DXB) provides airline travelers with a premium seating range of seating material in various colors of blue, red, black and grey. Dubai International Airport (DXB) is an example of an airport that is focused on setting apart standards of original airport seating and experimenting with various colors to enhance appearance and comfort. Priority Pass is a membership-based lounge access service that caters to airports around the world including Africa, Asia, Continental Europe, Latin America and The Caribbean, Middle East, North America and UK and England. With 25 years of service, Priority Pass provides passengers with elegant seating styles, far from ordinary. The first sleeping pod was introduced in 2013 to Helsinki Airport in Finland. The sleeping pod allowed airline travelers to relax in their own peaceful space. The pod features adjustment to be turned from a seat to a bed, storage area for carry-on luggage, as well as charging connectivity. Bamako-S√©nou International Airport offers relaxed seating including bar-style seating Dubai International Airport (DXB) also features sleeping pods that fulfils a similar purpose at their Sleep ‚Äòn Fly Lounge.  Comfortability trends  The environment of airport waiting areas is continuously updated, and revamped. The purpose has been, to enhance the experience of the traveler. Due to the reinforcement of airport security, the wait time of a passenger has significantly increased. To accommodate customer experience, airports have applied major efforts in increasing comfort in the lobbies/seating areas. The space surrounding the seating area within an airport is designed to encourage comfort, happiness and connectedness within travelers. The level of comfort within travelers has been dependent on a number of elements, which affect the surrounding environment. The six airport servicescape factors are: * Design * Scent * Functional organization * Air/lighting conditions * Seating * Cleanliness In a study regarding the importance of these factors, it was found that there is a positive correlation between the comfort of the traveler and the scent of the waiting area. A higher level of comfort has encouraged the desire to fly through a specific airline more than once. = Modern technologies = New styles of seating have been developed to accommodate new technologies. The Ampere modular tandem seating system is designed to allow travelers to use multiple electrical devices while remaining seated in their chair.

The attribution of his works has been dubious for centuries, until his style and career was defined by the American art historian Bernard Berenson. One of his first identified work is the Pala dei Barcaioli (\\"Boatmen Altarpiece\\") in the church of San Pietro Martire at Murano. His only signed work is the St. Peter and St. John the Evangelist in the Pinacoteca di Brera, which shows Lombard influences, such as that of Bramantino. Later he was also influenced by Leonardo da Vinci's style, as visible in the Christ Washing the Feet of the Apostles in the Gallerie dell'Accademia of Venice. After moving to Venice in the wake of Ludovico Sforza's fall, he returned to Milan in 1506. He subsequently executed works for privates and for the Certosa di Pavia; one of his late works, the Calvary, is housed in the National Gallery in Prague. He also collaborated with Marco d'Oggiono for a polyptych in the church of Santa Maria della Pace in Milan, some panels of which are now in the Pinacoteca di Brera.

Ltd. is an Indian fintech company, service for State Bank of India (SBI), ICICI Bank India's two largest banks and Yes Bank, India's youngest private bank, and provides no-frills bank accounts and deposit, withdrawal and remittance services to customers (nearly 80% of whom are migrants or the unbanked section of the population) through mobile banking. With Bharti AXA Life Insurance Company, it provides Bharti AXA Life - Bachat Bima, micro-insurance policies. It was established by brothers Abhishek and Abhinav Sinha in 2007 and two other founders who left after a year. It allows low-wage immigrants workers in the Indian urban areas to remit money to their homes using mobile phones. Sanjay Bhargava was the first chairman. He made important contributions to the business model of the company and invented a security method that enabled a low-end mobile phone to be used to initiate transactions securely. However, the brothers Abhishek and Abhinav, and a few other early employees, deserve credit for scaling Eko. Today it has 180,000 users doing more than 6,000 money transfer transactions a day through a network of 700 \\"branches\\" (banking agents), in which neighborhood grocery and pharmacy stores serve as \\"Customer Service Points\\" (CSP), in Delhi NCR, six districts of Bihar and one district of Jharkhand state, processing Rs. 35 million every day, in 2010 more than Rs. 1 billion were processed through its branches. In 2010, it was chosen amongst the 'NASSCOM EMERGE 50 ‚Äì The League of Ten for 2010' list by NASSCOM, the Indian chamber of commerce, for \\"50 Emerging companies which are redefining the benchmark of excellence for the next generation of SMEs.\\" History India has about 100‚Äì120 million migrant workers and as per recent study by the Centre for Micro Finance (CMF), only 22% of India's migrant labourers have bank accounts. This is because many do not have identification or \\"official\\" residency. This makes saving money difficult and having access to other facilities like money transfer to villages back home through banks, available to only 1/3 of the migrants; instead most have to rely on informal networks like friends, families, hawala couriers or bus drivers etc., making transfers risky, time-intensive, and expensive. Based on the recommendations of the Khan Commission, the Reserve Bank of India, in its 2005-2006 policy year introduced the concept of 'Business Correspondents' to enhance financial inclusion in the Indian banking sector, At the time co-founder Abhishek Sinha, a graduate of BIT Mesra, was working with Mahindra Satyam, and was involved in developing a mobile commerce application for a foreign company. Eventually inspired by a similar program in Brazil, M-Pesa model in Kenya where Vodafone-enabled subscribers send cash to other phone users by SMS, Globe Telecom and Smart Communications, both in Philippines, Abhishek Sinha with brother Abhinav Sinha launched Eko in September 2007 with $0.5 million donated by family and friends as financial service company providing peer-to-peer money transfers, cash deposits and withdrawal, wage and salary payments, micro-insurance, and micro-credit facilities to individuals through small neighbourhood shops, which became their banking agents. Eko planned tied up with Centurion Bank of Punjab in 2008, to open no-frill accounts, fell through after latter merged with HDFC Bank, and the company hit a rough patch. Bill Gates visited the Uttam Nagar, New Delhi situated mobile banking project of Eko, in November 2008, and an important turning point for the company came in March 2009 when it received a \\"grant funding\\" of $1.78 million from CGAP Technology Program which is housed within the World Bank and co-funded by Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. In February 2009, State Bank of India (SBI), the largest state-owned banking and financial services company in India, appointed Eko Aspire Foundation as its official business correspondent, which works actively in the field, while its Eko India Financial Services provides technological and non-technological support to the former. Thus around October 2009, with another grant from CGAP Eko started operations with the launch of 'SBI Mini Savings Bank Account' at Uttam Nagar, New Delhi on 23 February 2009, this allowed account holders to carry out financial transactions like deposit and withdrawal from their accounts through their mobile phones at various SBI Eko Customer Service Points, like local grocery stores, stationery stores, petrol pumps, PCOs and pharmaceutical shops in far flung villages of Bihar and Jharkhand and Delhi, where the low-wage people rarely have access to a banking system. By November 2010, it had 180,000 users carrying out over 7,000 transactions per day through its 500 \\"branches\\" in Delhi and 200 more in Bihar and Jharkhand, the hometowns of many maids and migrants. Eko gets a tiny commission from the bank for each transaction; further on the retailer who operates as Eko's banking agent also gets commission on every account he holds and gets a cut on each transaction, and by August‚ÄìSeptember 2011, it started turning profit. Meanwhile, it also tied up with ICICI Bank, India's second largest bank which started a Apna Savings Account scheme, and started gathering international business media attention, journalist Thomas Friedman wrote about it in the New York Times (Nov 2010)., while Business Week profiled it (Jan 2011). In August 2010, Eko India was chosen amongst the 'NASSCOM EMERGE 50 ‚Äì The League of Ten for 2010' list by NASSCOM, the Indian chamber of commerce, for \\"50 Emerging companies which are redefining the benchmark of excellence for the next generation of SMEs.\\" In October 2011, Eko was selected as a Tech Awards laureate and won the cash prize for Economic Development. Creation Investments Social Ventures Fund I, a leading private equity impact investment fund, and other co-investors are investors in Eko as they support financial inclusion for the bottom of the economic pyramid. In April 2012, Eko was appointed by Yes Bank as a Business Correspondent to provide domestic money transfer services. The services went live in June 2012.

Tournaments *Hatsu basho, Ryogoku Kokugikan, Tokyo, 9 January ‚Äì 23 January *Haru basho, Osaka Prefectural Gymnasium, Osaka, 13 March ‚Äì 27 March (cancelled) *Natsu basho, Ryogoku Kokugikan, Tokyo, 8 May ‚Äì 22 May *Nagoya basho, Aichi Prefectural Gymnasium, Nagoya, 10 July ‚Äì 24 July *Aki basho, Ryogoku Kokugikan, Tokyo, 11 September ‚Äì 25 September *Kyushu basho, Fukuoka International Centre, Kyushu, 13 November ‚Äì 27 November News =January= *23: Hakuho wins the first honbasho of the year. It is his eighteenth championship, and his sixth in a row, a feat only previously achieved by Taiho and Asashoryu. His only defeat is to Kisenosato, who also beat the yokozuna in the previous tournament and once again wins the Outstanding Performance Prize. Kotoshogiku and Okinoumi finish runners-up to Hakuho on 11‚Äì4 and are awarded Technique and Fighting Spirit prizes respectively. Goeido also finishes on 11‚Äì4. The j≈´ry≈ç championship is won by Kasugao, and the makushita title by Matsutani, returning from suspension. Former maegashira Kasuganishiki announces his retirement. He will stay in the sumo world as an elder under the name Takenawa Oyakata. *23: Kiriyama stable shuts down, with its wrestlers moving to Asahiyama stable. *24: Georgian wrestlers Kokkai and Gagamaru are reprimanded by the Japan Sumo Association after allegedly damaging an Indian restaurant after a night of drinking following the sixth day of the Hatsu tournament. *26: Three former wrestlers from the ≈ånomatsu stable are arrested in connection with illegal gambling on professional baseball. *27: The Sumo Association issues a warning to Tamawashi after he leaned against and broke the window of a restaurant in Tokyo after the last day of the Hatsu basho. He had been drinking, and the accident caused an injury to his right arm which will keep him out of action for three weeks. *29: The danpatsu-shiki or official retirement ceremony of former komusubi Kaiho (Tanigawa Oyakata) takes place at the Kokugikan. =February= Chiyohakuho admitted in February to throwing bouts. * 2: It becomes public that police last May investigating the baseball betting scandal found evidence of match fixing of sumo bouts, known as yaocho, from mobile phones belonging to j≈´ry≈ç wrestlers Kasuganishiki and Chiyohakuho. Leaked to the media are a series of text messages between Kasuganishiki and Kiyoseumi, with the low ranker Enatsukasa acting as a go- between. They discuss trading cash for wins and how to orchestrate the matches, with Kiyoseumi saying of one bout, \\"Hit me hard at the tachi-ai and just go with the flow.\\" Also mentioned in the messages are Kaiho (Tanigawa Oyakata), Shimotori, Shotenro, Koryu, Toyozakura, Kyokunankai, , , and Yamamotoyama. Twelve of the wrestlers are summoned to the Sumo Association headquarters to explain themselves. Chairman Hanaregoma tells a press conference that this questioning did not uncover any conclusive evidence but he promises severe punishments to those proven to be involved. * 3: Sports minister Yoshiaki Takaki tells the Diet that three people in the sumo world have admitted their involvement in bout rigging. They are Chiyohakuho, Enatsukasa and the now-retired Kasuganishiki (Takenawa Oyakata). Kiyoseumi denies any wrongdoing. During these interviews Kirinowaka's name is mentioned, bringing the number of wrestlers involved to 14. The Japanese Prime Minister Naoto Kan calls the scandal a \\"betrayal\\" of the Japanese public. At stake is the Sumo Association's future as a government affiliated entity with tax benefits, as this is up for renewal. NHK announces that it will not hold the 44th Annual Charity Ozumo tournament scheduled for February 11, and is considering dropping TV coverage of the March honbasho. Fuji TV is also scrapping its 1-day tournament on February 6. A Ministry of Education official, Kan Suzuki, insists the Sumo Association conduct a thorough investigation, saying \\"Holding the scheduled sumo tournament in March will not gain the public's support unless the association uncovers every detail.\\" An independent panel of seven figures from outside sumo has been set up and will report its findings to the Sumo Association. *5: It is reported that the Sumo Association has decided to cancel the March tournament in Osaka. This will be the first time since 1946 (when the bomb-damaged Kokugikan was undergoing renovation) that a honbasho has been called off. A regional exhibition tournament in Akita Prefecture on August 8 has also been cancelled. *6: Cancellation of the Haru basho is confirmed by Hanaregoma, who tells reporters \\"We cannot, and should not hold the tournament under these circumstances. Until we can completely root out corruption in the sport, we cannot appear in the sumo ring.\\" He also announces the scrapping of all regional tours (jungyo) for the year. The head of the investigative panel, Waseda University professor Shigeru Ito, says that questionnaires distributed to members of the Sumo Association have not led to anyone else confessing involvement, but that the 14 wrestlers under suspicion have been asked to surrender their mobile phones and bank account details for analysis. Ito stresses that the panel will thoroughly investigate without regard for the scheduling of tournaments, which could also put May's Natsu honbasho in Tokyo in doubt. *8: Sports minister Takaki requests that wrestlers co-operate fully with investigators, after reports that some of the 14 who have been asked to hand over their mobile phones have claimed that they are either broken or have been replaced by new ones. *14: Kodansha, publishers of the tabloid weekly Shukan Gendai, demand compensation from the Sumo Association for lost court cases in 2007 over articles that alleged match-fixing, in which they had to pay 8.25 million yen in damages. *15: Police submit requests to the Tokyo District Prosecutors' Office for charges to be brought against two j≈´ry≈ç wrestlers, and Daido, and seven other people, for allegedly taking part in an illegal baseball gambling ring. *17: An independent panel of 11 sumo outsiders, formed last year to look at ways to improve the Sumo Association's governance, delivers its report. It does not mention the current match-fixing scandal, but recommends banning the trading of toshiyori elder names, reducing the number of stables from the present 50 to around 30, issuing contracts with each stable for the education of its young wrestlers, and having outsiders make up about half the Association's 12 man executive board. It criticised the current practice of allowing stablemasters to serve as board members, saying, \\"It is inappropriate that the people who are being supervised are those doing the supervising.\\" *28: Instead of a traditional banzuke, the Sumo Association releases a simple document indicating the rankings of the wrestlers on their performances in the January tournament, to be used for calculating salary and other allowances. Only the positions of the sekitori are released to the media. Chiyohakuho and Kiyoseumi are both listed in the j≈´ry≈ç division. =March= Ex- Kasuganishiki's testimony was crucial to the investigative panel *2: The Mainichi Daily News reports that Takenawa Oyakata (ex Kasuganishiki) has claimed that about 40 other wrestlers were involved in the match-fixing scam, and that he first became exposed to yaocho in January 2006 when a sanyaku wrestler asked him to throw a bout. He refused on that occasion, but later became involved when injuries sent him down to j≈´ry≈ç. *4: ** The Metropolitan Police Department concludes its investigation into the illegal baseball affair by reporting 30 people to prosecutors, including 16 active wrestlers such as Toyonoshima and Miyabiyama, as well as the dismissed Kotomitsuki and Otake Oyakata. ** Shigeru Ito's fact-finding panel has determined that at least 20 wrestlers and coaches are highly likely to have been involved in match-fixing. Most are believed to be lower makuuchi and higher j≈´ry≈ç level wrestlers and do not include the very highest ranked. In addition to the names that surfaced last month, j≈´ry≈ç Asofuji and Masatsukasa are suspected as being regularly involved in trading wins and losses. *5: There are just 36 new recruits reporting for their physical examinations, the lowest ever entry for the month of March. The tests, normally held in Osaka, take place in Tokyo due to the cancellation of the March basho. *18: Prosecutors in Tokyo announce that Kotomitsuki, Otake and 25 others involved in the baseball gambling scandal will be spared indictment over gambling due to lack of implicating evidence. However, they are filing summary charges against nine others, including j≈´ry≈ç ranked Shironoryu. *23: The investigative panel finishes its inquiry into the match-fixing scandal, and is set to meet to decide on punishments and present its findings to the Sumo Association on April 1. *28: It is reported that the panel has recognised the involvement of three more wrestlers in the scandal in addition to those who have already confessed, and that around 20 people are to be either dismissed or hit with lengthy suspensions. *31: Three members of the Sumo Association's executive board, Kitanoumi, Kokonoe and Michinoku, will reportedly resign from their posts after the investigative panel ruled that their wrestlers were guilty of match-fixing. =April= Ex-Kaiho was found guilty of match-fixing but refused to resign *1: The Sumo Association \\"advises\\" nineteen wrestlers to retire because of match-fixing: makuuchi- ranked Tokusegawa, Kasugao, Koryu, Hakuba, Shimotori, Kotokasuga and Mokonami, j≈´ry≈ç Masatsukasa, Asofuji, Sakaizawa, , Kiyoseumi, Toyozakura and Kyokunankai, former makuuchi Yamamotoyama and J≈´monji, and former j≈´ry≈ç , Kirinowaka and . Tanigawa Oyakata, (the former Kaiho), is also asked to resign but is quoted as saying, \\"This is absolutely ridiculous. I told the Japan Sumo Association board that the panel‚Äôs investigation was full of holes. I will take legal action.\\" Many of the other wrestlers also declare their anger at being forced to retire, with Yamamotoyama saying,\\"They decided without listening to my excuse,\\" and Wakatenro protesting, \\"There's no way I can accept this because I'm being forced out simply because my name came up in some testimonies and text messages.\\" They had until April 5 of that year to hand in their retirement papers, or face the even more harsh punishment of outright dismissal. Two year bans are given to those who admitted wrongdoing: Chiyohakuho, Takenawa Oyakata (ex Kasuganishiki) and sandanme ranked Enatsukasa (who acted as the go-between). However, all three have indicated they are leaving sumo completely. Enatsukasa issued an apology to sumo fans, saying \\"I've caused a lot of problems for the wrestlers who genuinely put in the work, and it hurts.\\" Seventeen sumo elders are demoted, with executive members Kitanoumi, Kokonoe and Michinoku resigning from their posts and chairman Hanaregoma taking a 30 per cent pay cut for two months. Hanaregoma told a press conference, \\"We had to punish many people, all of whom are our colleagues. It was a very tough decision to make.\\" About ten other wrestlers are still under investigation, meaning it is unlikely that the Natsu tournament in May will go ahead. *4: Mokonami, Kasugao and Kotokasuga hand in their retirement papers. *5: ** With the deadline to retire set to expire at 4pm, the rest of the 23 guilty men follow suit, with the exception of Tanigawa Oyakata, who tearfully tells a press conference, \\"In the fourteen years I have done sumo, I have never done any yaocho. If I hand in my papers now, it will be an admission of guilt.\\" Tanigawa says he has not yet decided whether he will sue the Sumo Association. Chairman Hanaregoma responds, \\"it is unfortunate but he has his own feeling on this matter.\\" ** Details emerge of the Sumo Association's executive board meeting on Friday. Some board members felt that suspension from upcoming tournaments would be sufficient punishment, and that \\"it's not right to punish all wrestlers simply by believing the testimony of just one or two wrestlers who admit to bout-rigging,\\" but in the end the vote was 9 to 3 in favour of accepting the investigative panel's proposals. The panel reached its conclusions not just on the basis on the text messages but also on the testimony of Takenawa Oyakata, the responses of the wrestlers under suspicion and video analysis of sumo matches. Originally makuuchi Sokokurai and j≈´ry≈ç were also on the guilty list, but their names were removed pending further investigation, and Shotenro was found not guilty. *6: ** Tanigawa is fired from the Sumo Association, having refused to voluntarily resign. ** The Sumo Association announces that there will be a tournament held in May, but it will be a \\"test meet\\" instead of a fully- fledged honbasho. The event is being held purely to decide on the wrestler's rankings for the Nagoya tournament in July. It will take place at the Kokugikan as scheduled, but admission will be free and there will be no Emperor's Cup or prize money. However, the bouts will count on the wrestlers' career records. *7: An eight-member committee set up last month to look at ways of preventing yaocho proposes bringing back the kosho or public injury system, abolished in 2003, which allowed wrestlers who were injured during a honbasho to sit out the next tournament without an effect on their rank. *11: The Sumo Association decides that Sokokurai and Hoshikaze are guilty of match fixing, and forces them both into retirement. However, both are declaring their innocence and refusing to submit their papers, saying they may take legal action. Their stablemasters, Arashio and Oguruma, are both demoted. *13: The deadline for Hoshikaze and Sokokurai to retire passes with both refusing to do so ‚Äì the first active wrestlers in the scandal to not submit their papers. The investigative panel determined that Sokokurai took part in a fixed match with Kasuganishiki in May 2010, based on testimony by the now-Takenawa and others, while Hoshikaze was at first cleared by Takenawa's testimony but then implicated by Chiyohakuho, who testified that his bout with Hoshikaze in the most recent January 2011 tournament was rigged. *14: Sokokurai and Hoshikaze are both fired by the Sumo Association, and make it clear that they will take legal action ‚Äì an option which none of the other 23 wrestlers punished in the match-fixing scandal have chosen. Sokokurai comments, \\"I have never taken part in a fixed match in the eight years that I've been in sumo. I will prove this in court\\", while Hoshikaze says, \\"I want to clearly prove in court that I didn't do it.\\" Hoshikaze's lawyer says his client was never given an opportunity to argue his case once he was found guilty. *18: Onoe Oyakata, already demoted two rungs in the Sumo Association's elder hierarchy because three of his wrestlers were found guilty of match-fixing, falls asleep at the wheel while waiting at a red light and is found by police to be over the legal alcohol limit. He holds a press conference at which he says he deeply regrets what he did. *20: NHK confirms that it will not be broadcasting the May test meet live, nor will it show highlights. *25: On the day that the banzuke for the May honbasho would have been announced, yokozuna Hakuho says he has mixed feelings about the upcoming test meet, which will have no prizes: \\"I, more than anyone else, have the experience and feel the weight of winning the Emperor's Cup and claiming titles. This is very emotional.\\" *28: The Sumo Association says it will broadcast the May test meet live on the internet, and it will also be cutting by almost half the usual amount of electricity it uses at the Kokugikan, to meet power saving measures following the March 11 earthquake. *29: Wrestlers work out before the Yokozuna Deliberation Council and around 1700 spectators at the Kokugikan, the first public performance of sumo since January. =May= the May \\"technical examination\\" tournament *4: Former komusubi Futen'≈ç, who has fallen to the makushita division, announces his retirement from active competition at the age of 30. He will stay in sumo as a coach under the elder name Inagawa Oyakata. *8: The first day of the test meet attracts around 10,000 spectators. Hakuho opens his account with a win over Toyonoshima, and comments, \\"It has been a dark situation for a long time now. But I've gotten through with the first day of competition. I am happy I could wrestle well.\\" Chairman Hanaregoma offers his \\"heartfelt condolences\\" to the victims of the March 11 tsunami in his opening speech, and also apologises to sumo fans for what he calls \\"the problem with intentional spiritless sumo.\\" *22: The final day of the technical examination tournament sees Hakuho take his nineteenth championship after his only challenger, Tochinoshin, loses to Harumafuji. Hakuho subsequently loses his match to ozeki Kaio but his 13‚Äì2 record is enough for his seventh consecutive title, equalling the record held by Asashoryu. Tochinoshin finishes on 12‚Äì3 and is runner-up alongside Kakuryu. Tochinoshin shares the Fighting Spirit prize with Kaisei (who scores 10‚Äì5 in his makuuchi debut) while Kakuryu shares the Technique prize with Goeido. The j≈´ry≈ç yusho is won by Sagatsukasa. Among the many rikishi retiring at this tournament are former sekiwake Hokutoriki, former j≈´ry≈ç and the 44-year-old , the last wrestler to have fought in the old Kuramae Kokugikan which closed in 1984. *25: The Sumo Association announces that a postwar record of 13 rikishi are to be promoted to the j≈´ry≈ç division, to fill the gaps left by the many wrestlers forced to retire over match-fixing. Among the newcomers are Bulgarian Aoiyama, the Czech Takanoyama and Mongolian Arawashi. Among the returnees are former komusubi Kakizoe and former maegashira Hamanishiki. Kakizoe and Arawashi both earned promotion despite posting losing 3‚Äì4 records; the first time in the modern era that this has occurred. =June= *11: Takashima stable, run by the former sekiwake Koboyama, shuts down and its one remaining wrestler retires. *27: The banzuke for the Nagoya tournament is released. The makuuchi division has been reduced to 40 wrestlers from 42, and j≈´ry≈ç to 26 from 28. There are four newcomers to the top division ‚Äì 21-year- old Takayasu, former collegiate wrestlers Takarafuji and Daido and Tamanoi stable's Fujiazuma. Sagatsukasa also returns to the top division for the first time in 7 basho. Kakuryu joins Kisenosato and Kotoshogiku at sekiwake, making it the first time since 2005 that there are three men at sumo's third highest rank. Takamisakari and Kimurayama both find themselves at higher ranks despite only scoring 7‚Äì8 last time out. There are also no wrestlers losing sekitori status ‚Äì the first time this has occurred since 1933. =July= *14: At the Nagoya basho, Kaio wins his 1046th career match, breaking the record held by Chiyonofuji. He is congratulated by the former yokozuna after his bout. *19: After losing his seventh bout of the tournament to fellow ozeki Kotooshu, Kaio announces his retirement after 23 years in sumo. As well as holding the record for careers wins he also won a record 879 top division matches and competed in 107 top division tournaments, 65 of them as an ozeki. He will stay in sumo as a coach at his stable under the elder name Asakayama Oyakata. *23: Ozeki Harumafuji defeats compatriot Hakuho to clinch his second top division championship, standing at 14‚Äì0 while Hakuho falls to 12‚Äì2. This ends his hopes of winning a record eight consecutive yusho. *24: On the final day of the tournament, Harumafuji loses to Kisenosato to finish on 14‚Äì1. Hakuho also loses (to Baruto) to fall to 12‚Äì3, but it is still enough to take the runner- up position. Kotoshogiku finishes on 11‚Äì4, which is not enough to get the ozeki promotion which he was hoping for, but he receives the Outstanding Performance prize for his defeat of Hakuho on Day 10. Homasho also finishes on 11‚Äì4 and receives the Fighting Spirit award. The j≈´ry≈ç championship goes to Myogiryu after a playoff with Masunoyama. The total attendance at the tournament was just 74,000, down 18% on last year, and the final day was the only one to attract a sell-out crowd. *26: Nine promotions to j≈´ry≈ç for September are announced, including Kimikaze, who formerly competed as Naoe and is the first graduate of Waseda University make j≈´ry≈ç since 1933, Mongolian Kyokush≈´h≈ç, Kokonoe stable's , former maegashira Satoyama, and , a former j≈´ry≈ç rikishi who fell off the banzuke completely through injury before returning in just five tournaments. =August= *29: The banzuke for the September basho is released. The retirement of Kai≈ç leaves no Japanese born wrestlers at ozeki or yokozuna for the first time since January 1993. There are three makuuchi newcomers: Masunoyama, the first wrestler from Chiganoura stable to reach makuuchi since it opened in 2004, Czech Takanoyama, whose 58 tournament rise to the top division is the second slowest for a foreigner, and Yoshiazuma, who took 93 tournaments to make makuuchi and is the second oldest top division debutant since WWII at 34 years and three months. =September= Kotoshogiku earned promotion to ozeki in September. *25: The Aki basho is won by Hakuho, who avoids a possible three-way playoff between himself, Kotoshogiku and Kisenosato by beating Harumafuji to finish one win ahead of the sekiwake pair on 13‚Äì2 (Harumafuji's bid for yokozuna promotion ends with a mediocre 8‚Äì7 record). Kotoshogiku is assured of ozeki promotion and gets prizes for Outstanding Performance and Technique. Kisenosato shares the Outstanding Performance prize, and gets his first ever jun-yusho or runner-up performance. He will be looking for ozeki promotion himself in November. Kakuryu, by contrast, is back to square one after scoring only 9‚Äì6. The Fighting Spirit prize goes to Gagamaru for his fine 11‚Äì4 record which included a win over ozeki Baruto. Myogiryu wins his second j≈´ry≈ç championship in a row, this time without the need for a playoff. *26: Isenoumi Oyakata, the former sekiwake Fujinokawa, turns 65 and retires. He is replaced as head coach of Isenoumi stable by former maegashira Kitakachidoki. *28:Kotoshogiku's promotion to ozeki is officially confirmed, the first by a Japanese wrestler since his ex-stablemate Kotomitsuki in 2007. =October= *18: Kasugano Oyakata, the former sekiwake Tochinowaka Kiyotaka and head of Kasugano stable is severely reprimanded by the Sumo Association for beating Tochinoshin and two of his other wrestlers with a golf club after they repeatedly broke stable rules on curfews and wearing Western style clothes instead of kimono in public. Kasugano admitted responsibility and said, \\"I honestly think I went too far and I regret it.\\" Instead he decides to ban Tochinoshin from keiko (training). *27: The Sumo Association launch an investigation into allegations made by the tabloid Shukan Shincho that Naruto Oyakata, the 58th Yokozuna Takanosato and head of Naruto stable, beat a former junior member of his stable with a block of wood and injected Takanoyama with insulin so that the barely 100 kg wrestler would increase his appetite and put on weight. Both Naruto and Takanoyama are summoned to the Ryogoku Kokugikan for questioning by Sumo Association chairman Hanaregoma. *31: The banzuke for the forthcoming Kyushu tournament is released. There are five rikishi making their makuuchi debuts, the most since the September 1950 tournament. They are Myogiryu, who only a year earlier was at the bottom of makushita after a four basho injury layoff, Sh≈çh≈çzan (previously Matsutani), Sadanofuji, the Bulgarian Aoiyama and , who finally reaches the top division at the age of 32 years 8 months. The 63 tournaments it took Tsurugidake to reach makuuchi is the slowest ever by a former amateur collegiate competitor. Myogiryu and Shohozan are also former collegiate competitors, with Myogiryu and Tsurugidake belonging to the same club, Nihon Taiiku University. There are three new j≈´ry≈ç wrestlers, Tokushoryu, , and Ikioi, plus returnee , previously known as Kanbayashi. Also, Homasho finally makes his sanyaku debut at the age of 30 years, 6 months, making him the fourth oldest to do so since the six tournaments a year schedule began in 1958. =November= Tsurugidake was one of five men making his top division debut in November *7: Naruto Oyakata dies of respiratory failure in a hospital in Fukuoka at the age of 59. *8: The Sumo Association announce that Nishiiwa Oyakata (ex-Takanotsuru) will take over Naruto stable and that the investigation into the late Naruto's alleged actions will be dropped. *27: On the final day of the Kyushu tournament, Kisenosato is defeated by new ozeki Kototshogiku to finish on 10‚Äì5. However, the Sumo Association had already indicated earlier in the day that his record was good enough for ozeki promotion. He is also awarded his first Technique Prize. Yokozuna Hakuho, who wrapped up his 21st yusho on Day 13, loses his final bout to Baruto to finish on 14‚Äì1. Runner-up is rank-and-filer Wakakoyu on 12‚Äì3, who wins his first Fighting Spirit prize. He shares the award with Bulgarian Aoiyama, who scores 11‚Äì4 in his makuuchi debut. Myogiryu also has a good start to his top division career, finishing on 10‚Äì5. The j≈´ry≈ç championship goes to Ikioi in his debut in the division. Retiring are former sekiwake Tamanoshima, who becomes Nishiiwa Oyakata, and former j≈´ry≈ç division Daishoumi. *30:Kisenosato's promotion to ozeki is officially confirmed. =December= *21: The banzuke for the January 2012 tournament is announced. There are four newcomers to the top division, Chiyonokuni, Tenkaiho, Kyokushuho and , and four j≈´ry≈ç debutants, the Russian Amuru, , Chiyotairyu and Homarefuji. Miyabiyama, the former ozeki who dropped to j≈´ry≈ç in 2010, returns to the sanyaku ranks after 29 tournaments away. Deaths *18 April: Former maegashira (also former Sendagawa Oyakata), aged 72, of heart failure. *8 October: Former maegashira Wakasegawa, aged 49, of complications from diabetes. *7 November: 59th Yokozuna Takanosato (also Naruto Oyakata), aged 59, of respiratory failure.

Dutch colonial architecture in Indonesia were built across the archipelago that once was known as Dutch East Indies. Most of the better and permanent colonial era structures are located in Java and Sumatra, which were economically considered more important during the Dutch imperial period. http://www.colonialarchitectureproject.org/index?/category/3003-indonesia As a result, there are large number of colonial buildings concentrated in its cities. Plenty of old VOC era forts and warehouses are also scattered throughout the archipelago, particularly around Maluku Islands and Sulawesi. There are three Dutch colonial architectural styles: *Old Indies Style *Indies Empire style *New Indies Style Early architecture: replicating the mother country Fort Rotterdam in Makassar a typical Dutch fort of the 17th century. Upon arriving in the East Indies, the Dutch's architecture were mainly derived from knowledge and workmanship of the home country. On most cases masonry were favored for much of their construction. Previously timber and its by-products had been almost exclusively used in the Indies, with the exception of some major religious and palace architecture. During the early period of colonization the Dutch colonies were mainly ruled by the VOC, who were mainly concerned with functionality of its construction rather than making structure as prestigious display.http://www.pac- nl.org/downloads/colonialarchitectureinindonesia.pdf One of the first major Dutch settlements was Batavia (later Jakarta) which in the 17th and 18th centuries was a fortified brick and masonry city built on a low lying terrain. The Dutch settlements in the 17th century were generally intra-muros, within walled defences to protect them from attack by other European trade rivals and native revolt. The fort was both a military base and a center of commerce and administration. The city was laid out into a grid with blocks that are divided by canals, complete with a Town Hall and Churches, just like any Dutch city would have been at the time. The houses within Batavia are described as being \\"fairly tall with a narrow fa√ßade and plastered walls inset with crossbar windows provided with rattan wickerwork for ventilation\\". And as in the Netherlands they were mainly terraced houses with small courtyard. Similar behavior of town planning and architecture can be noted in the development of the VOC port of Semarang in the 18th century.Pratiwo. (2005). The City Planning of Semarang 1900‚Äì1970. In F. Colombijn, M. Barwegen, P. Basundoro & J. A. Khusyairi (Eds.), Old City, New City: The History of the Indonesian City Before and After Independence. Yogyakarta: Penerbit Ombak. For almost two centuries, the colonists did little to adapt their European architectural habits to the tropical climate.Dawson, B., Gillow, J., The Traditional Architecture of Indonesia, p. 8, 1994 Thames and Hudson Ltd, London, In Batavia, for example, they constructed canals through its low-lying terrain, which were fronted by small-windowed and poorly ventilated row houses, mostly in a Chinese-Dutch hybrid style. The canals became dumping grounds for noxious waste and sewage and an ideal breeding ground for the anopheles mosquitos, with malaria and dysentery becoming rife throughout the Dutch East Indies colonial capital. And by the second half of the 17th century people inside walled Batavia started to build their large countryside estates and villas alongside the Molenvliet Canal, the best examples to survive are former mansion of Reyner de Klerk which was built in rigid European style. =Chinese Influence= Pintoe Ketjil's Chinese shophouses along Ciliwung River. Both VOC and later Dutch government encourage Chinese immigration to their colonies in the East Indies, these Chinese were brought as laborers and many of them ended up as a contractors during the early development of Batavia. In fact at the early 18th century Batavia had been described as a \\"Chinese city\\", and they had dominated the trade and economic sector of many VOC outposts around the East Indies. Many of the main colonial cities have large number of Chinese shophouses, which incorporated elements of the Chinese, Dutch and as well as Indigenous, particularly in the ventilation system. Unfortunately many example of these Chinese dwellings have been largely demolished in favor of cheap modern small offices. Parts of Surabaya, Medan, Tangerang and Semarang still has few examples around the Chinatown area. The most eminent example is Tjong A Fie Mansion in Medan, built in the year 1900 by a rich Chinese businessman Tjong A Fie; and also Candranaya Building in Jakarta which was built in 1807 by a Kapitan China. The Chinese also had built their ancestral temples in many cities, mainly in the historic Chinese quarters across the country and in imposingly Chinese style. The oldest temple to have survived is Kim Tek Ie in Glodok which dates back to 1650. =Early adaptation to the local environment= Although row houses, canals and enclosed solid walls were first thought as protection against tropical diseases coming from tropical air, years later the Dutch learnt to adapt their architectural style with local building features (long eaves, verandahs, porticos, large windows and ventilation openings). The Dutch Indies country houses of the middle 18th century were among the first colonial buildings to incorporate Indonesian architectural elements and attempt adapting to the climate. The basic form, such as the longitudinal organisation of spaces and use of joglo and limasan roof structures, was Javanese, but it incorporated European decorative elements such as neo-classical columns around deep verandahs. The style is known as Indies Style. 19th Century The Palace of Daendels, completed in 1828. At the end of the 19th century, great changes were happening across much of colonial Indonesia, particularly Java. The VOC have gone into bankruptcy and its possession were acquired by the Crown of Netherlands. Economic reform were started by the French-pro Governor General Daendels, who were appointed in Java to manage the deteriorating VOC outposts. Daendels popularized the French neoclassic Empire Style in the Indies, which later became known as Indies Empire style. Daendels quit the by then already dilapidated castle of Batavia and expanded a suburb on the satellite town of Weltevreden in the south. Due to trade blockade by the English there was difficulties in gaining building materials, and thus majority of the old fortification of Old Batavia were dismantled to build public buildings of the 19th century style in Batavia. Similarly all the outpost on the outer islands beyond Java have experienced similar trend of architecture style, however very few of these buildings manage to survive. In the late 19th century the taste for architecture in Europe have begun shifting to Neo Gothic and Neo Renaissance, the colony however didn't experience a boom in this style of architecture until later period. It was in this period also that the number of growing appreciation of indigenous architectural forms; Tawang railway station (1864) in Semarang features example of a harmonious assimilation of eastern and western ideas. In 1869 Suez Canal have been opened which had increased the volume of ships travelling from Europe to the East, new ports such as Tanjung Priok and Tanjung Perak were built to accommodate the increasing arriving ships. And it was also around the same period that Dutch Ethical Policy were implemented for the native of Dutch East Indies resulting several construction boom in cities. Near the end of 19th century, a major civic building the Jakarta Cathedral was built in Neo-Gothic style, and on later period several Catholic churches; such as Surabaya's Kepanjen Church and Malang's Ijen Church, are also built in similar manner. However Neo Gothic remained stranger in the tropical setting of the Indies and were not as implemented as in British Raj. While Neo Renaissance can be seen in several buildings such as Blenduk Church of Semarang. Twentieth century At the turn of the 20th century there was further significant changes in the colony. The Dutch by this period have manage to control most of the present day Indonesian border. The Dutch also have implemented the Dutch Ethical Policy that encourage both entrepreneurial opportunities for Europeans and flow of foreign investment. There was also increasing interest in exploiting Indonesia's wealth in oil and gas, leading capitalist to further set an eye on the archipelago and the Dutch to upgrade its infrastructures. Significant improvements to technology, communications and transportation had brought new wealth to Java's cities and private enterprise was reaching the countryside. The architectural trend of the colony followed the Metropolis' status both in economic health and popularized style. At the early 20th century, most of the buildings in the colony were built in Neo Renaissance style of Europe which was already popularized in the Netherlands by Pierre Cuypers. His nephew Eduard Cuypers would later traveled to the Indies to design several magnificent offices for De Javasche Bank across the country. Eduard Cuypers would also establish largest architectural agency in the East Indies, then called Hulswit-Fermont, Batavia and Ed. Cuypers, Amsterdam. Other prominent architect such as Berlage designed two buildings strictly in Dutch style such as the Algemene Insurance company in Surabaya and a building in Batavia. Cosman Citroen also had designed Lawang Sewu in strikingly European appearance. Moojen's NILLMIJ in Batavia, 1912. However, by the 1920s, the architectural taste have begun to shift in favor of Rationalism and Modernist movement, particularly there was Increasing Art Deco architecture design influenced by Berlage. In the first three decades of the 20th century, the Public Works Department rolled out major public building and city planning programs. The key designer was T. Karsten who developed his predecessors' ideas for incorporating indigenous Indonesian elements into rational European forms.Vickers (2005), pp 23-25 Bandung which once was described as a \\"laboratory\\", is of particular note with one of the largest remaining collections of 1920s Art-Deco buildings in the world, with the notable work of several Dutch architects and planners, including Albert Aalbers, Thomas Karsten, Henri Maclaine Pont, J. Gerber, and C.P.W. Schoemaker. A large number of train stations, business hotels, factories and office blocks, hospitals and education institutions were built in this period. With economic growth and increasing European migration to the colony, there was increasing middle class population and urbanization from the countryside. To accommodate this growth several modern Garden Suburb were built across the cities of the Indies such as P.A.J. Moojen's Menteng in Jakarta, T. Karsten's New Candi Suburb in Semarang, and most of North Bandung. Ceremonial Hall, Bandung Institute of Technology, Bandung, by architect Henri Maclaine-Pont. This pre-war Bandung home is an example of 20th century Indonesian Dutch Colonial styles Various Dutch architect also made the Indies their architectural and engineering playground. This resulted to the introduction of architecture style such as Nieuwe Zakelijkheid, De Stijl and Amsterdam School, most of which had survived and can be observed in design for colonial period offices, churches, public buildings and villas. Perhaps the highest form of \\"enlightenment\\" can be seen in Villa Isola, designed by Schoemaker in Bandung. Several architect such as C.P.W. Schoemaker and H.M. Pont also made an attempt on modernizing the indigenous architecture of Indonesia, by incorporating it with western modernity, paving the way for the creation of vernacular New Indies Style. The development of this architecture trend paralleled the growth of Delft School of the Netherlands. Bandung Institute of Technology, Pasar Gede of Solo and Pohsarang Church in Kediri are clear example of this experiment. The attempt of conforming with the local architecture had already began since the early VOC period as appeared in the Indies Style. The differences is whereas the Indies Style country houses were essentially Indonesian houses with European trim, by the early 20th century, the trend was for modernist influences--such as art-deco--being expressed in essentially European buildings with Indonesian trim (such as the pictured home's high-pitched roofs with Javan ridge details and often with more consideration for air ventilation). Practical measures carried over from the earlier Indies Style country houses, which responded to the Indonesian climate, included overhanging eaves, larger windows and ventilation in the walls. The outer islands Art Deco in Medan appeared in the former building of AVROS, now the Sumatra Planters Association (BKS PPS). There are plenty of colonial architecture and infrastructure that remain functional beyond Java. The island of Sumatra in particular benefited from its abundance of oil and tin, in comparison to Java's mostly plantation based economy. The best buildings are concentrated in West Sumatra, North Sumatra and Aceh. Medan was once known as \\"Parijs van Sumatra\\" and have a large number of Art Deco colonial offices concentrated around Kesawan Square. For the European and upper class local population the Dutch had planned and built the Garden Suburb of Polonia.Medan Het Parijs van Sumatra ¬ª Balai Pelestarian Nilai Budaya Aceh Moorish Revival architecture also paved their way to Sumatra's Mosque design. The Maimun Palace and Great Mosque of Medan are beautiful example of the movement. There are large concentration of colonial offices, public buildings and villas in the city of Padang, Sawahlunto, Bukittingi and Banda Aceh, all of which was major economic cities in colonial Sumatra. Other parts of Sumatra also include Bangka-Belitung Islands Regency (a major source of Tin), and the pepper port of Bengkulu. In Makassar, which once was considered the gateway for Eastern province, has several fine colonial era buildings. The best surviving example of colonial buildings is Fort Rotterdam, followed by the old Cityhall, Court of Justice and Harmonie Society building that now function as an art gallery. Large scale demolition of colonial era old town took place in Makassar as a result of its harbor expansion. Colonial rule was never as extensive on the island of Bali as it was on Java-- it was only in 1906, for example, that the Dutch gained full control of the island--and consequently the island only has a limited stock of colonial architecture. Singaraja, the island's former colonial capital and port, has a number of art-deco kantor style homes, tree-lined streets and dilapidated warehouses. The hill town of Munduk, a town amongst plantations established by the Dutch, is Bali's only other significant group of colonial architecture; a number of mini mansions in the Balinese-Dutch style still survive. There are numerous forts built by European powers across the archipelago, but the highest concentration are located around the Maluku Islands. Most are built the early colonial era to protect Dutch interest in the spice trade. There is particularly a high concentration of colonial buildings in Banda Neira, Saparua, and Nusa Laut, with several 17-18th century churches and fortification. Ambon City was once renowned for its \\"colonial charm\\" and stock of Dutch buildings; however, the city was largely destroyed during World War II. In independent Indonesia The lack of development due to the Great Depression, the turmoil of the Second World War and Indonesia's independence struggle of the 1940s, and economic stagnation during the politically turbulent 1950s and 60s, meant that much colonial architecture has been preserved through to recent decades. Although colonial homes were almost always the preserve of the wealthy Dutch, Indonesian and Chinese elites, and such buildings in general are unavoidably linked with European colonialism, the styles were often rich and creative combinations of two cultures, so much so that the homes remain sought after into 21st century. Native architecture was arguably more influenced by the new European ideas than colonial architecture was influenced by Indonesian styles; and these Western elements continue to be a dominant influence on Indonesia's built environment today.

It retells the theft and attempted sale of lunar samples plus a Martian meteorite from a vault at NASA's Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center by a cooperative education student assisted by another co-op, an intern, plus an acquaintance. The book received mainly negative reviews, criticized for its purple prose and overly- sympathetic discussion of the ringleader. Summary The story follows Thad Roberts, a University of Utah student and high-achieving NASA co-op in Houston, dreaming of doing great things such as becoming an astronaut; his love interest Rebecca; and his accomplices Sandra and Gordon McWhorter. The group stole lunar samples from Building 31, had sex on a bed covered by the precious stones, were arrested by the FBI during a sting operation in Orlando, and sentenced. The book also describes Thad's release from jail. Reception In a review in The Globe and Mail, the book is described as \\"in the pulp-non- fiction genre, crafted with colour-saturated prose and hyperbolic plot points that have its screenplay in view\\", but was criticized for failing to identify or explore why Roberts undertook the theft in the first place, \\"other than sex\\". A review in The New York Times criticized Mezrich's writing style for being excessively elaborate and dramatic, and for both the book and Roberts repeating the themes and style of his previous works, most notably the biography of Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, The Accidental Billionaires. The writing of Sex on the Moon was described as \\"cookie-cutter\\" and Roberts having a motivation of \\"a desire to be cool and attract hot babes\\". The review also criticized the book for highlighting the drama of the events without noting that Roberts' actions resulted in the destruction of 30 years‚Äô worth of research notes regarding the moon rocks by Roberts' Nasa mentor, Everett K. Gibson. A review in The A.V. Club also compared the book to The Accidental Billionaires and Mezrich's portrayal of Roberts to his portrayal of Zuckerberg, stating that the novel-like approach to a nonfiction book was jarring at times, but had the advantage of providing a strong characterization of the central player, Roberts. A review in USA Today gave the book two out of four stars and stated that \\"Mezrich has a credibility gap that shines through writing that's overwrought, overstated, over-everything.\\" The review criticized Mezrich's prose for being excessively flowery, and for recreating dialogue a decade after the conversations took place, which allowed for a more compelling narrative but raised serious questions about the book's resulting accuracy. A review for CNN also noted Mezrich's repeating choice of writing about \\"young geniuses, some with questionable ethics\\". A review written for The Daily Beast describes the choice to write from Roberts' perspective as a \\"narrative pitfall\\" given he appears to be \\"somewhat delusional\\", making it hard to differentiate fact from fiction, and notes that Mezrich takes frequent \\"creative liberties\\". The review also criticized Mezrich for being overly sympathetic to Roberts and his rationalizations for his actions. A review for Boston describes the book as containing \\"impressively hackneyed writing\\", but a fast read with many interesting details, though it does not deal with the moral dilemmas raised by Roberts' actions. The characterization of Roberts is seen as the main flaw, who is described as \\"off-putting\\" and unsympathetic with \\"glib rationalization\\" for his actions, ultimately coming off as a \\"sad sociopath\\". Kirkus Reviews describes the lead-up to the theft as the most interesting part of the book, but the prose as \\"overheated\\", and states that Mezrich fails in his efforts to portray Roberts, ultimately a \\"small-time crook\\", as a hero. Film In 2011, the book was optioned by Sony Pictures Entertainment, who also produced The Social Network based on Mezrich's biography of Mark Zuckerberg.

She was the most powerful imperial princess in Ottoman history and one of the prominent figures during the Sultanate of Women.  Name  Mihrimah Sultan's name means \\"Light of the Moon\\" in Persian. To Westerners, she was known as Cameria, which is a variant of \\"Qamariah\\", an Arabic version of her name meaning \\"of the moon\\". Her portrait by Cristofano dell'Altissimo entitled as Cameria Solimani. Other Ottoman imperial princesses who also named ‚ÄúMihrimah‚Äù and also Mihrimah Sultan's close relative were: * Mihrimah's niece, daughter of ≈ûehzade Bayezid (son of Suleiman the Magnificent; Mihrimah's younger full-brother) * Mihrimah's grandniece, daughter of Murad III (son of Selim II; Mihrimah's nephew) Biography A letter that was written by Mihrimah Sultan to Sigismund II Augustus in 1548 Mihrimah was born in Constantinople (Istanbul) around 1523 during the reign of her father, Suleiman the Magnificent. Her mother was Hurrem Sultan, an Orthodox priest's daughter, who was the current Sultan's concubine at the time. In 1533 or 1534, her mother, Hurrem, was freed and became Suleiman's legal wife. On 26 November 1539 in Istanbul at the age of seventeen, Mihrimah was married to R√ºstem, a devshirme from Croatia who rose to become Governor of Diyarbakƒ±r and later, Suleiman's Grand Vizier. Her wedding ceremony and the celebration for her younger brother Bayezid's circumcision occurred on the same day. Five years later, her husband was selected by Suleiman to become Grand Vizier. Though the union was unhappy, Mihrimah flourished as a patroness of the arts and continued her travels with her father until her husband's death. Mihrimah Sultan and R√ºstem Pasha had two children: Osman and H√ºma≈üah. = Political affairs = Mihrimah traveled throughout the Ottoman Empire with her father as he surveyed the lands and conquered new ones. In international politics, Hurrem Sultan sent letters to Sigismund II, King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania, and the contents of her letters were mirrored in letters written by Mihrimah, and sent by the same courier, who also carried letters from the sultan and her husband R√ºstem Pasha the Grand Vizier. Therefore, it is most probable that Hurrem and Mihrimah were well known even among ordinary Ruthenians. Although there is no proof of Hurrem or Mihrimah's direct involvement in her half-brother ≈ûehzade Mustafa's downfall, Ottoman sources and foreign accounts indicate that it was widely believed that Hurrem, R√ºstem and Mihrimah worked first to eliminate Mustafa so as ensure the throne to Hurrem's son and Mihrimah's full-brother, Bayezid. The rivalry ended in a loss for Mustafa when he was executed by his own father's command in 1553 during the campaign against Safavid Persia because of fear of rebellion. Although this stories were not based on first-hand sources, this fear of Mustafa was not unreasonable. Had Mustafa ascended to the throne, all Mihrimah's full- brothers (Selim, Bayezid, and Cihangir) would have likely been executed, according to the fratricide custom of the Ottoman dynasty, which required all brothers of the new sultan be executed to avoid feuds among imperial siblings. Mihrimah also became Suleiman's advisor, his confidant and his closest relative, especially after Suleiman's other relatives and companions died or were exiled one by one, like Mustafa (executed in October 1553), Mahidevran (lost her status in the palace after Mustafa's death and went to Bursa), Cihangir (died in November 1553), Hurrem (died in April 1558), R√ºstem (died in July 1561), Bayezid (executed in September 1561), and G√ºlfem (died in 1561 or 1562). After Hurrem's death, Mihrimah took her mother's place as her father's counselor, urging him to undertake the conquest of Malta and sending him news and forwarding letters for him when he was absent from capital. = Economic power = Beside her great political intelligence, Mihrimah also had access to considerable economic resources and often funded major architectural projects. She promised to build 400 galleys at her own expense to encourage Suleiman in his campaign against Malta. When her brother ascended to the throne as Selim II, she lent him some 50,000 gold sovereigns to sate his immediate needs. Mihrimah Sultan Mosque in Edirnekapƒ±, ƒ∞stanbul, Turkey. Mihrimah also sponsored a number of major architectural projects. Her most famous foundations are the two Istanbul-area mosque complexes that bear her name, both designed by her father's chief architect, Mimar Sinan. Mihrimah Sultan Mosque (Turkish: Mihrimah Sultan Camii), also known as ƒ∞skele Mosque (Turkish: Iskele Camii), which is one of √úsk√ºdar's most prominent landmarks and was built between 1546 and 1548. The second mosque is also named as Mihrimah Sultan Mosque at the Edirne Gate, at the western wall of the old city of Istanbul. Its building took place from 1562 to 1565. Her Kira has sometime been identified as Strongilah or Esther Handali. Charities The twin minaret mosque complex in √úsk√ºdar, a prominent landmark, consisted of a mosque, a madrasah, a soup kitchen to feed the poor, a clinic and a primary school. With the exception of the mosque, the primary school, library and madrasah are currently used to serve as an outpatient clinic. The mosque in Edirnekapƒ± consists of a fountain, madrasah and hammam. Unlike its namesake, it features a single minaret. The construction of the complex, which was accepted by Kanuni Sultan S√ºleyman on behalf of his daughter Mihrimah Sultan, started in the first years of the 1540s and was completed in 1547 according to the mosque. The complex, which was one of the first important building groups built by Mimar Sinan simultaneously with the ≈ûehzade Complex after being the architect, consisted of facilities such as waterways, fountain, reservoir and toilet next to the mosque, madrasah, primary school, imaret and inn. However, in the following periods, two tombs and possibly a double bath were added to the complex, and a wooden pavilion and temporary residence, whose presence could be determined from engravings, but the imaret-tabhahane, inn, pavilion and temporary quarters disappeared in time, and the double bath. The fountain, which is extended from the porch of the last congregation place and surrounded by columns, is an elegant example of the stone workmanship of its period. Water-roads were also installed here and water was brought from the plots on Baƒülarba≈üƒ± and Icadiye ridges. It is estimated that one of these waterways, one following today's Cumhuriyet street and the other following the northern ridges and Pa≈üalimanƒ± street of Sultantepe, was built in 1681 when the Mihrimah Sultan Fountain was added. Later life and death Mihrimah Sultan was buried next to her father Suleiman the Magnificent inside his t√ºrbe at S√ºleymaniye Mosque Mihrimah's life was uncertain after Selim's death in 1574. Some say she lost all her power and retired at the Old Palace. However it is most likely that Mihrimah kept her position at Topkapƒ± Palace and continued to share her power with Nurbanu, the new Valide Sultan, until her own death, and was the only Imperial Princess to be ranked with Nurbanu Sultan (Murad's mother) and above Safiye Sultan (Murad's wife) in the royal court. Mihrimah died in Istanbul on 25 January 1578 during the reign of her nephew Murad III, outliving all of her siblings. She is the only one of Suleiman's children to be buried in his tomb, the S√ºleymaniye Mosque complex. In popular culture * In the 2011‚Äì2014 TV series Muhte≈üem Y√ºzyƒ±l, she is portrayed by Pelin Karahan. * In The Architect's Apprentice, a 2014 novel by Elif ≈ûafak, she is a central character.

The animal's name comes from its scales that are raised above the surrounding scales and have rough texture. The scales are known as \\"keels\\". Taxonomy A 2016 genetic analysis showed that the closest relative of the rough-scaled snake is the tiger snake (Notechis spp.). Description The snake is brown to olive with narrow, irregular cross-bands or blotches of darker brown. The belly surfaces are greenish-grey or olive-cream, often with darker blotches. The mid-body scales have a raised keel or carinated appearance. The coloration and scale structure has led to some confusion with the non venomous keelback snake. It grows to around 70 cm in length. Habitat The snake's habitat includes rainforests, moist open air forests and waterways. It is found from mid-eastern New South Wales to the tip of far- north Queensland. Behaviour The snake is active both day and night. It can climb trees in pursuit of prey. The rough-scaled snake is highly venomous and will readily bite if attacked or handled. Diet The snake eats a variety of small vertebrates; frogs, lizards, small mammals, birds. It generally forages at ground level but can climb to take prey. Venom The rough-scaled snake is a highly venomous snake. Its venom is a fast acting powerful neurotoxin that is both presynaptic and post-synaptic. It has potent post-synaptic neurotoxins as well as potent pre-synaptic neurotoxins. It also has potent coagulants as well as myotoxins. It will readily bite and is known for its foul disposition and defensive nature. Several fatalities have occurred due to this species and it will strike rapidly in defense.

When his father died at the age of ten, Christen Collin was raised by his maternal grandfather in Troms√∏e. He took the cand.philol. degree at the Royal Frederick University in 1887, and studied abroad while writing for Verdens Gang before returning home and founding the periodical Nyt Tidsskrift. He started teaching at the Royal Frederick University in 1892, and was promoted to docent in the history of European literature in 1895. He was a member of the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters from 1897. He was a professor from 1914 to his death, and is best known for his research on English literature and Bj√∏rnstjerne Bj√∏rnson. He biographed the early Bj√∏rnson in the 1907 book Bj√∏rnstjerne Bj√∏rnson. Hans barndom og ungdom. A collection of letter correspondence between Bj√∏rnson and Collin was released in 1937. A William Shakespeare biography was planned but never finished, but Collin wrote articles on Shakespeare, reissued The Merchant of Venice and translated English poetry. Collin was not uncontroversial in his time. He criticized Naturalism, especially in the 1894 book Kunsten og moralen, and received rebuttals from people like Gunnar Heiberg, Nils Kj√¶r, Arne Garborg and Georg Brandes. He, especially in his later career, wrote several books where he diagnosed the European culture of the time with \\"cultural diseases\\" or \\"cultural problems\\". In them, he fused his cultural knowledge with sociology, natural sciences and medicine. Such books include (1910), (1912), (1914), (1916), (1917), (1917), (1921) and (1922). From 1918 to 1925 he edited his own periodical, Atlantis. He was branded as a socialist by some, but shunned by the socialists after supporting the existence of a military. During the First World War he strongly supported of the Triple Entente. In July 1894 he married Astrid Greve (1874‚Äì1947), a daughter of Mathias Sigwardt Greve and sister of Ulrikke Greve and Bredo Greve. He died in April 1926 in Oslo.

Albasini was born to an Italian family, but according to tradition born in Portugal on a ship leaving for Africa ‚Äì hence the Portuguese form of his first name. A passionate tradesman and big game hunter, Albasini came to Louren√ßo Marques in 1831. He revolutionised trade in the Lowveld more than a decade before the first settlers from European descent arrived there. Albasini set up trade routes and infrastructure that reached from the port at Louren√ßo Marques far into the mainland. Albasini supplied the Tsonga people with ammunition and rifles to protect themselves against other tribes. He also trained and employed 500 Tsonga men to hunt elephant for him, these 500 Tsonga men were all given hunting riffles or guns and Albasini did not control the supply of guns to these hunters because he trusted Tsonga people very well. By contrast, Albasini will not give guns or ammunition to any other tribes other than the Tsonga people, the reasons were clear, Albasini did not trust anyone and he prohibited the supply of guns to any tribe except the Tsonga people. Albasini was a good friend and fellow of the Tsonga people, he was revered among them that they made him their honorary tribal leader and named their area Albasini village, which was later renamed Valdezia in 1875, he ruled supreme as a chief of the Tsonga people at Valdezia Village until his death in 1888. In 1858 Albasini was appointed Vice Consul of Portugal in South Africa and was married to Gertina Maria Petronella, daughter of ‚ÄúTrekker‚Äù Janse van Rensburg. Albasini later settled at Schoemansdal. He died in 1888 and was buried on Goedgewensch farm, near where the Albasini dam was built. Jo√£o Albasini was the paternal great grandfather of prominent artist, the late Selma Albasini. Appointment of tinduna/headmen N'wamanungu confirm and appoint while Joao Albasin recognise all Tsonga chiefs in the Elim area, between the years 1845-1885, powerful Tsonga chiefs, such as Hosi Bungeni, Hosi of Elim, Hosi Mbhokota, Hosi Bokisi, Hosi Mtsetweni, Hosi Ndengeza, Hosi Malele of Wayeni, Hosi Sibisi Mahatlane, Hosi , Hosi Sikhunyana (Makhoma), Hosi Nkuzana, Hosi Xitaci and many more, were appointed as headmen by N'wamanungu and confirm by Albasini. The large Tsonga population in the Elim area today are a result of Albasini's policies of encouraging Tsonga immigration into the area, mostly between the years 1845-1895. Due to large scale Tsonga immigration into the Elim area, headmen were appointed (by Albasini) to help settle the thousands of Tsonga immigrants who arrived in the area as refugees from Mozambique. That is the reason why Albasini is famously known as the \\"White Chief of the Shangaan people\\". Fall of Schoemansdal After the destruction of Schoemansdal by the Venda King Makhado in 1867, all whites left the area and moved south, where they established the town of Pietersburg, 100 km away. The Pedi King, Sekhukhune did not attack the Boers when they took land in Pietersburg, the town grew to be the biggest town north of Pretoria, while Schoemansdal became a ghost town. Joao Albasini remained as stubborn as ever and was the only white person left in the Schoemansdal district. He was able to resist attack by Makhado because his Tsonga warriors, consisting of 2000 Tsonga men, armed with assault rifles, guarded his fort day and night. When the Boers returned to Schoemansdal during the 1870s, Albasini was able to assist the Trekkers with food and land. Joao Albasini and Coenraad de Buys were the only two Europeans in the Transvaal and indeed, in the whole of South Africa, to rule Africans as their Chief or leader. Joao Albasini acted at all times as a paramount chief of the Transvaal Tsonga people until his death in 1888. In same year N'wamanungu of Siweya Clan took over the thrown of Kingship of vatsonga until 1901 -1902 at Klien Letaba river where he shoot died by James Alfred Taylor ,Shiel and Phephu Ramabulana . He was the main man in protecting the Davana family and the great warrior of vatsonga tribe. Legacy Albasini died in 1888 and was buried by the Tsonga people in accordance with Tsonga burial rituals, the Tsonga people were deeply hurt and saddened by the death of their beloved chief. The village of Valdezia, situated 3 km from the Albasini Dam, is a village where Joao Albasini ruled supreme as chief of the Tsonga people. Every year, hundreds of Tsonga people gather around the grave of Joao Albasini and perform Tsonga rituals in honour of their tribal leader. The grave of Joao Albasini is regarded as a sacred site by the Tsonga people of Valdezia Village and the Tsonga neighbouring villages. References De Vaal, J.B. 1953.

It is now a museum, and has had a history spanning almost 900 years. To the side of the house is a small garden belonging to St John's and to the rear is the large St. Nicholas' Park. The museum is currently operated by Warwickshire Heritage and Culture's Museum Service, a branch of Warwickshire County Council. The current grade I listed building dates from around 1666, and is considered one of the most important building in Warwick.  Historic Use  In the almost 900 years of its existence, St. John's House has had a wide and varied history. Many of its uses have been related directly to helping local people, particularly in the realms of health and education - a tradition which is continued today in its use as a free museum to educate the local community on the area's history. = As a hospital = In the mid 12th century, during the reign of Henry II, the land on which St. John's House stands was given to the establishment of the Hospital of St. John the Baptist. The hospital was brought into being by William de Beaumont, then Earl of Warwick. This hospital provided two purposes: To help the local poor and ill; and to provide casual overnight boarding and food to impoverished travelers such as pilgrims.A detailed history of the hospital. The Hospital of St. John the Baptist was one of two such hospitals in the town of Warwick at the time. The other was the Hospital of St. Michael, founded with the sole purpose of providing help and respite to those in the parish suffering from leprosy. Of both hospitals, only the chapel building of St. Michael still stands.Dugdale's History of Warwickshire In 1291's taxatio, the Hospital was noted to own a dovecote worth 2 shillings. Additionally, the carucate of land owned by the Hospital was valued at 10 shilling per year. In 1337, protection was granted to the hospital's brethren and their attorneys for the collection of alms at churches. At this time it was suggested that some building renovation was necessary. It is known that in 1610 the site comprised four standing buildings, including a gatehouse topped with crenelations. The largest of the three other buildings has crosses at the roof's apex, suggesting its religious use as the site's chapel.Warwickshire County Record Office - 'The Ground plott of Warwick', in Dugdale, W. The Antiquities of Warwickshire, London, 424-5 At the time the hospital site also included a cemetery - remains have often been dug up during refurbishment or remodeling works on the House. The first recorded case was in the 1830s when work was being undertaken in the kitchen garden. In 1987, two workmen digging to the Coten End front of St. John's Court flats discovered two skulls.Archaeological Report 0446 Rev A July 2006, Warwickshire County Council records = As a residence = During the Dissolution of the Monasteries at the behest of Henry VIII, St. John's was granted to Anthony Stoughton, for services to the King. The land was later passed to his eldest son William by inheritance. Neither of the two lived in the house, but they leased it out to others such as Richard Townsende, a yeoman at Warwick. Eventually the land was inherited by the son of William Stoughton, Anthony Stoughton (junior), who built a house on the site. Of note is the fact that in the East Wing of the house there is a door lintel which bears the date 1626 and the initials A.S.. The house remained in the possession of the Stoughton family until 1960. = As a school = In 1791, the building was rented out for the first time by the Earl of Warwick for public use, with the intent of converting it into a school. The school, then known as St John's Academy, was founded by William T Fowler and was set up as a school for \\"Young Gentlemen\\" (as advertised on the hand-billPoster for St John's Academy, Warwick, for the education of young gentlemen c.1800. Warwickshire Country Record Office (PV WAR St John 8) Throughout the life of the school, its cohorts changed frequently. In 1828, the daughters of William Fowler, then running the school, changed it to a school for girls. It was then reverted in 1845 under a Mr. Townsend. Then it returned to a girls' school in 1884, which continued until the very end of the 19th Century. In the later part of the school's life, as money became tighter, the school restricted itself to the lower part of the house, with upper rooms being leased out to local artists and other public figures, with their studios being open for public viewing. The school was declared bankrupt in 1900 and closed down. = As a public service = After a brief spell of private tenancy in the start of the 20th century, the house became property of the War Department, where it was used for the administration of the Home Counties and East Anglian Brigades. In 1959 the Lord Warwick declared sale of the Warwick Castle Estates, including the St. John's House. It was bought by Warwickshire County Council along with the Royal Regiment of Fusileers (Royal Warwickshire), who own it to this day. The building was then turned into a museum, with some of the premises leased to the Regiment. The museum was officially opened in 1960 by Bernard Montgomery, 1st Viscount Montgomery of Alamein.  The Museum  Now, the museum provides information about the history of the site, as well as Warwick and the surrounding area. Features of the museum include: * A full-sized replica of a Victorian classroom, as it would have appeared during the educational period of St. John's House. The display includes benches and seating, charts and diagrams, as well as teaching tools such as abacuses and blackboards, all contemporary of the time. This display is designed to give people (young people in particular) an idea of what education would have been like in 19th century compared with now. The Museum currently runs activities based on this exhibit for schools. * The second floor houses a museum dedicated to the history of the Royal Warwickshire Fusiliers. * In 2011, the Museum Service established a themed outdoor space, St John's Brook Gardens, between St John's House Museum and St Nicholas' Park. This features woodcarving and information on natural history. The museum is free and open to the public. The museum is located half a mile from the Market Square and the main bus station, and a short walk from Warwick railway station.

It is located west-northwest of Las Vegas, Nevada. It was closed by the Air Force in 1969 and turned over to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). The site is now data-tied into the Joint Surveillance System (JSS). History Las Vegas Air Force Station was initially part of Phase II of the Air Defense Command Mobile Radar program. The Air Force approved this expansion of the Mobile Radar program on October 23, 1952. Radars in this network were designated \\"SM\\". The radar site is located on top of Angel Peak, which is north-northwest of the city of Las Vegas, and east of Charleston Peak. The Air Force constructed about 24 main buildings in two LVAFS areas, the Operations and Cantonment Areas. Construction in the Operations Area consisted of four radar towers, four operational buildings, one water pump station, a power building, and five large above-ground fuel tanks. The Cantonment Area contained approximately five dormitories, a dispensary, a mess hall, an administration building, an automotive shop, a maintenance shop, a storage building, a recreation building, one underground gasoline storage tank, and one large above-ground fuel oil tank. Each building had a smaller day tank for storage of heating oil. Three septic tanks comprised the sewage treatment system. The station became operational on 1 April 1956 when the 865th Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron was assigned to the new station. The squadron initially used AN/FPS-3 search and AN/MPS-14 height-finder radars at this site, and the station functioned as a Ground- Control Intercept (GCI) and warning station. As a GCI station, the squadron's role was to guide interceptor aircraft toward unidentified intruders picked up on the unit's radar scopes. In 1958 an AN/FPS-20A replaced the AN/FPS-3 search radar. During 1961 Las Vegas AFS joined the Semi-Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE) system, initially feeding data to DC-21 at Luke AFB, Arizona. After joining, the squadron was redesignated as the 865th Radar Squadron (SAGE) on 15 October 1961. The radar squadron provided information 24/7 the SAGE Direction Center where it was analyzed to determine range, direction, altitude, speed, and whether or not aircraft were friendly or hostile. It also became a joint-use facility with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). On 31 July 1963, the site was redesignated as NORAD ID Z-163. An AN/FPS-26A height-finder radar joined the site in 1963. In 1964 an AN/FPS-27 search radar set was installed, and in 1965 the AN/FPS-20A was retired from Air Force service. Reportedly, the FAA retained this radar set. In 1968 the AN/MPS-14 height-finder radar was removed. In addition to the main facility, Las Vegas operated several AN/FPS-14 Gap Filler sites: * Boulder City, Nevada (SM-163A): , now home to a VOR/DME * Lathrop Wells, Nevada (SM-163B): The 865th Radar Squadron (SAGE) was inactivated 31 December 1969. In 1970 the Air Force relinquished the property to the Department of Interior and transferred accountability for all improvements, with the exception of Buildings 18 and 40, to Clark County. Accountability for Building 18 was transferred to the Atomic Energy Commission (currently DOE) and accountability for Building 40 (Radar Tower FPS-20) was transferred to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). , all main buildings in the Operations Area are in use. The FAA operates the radar facility in Building 40. DOE maintains Building 18 and leases space to Nellis Air Force Base, and other government and private entities. Clark County leases all other buildings in the Operations Area to other government and private organizations. The former Cantonment Area is used by Clark County Juvenile Court Services, Spring Mountain Youth Camp (SMYC). Buildings 5, and 44 have been removed, but the foundations are currently used for various functions. The FAA had operated the AN/FPS-20A as part of the Joint Surveillance System (JSS) until the facility was replaced with a CARSR and ModeS. Both the SMYC and FAA facilities are restricted access.

In the post- conflict era, HLC has continued working for the rights of victims of war crimes and social injustice, investigating the truth and pursuing justice on their behalf, working to obtain material and symbolic reparation, and campaigning to secure the removal of known perpetrators from state institutions and other positions of authority. Human rights activities Humanitarian Law Center (HLC) was founded in 1992 by Nata≈°a Kandiƒá. It aims to assist the successor states of the former Yugoslavia establish the rule of law and come to terms with the large-scale human rights abuses committed during armed conflicts in Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Kosovo in particular, prevent the recurrence of such crimes, ensure perpetrators of war crimes are brought to justice and promote the cause of justice.Humanitarian Law Center 2007 Annual Report at HLC website , accessed 22 January 2011 HLC works across national boundaries to assist post-conflict societies within the region reestablish the rule of law and deal with past human rights abuses.

The discussion was about initiative to call for leaders of former Yugoslavia to establish RECOM network on the forthcoming London summit within the Berlin Process in July 2018. The Humanitarian Law Center advocates a regional approach to transitional justice in the Western Balkans. Documenting and prosecuting war crimes in the countries affected by the conflicts of the former Yugoslavia involves obtaining information from other countries as perpetrators, victims and witnesses often live on opposite sides of national frontiers. At the First Regional Forum on Transitional Justice in Sarajevo in May 2006 HLC and other human rights NGOs launched a joint initiative to establish a Regional Commission to determine and disclose the facts about war crimes committed in the former Yugoslavia (RECOM).Impunity Watch , accessed 25 January 2011 Regional consultations involving young people, artists, media, human rights NGOs, victims, associations of victims and associations of war veterans took place between May 2006 and October 2008 across the Western Balkans and two more Regional Forums were held in Zagreb and Belgrade. At the Fourth Regional Forum held in October 2008 in Pristina, Kosovo, more than 100 organizations and individuals, including victims and victim associations from Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Kosovo, Montenegro and Serbia and associations of citizens, human rights NGOs, media associations, and other civil society groups from across the region came together to form the Regional Coalition for RECOM (today RECOM Reconciliation Network). The Regional Network is carrying out consultations with civil society about RECOM's mandate and character and working to develop a model structure for RECOM. It is campaigning to collect one million signatures supporting the establishment of RECOM and calling on national governments in the region to support the establishment of RECOM. In August/September 2010 RECOM representatives held meetings with the Croatian president Ivo Josipovic and Serbian president Boris Tadic who expressed their support and enthusiasm for the initiative.\\"RECOM Initiative Wins Support of Croatian and Serbian Presidents\\", Impunity Watch News, 9 September 2010 , accessed 25 January 2011 Achievements In March 2009, former members of the 37th Special Police Unit (PJP) of the Ministry of the Interior of the Republic of Serbia (MUP Serbia) were arrested on the basis of information and evidence acquired by HLC about the unit's participation in large-scale war crimes in Kosovo. In May 2008, HLC filed criminal charges against Bo≈æidar Deliƒá, a retired Major General of the Yugoslav Army, current deputy speaker of the Serbian National Assembly and senior official of the Serbian Radical Party, and another ten members of the Yugoslav Army relating to the massacre at Trnje/Termje, Kosovo, on 25 March 1999, in which members of the 549th Motorised Brigade under Deliƒá‚Äôs command killed 42 Albanian civilians, including children, women, and elderly people. In April 2008 the submission of evidence by HLC about war crimes committed in Lovas, Croatia, led to the Belgrade War Crimes Chamber began the trial of 14 indictees for their alleged role in the killing of 70 Croatian civilians in the first war crimes trial of former Yugoslav National Army officers. In 2007 HLC obtained the opening of an investigation into the murder of 700 Bosniaks in Zvornik in 1992. HLC published the full transcript of the trial of Slobodan Milosevic at the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) in Bosnian/Croatian/Serbian and provided copies to prosecutors offices, courts, judges, and lawyers throughout the Western Balkans in order to facilitate war crimes trials in the region. In 2006 HLC secured the removal from office of the Head of the Serbian Police War Crimes Investigation Unit and two colleagues who had occupied positions with the Ministry of Interior during the time of the armed conflict in Kosovo, knew or should have known about crimes that were being committed and had failed to prevent or report them. In 2005 HLC provided the ICTY with the notorious video tape showing members of the Scorpions, a unit of the Serbian Interior Ministry, executing six Muslims from Srebrenica at Trnovo. The release of the tape shocked the Serbian public with its revelation of Serbia‚Äôs involvement in the war crimes committed at Srebrenica. In 2004 HLC established its Victim-Witness Support Programme to encourage and support hesitant witnesses testify in war crimes proceedings before the Serbian courts. Register of Serbian and Montenegrin victims 1991-1995 In January 2009 began to research and compile a register of individual citizens of Serbia and Montenegro who were killed or disappeared during the armed conflicts in Slovenia (1991), Croatia (1991‚Äì1995) and Bosnia and Herzegovina (1992‚Äì1995) with the aim of creating an objective record of the Serbian and Montenegrin victims of the conflicts of 1991‚Äì1995 on the territory of the former Socialist Federative Republic of Yugoslavia (SFRJ) that would serve to curb attempts at historical revisionism and manipulative use of the numbers of victims. The register is based on analysis of documents including newspaper reports from the period, publications, court documents (ICTY and regional courts), associations of veterans and families of the dead, etc. and interviews with eyewitnesses or family members of individuals who lost their lives. By the end of 2010 HLC researchers had interviewed a total of 411 witnesses and family members and analysed 5,381 documents and from these sources had compiled a list of 2.028 citizens Note: as of August 2020, the HLC website's list is working in Serbian language mode only!of Serbia and Montenegro who were killed or disappeared in the wars of the former Yugoslavia between 1991 and 1995. Kosovo Memory Book As part of its work of researching war crimes and human rights violations in Kosovo, HLC has compiled its Kosovo Memory Book. This is a record of all individual victims of the conflict between 1 January 1998 and 31 December 2000, documenting the circumstances in which each of the victims was killed or disappeared. The object is to prevent political manipulation of the number of victims, help society confront the reality of the atrocities committed during the conflict, and build a culture of remembrance.\\"Kosovo Memory Book\\", Humanitarian Law Center website , accessed 22 January 2011 As of 16 October 2008 HLC had recorded 13,472 victims in Kosovo between 1998 and 2000.

Of the 4,593 victims still to be fully processed, 1,666 were Serbs (686 members of the army or police, 590 civilians and 390 of unknown status), 1,553 ethnic Albanians and 120 members of other ethnic communities; the ethnicity of the remaining 1,254 victims was still unconfirmed. HLC repudiated media reports that 12,000 Serb victims had been registered. HLC had been provided with information by the Serbian Missing Persons Commission and in September 2008 the Serbian Ministry of Defence provided information about army members who disappeared or were killed in Kosovo. However the Interior Ministry had been unwilling to provide information about murdered or missing police officers. HLC had initially estimated that 8,000-10,000 Albanians were killed and 2,000-2,500 Serbs, Roma, Bosniaks and other non-Albanians during the Kosovo conflict. As of May 22, 2009, the International Committee of Red Cross recorded 1,906 individuals from all ethnic groups who were still considered missing. Teams of researchers have conducted research in Kosovo and Serbia, interviewing witnesses, family members and other persons with knowledge of the circumstances in which victims disappeared or were killed and collecting documents and photographs of victims, graves, monuments etc. The research findings are analysed and used to add to or update the records in the war crimes database. From 1 September 2007 until 31 August 31st 2009, 4874 records were created documenting the fate of 8752 victims. The total number of victims recorded in HLC‚Äôs database of victims is 13,790, including 3,562 victims of documented mass crimes. To date HLC recorded and described the fate of 7,636 Albanians, 845 Serbs, 109 Roma, 64 Bosniaks, 34 Montenegrins, 22 Ashkali, six Gorani, 13 Kosovo Egyptians, six Turks, two Russians, one Croat, two Hungarians, one Macedonian, one Bulgarian, one Ruthenian, two Slovenians, one Yugoslav, and six victims of undetermined nationality.

Returning to Minneapolis, he spent nine years as art director of greeting cards with the Buzza Company. Comic strips He launched Aggie Mack with the Chicago Tribune Syndicate in 1946. Comics historian Eric Agena described Rasmusson's characters: :Aggie Mack was created by Hal Rasmusson in 1946, and appeared in the Chicago Tribune until the end of the 1950s. It was a gag-a-day strip based mainly on the everyday life of teenagers, with the star being a cute blonde named Aggie Mack. There were also numerous supporting characters, with a lot of the guys having real \\"hip\\" names like Animal, Wayout and Swinger. The series enjoyed great success in France, where it first appeared in Fillettes in 1947. In 1960, G√©rard Alexandre, who signed with the pseudonym AL.G., created a French version of the strip based on Rasmussen's creation and called it simply Aggie. Back in the United States, the series was taken over by Roy Fox after Rasmusson's death in 1962. In 1966, the name of the American strip was shortened to Aggie and continued to run until its demise in 1971.Comic Strip Fan Rasmusson also drew the accompanying strip Honey Bun until 1953.

It is located north-northeast of Tucson, Arizona. It was closed in 1969. History Mount Lemmon Air Force Station was established in 1954 by Air Defense Command as one of a planned deployment of forty-four mobile radar stations to support the permanent ADC Radar network in the United States sited around the perimeter of the country. This deployment was projected to be operational by mid-1952. Funding, constant site changes, construction, and equipment delivery delayed deployment. This site became operational on 1 April 1956 when the 684th Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron was assigned by the 34th Air Division to Mount Lemmon AFS. The squadron began operations using AN/MPS-7, AN/MPS-14, and AN/TPS-10D radars at Mount Lemmon in August 1956, and initially the station functioned as an aircraft control and warning station. The AN/TPS-l0D was soon retired. By 1959 an AN/FPS-20 had replaced the AN/MPS-7 search radar. The Ground Air Transmitting Receiving (GATR) Site (R-92) for communications was located at , Normally the GATR site was connected by a pair of buried telephone cables, with a backup connection of dual telephone cables overhead. The Coordinate Data Transmitting Set (CDTS) (AN/FST-2) at the main site converted each radar return into a digital word which was transmitted by the GATR via microwave to the Control Center. During 1961 Mount Lemmon AFS joined the Semi Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE) system, feeding data to DC-21 at Luke AFB, Arizona. After joining, the squadron was re-designated as the 684th Radar Squadron (SAGE) on 15 October 1961. The radar squadron provided information 24/7 the SAGE Direction Center where it was analyzed to determine range, direction altitude speed and whether or not aircraft were friendly or hostile. During the following year, an AN/FPS-6 supplemented the AN/MPS-14 height-finder radar, and the AN/FPS-20 was upgraded to become an AN/FPS-67. On 31 July 1963, the site was redesignated as NORAD ID Z-92. The AN/FPS-6 was removed in 1968. In addition to the main facility, Mount Lemmon operated several AN/FPS-14 Gap Filler sites: * Sells, AZ (M-92A): * Benson, AZ (M-92C): * Globe, AZ (M-92D): The 684th was inactivated in December 1969. However, the GATR facility (R-92) was later reactivated, and is still in use as site G-29 by the 355th Communications Squadron, Davis-Monthan AFB, Arizona. After its closure, Mount Lemmon AFS was used by the University of Arizona and others as an observatory. Its tracking radar (now removed) was used by US Army from Fort Huachuca.

While in prison, he said, he was confronted with a fellow prisoner named Randy who was a devout Christian. Wood said he often challenged Randy's Christian beliefs, initially claiming that Randy was only a Christian because he was born into a primarily Christian society, specifically the United States. Wood stated that, while in prison, he and Randy frequently fasted, with Wood attempting to \\"beat\\" Randy at fasting, which eventually resulted in Wood being placed into solitary confinement under observation due to concerns over Wood potentially attempting to commit suicide by starvation. During this time, he began to read the Bible and participate in various Bible study programs in order to respond to Randy's rebuttals (thus \\"beating\\" him) but it eventually led Wood to convert to Christianity in 1996.

Wood said that he concluded that the Quran and Muhammad's example did not simply describe violence in the past (as in the Christian Bible per his assertion), but rather commanded ongoing violence.

First mentioned De Cliff is first mentioned as accompanying the king abroad in May 1313; and on 11 May 1317, as a master in chancery, he had charge of the Great Seal at the house of the Lord Chancellor, John Sandale, Bishop of Winchester. Possible confusion and further career There is another master in chancery in Edward II's reign of the same name, probably a brother. From 1317 till 1324 de Cliff continued to be one of the clerks under whose seal, during the absences of the Lords Chancellors Sandale, Hotham, Bishop of Ely, Salmon, Bishop of Norwich, and Baldock, the great seal was constantly secured. On the opening of parliament on 6 October 1320 he was auditor of petitions in England and Wales. On 23 February 1324 he appears as a canon of York and as procurator in parliament at Westminster, both for the dean and chapter of York and for the bishop of St Asaph. As Master of the Rolls On 4 July 1325 he was appointed Master of the Rolls, and after the abdication of Edward II in 1326 he was, on 17 December, directed to add his seal to that of the Bishop of Norwich to secure the great seal. Until the appointment of Bishop Hotham of Ely as lord chancellor on the accession of Edward III, the Bishop of Norwich and Cliff discharged the chancellor's duties. For some dispute with Thomas de Cherleton, Bishop of Hereford, in connection with the presentation to the prebend of Blebury in Salisbury Cathedral he incurred the penalty of excommunication, in regard to which, within a month of his accession, and again in the following March, Edward III personally wrote letters on his behalf. The great seal continued to be often entrusted to him. From the resignation of John de Hotham to the appointment of Henry Burghersh, Bishop of Lincoln (1 March to 12 May 1328), he held it along with William de Herlaston, and during absences of Burghersh it was in his custody again in 1328 (1‚Äì30 July and 17‚Äì26 August), and in 1329 (31 May-11 June). He was similarly entrusted with it under the next chancellor, John de Stratford, bishop of Winchester, in April and November 1331, and April and December 1332. In 1329 he was a commissioner with the Bishop of Hereford and another to open the adjourned session of parliament. Death He died in January 1334, and on the 20th was succeeded by Michael de Wath.

Life Clifford was the sixth of the eight sons of the Hon. Thomas Clifford (fourth son of Hugh Clifford, 3rd Baron Clifford of Chudleigh) of Tixall, Staffordshire, by the Hon. Barbara Aston, younger daughter and coheiress of James Aston, 5th Lord Aston of Forfar. After receiving some preliminary education, he spent some months in 1795 at Stonyhurst College. He married on 15 June 1809 Eliza Matilda, second daughter of Donald Macdonald of Berwick-upon-Tweed. His wife died in August 1827. There seems to have been no issue of the marriage. He died at Winchester on 16 January 1830, aged 52. Works His first publication was The State Papers and Letters of Sir Ralph Sadler, edited by Arthur Clifford, Esq.; to which is added a Memoir of the Life of Sir R. Sadler, with Historical Notes by Walter Scott, Esq., Edinburgh (Constable), 1809, 2 vols. 4to (a few copies were printed on large paper in 3 vols. 4to). This collection consists of four sets of letters relating almost entirely to Scottish affairs. A less complete collection of Ralph Sadler's State Papers had been previously published in 1720. The documents in Clifford's edition were printed by him from a copy of the original manuscripts preserved at Tixall, the seat of his eldest brother, Thomas Hugh Clifford, to whom they had descended through the family of Lord Aston, into which Sir Ralph Sadler's granddaughter had married. Sir Walter Scott superintended the printing of the book, besides contributing the notes and a memoir of Sadler extending to thirty pages (republished in Scott's Miscellaneous Prose Works, iv. 834). After publishing the Sadler Papers, Clifford made a search at Tixall for the papers of Walter, Lord Aston, ambassador in Spain under James I and Charles I. The Aston family had formerly lived at Tixall, and James, fifth lord Aston, was Clifford's grandfather. The Sadler MSS. had been originally found at Tixall 'in an old oaken box covered with variegated gilt leather, and ornamented with brass nails. Clifford's father had at one time made a bonfire of various old trunks and papers that had been accumulating in the house for two centuries, but the gilt leather box was rescued by the ladies of the family. Clifford now found that it contained all the state papers and letters of Sir Walter Aston carefully tied up in small bundles, and in his researches at Tixall he also discovered a number of letters and papers relating to the Aston family, some manuscript volumes of poetry, and an additional packet of letters belonging to Sir R. Sadler. The Gentleman's Magazine for March 1811 announced that the State Papers and Letters of Sir W. Aston were then being printed uniform with the Sadler Papers. This work, however, never appeared, though in 1815 Clifford published Tixall Letters, or the Correspondence of the Aston Family and their Friends during the Seventeenth Century; with Notes and Illustrations, 2 vols. London, 1815. He had already published in 1813 the manuscript volumes of poetry found at Tixall, under the title of Tixall Poetry . . . with Notes and Illustrations, Edinburgh, 1813, 4to. Sections i. and iv. of this book are headed : 1. 'Poems collected by the Hon. Herbert Aston,' 1658. 2. 'Poems by the Hon. Mrs. Henry Thimelby.' 3. 'Poems collected by Lady Aston'. Some of the poems are original, others are transcribed by the Astons from the works of different English writers. Clifford adds some verses of his own, including a Midnight Meditation among the Ruins of Tixall (also published separately 1813 ? 4to). In 1817 he was staying at Paris with his eldest brother, and while there published Collectanea Cliffordiana, in three parts, containing notices of the Clifford family and an historical tragedy on the battle of Towton; and A Topographical and Historical Description of the parish of Tixall in the county of Stafford. By Sir Thomas [Hugh] Clifford, Bart., and Arthur Clifford, Esq., Paris, 1817, 4to. In his later years Clifford published some treatises on teaching: # A Letter to ... the Earl of Shrewsbury on a new Method of teaching and learning Languages, &c.;, 2 pts. 1827, 8vo. # An Introduction to the Latin Language in three parts, Oxford (1828 ?), 8vo. # Instructions to Parents and Teachers respecting the use of the elementary Books for the Latin Language, &c.;, Oxford, 1829, 12mo.

His mother was Isabella (d. 25 July 1362), daughter of Maurice, 2nd Lord Berkeley. He succeeded his elder brother, Robert de Clifford, 4th Baron de Clifford in 1350, on which day he made proof of his age.(Dugdale, i. 240; Whitaker, pp. 310‚Äì11; Hist.

A similar summons to defend his lands in Ireland was issued on 28 July 1368.(Rymer, vi. 319, 595) His chief services, however, were rendered on the Scottish borders. In July 1370 he was appointed one of the wardens of the west marches; but according to Sir H. Nicolas he is found defending the northern borders fourteen years earlier.(Rymer, vi. 657; Dugdale, i. 340; Scrope Roll, ii. 469, &c.;) Resigned the truce with Scotland on 24 August 1369, and was warden of both east and west marches on five occasions between 1380 and 1385. In August 1385 he accompanied Richard II's expedition against Scotland with sixty men-at-arms and forty archers. His last border sendee seems to have been in October 1388, when he was ordered to adopt measures of defence for the Scotch Marches.(Rymer, vi. 570, 637, 714, vii. 9, 475; Nicolas, Scr. and Gros.

In 1377 he was made High Sheriff of Cumberland and governor of Carlisle, a city whose walls he appears to have inspected and found weak in the preceding year. To the last two offices he was reappointed on Richard II's accession. He was made a commissioner of array against the Scots (26 February 1372), and one of a body of commissioners to correct truce- breakers and decide border disputes 26 May 1373, having sat on a similar commission in September 1367. =Parliament= Clifford was summoned to all parliaments from 15 December 1356 to 28 July 1388.(Dugdale, i. 340; Hist.

Education Clifton was the fourth and youngest son of Josiah Clifton, merchant, of Great Yarmouth, Norfolk, and his wife Mary who was the only child of Thomas Fenne of the same town. Deciding to follow the medical profession, he was entered at Leyden on 23 May 1724, and before the end of the year graduated doctor of medicine there. His inaugural dissertation, De distinctis et con-fluentibus Variolis (Leyden, 1724) was included by Albrecht von Haller in the fifth volume of his Disputationes ad Morborum Historiam et Curationem Facientes. Career Clifton afterwards settled in London, where his classical and scientific attainments won him the friendship of many eminent men, including Sir Hans Sloane, at whose instance he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society on 22 June 1727. The same year he published , (London, 1727), which was followed in 1732 by Proposals for Printing, by subscription, all the works of Hippocrates in Greek and Latin, digested in a new and regular manner, but from want of encouragement the intended publication never appeared. Clifton received the honorary degree of M.D. from Cambridge on 26 April 1728, during the visit of George II; was admitted a candidate of the College of Physicians on 23 December in the same year, a fellow on 22 December 1729, and read the Gulstonian lectures in 1732. In 1731 he published Tabular observations recommended as the plainest and surest way of practising and improving physick, and in the following year The state of physick, ancient and modern, briefly considered: with a plan for the improvement of it. In these, Clifton advocated that physicians should base their ideas about the effectiveness of their remedies on a statistical analysis of their effects on their patients, rather than on theory. Death in Jamaica Clifton also held the appointment of physician to Frederick, Prince of Wales, which he resigned, and abruptly quitted London for Jamaica in 1734. Writing to Sir Hans Sloane from Kingston in that island on 3 June 1736, he says : \\"My misfortunes came so fast upon me, and my brother's provocations were so frequently repeated, that I was hurried in a manner to death about 'em\\". He died a few weeks afterwards, leaving no issue by his wife, Sarah Banckes, daughter of a merchant in Leadenhall Street. In the letters of administration P.C.C. granted on 6 Nov. 1736 to his widow, Clifton is described as \\"late of the parish of St. George, Hanover Square, Middlesex, but at Kingston in Jamaica, deceased\\". His widow survived until 1747, and was buried in the parish church of St. Andrew Undershaft. At the time of his death Clifton was engaged in drawing up an account of the diseases of Jamaica, but left it unfinished. He also published Hippocrates upon Air, Water, and Situation ... To this is added Thucydides' Account of the Plague of Athens. Translated and ... illustrated with notes (London 1734).

Background and composition \\"Here I Stand\\" was written by Usher, Polow da Don, Adam Blackstone and Gerrell Gaddis, as well as Dre & Vidal, who also produced the track. The song was recorded by Vincent Dilorenzo, with assistance from Geoff Rice, at Sony Music Studios, New York City and Zac Recording, Atlanta. Dilorenzo also mixed the record, with assistance from Matt DeSando, at Studio 609, Philadelphia. According to Josh Eells of Blender, \\"Here I Stand\\" was written for Tameka Foster, whom Usher married in August 2007. Composed before their engagement, \\"Here I Stand\\" was played at Usher and Foster's wedding, on Foster's request. The tune is an assurance of sexual fidelity and commitment. In an interview with MTV News, Usher stated, \\"If you listen to the words [of 'Here I Stand'], it is very heartfelt, simplistic, yet very soulful. ... It's a man's words to his woman: a vow to say that you are the one, and I'll be there for you.\\" A slow jam soul ballad, \\"Here I Stand\\" has been compared to the work of Stevie Wonder by critics.

Life John Clifton was born in London in 1781. His father had expected him to become a merchant, but Clifton's early talent for music was so clear that he was put under the care of a relation, the singer Richard Bellamy, with whom he studied music for five years. He then became the pupil of Charles Wesley, and eventually decided to follow music as a profession, giving up an appointment in the Stationery Office, which he held for about two years. Clifton's first professional engagement was at Bath, where he conducted the Harmonic Society. In 1802 he went to Dublin, and in 1815 produced a musical piece called Edwin there, which is said to have been successful. He also gained some credit by organising (together with Sir John Andrew Stevenson) a concert on a very large scale in aid of the sufferers from the Irish famine. About 1816 he invented an instrument for helping singing by sight. He called it the \\"Eidomusicon,\\" though it does not seem to have been patented. About the same time he finished a work on the theory of harmony. He came to London in 1818 to try to publish his invention, but was unsuccessful. Clifton next adopted the Logierian system of musical instruction and for some years was a well-known teacher in London. He married the proprietress of a ladies' school at Hammersmith, where the last years of his life were spent. About 1838 he became possessed with the idea that he was enormously wealthy, and the mania grew to such an extent that he needed to be put under restraint. He died at Teresa House, Hammersmith, on 18 November 1841. His compositions chiefly consisted of songs and glees.

Launched in 2011 to replace the decade-old USA-161 satellite, it is the fifteenth KH-11 optical imaging satellite to reach orbit. Project history and cost After the Boeing-led Future Imagery Architecture program failed in 2005, NRO ordered two more KH-11s, including USA-224. Critics worried that each of these \\"exquisite-class\\" satellites would cost more than the latest (CVN-77), which had a projected procurement cost of as of May 2005 (equivalent to approximately $B in ). USA-224 ‚Äì the first of these two ‚Äì was completed by Lockheed under the initial budget estimate, and two years ahead of schedule. USA-224 was launched atop a Delta IV Heavy rocket from Vandenberg AFB Space Launch Complex 6 in California. The launch was conducted by United Launch Alliance, and was the first flight of a Delta IV Heavy from Vandenberg. Liftoff occurred on 20 January 2011 at 21:10:30 UTC. Upon reaching orbit, the satellite received the International Designator 2011-002A. The satellite began operating 33 days after its predecessor, USA-161, stopped doing its primary mission. This coverage gap was much smaller than originally feared, thanks to USA-224's earlier-than-planned launch and operational changes to extend the lifetime of USA-161. As the fifteenth KH-11 satellite to be launched, USA-224 is a member of one of the later block configurations occasionally identified as being a separate system. Details of its mission and orbit are classified, but amateur observers have tracked it in low Earth orbit. Shortly after launch it was in an orbit with a perigee of , an apogee of and 97.9 degrees of inclination, typical for an operational KH-11 satellite. By April it was at 97.93 degrees. Imaging of Nahid-1/Safir launch preparation accident President Trump which is believed to have been taken by USA-224alt=left On 30 August 2019, President Donald Trump tweeted a classified picture from an intelligence briefing showing the aftermath of an accident that apparently occurred during launch preparations of a Safir rocket at the Imam Khomeini Spaceport a day earlier. According to analysts, the photo is likely to have been taken by USA-224. The opinion is based on a close agreement between the estimated time when the photo was taken (based on the orientation of shadows cast by structures in the photo), and the location of the satellite at that same time, as estimated with tracking data maintained by the amateur satellite watching community. The photograph stands out for its high-resolution (estimated by analysts to be 10 cm or less per pixel), sharpness and lack of atmospheric distortion. Before this tweet, the only KH-11 imagery available was leaked in 1984, and the only declassified imagery available in public domain was released in 2011 taken by KH-9.

He was also a political radical, associated with leading supporters of the French Revolution, a farmer, and a Fellow of the Royal Society. Life Cline was born in London, and was educated at Merchant Taylors' School. At the age of seventeen he was apprenticed to Thomas Smith, one of the surgeons to St. Thomas's Hospital, and before the end of his apprenticeship he frequently lectured for Joseph Else, then lecturer on anatomy. On 2 June 1774 Cline obtained his diploma from Surgeons' Hall. In the same year he attended a course of John Hunter's lectures, and was much influenced by it. When Else died in 1781, Cline bought his preparations from his executors, and was appointed to lecture on anatomy. Three years later, on the death of his old master Smith, Cline succeeded him in the surgeoncy of St. Thomas's. After a residence of some years in St. Mary Axe, he moved in 1796 to Lincoln's Inn Fields, where he remained for the rest of his life. In 1796 Cline was elected a member of the court of assistants of the Surgeons' Company; but his election having taken place at a meeting when neither of the two governors was present (one having just died), was found to have voided the act of incorporation. After failure of a bill to legalise the surgeons' proceedings, in 1800 they were incorporated by charter as the Royal College of Surgeons, the old municipal privileges being given up. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1806. In 1808 Cline bought some land at Bound's Green in Middlesex, and visited it regularly, becoming greatly interested in agriculture, and losing much time and money in its pursuit, according to Astley Cooper, his pupil. When he was sixty years old his practice brought him about ¬£10,000 per annum; but it was Cooper's opinion that, it would have been much more had he not been so fond of politics and farming. In 1810 Cline became an examiner at the College of Surgeons, and in the following year resigned his appointments at St. Thomas's. His pupils subscribed for a bust by Francis Leggatt Chantrey, which was placed in St. Thomas's Museum. In 1815 he became master of the College of Surgeons, and in 1816 and 1824 delivered the Hunterian oration. In 1823 Cline was president of the college, the title having been changed from that of master in 1821. He died on 2 January 1827. Views and associations Cline was an adherent of John Horne Tooke, attending him professionally when in the Tower of London, and afterwards in his last illness. For many years he gave an anniversary dinner to Tooke's friends and supporters at his own house, in commemoration of Tooke's acquittal. He was also a friend of John Thelwall. He was in favour of the French revolution, and by his influence with leading men in Paris secured Astley Cooper's safety during a three months' residence there in 1792. Cline thought there was a cause superior to man, but believed that nothing was known of the future. Works His only publication was a small brochure on the Form of Animals, 1805; twice reprinted, 1808 and 1829. Family In 1775 Cline took a house in Devonshire Street, and married Miss Webb, lecturing on the day of his marriage. Cline was succeeded in the surgeoncy to St. Thomas's and in the lectures on anatomy and surgery by his son Henry Cline, who died on 27 May 1820 of phthisis.

He then worked on oculomotor physiology in cats at UCLA and on the primary visual cortex of macaques at New York University. An interest in comparative behavioral biology led him to study song development and mirror self-recognition in gibbons, and eventually to research on the biological roots and evolutionary background of human music and language. With Nils Wallin and Steven Brown he edited the interdisciplinary volume The Origins of Music. In retirement, he continues active work on theoretical topics that include the analysis of brain macrosystems and their interaction, countercurrent modelling of cortical memory, the subcortical foundations of brain mechanisms of attention and consciousness, and the biological background to human music and language.Libris, the Royal Library of Sweden search engine, is listing 21 titles as of Jan 21, 2011.Cecilia Christner Riad Ensam om att g√• i takt, in: Forskning och Framtid, No. 8 (2003) - interview with Bj√∂rn MerkerCurriculum Vitae by Bj√∂rn Merker, 5 pages, June 2010 - read Jan 21, 2011 Merker's theory is featured at online websites, such as by McGill University.

The ultimate goal of MCC is to enable execution of rich mobile applications on a plethora of mobile devices, with a rich user experience. MCC provides business opportunities for mobile network operators as well as cloud providers. More comprehensively, MCC can be defined as \\"a rich mobile computing technology that leverages unified elastic resources of varied clouds and network technologies toward unrestricted functionality, storage, and mobility to serve a multitude of mobile devices anywhere, anytime through the channel of Ethernet or Internet regardless of heterogeneous environments and platforms based on the pay-as-you-use principle.\\" Architecture Mobile cloud architecture MCC uses computational augmentation approaches (computations are executed remotely instead of on the device) by which resource-constraint mobile devices can utilize computational resources of varied cloud-based resources. In MCC, there are four types of cloud-based resources, namely distant immobile clouds, proximate immobile computing entities, proximate mobile computing entities, and hybrid (combination of the other three model). Giant clouds such as Amazon EC2 are in the distant immobile groups whereas cloudlet or surrogates are member of proximate immobile computing entities. Smartphones, tablets, handheld devices, and wearable computing devices are part of the third group of cloud-based resources which is proximate mobile computing entities. Vodafone, Orange and Verizon have started to offer cloud computing services for companies.  Challenges  In the MCC landscape, an amalgam of mobile computing, cloud computing, and communication networks (to augment smartphones) creates several complex challenges such as Mobile Computation Offloading, Seamless Connectivity, Long WAN Latency, Mobility Management, Context-Processing, Energy Constraint, Vendor/data Lock-in, Security and Privacy, Elasticity that hinder MCC success and adoption. =Open research issues= Although significant research and development in MCC is available in the literature, efforts in the following domains is still lacking: * Architectural issues: A reference architecture for heterogeneous MCC environment is a crucial requirement for unleashing the power of mobile computing towards unrestricted ubiquitous computing. * Energy-efficient transmission: MCC requires frequent transmissions between cloud platform and mobile devices, due to the stochastic nature of wireless networks, the transmission protocol should be carefully designed.Peng Shu, Fangming Liu, Hai Jin, Min Chen, Feng Wen, Yupeng Qu, Bo Li, \\"eTime: Energy-Efficient Transmission between Cloud and Mobile Devices\\", in Proc. of IEEE INFOCOM (Mini-conference), Italy, April, 2013.Fangming Liu, Peng Shu, \\"eTime: Energy-Efficient Mobile Cloud Computing for Rich-Media Applications\\", IEEE COMSOC MMTC E-Letter (IEEE Communications Society, Multimedia Communications Technical Committee), vol. 8, no. 1, January 2013. * Context-awareness issues: Context-aware and socially-aware computing are inseparable traits of contemporary handheld computers. To achieve the vision of mobile computing among heterogeneous converged networks and computing devices, designing resource-efficient environment-aware applications is an essential need. * Live VM migration issues: Executing resource-intensive mobile application via Virtual Machine (VM) migration-based application offloading involves encapsulation of application in VM instance and migrating it to the cloud, which is a challenging task due to additional overhead of deploying and managing VM on mobile devices. * Mobile communication congestion issues: Mobile data traffic is tremendously hiking by ever increasing mobile user demands for exploiting cloud resources which impact on mobile network operators and demand future efforts to enable smooth communication between mobile and cloud endpoints. * Trust, security, and privacy issues: Trust is an essential factor for the success of the burgeoning MCC paradigm. It is because the data along with code/component/application/complete VM is offloaded to the cloud for execution. Moreover, just like software and mobile application piracy, the MCC application development models are also affected by the piracy issue. Pirax is known to be the first specialized framework for controlling application piracy in MCC requirements MCC research groups and activities Several academic and industrial research groups in MCC have been emerging since last few years. Some of the MCC research groups in academia with large number of researchers and publications include: * MDC, Mobile and Distributed Computing research group is at Faculty of Computer and Information Science, King Saud University. MDC research group focuses on architectures, platforms, and protocols for mobile and distributed computing. The group has developed algorithms, tools, and technologies which offer energy efficient, fault tolerant, scalable, secure, and high performance computing on mobile devices. * MobCC lab, Faculty of Computer Science and Information Technology, University Malaya. The lab was established in 2010 under the High Impact Research Grant, Ministry of Higher Education, Malaysia. It has 17 researchers and has track of 22 published articles in international conference and peer reviewed CS journals. * ICCLAB, Z√ºrich University of Applied Sciences has a segment working on MCC. The InIT Cloud Computing Lab is a research lab within the Institute of Applied Information Technology (InIT) of Z√ºrich University of Applied Sciences (ZHAW). It covers topic areas across the entire cloud computing technology stack. * Mobile & Cloud Lab, Institute of Computer Science, University of Tartu. Mobile & Cloud Lab conducts research and teaching in the mobile computing and cloud computing domains. The research topics of the group include cloud computing, mobile application development, mobile cloud, mobile web services and migrating scientific computing and enterprise applications to the cloud. * SmartLab, Data Management Systems Laboratory, Department of Computer Science, University of Cyprus. SmartLab is a first-of-a-kind open cloud of smartphones that enables a new line of systems-oriented mobile computing research. * Mobile Cloud Networking: Mobile Cloud Networking (MCN) was an EU FP7 Large-scale Integrating Project (IP, 15m Euro) funded by the European Commission. The MCN project was launched in November 2012 for the period of 36 month. The project was coordinated by SAP Research and the ICCLab at the Zurich University of Applied Science. In total 19 top-tier partners from industry and academia established the very first vision of Mobile Cloud Computing. The project was primarily motivated by an ongoing transformation that drives the convergence between the Mobile Communications and Cloud Computing industry enabled by the Internet and is considered the very first pioneer in the area of Network Function Virtualization.

It is based on Pearson's chi-squared statistic and was published by Harald Cram√©r in 1946.Cram√©r, Harald. 1946. Mathematical Methods of Statistics. Princeton: Princeton University Press, page 282 (Chapter 21. The two-dimensional case). (table of content ) Usage and interpretation œÜc is the intercorrelation of two discrete variablesSheskin, David J. (1997). Handbook of Parametric and Nonparametric Statistical Procedures. Boca Raton, Fl: CRC Press. and may be used with variables having two or more levels. œÜc is a symmetrical measure, it does not matter which variable we place in the columns and which in the rows. Also, the order of rows/columns doesn't matter, so œÜc may be used with nominal data types or higher (notably ordered or numerical). Cram√©r's V may also be applied to goodness of fit chi-squared models when there is a 1 √ó k table (in this case r = 1). In this case k is taken as the number of optional outcomes and it functions as a measure of tendency towards a single outcome. Cram√©r's V varies from 0 (corresponding to no association between the variables) to 1 (complete association) and can reach 1 only when each variable is completely determined by the other. œÜc2 is the mean square canonical correlation between the variables. In the case of a 2 √ó 2 contingency table Cram√©r's V is equal to the Phi coefficient. Note that as chi-squared values tend to increase with the number of cells, the greater the difference between r (rows) and c (columns), the more likely œÜc will tend to 1 without strong evidence of a meaningful correlation. V may be viewed as the association between two variables as a percentage of their maximum possible variation. V2 is the mean square canonical correlation between the variables. Calculation Let a sample of size n of the simultaneously distributed variables A and B for i=1,\\\\ldots,r; j=1,\\\\ldots,k be given by the frequencies :n_{ij}= number of times the values (A_i,B_j) were observed. The chi-squared statistic then is: :\\\\chi^2=\\\\sum_{i,j}\\\\frac{(n_{ij}-\\\\frac{n_{i.}n_{.j}}{n})^2}{\\\\frac{n_{i.}n_{.j}}{n}} Cram√©r's V is computed by taking the square root of the chi-squared statistic divided by the sample size and the minimum dimension minus 1: :V = \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{\\\\varphi^2}{\\\\min(k - 1,r-1)}} = \\\\sqrt{ \\\\frac{\\\\chi^2/n}{\\\\min(k - 1,r-1)}} where: * \\\\varphi is the phi coefficient. * \\\\chi^2 is derived from Pearson's chi-squared test * n is the grand total of observations and * k being the number of columns. * r being the number of rows. The p-value for the significance of V is the same one that is calculated using the Pearson's chi- squared test. The formula for the variance of V=œÜc is known.Liebetrau, Albert M. (1983). Measures of association. Newbury Park, CA: Sage Publications. Quantitative Applications in the Social Sciences Series No. 32. (pages 15‚Äì16) In R, the function \`cramerV()\` from the package \`rcompanion\` calculates V using the chisq.test function from the stats package. In contrast to the function \`cramersV()\` from the \`lsr\` package, \`cramerV()\` also offers an option to correct for bias. It applies the correction described in the following section. Bias correction Cram√©r's V can be a heavily biased estimator of its population counterpart and will tend to overestimate the strength of association. A bias correction, using the above notation, is given by :\\\\tilde V = \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{\\\\tilde\\\\varphi^2}{\\\\min(\\\\tilde k - 1,\\\\tilde r - 1)}} where : \\\\tilde\\\\varphi^2 = \\\\max\\\\left(0,\\\\varphi^2 - \\\\frac{(k-1)(r-1)}{n-1}\\\\right) and : \\\\tilde k = k - \\\\frac{(k-1)^2}{n-1} : \\\\tilde r = r - \\\\frac{(r-1)^2}{n-1} Then \\\\tilde V estimates the same population quantity as Cram√©r's V but with typically much smaller mean squared error. The rationale for the correction is that under independence, E[\\\\varphi^2]=\\\\frac{(k-1)(r-1)}{n-1}.

Located in what is now called eastern Turkey and northwestern Iran, the region is considered to be the cradle of Armenian civilization. History During most of its history it was ruled by the Artsruni dynasty, which first managed to create a principality in the area. At its greatest extent Vaspurakan comprised the lands between Lake Van and Lake Urmia (also known as Kaputan) in 908. During this time they were under the sovereignty of the Bagratuni Kingdom of Ani. Vaspurakan was elevated to the status of a kingdom in 908, when Gagik I of Vaspurakan was recognized King of Armenia by the Abbasids and at first was on their side, but soon he regretted and together with Ashot II defeated the Arabs. Soon he was recognized as the King of Vaspurakan by the Bagratuni Ashot II. In 1021 Seneqerim Artsruni gave Vaspurakan to the Byzantine Empire, receiving Sebasteia and its surroundings. Vaspurakan became the Byzantine province (thema) of Vasprakania or Media. In about 1050 Vasprakania was merged with that of Taron, but was conquered by the Saljuq Turks between 1054-1056. In the 13th century part of Vaspurakan was liberated by Zakarids. But soon was conquered by Mongols, then by Ottoman Turks. Turks several times tried to kill Armenians in Vaspurakan, especially in Van. But Van's Armenian population always resisted, especially is notable Siege of Van of 1915, when the Ottoman forces attacked Van during 1915's Armenian Genocide. After the Byzantine annexation the dynasty continued with Derenik, son of Gurgen Khatchik, who became lord of Antzivaziq by 1004 and had two brothers: Gugik and Ashot. King Hovhannes-Seneqerim also had several children among them David, Atom, Abushal and Constantine. There is a legend that one of Seneqerim's daughter is thought to have married Mendo Alao, an Alan who lived in Lusitania. David had a daughter that married King Gagik II of Ani. Another branch of the family appeared on the person of Khatchik the Great in 1040, who had three children: Hasan, Djendjluk and Ishkhanik. Hasan had a son called Abelgharib who had a daughter that married King David of Ani.http://medbib.com/Vaspurakan The kingdom of Vaspurakan had no specific capital, the court moving as the king transferred his residence from place to place ‚Äì Van, Ostan/Vostan (modern Geva≈ü), and so on.

During the Yuan rule of Tibet, the region was structurally, militarily and administratively controlled by the Mongol-led Yuan dynasty of China, a division of the Mongol Empire. In the history of Tibet, Mongol rule was established after Sakya Pandita got power in Tibet from the Mongols in 1244, following the 1240 Mongol conquest of Tibet led by the Mongol general with the title doord darkhan.Wylie. p.110. It is also called the Sakya dynasty after the favored Sakya school of Tibetan Buddhism. The region retained a degree of political autonomy under the Sakya lama, who was the de jure head of Tibet and a spiritual leader of the Mongol Empire. However, administrative and military rule of Tibet remained under the auspices of the Yuan government agency known as the Bureau of Buddhist and Tibetan Affairs or Xuanzheng Yuan, a top-level administrative department separate from other Yuan provinces, but still under the administration of the Yuan dynasty. Tibet retained nominal power over religious and political affairs, while the Mongols managed a structural and administrativeWylie. p.104: 'To counterbalance the political power of the lama, Khubilai appointed civil administrators at the Sa-skya to supervise the Mongol regency.' rule over the region, reinforced by the rare military intervention. This existed as a \\"diarchic structure\\" under the Yuan emperor, with power primarily in favor of the Mongols. One of the department's purposes was to select a dpon-chen, usually appointed by the lama and confirmed by the Mongol emperor in Beijing.Dawa Norbu. China's Tibet Policy, pp. 139. Psychology Press.  History  Yuan dynasty, circa 1294. = Conquest of Tibet = Prior to the Yuan dynasty, Tibet had previously been invaded by the Mongol Empire. The first invasion was by Prince K√∂den or Godan, grandson of Genghis Khan and son of √ñgedei Khan. The second invasion by M√∂ngke Khan resulted in the entire region falling under Mongol rule. Kublai Khan incorporated the region into his later Yuan dynasty, but left the legal system intact.Schirokauer, Conrad. A Brief History of Chinese Civilization. Thomson Wadsworth, (c)2006, p 174 Drog√∂n Ch√∂gyal Phagpa, the Sakya lama, became a religious teacher to Kublai, who made him the nominal head of the region. = Yuan rule = Although the Yuan maintained administrative rule of Tibet, scholarly opinion on the exact nature of this rule is disputed: according to different sources, it is considered a direct subject, an indirect part of the Yuan dynasty or an \\"autonomous\\" region outside direct Yuan rule, but subject to the greater Mongol Empire.Kychanov, E.I. and Melnichenko, B.N. 2005.

While no modern equivalents remain, the relationship is analogous to that of the British Empire and the British Raj in India. The rule was described in the Mongolian chronicle \\"Ten Laudable Laws\\", which describes \\"two orders\\", one order based on the religious and one order based on the secular. Religious is based on the Sutras and Dharani, secular on peace and tranquillity. The Sakya Lama is responsible for the religious order, the Yuan Emperor for the secular. The religion and the state became dependent on each other, each with its own functions,Franke, H. 1981. Tibetans in Yuan China. - In: China Under Mongol Rule. Princeton. but the will of the Emperor, through the d-pon chen, held the de facto upper hand. Through their influence with the Mongol rulers, Tibetan lamas gained considerable influence in various Mongol clans. Besides Kublai, there were, for example, clear lines of influence between scattered areas of Tibet and the Mongol Ilkhanate based in Persia.Authenticating Tibet: Answers to China's 100 Questions, by Anne-Marie Blondeau, Katia Buffetrille, p13 Kublai's success in succeeding M√∂ngke as Great Khan meant that after 1260, Phagpa and the House of Sakya would only wield greater influence. Phagpa became head of all Buddhist monks in the Yuan empire. Tibet would also enjoy a rather high degree of autonomy compared to other parts of the Yuan empire, though further expeditions took place in 1267, 1277, 1281 and 1290/91.Dieter Schuh, Tibet unter der Mongolenherrschaft, in: Michael Weiers (editor), Die Mongolen. Beitr√§ge zu ihrer Geschichte und Kultur, Darmstadt 1986, pp. 283-289.  Kublai Khan  Drog√∂n Ch√∂gyal Phagpa, the first Imperial Preceptor of the Yuan dynasty. Drog√∂n Ch√∂gyal Phagpa was the spiritual advisor and guru to Kublai Khan. In 1260, Kublai appointed Ch√∂gyal Phagpa as \\"Guoshi\\", or State Preceptor, in 1260, the year when he became Khagan. Phagpa was the first \\"to initiate the political theology of the relationship between state and religion in the Tibeto- Mongolian Buddhist world\\".Laird 2006, pg. 115.F. W. Mote. Imperial China 900-1800. Harvard University Press, 1999. p.501. With the support of Kublai Khan, Ch√∂gyal Phagpa established himself and his sect as the preeminent spiritual leader in Tibet, and in the wider Mongol Empire. In 1265 Drog√∂n Ch√∂gyal Phagpa returned to Tibet and for the first time made an attempt to impose Sakya hegemony with the appointment of Shakya Bzang-po, a long time servant and ally of the Sakyas, as the Mongol approved dpon-chen, or great administrator, over Tibet in 1267. A census was conducted in 1268 and Tibet was divided into thirteen myriarchies. While maintaining administrative control through the dpon-chen, Kublai's relationship with the Sakya Lama became known in the Tibetan tradition as the patron and priest relationship. Subsequently, each Yuan emperor had a Lama as a spiritual guide.Uspensky, V.L. 1996. Lamaist Beijing: from Shun-Chi to the Tao-Kuang. ‚ÄìOriens (Moscow), no. 4 According to Rossabi, Khublai established a system in which a Sakya lama would be \\"Imperial Preceptor\\" or Dishi (originally \\"State Preceptor\\" or Guoshi), who would reside in China and supervise all the Buddhists of the empire, and a Tibetan called dpon-chen (Ponchen) or \\"Civil Administrator\\" would live in Tibet to administer it.Rossabi 1989, p. 144 Nevertheless, this system also led to conflicts between the Sakya leaders and the dpon-chens.Rossabi 1989, pg. 221 Kublai Khan commissioned Ch√∂gyal Phagpa to design a new writing system to unify the writing of the multilingual Mongol Empire. Ch√∂gyal Phagpa in turn modified the traditional Tibetan script and gave birth to a new set of characters called Phagspa script which was completed in 1268. Kublai Khan decided to use the Phagspa script as the official writing system of the empire, including when he became Emperor of China in 1271, instead of the Chinese ideogrammes and the Uyghur script. However, he encountered major resistances and difficulties when trying to promote this script and never achieved his original goal. As a result, only a small amount of texts were written in this script, and the majority were still written in Chinese ideogrammes or the Uyghur alphabet.Rossabi 1989, p158 The script fell into disuse after the collapse of the Yuan dynasty in 1368.Laird 2006, pp. 114-117 The script was, though never widely, used for about a century and is thought to have influenced the development of modern Korean script.Laird 2006, pp. 115-116.  Revolt  The Sakya hegemony over Tibet continued into the middle of the fourteenth century, although it was challenged by a revolt of the Drikung Kagyu sect with the assistance of DuwaM.Kutlukov, Mongol rule in Eastern Turkestan. Article in collection Tataro-Mongols in Asia and Europe. Moscow, 1970 of the Chagatai Khanate in 1285. The revolt was suppressed in 1290 when the Sakyas and the Yuan Mongol army under Temur-Buqa, Kublai's grandson, burned Drigung Monastery and killed 10,000 people.Wylie, Turnell V. (1977) \\"The First Mongol Conquest of Tibet Reinterpreted,\\" Harvard Journal of Asiatic Studies 37.1: 103-133.  Decline of the Yuan  Between 1346 and 1354, the Yuan dynasty was weakening from uprisings in the main Chinese provinces. As Yuan declined, in Tibet, Tai Situ Changchub Gyaltsen toppled the Sakya and founded the Phagmodrupa Dynasty, the rulers of which belonged to the Kagyu sect. The succession of Sakya lamas in Tibet came to an end in 1358, when central Tibet in its entirety came under control of the Kagyu sect, and Tibet's independence was restored, to last nearly 400 years.Rossabi 1983, p. 194 \\"By the 1370s the lines between the schools of Buddhism were clear.\\"Laird 2006, p. 124 Nevertheless, the Phagmodrupa founder avoided directly resisting the Yuan court until its fall in 1368, when his successor Jamyang Shakya Gyaltsen decided to open relations with the Ming dynasty, founded by a native Han Chinese.

Passing to the London and North Eastern Railway in the 1923 grouping, the line continued to suffer from light traffic apart from a period during the Second World War when the local area was used for munition storage in the area around Tanfield station. In the run-up to D-Day, trainloads of 50 wagons were leaving the site to supply the operation with munitions. Both Tanfield and Masham stations had been provided with goods facilities in the station area. Tanfield had a passing loop in the station, but was only constructed with one platform. Masham had a goods yard directly next to the station platforms, but was also provided with a transhipment goods yard north of the station and across the Masham to Melmerby road (now the A6108 road) for the narrow gauge railway supplying the reservoir building further west. A passenger train derailed between Tanfield and Masham on the 5 April 1926. 30 people were aboard the train and despite the train leaving the rails, there were no injuries. The cause was later attributed to newly laid rail on a bed of ash (instead of being properly ballasted) that had buckled in unseasonably hot weather. =Leighton and Roundhill Reservoir railway= A railway was built between Masham and the Leighton Wood area (just north of Masham Moor). This line was used to transport equipment and materials to the building of a reservoir at Roundhill for the Harrogate Corporation and the line was also used by the Leeds Corporation to build their reservoir at Leighton immediately downstream. The line opened in 1905 and was closed in 1930, some time after completion of both reservoirs. =Closure= By the time of the lines closure to passengers on 1 January 1931, it had four passenger services a day. The line closed completely on 11 November 1963.

Biography Duncan was the eldest child and only son of Leland Crosthwait Duncan and Caroline Ellen Lewis. His father, a grandson of Leland Crosthwait, Governor General of the Bank of Ireland, had left Ireland for London in 1851 and after his marriage settled in Lewisham. The family lived at 1 Vicarage Terrace, High Road, Lewisham, where Leland Lewis Duncan was born. The family moved twice before they went to live at \\"Rosslair\\", 8 Lingards Road, Lewisham, England, in 1872. He can trace his roots to Strathblane, Stirlingshire, Scotland. Duncan was born in Lewisham, where he lived throughout his life, was educated at Colfe's Grammar School, and began a career as a public servant. His 40-year service with the War Office, beginning in 1882, was recognised with an O.B.E. as he rose in position. For his service in connection with the Coronation of King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra, he was invested as a Member (fourth class) of the Royal Victorian Order (MVO) two days after the ceremony, on 11 August 1902. He became interested in archaeology early in his life, and began disposing of his spare time by copying wills at Somerset House. This collection of documents was largely ill-ordered and an untapped source of historical evidence. His work in this field led to his appointment as general editor on Challenor Smith's 1893 Index of Wills, published by the British Record Society. Duncan's transcription and editing of this material, which he carefully produced throughout his life, became an important resource to his contemporaries and later researchers. He made many field trips to note the deteriorating engravings amongst the memorials of churchyards, carefully recorded in an extensive set of notebooks. He was made a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London in 1890, contributed to the works of the St Paul's Ecclesiological Society and Lewisham Antiquarian Society, and was a life member of the Kent Archaeological Society (KAS). He also assisted in the compilation or editing of several works, and the results of his research and fieldwork were published in the journals and transactions of several societies. His contributions to Archaeologia Cantiana began with a list of historical administrations of the Kent region. The society later published a special volume for his extracts from wills, Testamenta Cantiana, in 1906. His few printed works include The Parish Church of St. Mary, Lewisham, and an account of its Vicars and Curates (1902); The History of the borough of Lewisham (1908); and The History of Colfe's Grammar School and a life of its founder (1910). The journal Archaeologia Cantiana printed his papers 'The Renunciation of Papal Authority in West Kent, 1534', 'The Rectory of Cowden with a list of Rectors', 'The Will of Abp. Courtenay', 'Ecclesiological Notes on Shoreham', 'The Will of Cardinal Bourgehier', and 'Extracts from some lost Parish Registers'. A major work was interrupted by his death, Kent Records ‚Äì Index of Wills was completed and issued by the KAS in 1924 with a memoir of the author by F. W. Cock. Duncan died on 26 December 1923, the year following his retirement.

They play in the Northern League. History The club was founded by coal miners in Ryhope in 1892. It was not until 1927‚Äì28 that it won its first league title. However the club enjoyed most of its success in the 1960s, winning the Wearside Football League on four occasions, the Monkwearmouth Charity Cup twice as well as the Sunderland Shipowners Cup and League Challenge Cup during the decade. In the 1967‚Äì68 season, the team reached the First Round Proper of the FA Cup for the only time in its history, losing 1‚Äì0 at home to then Football League Division 4 side Workington. The club's next successful season was 1977‚Äì78, finishing 3rd in the league, winning the League Cup with the season culminating in winning the Durham Challenge Cup for the only time in the club's history. Between the 1988‚Äì89 and 1991‚Äì92 seasons, the club was known as Vaux Ryhope after a merger with Sporting Club Vaux (previously South Hetton FC)FCHD.info ‚Äì Sporting Club Vaux In season 2009‚Äì10 under the guidance of newly appointed manager Martin Swales Ryhope won the Monkwearmouth Charity Cup for the first time in 44 years as well as being runners up in the league their highest position also for 44 years. Season 2010‚Äì11 however was the most successful in the club's history, winning all four competitions the Wearside League Title, Sunderland Shipowners Cup, Monkwearmouth Charity Cup and League Cup. This was only the third time in the history of the League that this has been achieved by a club. However, in season 2011‚Äì12 Ryhope repeated the feat of the previous season winning all four competitions and gained promotion to the Northern League for the first time in its history. It ended the season having only been defeated once in its last 70 Wearside League and Cup games. The team continued its success in season 2012‚Äì13 finishing runners up to Crook Town and gaining promotion to the Northern League 1st Division at its first attempt, losing only three games and scoring 147 league goals. However, due to off the field ground grading issues, rather than making the step up the club was relegated back to the Wearside League. It was a decision taken by the Northern League Management Committee and endorsed by the FA. Season 2013‚Äì14 saw the team back in the Wearside League and finish runners up to Stockton Town and with the ground issues solved the team again was promoted to the Northern League 2nd division for the season 2014‚Äì15. After finishing 6th in season 2014‚Äì15 the club finished runners up to South Shields in season 2015‚Äì16 thus gaining promotion to the Northern League Division 1 under the guidance of managerial duo Gary Pearson and Stuart Gooden (who is now in jail).

It is located in Coconino County, Arizona, west-northwest of Winslow, Arizona. It was closed in 1963. History Winslow Air Force Station was established in 1954 by Air Defense Command as one of a planned deployment of forty-four Mobile radar stations to support the permanent ADC Radar network in the United States sited around the perimeter of the country. This deployment was projected to be operational by mid-1952. Funding, constant site changes, construction, and equipment delivery delayed deployment. This site became operational in April 1955 when the 904th Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron was assigned to the station. Winslow became operational in 1956 with the squadron using an AN/FPS-8 search radar, and initially the station functioned as a Ground-Control Intercept (GCI) and warning station. As a GCI station, the squadron's role was to guide interceptor aircraft toward unidentified intruders picked up on the unit's radar scopes. In 1958 an AN/FPS-6A height- finder radar was added. During 1961 Winslow AFS joined the Semi Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE) system, feeding data to DC-21 at Luke AFB, Arizona. After joining, the squadron was redesignated as the 904th Radar Squadron (SAGE) on 15 October 1961. The radar squadron provided information 24/7 the SAGE Direction Center where it was analyzed to determine range, direction altitude speed and whether or not aircraft were friendly or hostile. Also in 1961, an AN/FPS-6B was added. An AN/FPS-64 was installed reportedly in 1963, but never became operational. During the AN/FPS-64 installation in a new tower, the AN/FPS-8 was replaced by an AN/MPS-11 on a temperate tower. In addition to the main facility, Winslow operated several AN/FPS-14 Gap Filler sites: * Mingus Mountain, AZ (M-93A): * Hillside, AZ (M-93B): In March 1963 the Air Force ordered Winslow closed; operations ceased 31 May 1963, the station being closed on 1 August. The Air Force transferred the property to the Department of the Interior, Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), by Letter of Transfer dated 9 December 1964, effective 11 December 1964. Beginning in 1966, the former Winslow Air Force Station was home to a training center for the US Job Corps under the control of the Navajo Nation, and housed several hundred teachers, support personnel, and family members, and approximately one hundred inner-city at risk youth. Under the program, inner-city youth were brought to this remote site and trained in heavy-equipment job skills and also earned their GED high school equivalency degrees. The site was closed in 1969 under orders from then-President Nixon. The Navajo Tribe then used the station as a work center for the maintenance of schools within commuting distance until about 1978. Site history for Windslow AFS Site history for Windslow AFS After the site's closure in 1978, the site was thoroughly vandalized. Between 1990 and 1992 all structures associated with the former Winslow Air Force Station Site were removed by the BIA. Approximately 1.2 million dollars were spent on building demolition and removal, and cleanup of environmental hazards. Asbestos containing building materials were removed and disposed of prior to building demolition. In addition, two 15,000 gallon underground storage tanks were removed for disposal, two transformers were disposed of as PCB- contaminated, and sulfuric acid which was stored on the site was removed for disposal, and the site was restored it to its natural state. Except for some roads, the entire site has been obliterated; today no remains of the station or radars are left.

Context in general culture The phrase it's like Piccadilly Circus is commonly used in the UK to refer to a place or situation which is extremely busy with people. It has been said that a person who stays long enough at Piccadilly Circus will eventually bump into everyone they know. Probably because of this connection, during World War II, \\"Piccadilly Circus\\" was the code name given to the Allies' D-Day invasion fleet's assembly location in the English Channel. Piccadilly Circus has inspired artists and musicians. Piccadilly Circus (1912) is the name and subject of a painting by British artist Charles Ginner, part of the Tate Britain collection. Sculptor Paul McCarthy also has a 320-page two-volume edition of video stills by the name of Piccadilly Circus.

Its starting point was Roth's encounter with the collection of postcards of Piccadilly Circus owned by Richard Hamilton and his wife Rita Donagh. Initially, six of these cards were printed as a large scale portfolio in 1970; eventually, in 1977, 96 of these altered Picadillies were collected in a book, including the unaltered backs, with cut marks to allow the buyer to re-use them as postcards. *\\"Lipsticks in Piccadilly Circus, London\\" 1966 is a work by Claes Oldenburg. In this postcard collage Oldenburg raised an everyday cosmetic item to a monumental scale. Made during his stay in London at the height of the ‚Äòswinging sixties‚Äô, it embodies the popular, expendable, sexy imagery of Pop art. Oldenberg remarked: ‚ÄòFor me, London inspired phallic imagery which went up and down with the tide - like mini-skirts and knees ... like the up-and-down motion of a lipstick‚Äô. To replace the Victorian statue of Eros in Piccadilly Circus with lipsticks lifted from an advertisement was, therefore, to update one vision of sexuality with another.Tate Collection  Lipsticks in Piccadilly Circus, London by Claes Oldenburg *\\"Piccadilly Circus\\" is the name of Swedish singer Pernilla Wahlgren's 1985 Melodifestivalen song. *Northern Irish punk band Stiff Little Fingers had a different song of the same name from their 1981 album Go for It, a true story about a friend of theirs migrating to London to escape The Troubles of Belfast only to be stabbed by strangers in Piccadilly Circus.

It conducts theoretical and applied research, publishes studies and journals, operates educational programs and workshops and undertakes advocacy work. Its headquarters are in Ramallah and it has an office in Gaza. RCHRS monitors and raises awareness about human rights violations in Palestine and advocates the need to defend justice and basic freedoms for all. History RCHRS was founded in 1998 by a group of academics, researchers, lawyers and human rights activists.About Ramallah Center for Human Rights Studies, Ramallah Center for Human Rights Studies. Retrieved 22 January 2011. Work RCHRS aims to engender a culture of tolerance and human rights by supporting inter- religious, inter-cultural and non-violent dialogue. It also advocates educational rights and academic freedoms in Palestinian educational institutions. RCHRS seeks to strengthen civil liberties, the freedom of belief, opinion, and expression and media freedom in Palestine by documenting their violations and advocating for their protection. The goals of the organization include the advancement of secularism and pluralism in Palestinian society and to raise awareness and support for democratic processes and good governance. RCHRS has a wide network of researchers and associated institutions that enables it to reach isolated and marginalized areas and to cooperate on human rights and tolerance issues. =Applied and Theoretical Research= RCHRS relies on a wide network of researchers and associated institutions that contribute their theoretical and applied research on issues relevant to human rights and freedoms in Palestine. Debate, constructive critiques and peer review of these studies are a crucial part of the research process. RCHRS publishes its research widely in books and reports that are distributed locally, internationally and online. These publications are of a high academic standard and are published in Arabic with an introduction in English. =Local and International Conferences, Workshops and Seminars= One key area RCHRS focuses on is facilitating dialogue between various social groups especially young people. Recent projects include Tolerance Among University Students, a training course for students in the West Bank and Gaza. Workshop topics such as the importance of tolerance, academic freedom, democracy and civil rights were discussed. Students from a variety of social, ideological and religious backgrounds take part. RCHRS also holds monthly meetings for representatives from local and international media, civil society organizations and academic institutions. Participants discuss recent events in Palestinian politics and the impact these events have on public security and human rights. The goal is to encourage political leaders to adopt policies and practices that further democracy and enhance civil liberties. =Reaching Isolated and Marginalized Areas= The ongoing occupation of the West Bank, East Jerusalem, and the Gaza Strip has meant not only physical fragmentation of Palestinian society but also a social and cultural fragmentation. As a result, RCHRS sees it as critical that the Center try and reach as many isolated and marginalized areas as possible. This is done through a wide network of associates that work in many local communities. The political events in Gaza in June 2007 and the ongoing internal division in Palestine, prompted the center to expand its reach even further by opening a branch in Gaza. This has allowed RCHRS to continue its activities in this volatile region ensuring that the values of tolerance, human rights and democracy continue to be communicated to all Palestinians. Organizational Structure RCHRS‚Äôs internal structure is founded upon the principle of pluralism. The staff includes secular, Muslim, Christian and Samaritan men and women with differing ideological orientations and social and economic backgrounds. Publications The Ramallah Center for Human Rights Studies publishes reports, articles, quarterly journals, studies, and press releases on various topics and issues concerning Palestinian and Arab society. In particular, RCHRS documents and examines the state of tolerance and human rights within these societies. =Tasamuh (Tolerance) = The TasamuhTasamuh (Tolerance) Journal, Ramallah Center for Human Rights Studies. Retrieved 25 January 2011. quarterly, first released in 2003, is an independent periodical dedicated to debates on tolerance and human rights issues in Palestine and the Arab region. It seeks to disseminate a contemporary illuminated culture through its assertion on the values of human rights and tolerance. It also tries to consider the current socio-political situation and to evaluate its impact on the reality of tolerance within the community. Professor Iyad Barghouti, the General Director of the Ramallah Center for Human Rights Studies is the chief editor of the Tasamuh periodical. Tasamuh consists four sections: studies and articles, reports, laws and legislations and culture. The reports section focuses on different human issues that all defend people's rights in practicing their freedoms. This is done through publishing reports that expose specific occurrences or research findings in the Arab world and discuss their impact on the state of tolerance. The laws and legislations section discusses subjects -not only theories- based on scientific research mainly related to human rights in the Arab societies. The cultural section consists of an essay on tolerance in the thought of an Arab or foreign intellectuals. This aims at demonstrating this noble concept as an ideology and as a practice. Four issues of Tasamuh are published each year. The first issue was published in December 2003. Main language of publication is Arabic. Writers of Tasamuh In addition to Palestinian writers, Tasamuh is also open to writers from the whole Arab world as well as to writers from the Diaspora. Recent issues included material written by authors from Lebanon, Saudi Arabia and Jordan as well as Arab writers living in France and UK. Young writers and researchers are contribute to Tasamuh.

The exhibition gathers young Palestinian and Arab artists though cultural art workshops and activities themed around concepts of tolerance. The annual event exhibits poster art displaying symbols of tolerance and acceptance of cultural and religious diversity. Networks =Arab Network for Tolerance= The Arab Network for Tolerance is a regional network established by RCHRS in June 2008 to serve as a forum where activists, academics, media professionals and youth can come together to identify new strategies for improving the human rights situation in the region. The founding of the Arab Network for Tolerance was announced at a press conference held at the Lebanese Journalists' Union in Beirut on 2 September 2008. This project coincides with RCHRS‚Äôs decision to broaden its work outside Palestine, and is part of RCHRS's efforts to reach a wider audience in its work of diffusing the concepts and values of tolerance. The Network aims to disseminate the culture, values and concepts of tolerance and counter fundamentalism, violence and division, trends seen throughout Arab countries today. The Network‚Äôs stated goal is to ‚Äúactively contribute to building more tolerant societies in the Arab world‚Äù. RCHRS expects that this association of individuals and organisations will be the start of a moderate, secular and effective movement in the Arab countries that can positively influence and develop a variety of sectors in the Arab world, including education, civil society and media. Anticipated outcomes of the Network include: * Finding ways to challenge destructive fundamentalist trends and approaches * Reaching marginalised groups with the values of tolerance and human rights * Revitalizing conventional approaches to human rights and good governance by introducing the concepts of tolerance and diversity into these discourses. The Network started with pre-identified groups in six Arab countries (Yemen, Egypt, Tunisia, Morocco, Lebanon and Palestine) that shared a basic understanding of the concept of tolerance. The Network is open for organisations and individuals who wish to join and will eventually extend to more Arab countries. RCHRS coordinates the Network and is responsible for developing its conceptual and practical framework and for taking a leading role in steering its work. The Network includes a range of structured activities, including training sessions, regional meetings, conferences and publications.

Dudfield) and NME photographer Martyn Goodacre, initially under the name Baggy.  History  The original line up included Spence (vocals), Goodacre (guitar), Russell Underwood (guitar), Kieron \\"Ronnie Fabulous\\" Flynn (bass) and Robert \\"Hodge\\" Hodges (drums).Strong, Martin C. (2003) The Great Indie Discography, Canongate, , p. 734 Briefly called Baggy, the band were managed by NME features editor James Brown who claimed that the exploits of Fabulous were the inspiration behind his later creation of Loaded magazine. Their debut single \\"Destined To Be Free\\" was released on Heavenly Records in November 1991. The sleeve was designed by Screamadelica artist Paul Cannell (HVN 11). \\"Destined To Be Free\\" was made \\"Single of The Week\\" in the NME. The band were at the centre of much controversy over their often-brief live shows and obscene Cannell-designed T-shirts. Jacqui and Carrie of future Shampoo fame often appeared on stage with the group and ran their fan club. Malcolm McLaren suggested Fabulous work with Pete Waterman and the group signed to Waterman's PWL in 1992 (and were handed their own label PWL Rock). After appearing on Waterman's The Hitman And Her TV show, Fabulous and PWL parted company. The album they were working on, Produced by Kylie, has never been officially released. Two further singles, \\"Personality Recession\\" and \\"Dead Friends\\" were recorded independently and released on the Kinglake Records label. Fabulous worked briefly with Andrew Loog Oldham's Immediate Records before disbanding.  Publicity  Malcolm McLaren and the Fab Mobile The band were better known by their hype than their music. Never out of the music paper gossip columns, they made tabloid headlines by being banned from nearly every venue on their debut UK tour. \\"Fabulous bad boys banned\\" splashed The Sun after an infamous stage-wrecking performance at Kingston Polytechnic that was also reviewed by the NME. Further publicity came via an association with American actor Keanu Reeves chronicled by The Daily Star, Smash Hits and The Face. Their Austin Maxi motor (left), dubbed the \\"Fab Mobile\\", was painted by Paul Cannell and was featured in a lengthy TV feature about Fabulous on the BBC2 music show Rapido. Razorlight manager Roger Morton gave them their first live review in the NME on 27 July 1991 - their first ever gig ‚Äî \\"the least dour group you will ever see\\". They featured heavily in i-D, The Face, The Wire, Select, and Melody Maker. Author Mark Simpson (journalist) profiled them in The Guardian, and featured the group in his first book Male Impersonators. Radio broadcaster and author Stuart Bailie strongly supported them at the NME, making their debut single \\"single of the week\\" and, in a January 1992 cover story, writing: \\"They terrify the Manics. They flaunt porno t-shirts. They steal carpets, and erm, Santas. They are a sick NME joke. They are a daft, manipulative group, noisy, reckless, exciting.\\"  Individual careers  Martyn Goodacre is a photographer, musician and the owner of Kinglake Records. Simon Spence (under the name 'Simon Dudfield') contributed interviews and research to the books Stoned and 2Stoned, the autobiographies of The Rolling Stones' manager Andrew Loog Oldham.

Mohamed was born in Somalia and immigrated in 1995. He was raised in Alexandria, Virginia, by his immigrant parents. In March 2009, Mohamed travelled to Yemen where he stayed for three weeks and then to Somalia to stay with relatives. He stated that the purpose of his trip was to meet his extended family and to study Islam and Arabic. In August 2009, he went to Kuwait to live with his uncle. On December 20, 2010, Mohamed went to the Kuwait Airport to renew his visa, and was detained by two men who placed him in a car and blindfolded him. He was placed in a jail cell and interrogated about whether he knew Anwar al-Aulaqi or Osama bin Laden. His interrogators insisted that Mohamed knew al-Aulaqi from the time that the cleric had preached in Falls Church, Virginia in 2001, when he was 10 years old. The interrogators demanded his e-mail and Facebook passwords and took his iPhone. He claims that he was severely beaten and deprived of sleep. After a week, on December 28, Mohamed was taken to a Kuwait deportation facility where he was visited by three FBI agents, who said that his travels \\"raised red flags.\\" Mohamed claimed that the FBI agents requested that he become an informant for the Bureau, but he declined. On December 28, Mohamed used another detainee's contraband cell phone to call his family, who in turn contacted the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR). Mohamed's family sent his older brother to Kuwait to arrange for his release. On January 16, 2011, the Kuwait government advised Mohamed's family to purchase a plane ticket back to Washington and drove him to the airport in an effort to deport him. When he arrived at the airport, he was not allowed to board his flight because he was on the no-fly list. On January 18, 2011, Mohamed's attorney, provided by the CAIR, filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court in Alexandria, Virginia seeking his return to the United States. The federal government agreed to arrange for his return when the Judge was poised to order it. Mohamed was allowed to leave Kuwait on January 20, 2011 and arrived at Dulles Airport on January 21. Mohamed claims that he was detained and interrogated at Dulles for two hours without his lawyer present despite his request for counsel. References External links *Complaint in Mohamed v.

History  The first lord of Salona, Thomas I d'Autremencourt (or de Stromoncourt), was named by Boniface of Montferrat, the King of Thessalonica, in 1205. After the fall of the Thessalonica to the forces of Epirus, and a short-lived Epirote occupation in c. 1210‚Äì1212, Salona became a vassal of the Principality of Achaea, but later came under increasing dependency from the Duchy of Athens. In 1318, the lordship came under the rule of the Catalan Fadrique family, the leader of the Catalan Company, who claimed the title of Count of Salona. Among the eighteen Catalan vassals of the area in 1380-1 the Count of Salona ranks first above Count Demitre and the Margrave of Bodonitsa. Due to the unpopularity of the Dowager Countess Helena Asanina Kantakouzene, in 1394, the town opened its gates to the Ottoman sultan Bayezid I. It fell for a short time into the hands of the Despotate of the Morea c. 1402. The Despot Theodore I Palaiologos sold Salona to the Knights Hospitaller in 1404, but it fell again to the Ottomans in 1410.

System archetypes describe common patterns of behavior in dynamic complex systems. Attractiveness principle is a variation of Limits to Growth archetype, with restrictions caused by multiple limits. The limiting factors here are each of different character and usually cannot be dealt with the same way and/or (and very likely) they cannot be all addressed.  Introduction to the problem  Attractiveness principle is a concept that incorporates the fact that any product or kind of business cannot ever be ‚Äúall things to all people‚Äù Attractiveness Principle at Systems-thinking.org. http://www.systems- thinking.org/theWay/sap/ap.htm though companies very often strive to follow this way.Powell, Bob (2001). The Attractiveness Principle. Continuous Improvement Associates. 1‚Äì2. http://www.exponentialimprovement.com/cms/uploads/flyer_attractiveness_principle2p.pdf One needs to make necessary decisions on the characteristics of the product as it cannot be perfect in all dimensions. If she doesn't, the product is not going to be successful as of the natural constraints (limited resources) it will have to face ‚Äì sooner or later. It is a fact of life that (assuming we know the relationships among the system's elements) we can influence, inhibit or remove some of these limits through making expert changes in the system. The archetype can help us to get the insight into the system behavior so we could identify and decide which limiting factors to inhibit before they inhibit the results we want to achieve. But there will always be some limits we are not able to reduce and simply ‚Äúwe have to learn to live with them‚Äù and make compromises between our goals. = Application field = Knowledge of the attractiveness principle system archetype is essential in management of various projects and businesses. Managers decide which problem is more attractive in terms of possible future improvement of the company ‚Äì the origin of the archetype's name actually came from this point. Manager as a decision-maker needs efficient support in solving such complex problems, and system dynamics can play this role. Its main advantage is the ability to reach higher complexity and to provide simultaneous calculations. These can be used to determine the future possible behavior of the system.Mildeov√°, Stanislava and Vojtko, Viktor (2006). Selected Chapters of System Dynamics. KARTPRINT. 86‚Äì87. . If managers are able to recognize the archetype in a problem it often helps them to solve it with less cost and they are also often able to change its structure.Mildeov√°, Stanislava and Vojtko, Viktor (2003). Syst√©mov√° dynamika. Oeconomica. 39. . = History = The term attractiveness principle was first used by inventor of system dynamics Jay W. Forrester.Forrester, J. W. (1975). Collected Papers of Jay W. Forrester. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Wright-Allen Press. http://dieoff.org/page23.htm According to Forrester, the only way to control growth is to control attractiveness. Other references on this topic can be found in The Systems Thinker The Systems Thinker. Pegasus Communications, Inc. Waltham, MA. and in The Fifth Discipline Fieldbook Senge, P. et al. (1994). The Fifth Discipline Fieldbook. New York: Doubleday Currency. in articles and parts by Michael Goodman and Art Kleiner.  Model  = Structure = The system is made up of a reinforcing loop and at least two balancing loops. See causal loop diagram and stock and flow diagram for the insight into model fundamentals. Figure 1. Causal loop diagram Figure 2. Stock and flow diagram The Reinforcing Loop (R1 in Figure 1 and 2) represents accelerating growth ‚Äì a growing action is producing results. This is a positive feedback loop ‚Äì the more the growing action taken, the higher the results level, and yet the result itself produces even more of growing action. Balancing loops (B2 and B3 in Figure 1 and 2) represent the way the system turns back to its original state. Result produced in the reinforcing loop is influenced within the balancing loop. There are (at least) two limits causing the slowing actions in the system and adding to them. Limiting actions start to influence the system at various levels of results, generally. Since that moment slowing actions act in the system simultaneously. Both the slowing actions contribute to the total slowing action. Total slowing action then inhibits the results (this process is delayed in time). If we get back to the reinforcing loop then we can see the inhibited results are reducing growing action which is leading to the reduced results again. = Trade-offs = Trade-offs must be calculated to decide which ones of limits to focus on and address first.Sherrer, J. Alex (2010). Fix It With Systems Thinking: Part 4. Project Management Road Trip. http://www.pmroadtrip.com/art09004c.html#ATTRACTIVENESS The one that is more attractive in terms of future benefit to the results should be chosen to be dealt with. It is necessary to compare the future situations after removing each of the slowing actions and their values in terms of reaching the desired result. But not only the one that will have a greater impact should be chosen but a possible synergetic effect when removing interdependent limits should be considered when making a decision.  System behavior  Graphs in Figure 3 and 4 show the results of simulation in Simgua simulation tool. Figure 3. Situation with no limiting factor. Figure 4. Situation with one limiting factor set at 3 and another one set at 5. You can also run the Simgua Attractiveness principle model. Examples = Project management example = There is a project with a negative impact of a risk. Some people were taken off the team, there are unexpected changes in the project content and the economic circumstances have changed, too. The indicators of its quality, schedule and costs need to be kept up. Management's task is to allocate the resources as well as possible in terms of the project's indicators. Due to the fact the resources are limited it is necessary to make tradeoffs among opportunities. = Attractiveness of geographical areas = Jay W. Forrester studied the attractiveness principle of geographical areas.Forrester, Jay (1971). Counterintuitive behavior of social systems. Technology Review. He states that all the places in the world tend to the equilibrium where they are all equally attractive, no matter the population class. Let attractivity be the overall rating of a city in terms of its desirability for potential inhabitants. If a city has high attractivity people move to this city, which increases the prices of housing which is getting scarce, cause overloading of job opportunities (leading to unemployment), the environmental stress is rising, city getting overcrowded etc. These changes demonstrate the impact of the movement as of an equalizing process which makes the mentioned city less and less attractive ‚Äì to the (idealized) point when no one wants to move to it anymore. We can illustrate this situation by Forester's words: :To illustrate the attractiveness principle, imagine for a moment the ideal city. Perhaps the ideal city would be one with readily available housing at low cost, a surplus of jobs at high wages, excellent schools, no smoke or pollution, housing located near one's place of work, no crime, beautiful parks, cultural opportunities, and to this list the reader can add his own preferences. Suppose such a city existed. What would happen? It would be perceived as the ideal place to live. People from everywhere would move into the ideal city until the advantages had been so swamped by rising population that the city would offer no net attractiveness compared with other locations. (, pg. 275-276) As stated by Richard C. Duncan, using Forrester's Word dynamics model to predict the behavior of Third World countries shows that it is not possible to stop the immigration from these countries to USA as these countries can never reach the USA's level of geographical attractiveness (and so there always will be a tendency to immigrate).Duncan, Richard C. (2007). The olduvai theory: terminal decline imminent. http://www.oilcrash.com/articles/olduv_7.htm  Effective strategies  Here is a list of possible effective strategies to deal with Attractiveness principle in praxis based on.Braun, William (2002). The System Archetypes: 21‚Äì23. Attractiveness Principle Systems Archetype. SystemsWiki. # Knowing the growth is limited is the first step. # The insight is complicated by mutual interaction of limits, so analysis of their relation should be a priority. Such an analysis can also reveal possible synergies that can be achieved by allocating resources to carefully chosen limits. # Consider replacing limited resources by another ones. # Dominant strategy is to monitor the limits and using tradeoff analysis for deciding which of them it is convenient to reduce or remove to obtain desired results. # Define the acceptable level of (un)attraction. # Slowing actions are not usually appearing at the same time so it is important to manage them through the time. # Try to inhibit the limits before they even start to act like limits. # As limits start to have impact on various levels of results it is important to keep the right timing ‚Äì intercept the moment when the limit starts playing its role but not waste the resources to avoid its impact unless it is necessary. It is important to have in mind that dynamic complexity is very often counterintuitive ‚Äì cause and effect are distant in time and space, but decision-makers rather tend to look for causes ‚Äúnear‚Äù their effects. The solution is not to concentrate on the symptoms of the problem, but on its causes.Sterman, John D. (2000). Business Dynamics: Systems thinking and modeling for a complex world. McGraw Hill. 22. .

Opened in 1861, it forms part of the Bologna‚ÄìAncona railway. The station is currently managed by Rete Ferroviaria Italiana (RFI). However, the commercial area of the passenger building is managed by Centostazioni. Train services are operated by Trenitalia. Each of these companies is a subsidiary of Ferrovie dello Stato (FS), Italy's state-owned rail company. Location Pesaro railway station is situated at Piazzale Giovanni Falcone e Paolo Borsellino, southwest of the city centre. History The station was opened on 17 November 1861, upon the inauguration of the final section of the Bologna‚ÄìAncona railway, between Rimini and Ancona. The original operator of the station was the Societ√† Generale delle Strade Ferrate Romane (). In the reorganization of the Italian railways in 1865, the Kingdom of Italy entrusted its operation to the Societ√† per le Strade Ferrate Meridionali (SFM) (). The latter company retained that function until the nationalization of the Italian railways in 1905. During its history, the station has suffered severe setbacks, although the city has been constantly developing. In 1935, the original passenger building was replaced by the present structure, designed by the architect Roberto Narducci. Features The station yard has thirteen tracks, of which five are dedicated to passenger traffic. The passenger tracks are served by three platforms accessible to users through a pedestrian underpass - lifts are available. The busiest passenger tracks are track 2, used by southbound trains, and track 3, which serves northbound trains. Tracks 1, 4 and 5 are used infrequently, generally for trains either originating or terminating in Pesaro. Gallery File:Stazione Pesaro antica.jpgThe original passenger building.

The main origins and destinations of the regional trains are Bologna railway Bologna, Rimini, Milan and Ancona. During the summer, the station serves as a terminus for treni del mare (): interregional trains organized by Ferrovie Emilia Romagna, and originating in Bergamo, Brescia, Cremona and Mantua. The Intercity and High speed trains mostly link Pesaro with Roma Termini, Lecce, Ancona and Milan Central. The station is served by the following services (incomplete): *High speed services (FrecciaRossa) Turin - Milan - Bologna - Ancona - Pescara *High speed services (FrecciArgento) Milan - Bologna - Ancona - Pescara - Bari *Medium speed services (Frecciabianca) Milan - Parma - Bologna - Ancona - Pescara - Foggia - Bari - Brindisi - Lecce *Medium speed services (Frecciabianca) Milan - Parma - Bologna - Ancona - Pescara - Foggia - Bari - Taranto *Medium speed services (Frecciabianca) Turin - Parma - Bologna - Ancona - Pescara - Foggia - Bari - Brindisi - Lecce *Medium speed services (Frecciabianca) Venice - Padua - Bologna - Ancona - Pescara - Foggia - Bari - Brindisi - Lecce *Medium speed services (Frecciabianca) Ravenna - Rimini - Foligno - Terni - Rome *Intercity services Bologna - Rimini - Ancona - Pescara - Foggia - Bari - Brindisi - Lecce *Intercity services Bologna - Rimini - Ancona - Pescara - Foggia - Bari - Taranto *Slow speed local services (Regionale) to other big and small cities in Marche and Emilia-Romagna (Fano, Rimini, Bologna, Piacenza, Ravenna, Ancona ecc...)

The main source about him is Procopius.Martindale, Jones & Morris (1992), p. 8-9  Biography  Procopius considers Acacius and his son Adolius to have been natives of Roman Armenia: \\"Adolius, the son of Acacius ... This Adolius was an Armenian by birth, and he always served the emperor while in the palace as privy counsellor (those who enjoy this honour are called by the Romans \\"silentiarii\\"), but at that time he was commander of some Armenians. And these men did as directed.\\" Procopius, History of the Wars, Book 2, Chapter 21 Acacius is first mentioned when he brought forth accusations of treason against his friend Amazaspes. Justinian I arranged for Acacius to kill Amazaspes. Procopius reports that Justinian \\"gave over the villages to Amazaspes, the nephew of Symeon, and appointed him ruler over the Armenians. This Amazaspes, as time went on, was denounced to the Emperor Justinian by one of his friends, Acacius by name, on the ground that he was abusing the Armenians and wished to give over to the Persians Theodosiopolis and certain other fortresses. After telling this, Acacius, by the emperor's will, slew Amazaspes treacherously, and himself secured the command over the Armenians by the gift of the emperor.\\" Procopius, History of the Wars, Book 2, Chapter 3 On 18 March 536, a law of Justinian reformed the administration of Armenia. Acacius was already governor of Armenia Interior/Armenia Magna; his title was probably consularis of Armenia Magna. The reorganization named him governor of the new province of Armenia Prima (First Armenia) and gave him the title of proconsul. Further legal documents of 536 mention Acacius. He is called in \\"Latin\\" \\"proconsul Armeniae Primae\\" and in Greek as anthypatos of Armenia (). One of these legal documents clarifies that the women of Armenia share the same rights of inheritance as the rest of the Roman (Byzantine) women. Acacius proved highly unpopular with the population of his province, gaining a reputation for cruelty and greed. He was assassinated in 538/539. Procopius reports about him: \\"And being base by nature, he [Acacius] gained the opportunity of displaying his inward character, and he proved to be the most cruel of all men toward his subjects. For he plundered their property without excuse and ordained that they should pay an unheard-of tax of four centenaria. But the Armenians, unable to bear him any longer, conspired together and slew Acacius and fled for refuge to Pharangium.\\" Another passage of Procopius names Artabanes as the killer.

Club and state rowing Martin started rowing at Ballarat Grammar School whose facilities were located at the Wendouree Ballarat boat shed. After school she joined the Wendouree Ballarat Rowing Club. She was awarded a scholarship to the New South Wales Institute of Sport prior to her 2001 World Championship success.AIS News 2001 Martin was selected to represent Victoria in the state youth eight racing for the Bicentennial Cup at the Interstate Regatta within the Australian Rowing Championships in 1997 and 1998 and saw victories in both years. On nine consecutive occasions from 1999 to 2007 and then in 2010 she was selected to the Victorian senior women's eight who race for the Queen Elizabeth Cup at that same Interstate Regatta. She stroked that crew to victory in 2000 and rowed in seven total senior victories. Of the twelve occasions Martin raced for Victoria in representative crews she saw nine victories, two second placings and one third place. International representative rowing Martin's debut representative appearance came in 1998 at age nineteen in a development four with Angela Heitman, Deidre Coates and Kristina Larsen with whom she would share later senior success. They won gold in a W4- at the 1998 World Rowing Cup III in Lucerne. Selectors then sent that four to the 1998 World Rowing U23 Championships in Ioannina, Greece where they won an U23 World Championship title, leading all the way in the final and beating out the US crew by 6.4 seconds. Martin secured a seat at five in the Australian women's senior eight in 1999. She raced at the World Rowing Cup III that year in Lucerne and then at the 1999 World Rowing Championships in St Catharine's where the eight placed fifth. Her strength and skill ensured her place in the eight leading into the 2000 Olympic year. She rowed at seven in both World Cups II and III in Europe and then in Sydney for the 2000 Olympics in that critical seat setting up the bow side behind Jane Robinson. They managed a fifth place finish in the final. Martin was selected in the Australian squad for the 2001 international tour. In their first competitive outing of the 2001 season, racing as an Australian Institute of Sport selection eight at Henley Royal Regatta, Martin won the 2001 Henley Prize for women's eights (from 2002 this event was renamed the Remenham Challenge Cup). She rowed in two Australian senior crews at the World Rowing Cup IV regatta in Munich, Germany. In a coxless pair with Kristina Larsen she placed fourth while in the Australian eight they placed second and were on track for possible World Championship success. A month later at the 2001 World Rowing Championships in Lucerne, Martin was in the five seat of the Australian women's heavyweight crew who won Australia's first ever women's eight World Championship title. At those same World Championships she placed fourth in the final of the coxless pair with Larsen.Martin at World Rowing Martin had pressure holding her seat in the eight in 2002 as the selectors tried different combinations. She raced in a pair and the eight at the World Rowing Cup II in Lucerne and then in the pair at World Cup III in Munich. For the 2002 World Championships in Seville, Victoria Roberts and Rachael Taylor were seated at seven and five in the eight and Martin raced the Australian coxless pair with Monique Heinke. They finished in sixth place. Though she still rowed at the top national level in 2003 and 2004, Martin was not picked to representative crews. But the typical squad changes occurring in the first year after an Olympiad as rowers step away, happened again after Athens 2004 and Martin took her opportunities. She was selected in both the W4- and the W8+ for the 2005 World Rowing Championships in Gifu Japan. Both crews took gold with Martin rowing in the middle of each boat to her second and third World Championship titles. The following year at Eton Dorney 2006 Martin rowed in the eight and in a pair with Sarah Heard. The W8+ took bronze behind the US and Germany while the pair placed ninth. Martin was still in contention for the eight in 2007 and raced at the World Rowing Cup I in the two seat. For the World Rowing Cup II she raced only in the coxless four who won silver.

Neither Sweden nor Denmark-Norway had wanted war to begin with but once pushed into it through their respective alliances, Sweden made a bid to acquire Norway by way of invasion while Denmark-Norway made ill-fated attempts to reconquer territories lost to Sweden in the 17th century. Peace was concluded on grounds of status quo ante bellum on 10 December 1809. Background During the War of the First Coalition Denmark-Norway and Sweden had remained neutral. The two Nordic countries also intended to follow this policy during the War of the Second Coalition and had in 1800, together with Prussia and Russia, formed the Second League of Armed Neutrality in order to protect their neutral shipping against the British policy of unlimited search of neutral shipping for French contraband. The League would however, be dissolved following the British naval attack against Copenhagen and the death of Tsar Paul I of Russia in 1801. After the collapse of the alliance, and Denmark-Norway's brief war against the United Kingdom, Sweden and Denmark still continued their neutrality policy. In 1805 Sweden joined the war against France, but following the rapid French advance through northwest Germany and the defeat at L√ºbeck, Swedish forces had to withdraw to Swedish Pomerania. Attempts at peace negotiations between France and Sweden was initiated, and Emperor Napoleon I of France offered Sweden in the autumn of 1806, Norway in exchange for Swedish Pomerania.Ottosen 2012, pp. 12-15 But the negotiations failed, and in early 1807 French forces invaded and eventually occupied Swedish Pomerania. Following the Treaties of Tilsit in 1807 the main focus of France and Britain was directed towards Denmark. Napoleon wanted to include the neutral Denmark-Norway in the Continental System while the United Kingdom feared that the Danish fleet should fall into the hands of the French. Britain's attack and subsequent bombardment of Copenhagen led to the seizure and destruction of large parts of the Danish fleet and the Danish choice to conclude an alliance with Napoleon. The alliance between Denmark-Norway and France was signed at Fontainebleau on 31 October 1807. The agreement indicated vague promises from the French that they would help Denmark-Norway regaining its fleet, while Denmark had to commit themselves to participate in an eventual war against Sweden together with France and Russia. Crown Prince Frederik of Denmark-Norway was reluctant to participate in war against Sweden, but he decided to declare war against Sweden with the aim of conquering the territory which Denmark-Norway had lost after the Treaty of Br√∂msebro and Treaty of Roskilde. And since Sweden's attention was on Finland following the Russian invasion in February 1808,Jensen 1995, pp. 343-44 he saw it as easier to take back the territories. On 14 March 1808 the Danish Minister in Stockholm presented the declaration of war to the Swedish government,Dyrvik 1999, pp. 206-7 and the Swedish king, Gustav IV Adolf replied with planning an invasion of Sj√§lland, in order to force Denmark to conclude separate peace. This plan was however, temporarily sidelined and the Swedish troops in G√∂taland were instead placed in a defensive position, following rumors that Napoleon had sent reinforcements to Denmark. King Gustav IV instead approved the plan drawn up by Gustaf Mauritz Armfelt, on an invasion of Norway to compensate for a possible loss of Finland. Armies Johan Christopher Toll, commander of the Swedish army in southern Sweden Gustaf Mauritz Armfelt, commander of the Swedish army at the border =The Swedish army= The Swedish army stationed in Sweden counted a total of 23,000 men, 7,000 in southern Sweden under the command of Count Johan Christopher Toll, 14,000 towards the Norwegian border under the leadership of Gustaf Mauritz Armfelt, and 2,000 in Norrland under Johan Bergenstr√•hle. The Swedish army was fairly well equipped and the soldiers were well trained, but under the pressure from two fronts the Swedes had been forced to retain the ability to send troops wherever they were needed the most. The main theater of war was in the east, where the Russian invasion threatened the Swedish rule in Finland,Holm 1991, p. 69 but the threat from Denmark‚ÄìNorway and France was taken seriously. The Swedish western army was divided into two wings, the right wing was led by Armfeldt himself, and the left wing was led by Major General Vegesack.Schnitler 1895, pp. 214-15 The army's right wing furthermore consisted of Colonel Carl Pontus Gahn's \\"Flying Corps\\" of approximately 650 men in , Colonel Leyonstedt's 1st Brigade of approximately 1,600 men in Eda, Colonel Schwerig's 2nd Brigade of about 2,500 men in T√∂cksmark, Colonel Bror Cederstr√∂m's 3rd Brigade of approximately 1,750 men in Holmedal, and Colonel Johan Adam Cronstedt's 4th Brigade of approximately 1,700 men in the area east of the Marker. The army's left wing consisted mainly of one brigade at Str√∂mstad, one at T√∂ftedal and one in the area between Gothenburg and Uddevalla. Swedish regiments *H√§lsinge Regiment *Skaraborg Regiment *Kalmar Regiment *Life Grenadier Regiment *Bohusl√§n Regiment =The Danish- Norwegian army= Prince Christian August, Norwegian commander-in-chief The Danish-Norwegian army combined consisted of 36,000 men.Angell 1914, p. 18 The Danish army could muster 14,650 men, but only 5,000 of them could be used for attacks against the Swedish. The Norwegian army had been prepared for a future war with Sweden since the fall of 1807, but since they were forced to organize coastal protection along the long Norwegian coast against attacks from the British warships who tried to close the connecting lines between Norway and Denmark, the army was in a poor state in late February 1808. The army ended up with a lack of weapons, ammunition, clothes, food and many soldiers had equipment that was close to 20 years old. The Norwegian army was under the leadership of Prince Christian August of Augustenburg who at that time was President of the Norwegian Government Commission, which had been established when the British initiated the blockade between Norway and Denmark in 1807. Christian August would later during the war also be appointed Governor-general of Norway.

The Norwegian defence After the stationing of the troops at the border was completed in late March 1808, Christian August divided the southern forces along the border on √òstlandet from south to north: *Colonel Hans Gram Holst's right-wing brigade with approximately 3,400 men in the area from Svinesund to R√∏denes *Colonel Werner de Seues's center brigade with about 1,900 men in the area from R√∏denes to KongsvingerAngell 1914, p. 44 *Colonel Bernhard Ditlef von Staffeldt's left-wing brigade with roughly 1,300 men in the area from Kongsvinger to Elverum *Colonel Christopher Frederik Lowzow's 1st reserve brigade with some 1,700 men in the area from Vormsund to FetsundSaltnes 1998, p. 87-88 *Colonel Johan Andreas Ohme's 2nd reserve brigade with approximately 650 men from Gr√∏nsund to FetsundRastad 1982, p. 18 The Norwegian troops in the southern defense amounted to about 9,000 men, in addition, there were 3,300 men stationed in Tr√∏ndelag for the defense in the north: *Colonel Carsten Gerhard Bang with a brigade of about 2,100 men in R√∏ros *Lieutenant General Carl von Schmettow with a brigade of about 1,200 men in InnherredHolm 1991, p. 71 It was also stationed 2,000 men in Trondheim and Kristiansand, and 6,200 men in Frederiksvern and Bergen Fortress garrisons *Fredrikstad: about 2,350 men *Fredriksten: about 1,250 men *Kongsvinger Fortress: about 900 menAngell 1914, p. 43 *Akershus Fortress: about 800 men =The French army= At the outbreak of war Napoleon had sent reinforcements to Denmark from France, Spain and the Netherlands under the leadership of Marshal Jean- Baptiste Bernadotte (a total of about 45,000 men, 12,500 French, 14,000 Spaniards, 6,000 Dutch and a Danish reserve squad of 12,500 men), which meant that the Danish-French force consisted of approximately 81,000 men. The French made it a condition for their participation in the war against Sweden that the coalition army was to be under French command. War preparations On 5 March, several days before the Danish government had decided to declare war on Sweden, Marshal Bernadotte, who at that time was French governor of Hamburg and the other Hanseatic cities, started his march towards Denmark with the coalition army of 32,000 men. But it seems likely that Napoleon at the time was not willing to let their troops go into direct action, because after Bernadotte had camped with large parts of the coalition army on Sj√¶lland he was not ordered to continue his advance against the Danish shipping ports. The ice also started breaking up in mid-March, and to everyone's surprise, the first British warships started to show up even as ice floes still lay densely packed. Admiral Hyde Parker had wintered in Gothenburg the winter of 1807-08 with his squadron and came down very early in the straits between the Kattegat and Baltic Sea. Bernadotte, who had lost valuable time while lying ice-bound, also lost the ability to secure passage before the arrival of the British warships. The troops presence in Sj√¶lland, Fyn and Jutland was more a burden than help to the Danish population. Another problem arose after the news that Spain had revolted against Napoleon was known in Denmark, and the Spanish troops had to be disarmed and interned. In mid-April 1808 the Danish-French plan for an invasion of Sweden was called off and attention was directed towards the Swedish-Norwegian border. The war =Swedish invasion of Norway= In the last days of March, the Norwegian and Swedish outposts along the border had been in contact with each other on several occasions, but the scattered skirmishes had been fruitless. The first major action happened on 1 April 1808, when Johan Bergenstr√•hle marched with his 2,000 men into Norway from J√§mtland,Angell 1914, p. 53 but his army was forced to retreat back to Sundsvall without engaging in battle. But at the same time as Bergenstr√•hle's retreat two companies of 235 men under Major Gyllenskrepp went across the border from Herjedalen towards R√∏ros and engaged in a minor skirmish with a Norwegian field guard of 40 men from Colonel Bang's brigade in Aursund. After the field guards had withdrawn and the Norwegian outposts of 140 men, of which the field guard was a part of, had retreated to R√∏ros, the Swedes began with unusually extensive looting in the border area, and especially in the town of Brekken. The looting continued until those of Colonel Bang's forces who were closest in the area, a Musketeer battalion of 600 men under Major Sommerschild, counterattacked and forced the Swedes back across the border. In retaliation for the sacking of Brekken a force of 558 men from Colonel Bangs's Brigade marched across the border to Malmagen and Ljusnedal on 8 April. The royal properties in Funnesdalen were sacked and devastated in the purely predatory expedition, and all the loot that had been taken from Brekken, including 22 guns, was recaptured in Ljusnedal after a brief skirmish with the Swedish defenders. Since the spring should prove to be quite uneventful in the border area between Tr√∏ndelag and J√§mtland after the engagements in early April, the Norwegians decided to send several units to the south of R√∏ros, and to the area between Roverud and Kongsvinger. Battle of Lier (1808) The Swedish main attack to the south began on the night of 14 April with the advance of the Swedish 2nd brigade in the area of Aurskog-H√∏land.Saltnes 1998, pp. 89-90 Christian August, who was on his way to move his headquarters to Rakkestad, was notified of the Swedes' advances and marched a brigade to meet the threat from the east on 17 April. His choice of interior lines of operation proved suitable for a defensive position, so he could concentrate his forces against the front section where they were needed the most. Fighting in H√∏land and Aurskog ended with a Norwegian victory, and the Swedish commander, Colonel Schwerin felt so threatened by the Norwegian counterattacks that he ordered a retreat after the defeat at Toverud, where the Swedish commander Count Axel Otto M√∂rner and his troops had been forced to surrender.Bircka 1889, p. 539 Schwerin saved himself from a decisive battle against the Norwegian army because Christian August had decided to move his forces back to Kongsvinger to accommodate the Swedish advance in area and from there try to mount a major attack. Fighting around Kongsvinger In the border district at Eidskog, Gustaf Mauritz Armfeldt began this advance with about 1,600 men from across the border at Eda towards Kongsvinger on the evening of 15 April.Angell 1914, p. 85 He drove out the weak border guard and continued advancing towards the Lier entrenchment in the course of several days of spread skirmishes. The Norwegian defenders was forced to retreat in order to avoid being outflanked by the Swedes. On 18 April, a battle took place at Lier, about one mile south of Kongsvinger. In the battle 1,000 Swedish soldiers defeated a Norwegian army consisting of 800-900 men under the command of Major Bernt Peter Kreutz.Angell 1914, p. 86 After this victory the Swedish troops entrenched themselves at Lier and advanced all the way to the river Glomma, but they did not risk an attack on Kongsvinger Fortress,Rastad; Engh & Engen 2004, pp. 10‚Äì15 something that put an temporarily end to the offensive. Christian August reacted severely to the news of the defeat at the Lier and that the Swedish troops had reached the river Glomma. He now had to move the main forces to Blaker to stop a possible attack from the Swedish positions on the south-west side of Kongsvinger in the north or from H√∏land in the south. But fortunately for the Norwegians the outcome of the battle of Toverud and the engagement at Lund stabilized the situation in the south. Armfeldt therefore wanted to besiege and then attack Kongsvinger and thereby secure the strategically important fortress. Colonel Carl Pontus Gahn with his \\"Flying Corps\\" was with this ordered to make his way to Glomma and from there west towards Kongsvinger, Armfeldt would thereby make a pincer movement to besiege the fortress. The order given to Colonel Gahn about such a bold and perilous advance has always been controversial, as superior Norwegian forces of approximately 800 men were stationed by the Flisa river which he had to pass. Gahn marched from the Swedish camp at Midtskogen on the evening of 24 April with about 500 men along the snowy road to Flisa river and along the river down towards Trangen to the southwest of Nyen in √Ösnes. From Nyen, major Norwegian forces advanced down to attack the Swedes from the rear, and together with Colonel Staffeldt brigade of about 1,050 men, the approximately 800 Norwegian troops stationed in the area participated in the attack. The battle of Trangen was a serious defeat for the Swedes. The whole corps was annihilated and about 440 men were captured at Trangen, and another 65 on 25 April at Midtskogen. After the battles, Colonel Staffeldt was ordered to move his brigade west to Kongsvinger to reinforce the defense of the fortress. After the regrouping of the defense around Kongsvinger, Christian August traveled south to get the Swedes forestalled by an offensive in the area around √òrje. When Armfeldt was notified of the defeat in the north, he immediately feared a Norwegian attack on this flank as long as there was ice on Glomma. The Swedish commander had lost his right flank to the north, and strong Norwegian forces had gathered along the Glomma at Kongsvinger and Blaker.Angell 1914, p. 117 Because of this Armfeldt found it necessary to wait for Colonel Vegesack and his forces, who had not yet begun their advance, before he carried out some further operations and thereby chose to go into a defensive position. Prince Christian August(right) and Niels Stockfleth Darre Battles in Smaalenene Prince Christian August had initially planned to attack from Blaker against the Swedish 3rd Brigade at √òrje, but got messages that indicated that a Swedish attack across the border to the south would come in the near future. Because from 2‚Äì3 May, about 2,000 Swedish soldiers from two Swedish brigades under Colonel Vegesack advanced forward in three columns between Holmgil and Prestebakke east of Fredrikshald. But the conditions for the Swedish troops were so bad that the advance was stopped at the Norwegian defensive line between Haller√∂d, Gjeddeludd, Enningdalen and Berby church. Meanwhile, further north, a Swedish force of about 1,000 men advanced out of N√∂ssemark across the border towards Bj√∏rkebekk and Skotsund in Aremark, but this advance were also stopped. During the month of May the Swedish troops entrenched themselves along a line from the southeast of Kongsvinger, behind Haldenvassdraget from Kroksund and along the new line from Aremark to Iddefjorden. The Norwegian offensive that had been planned, was abandoned in favor of the realignment of the standing forces, including Colonel Holst's brigade that had been lying northeast of R√∏dnessj√∏en and had moved back to Mysen. A limited offensive against the Swedish brigade at √òrje was instead initiated with about 1,000 men who were directed over Mjerma under the command of Major Andreas Samuel Krebs on 4 May. The fighting around Aremark on 5 May was tough, but the Swedish troops eventually fled their positions back to the well-developed positions outside of √òrje, where they managed to hold out. The Norwegians had 10 wounded after the battle, while the Swedes had 10 dead and 16 wounded, and Krebs with his exhausted troops were recalled, while Major Friederich Fischer with his (approximately) 500 men went on from Mysen and came as a surprise to the Swedish field guards at Ysterud and Li, west of √òrje, on 7 May. But despite of the loss of only 9 wounded, Fischer was unable to continue because √òrje bridge was destroyed by the Swedes.Olsen 2011, pp. 324-325 It was also inserted several other local attacks against the Swedish positions, and on the night of 8 May, Major Peter Krefting advanced with three divisions against Skotsberg to break the link between the Swedish forces in Aremark and √òrje. But the Norwegian attack was beaten back under the first action at Skotsberg, where a strait separated the Swedes and Norwegians from each other. Krefting tried again to cross the strait during the second encounter at Skotsberg on 13 May with artillery and four mortars, but was stopped again. On 9 May Lieutenant Johan Sp√∏rck advanced with 120 men from Fredriksten fortress against the Swedish position at Gjeddelund, but were beaten back by a company from Holtet who recaptured the position. After the skirmish at Gjeddelund, Sp√∏rck had 1 killed and 6 wounded, while the Swedes had 1 killed, 11 wounded and 2 captured.Oppegaard 1996, pp. 168-69 A new, small offensive further north, took place on 12 May west of Str√∏msfoss, were, with his modest forces, Captain Hans Harboe Gr√∏n began a series of local attacks against the Swedish field guards. The attacks lasted until 28 May when the Swedes had been reinforced with a battalion. =Swedish withdrawal from Norway= After Colonel Staffeldt had regrouped his forces in Kongsvinger, the front against the fortress was quiet until the beginning of May, apart from some minor skirmishes that was set in to constantly disrupted the Swedes. These minor skirmishes worked to the benefit of the Norwegian troops and on 5 May a Swedish vanguard was wiped out and 10 Swedes were captured. It was much to the chagrin of the Swedish commander that he suffered the loss of patrols and small outposts because of the Norwegian troops' scattered warfare. This led to more concentration of the Swedish troops and the Swedish 2nd Brigade was moved closer to the 1st Brigade in order to prevent the Norwegians from attacking them in small groups. Siege artillery was also transferred to the Kongsvinger front for a new planned attack at Kongsvinger fortress. The Swedes had also initiated the development of new positions at the Lier entrenchment, with evident facing west, and the so-called \\"Skinnarb√∏l line\\" along the river east of Skinnarb√∏l and Vinger Sea facing north. The Norwegians kept close attention to what was going on at the Swedish positions by continually sending reconnaissance patrols that went out aggressively against the Swedes. Major troop movements were not possible before mid-May because of the huge snowfall that winter, and it was not until 15 May, Staffeldt ordered to make a larger attack on the Swedish right flank. But the conditions were still not good enough, and the roads had only just begun to dry up, so the attack was postponed until 18 May.Angell 1914, pp. 121-122 Battles at Mobekk and Jerpset The skirmish at Mobekk did not begin well for the Norwegian soldiers. The Swedes managed to destroy the vital bridge over the river at Overud, and the Norwegian troops were standing on their side against the Swedish defenders who fought doggedly in the barricade.Saltnes 1998, pp. 98-99 After four hours, the battle of Mobekk came to an end, and the Norwegian troops returned to Kongsvinger. In order to restore his dignity after the battle of Mobekk, Staffeldt was forced to make a new attack.Steen 1996, p. 160-62 It had been discovered that a Swedish j√§ger company had been moved to Jerpset in Vestmarka in order to connect the Swedish 2nd Brigade who was stationed closer to the border. On the 23 May, troops from Captain Wilhelm J√∏rgensen's light company, along with 65 skiers crossed Glomma approximately 10 km west of Kongsvinger. The Norwegians attacked Jerpset farm in the evening of the 24 May and discovered that the Swedes had sent out several patrols, and that only 29 Swedish soldiers were stationed at the farm. 25 of the 29 Swedish soldiers were taken prisoner.Rastad; Engh & Engen 2004, pp. 21-22 Swedish troops who were quartered at nearby farms were unable to obtain the Norwegians who after the fighting retreated into the woods under cover of darkness. Colonel Staffeldt had planned future attacks, but the events on Jerpset frightened Armfeldt so much that he ordered the withdrawal from the positions closest to Kongsvinger. Besides, he had already on the 19 May received an order from King Gustav IV Adolf of what he believed to be a general retreat. An English fleet had arrived in Gothenburg with 10,000 men on 18 May 1808, and Gustav IV Adolf now wanted to make a Swedish-English attack against the Danish island Sj√§lland, and therefore ordered Armfeldt to ¬´[...]occupy the safest and most favorable defensive position against Norway¬ª.Translation of: ¬´[...]intaga den s√§kraste och f√∂rdelaktigaste defensiva st√§llning mot Norge¬ª. King Gustav IV had, however, not intended for Armfeldt to retreat back across the border, but only secure the areas in Norway that he had occupied and wait for the planned invasion of Sj√§lland. Armfeldt on the other hand misunderstood the order and abandoned all plans of attack against the Norwegian military and, with the 1st and 2nd Brigade, retreated to secure positions behind the border in order to reorganize the troops and secure border crossings.Ottosen 2012, p. 20 The Swedish retreat came as a surprise to the Norwegians. Staffeldt advanced on the day after the Swedes' withdrawal all the way to Eidskog with his troops, and on the evening of 31 May his main force arrived at Matrand. Smaller patrols were also sent to Flisa to secure the area. King Gustav IV Adolf's plans for a Swedish-English attack on Sj√§lland would, however, be cancelled after the British fleet returned to England on 3 July. Fighting in Enningdal The other two Swedish brigades that had been stationed close to Fredrikshald went on 8‚Äì9 June back across the border together with the parts of the left wing brigade which had reached Skotfoss. In mid-June there were only two Swedish positions left on Norwegian territory, something that came as a surprise to the Norwegians. Christian August had originally planned a general offensive against the south to R√∏denes/√òrjebro and Enningdalen to push the last Swedish troops across the border, but the plan was instead changed into a small offensive. This plan, which had been worked out by the commander on Fredriksten fortress, Lieutenant Colonel Juel, was that one should insert many small attacks against the Swedes to drive them back across the border.Holm 1991, p. 107 Fighting in Enningdal The Swedish troops, under command of Lieutenant Colonel Jacob Lars von Knorring, had stationed themselves at their fortified positions at Prestebakke with strongholds in both the east and west, and with larger forces misplaced by Ende, Berby and Enningdalen. Juel, who was seriously ill, gave the command to Captain Arild Huitfeldt, who began advancing on the evening on 9 June with a force totalling 710 men. The thrust to the south was successful. During the battle of Prestebakke on 10 June, Huitfeldt managed to confuse the Swedish officers with a maneuver that surprised and routed the Swedish forces at Prestebakke. The Swedish casualties totaled 60 dead and severely wounded, and 395 captured (of which 34 were wounded), and two guns. The Swedish force of approximately 420 men were wiped out and a smaller force of about 150 men surrendered at Berby. The Norwegian losses were low with only around 12 casualties. In Sweden, there was a severe reaction to this surprising defeat, and the Swedish commander, Lieutenant Colonel von Knorring, was court-martialed.Angell 1914, pp. 143-144 After the Swedes had received reinforcements, they counter-attacked against the positions at Prestebakke on 14 June to reconcile their former positions. The main Norwegian force had moved back to Fredriksten fortress with a large number of Swedish prisoners of war, so the outnumbered Norwegian outposts at Prestebakke, Ende and Gjeddelund were driven back after a short battle. But the Swedes left their positions and went back across the border between the 20‚Äì24 June, and the Norwegian forces were quick to secure the border areas and to set up border guards. This meant that there were no longer any Swedish troops on Norwegian soil. =Raids and minor campaigns= In the period up to December there were several minor offensives from both the Norwegian and the Swedish side, but these were of little significance to the war. For the Norwegian troops stationed in the north of Kongsvinger and at Matrand there was a prolonged period of constant surveillance, in addition to boredom and poor conditions in the sparsely populated Eidskog with minimal settlement and little food. Many of the soldiers had to live in huts made of pine needles and bark for the rest of the summer and into the autumn. Norwegian raids against civilians on the Swedish side of the border were prohibited. If a Norwegian soldier brought back stolen goods from an attack, they were returned. Officers on both sides were very concerned that their soldiers should behave well towards the civilian population, but the border was sparsely populated and the sparse food supply was quickly used by the military. Poor accommodation, lack of supplies and a scarcity of food began to have a demoralising and debilitating effect on the troops on both sides of the border. Attack into Eda and J√§mtland Staffeldt, who had been promoted to Major General on 30 June, had kept his troops on the border in Eidskog until early in July, when they were ordered to advance across the border and carry out minor attacks in several places. A column of four companies was sent forward to Morast, another column of two companies to Magnor and a third column of three companies with Major Frederik Wilhelm Stabell to the area south to Vestmarka. Stabell's group continued on from there to Sweden on 18 July, and advanced to the Swedish positions at Adolfsfors. The troops stayed on the Swedish side of the border for two days, before they retreated across the border and back to Matrand. In August 1808, 644 Norwegian troops from Tr√∏ndelag under the commande of Major Coldevin advanced with artillery and mounted dragoons across the border from Verdal and Mer√•ker into J√§mtland in the J√§mtland Campaign of 1808. Staffeldt also sent troops to Falun in order to support the Norwegian invasion of J√§mtland and a force of 200 men advanced to Midtskogen on 10 August. These troops marched from there to Dalby in Sweden, and returned to Balteb√∏l on 20 August since they could not find any Swedish troops in the area, apart from the border guard at Midtskogen. The main Norwegian offensive into Jemtland was stopped at the entrenchment at J√§rpen on 15 August and, after two days, Major Coldevin chose to cancel the offensive because the Swedish troops had reinforced the stronghold at J√§rpen. The campaign ended on 19 August.Angell 1914, pp. 156‚Äì157 =Ceasefire= The British blockade of Norway had gradually worsened the situation for the Norwegians, and the few supplies that arrived from Denmark and northern Russia were not enough.Oppegaard 1996, p. 175 Everywhere there were food shortages, and it was impossible to replace the uniforms and other equipment that had been worn out and destroyed after several months in the field. Opportunities to carry out further offensives were also rare, and Christian August therefore decided to keep his troops at the border. Things were not much better for the Swedes in the sparsely populated border regions, since most of the supplies went to the troops fighting against the Russians in Finland. Lieutenant General Bror Cederstr√∂m had also taken over the command of the border army from Armfeldt, who had left in August as a result of his misunderstanding of the king's orders. During the autumn it came to negotiations between Christian August and the Swedes, but since it took a while to get contact with King Frederick in Denmark, Christian August had to act largely without the king's approval. He meant that he could not continue hostilities against Sweden because of the distress and lack of supplies among both the population and the soldiers in the country. So in defiance of the king's will he entered into an agreement for the armistice to the southern Norwegian front on 22 November and the Armistice Agreement came into force on 7 December 1808.Jensen 1995, pp. 353-354 It could be terminated on 48 hours notice, but was applicable for the rest of the war. Unfortunately the ceasefire agreement came too late for both the Norwegian and the Swedish army, who were both badly affected by diseases that spread from the east and into the border area, where thousands had lived in appalling conditions for several months. The southern Norwegian army, consisting of around 17,000 men, should during the fall and winter of 1808 experience that half of the soldiers would suffer from disease, and that only between April and September 700 died. In March 1809, approx. 8,700 were admitted to field hospitals, of which 1,200 died. In the Swedish army, the conditions were even worse because diseases such as typhoid and dysentery had spread from the east. The Swedish sources do not have precise information about the total number of sick people, only pieces from the various reports and records of the officers in the army. Morbidity rates had risen from 22% among the troops in September to 25% in November, and 403 Swedish soldiers died that month. King Gustav IV Adolf being arrested by the conspirators. In the winter of 1808-09 no major battles were fought. The Norwegians were lacking supplies and the Swedes were concentrated on the war in the east where the Russians now had managed to occupy the whole of Finland. At the same time dissatisfaction with the absolutist Swedish king had evolved, and there was a desire for a constitution. The Swedish still feared that the Norwegian troops on √òstlandet would take advantage of the uprising against the Swedish king, and invade Svealand or G√∂taland. So the leaders of the revolutionary Swedish forces had to ensure themselves that the Armistice Agreement of 7 December 1808 still was valid. This were ensured through the Kongsvinger Agreement in early March 1809, which was an oral agreement between the Swedish revolutionary forces and Christian August that the Norwegian troops should remain stationary at the border,Aln√¶s & Hagerud 2009, p. 13 while the Swedish forces in V√§rmland, under Lieutenant Colonel Georg Adlersparre marched to Stockholm to depose King Gustav IV. Most of the Norwegians supported the coup, and especially Christian August since he was a candidate to the Swedish throne.Christian August was also appointed Crown Prince of Sweden, but since that he died in 1810, the throne went to the French Marschal Jean-Baptiste Bernadotte On 7 March 1809, Lieutenant Colonel Adlersparre triggered the revolution by raising the flag of rebellion in Karlstad and starting to march upon Stockholm. To prevent the king from joining loyal troops in Scania, seven of the conspirators led by Carl Johan Adlercreutz broke into the royal apartments in the palace on 13 March, seized the king, and imprisoned him and his family in Gripsholm castle. Gustav IV Adolf's uncle, the old, weak and childless Charles XIII, was elected King of Sweden on 5 June, and the next day an assembly of nobles, clergy, bourgeoisie and peasants, passed a constitution. =Fighting in J√§mtland= Christian August was very reluctant in the spring and summer of 1809 to make any Norwegian attack against Sweden, but he was eventually pushed to it by King Frederik VI. On 2 July Christian August ordered an attack against J√§mtland from Trondheim, and on 10 July a force of 1,800 men, under the leadership of Major General Georg Frederik von Krogh, marched across the border to J√§mtland.Angell 1914, p. 169 To stop the Norwegian advance, Georg Carl von D√∂beln was sent out with a battalion of the H√§lsinge Regiment to Jemtland, at the same time an additional battalion from G√§vle was sent off against H√§rjedalen and reinforcements later arrived from the Life Grenadier Regiment and the Kalmar Regiment.Nordensvan 1898, p. 458-59 However, on July 16 the advancing Norwegian army captured the Hj√§rpe entrenchment which just had been abandoned by a Swedish force of 200 men under Colonel Theodore Nordenadler. Soon afterwards the Norwegians also captured the villages of M√∂rsil and Mattmar. But when a rumor that Sweden and Russia had started peace negotiations reached the Norwegian army, von Krogh chose to retreat and instead direct his attack against H√§rjedalen. On July 24, the Swedish force of 900 men under von D√∂beln and the 1,800 Norwegian soldiers met at H√§rjedalen, the Norwegians force was defeated and had to retreat. An armistice was written the following day at Bleck√•sen in Alsens.Jensen 1995, p. 355 One condition was that all the Norwegian troops would leave Sweden by 3 August, which also happened. Aftermath In Norway, the situation steadily worsened due to the British blockade and since they no longer received supplies from northern Russia, after the Russians had made peace with the Swedes on September 17. Sweden's two-front war had also shown to be disastrous for the population and especially the soldiers stationed along the border, due to disease and lack of supplies. It was therefore a desire for peace from both sides, and negotiations began in November. =Treaty of J√∂nk√∂ping= On December 10, 1809 Nils Rosenkrantz and the Swedish Minister Carl Gustaf Adlerberg met in J√∂nk√∂ping to sign the peace treaty between Denmark‚ÄìNorway and Sweden,Angell 1914, p. 170 which ended the Dano-Swedish War of 1808‚Äì1809. Treaty implied the following: *No country cedes any territory (status quo) *Sweden tries to keep the British warships in the distance from the Swedish coast *Renegades and criminals were to be extradited But Denmark‚ÄìNorway were still at war with the United Kingdom, and even if Sweden were to make peace with Napoleon in 1810, they were still going to be on the side of the Coalition during the War of the Sixth Coalition. This would further lead to the fact that Norway was ceded to the King of Sweden by the Treaty of Kiel in 1814.

The ship was launched in July 1818 and towed from Corlear's Hook in East River to the Hudson River to continue work there. It was officially registered on the Register of Ships on 30 July 1818, with build number 203, under the ownership of American captain Paul Delano, in order to prevent confiscation under U.S. neutrality laws. The ship, still unarmed, set sail for Buenos Aires on 9 September, together with Horatio (under Captain Joseph Skinner), built in the Adam and Noah Brown shipyard under the same circumstances, and with Sachem following with their respective war materiel. Chilean career In Buenos Aires Curacio set sail for Valpara√≠so, where she arrived on 23 June 1819 to be renamed Independencia and commissioned to the First Chilean Navy Squadron under the command of Captain Carlos F. Foster (also Robert Forster) and up to 1821 Wilkinson. She was flagship of Thomas Cochrane's expedition to California in 1821. On the way she, together with Araucano, captured the Spanish brigantine corsario San Francisco Javier. She ran aground near El Realejo without heavy losses. In summer 1822/23 she was refitted in Valpara√≠so and participated in the blockade of Chilo√©.

It can be found in the Mediterranean, North Africa, Central Europe Fauna europaea eastward to Korea, north of China and Siberia. It is not present in the north- west of Europe and in the Britain Islands.ITIS Habitat These bugs inhabit dry biotopes with sufficient sun exposure, especially calcareous grasslands, rocky heaths, south-facing slopes or forest edges. Description Male, lateral view Adults of Phymata crassipes can reach a length of about 7‚Äì9 mm. The body appear ornamented with some extrusions. Their triangular scutellum is shorter than a pronotum without prominent tubercles. They possess functional wings. They have clubbed antennae and enlarged fore femora and abdomen. The edge of the abdomen expands beyond the edges of the wings. Beautifully camouflaged, they capture their prey using their raptorial fore legs.Natur-in- nrw.de The basic body color is dark reddish-brown in males, while females are lighter yellow-brown. Moreover in the males the antennae terminate with a cylindrical joint, thicker and longer than all other segments, while the females antennae are terminated by a more clavate joint, not as long as the preceding ones.J.O.Westwood Observations on the Phymatites The Transactions of the Entomological Society of London, Volume 3 This species is rather similar to Phymata monstrosa, present in South West Europe, that shows small bumps on the femora of the median and hind legs. Biology This species overwinters as imago or in the larval stage. The overwintering bugs can be found and mate in early spring and the females lay their eggs on plant stems. The larvae can be found in early June. The new adult generation will appear in July. Males, females and larvae when disturbed can produce low-frequency sounds, which can not be heard by humans.Sakis Drosopoulos, Michael F. Claridge Insect Sounds and Communication: Physiology, Behaviour, Ecology, and Evolution Both adults and nymphs are predators, by means of their front legs modified to raptor appendages. They usually wait motionless on flowers for their preys, which consist of various insects, other arthropods and spider species. The prey can also be significantly larger than themselves, and bees, for example, can be successfully hunted.

Later local opposition to licenses turned to open \\"warfare\\" in the \\"oyster wars\\" when a fleet of state vessels fought \\"oyster pirates\\" in armed conflicts. That force became the Maryland State Fishery Force under the Conservation Commission of Maryland with which the schooner served when the entire force, boats and men, became a part of the U.S. Naval Reserve in an agreement between the state and the Navy in 1917. Julia Hamilton continued to patrol the usual waters enforcing conservation law as well as federal law under the agreement. After the war the state modernized its force selling the older sailing vessels to be replaced by purpose built motor boats. The force was one of the elements forming today's Maryland Department of Natural Resources Police. Maryland State Oyster Police Force (‚ÄúOyster Navy‚Äù) schooners, ca. 1918. State police boat Oyster pirates in 1884. Part of the Library of Congress notation is \\"Ships Julia Hamilton\\" though the drawing features \\"pirate\\" night dredgers. The background of the schooner is not clear but Julia Hamilton was definitely in commission as an Oyster Police Force boat when featured in a Harper's Weekly, March 1, 1884, illustration of oyster pirates \\"attaching the police schooner Julia Hamilton\\" related to one of the incidents of the oyster war. In February 1884 some hundred oyster pirates in some twenty vessels were at work dredging illegally when challenged by Captain John Insley of Julia Hamilton. They opened fire cutting the schooner's rigging to pieces and driving the police below decks even though the police had responded with the schooner's six pounder gun. The pirates boarded the schooner but called a truce when one of the pirates was killed. Captain Insley agreed to withdraw, resulting in accusations of cowardice after he refused to engage the pirates again. Local citizens appealed to Governor Robert McLane with the result the steamer William T. Hamilton was armed and Julia Hamilton reequipped and armed and directed to protect the oyster beds. Engagement in the oyster war on the Chesapeake, 1886. Unidentified but possibly Governor R. M. McLane. Engagements in the oyster wars continued with the state forces augmented for enforcement. In 1888 Julia Hamilton found pirates on oyster beds on a foggy morning with Captain Tyler ordering them off. They left in the fog but returned whereupon the police schooner attacked them resulting in several hours engagement with over 600 shots fired by police aboard Julia Hamilton. The pirates were routed, one being shot through an arm and boats riddled. State forces were reinforced by the police steamer and five dredging schooners were captured, though their captains escaped, and towed into Cambridge, Maryland. The earliest death of a Maryland conservation officer was on 17 September 1893 when Josiah Bromwell, a mate aboard Julia Hamilton, was swept overboard in rough waters of the Little Choptank River to drown. World War I dual service The Navy approached the Conservation Commission shortly after the nation's entry into World War I proposing the Commission's boats be used to maintain constant local patrols. The state legislature agreed that the boats and men of the state force would become part of the U.S. Naval Reserve providing they patrol the same districts for fisheries enforcement as well as federal interests with the benefit that patrol time would be increased and the expense for all be paid by the federal government. The Maryland State Fishery Force boats began operating under a contract in which they were under a free lease to the United States Navy in August 1917, serving as Squadron Number 8 of the 5th Naval District, patrolling their regular areas enforcing state conservation law and federal laws. They were under the command of a Conservation Commission member who was also a Lieutenant in the Navy with all expenses, wages, supplies and repairs paid by the federal government. The schooner entered service, there is no indication of commissioned status, with the Section Patrol designation (SP-1460). The Conservation Commission assumed full responsibility when the Navy released all the vessels and men on 28 March 1918.DANFS uses ID-1460, but type of service was definitely \\"patrol\\" rather than that of the usual ID vessels. Retirement and sale The Commission began replacing its older sailing vessels with new power boats in 1918. Two new boats, Kent and Talbot were acquired with Severn being purchased. The schooners Julia Hamilton, Helen Baughman, Bessie Jones, and Anna B. Smith were retired and sold along with the motorized, converted schooner, Daisy Archer. Julia Hamilton was sold for $350.00.
