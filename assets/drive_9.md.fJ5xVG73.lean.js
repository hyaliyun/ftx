Typically, first place will win about half of the prize pool, with the remainder divided on a sliding scale to second, third, and sometimes fourth place. There may even be some money given to last place, considering the random nature of a sweep. Office sweeps are exceptionally popular in Australia for the Melbourne Cup, and as a social event the sweep becomes the focus of the day's festivities. Daily newspapers such as The Age or Herald Sun include full colour lift-outs with images of each horse which can be cut up and used as tickets, as well as instructions on running the sweep, and space to record the names of who has each ticket. In New Zealand office based sweeps are equally popular. Similarly to in Australia, major news such as the New Zealand Herald include full page sweeps pull outs.

MSHS was recently awarded the Blue Ribbon Lighthouse Award for Excellence.  Academics  Based on the Alabama Reading and Math Test scores, the system has consistently placed among the top 10 school districts in one or more areas in most grade levels. Another tradition is the parental support of the school's programs with a majority of the parents being involved in one or more programs throughout the year. Still, another tradition is the large number of students who pursue post-secondary educational programs each year. It is not uncommon for this number to be at or above 90%.Muscle Shoals Board of Education Band The Muscle Shoals High School band program was founded in 1965 by Charles Stratford, graduate of Louisiana State University. The marching band has received Superior ratings every year since 1966, along with dozens of First Place, Best in Class, and Grand Champion awards. In 2001, they traveled to Atlanta, Georgia to be the first band from Alabama to compete in Bands of America (BOA). Since then, the band has been Class A Champions in Atlanta four times (2002, 2003, 2004, 2005). At the Alabama Bandmasters Association State Festival, the Muscle Shoals High School Symphonic Band has earned Superiors for the past 13 consecutive years. In 2005, the band traveled to Orlando, Florida to compete in the All-Star Music Festival. There they were awarded Grand Champions in Parade Band, Concert Band, Concert Percussion, and Jazz Band. In 2009, they returned to the Orlando All-Star Music Festival to receive once again the Grand Champion title in Concert Band, Concert Percussion, and Jazz Band. During the 2007‚Äì08 season, the marching band won the Grand Champion trophy at the Dixie Pride Marching Classic and the Vanderbilt Marching Invitational and won 3rd Place in Class A at the Bands of America Atlanta Super Regional. In 2012 the band lost two of their directors, Terry Ownby and Pat Stegall. Terry resigned to take the band directors position at Wallace State and Pat retired and took a position at the University of North Alabama. However, they hired two new directors. Will Campbell and Nathan Haskew became part of the family of music at MSHS. The marching band was awarded two Grand Champion awards and 3rd place in The Heart of Dixie competition with their show \\"The Piano Lesson\\". The concert band made superior ratings at MPAs and went to Disney World to compete. They also were delighted to have the opportunity to rename the MSHS auditorium in honor of former band director Charles R. Stratford at their Spring Concert. =Percussion= The Muscle Shoals High School Drumline has earned the reputation as one of the finest programs in Alabama and the Southeast. They consistently earn Superior Ratings, 1st Place, and Grand Champion awards. In 2008, after many years of in-state competition, they enrolled in various Winter Guard International (WGI) and Southeastern Color Guard Circuit (SCGC) events. With their show Samson & Delilah, featuring \\"Bachanalle\\", the ensemble placed 1st at the 2008 SCGC Championships in the Scholastic Concert Open class, and at the WGI World Championships they placed third in the nation in Scholastic Concert Open. In 2009, the ensemble competed again in WGI and SCGC with their show, \\"Carmen\\". They placed first in Scholastic Concert Open class, both in Winter Guard International and Southeastern Color Guard Circuit. Their 2010 show was entitled \\"Letters From War\\". They were awarded the silver medal at the Scholastic Concert World Class WGI Competition and first in the SCGC. In 2013 their show was called \\"School for Scandal\\". They placed second at WGI and competed in Disney as well.

The original work was published in 1998 by Karl-Dietrich Neubert.  Concept  The basic idea behind flashsort is that in a data set with a known distribution, it is easy to immediately estimate where an element should be placed after sorting when the range of the set is known. For example, if given a uniform data set where the minimum is 1 and the maximum is 100 and 50 is an element of the set, it's reasonable to guess that 50 would be near the middle of the set after it is sorted. This approximate location is called a class. If numbered 1 to m, the class of an item A_i is the quantile, computed as: K(A_i) = 1+\\\\textrm{INT}\\\\left((m-1)\\\\frac{A_i- A_\\\\textrm{min}}{A_\\\\textrm{max}-A_\\\\textrm{min}}\\\\right) where A is the input set. The range covered by every class is equal, except the last class which includes only the maximum(s). The classification ensures that every element in a class is greater than any element in a lower class. This partially orders the data and reduces the number of inversions. Insertion sort is then applied to the classified set. As long as the data is uniformly distributed, class sizes will be consistent and insertion sort will be computationally efficient.  Memory efficient implementation  To execute flashsort with its low memory benefits, the algorithm does not use additional data structures to store the classes. Instead it stores the upper bounds of each class on the input array A in an auxiliary vector L. These upper bounds are obtained by counting the number of elements in each class, and the upper bound of a class is the number of elements in that class and every class before it. These bounds serve as pointers into the classes. Classification is implemented through a series of cycles, where a cycle-leader is taken from the input array A and its class is calculated. The pointers in vector L are used to insert the cycle-leader into the correct class, and the class's pointer in L is decremented after each insertion. Inserting the cycle-leader will evict another element from array A, which will be classified and inserted into another location and so on. The cycle terminates when an element is inserted into the cycle-leader's starting location. An element is a valid cycle-leader if it has not yet been classified. As the algorithm iterates on array A, previously classified elements are skipped and unclassified elements are used to initiate new cycles. It is possible to discern whether an element has been classified or not without using additional tags: An element has been classified if and only if its index is greater than the class's pointer value in L. To prove this, consider the current index of array A the algorithm is processing. Let this index be i. Elements A_0 through A_\\\\textrm{i-1} have already been classified and inserted into the correct class. Suppose that i is greater than the current pointer to A_i‚Äôs class. Now suppose that the A_i is unclassified and could be legally inserted into the index indicated by its class pointer, which would replace a classified element in another class. This is impossible since the initial pointers of each class are their upper bounds, which ensures that the exact needed amount of space is allocated for each class on the array A. Therefore, every element in A_i‚Äôs class, including A_i itself, has already been classified. Also, if an element has already been classified, the class's pointer would have been decremented below the element's new index.  Performance  The only extra memory requirements are the auxiliary vector L for storing class bounds and the constant number of other variables used. In the ideal case of a balanced data set, each class will be approximately the same size, and sorting an individual class by itself has complexity O(1). If the number m of classes is proportional to the input set size n, the running time of the final insertion sort is m \\\\cdot O(1) = O(m) = O(n). In the worst- case scenarios where almost all the elements are in a few or one class, the complexity of the algorithm as a whole is limited by the performance of the final-step sorting method. For insertion sort, this is O(n^2). Variations of the algorithm improve worst-case performance by using better-performing sorts such as quicksort or recursive flashsort on classes that exceed a certain size limit. Choosing a value for m, the number of classes, trades off time spent classifying elements (high m) and time spent in the final insertion sort step (low m). Based on his research, Neubert found m=0.42n to be optimal. Memory- wise, flashsort avoids the overhead needed to store classes in the very similar bucketsort. For m=0.1n with uniform random data, flashsort is faster than heapsort for all n and faster than quicksort for n>80. It becomes about as twice as fast as quicksort at n=10000. Due to the in situ permutation that flashsort performs in its classification process, flashsort is not stable. If stability is required, it is possible to use a second, temporary, array so elements can be classified sequentially. However, in this case, the algorithm will require O(n) space.

They go on international tours every two to three years with the most recent tour to Europe in which the band competed in WMC kerkrade, Netherlands Members The Band draws from 90-120 of Central Alberta's most ambitious young musicians to come together annually to create this community based marching show band. The Royals have members aged as young as 11 all the way up to 21 and they currently represent 20 School Band programs from the Central Alberta region. The members travel from many cities of Central Alberta, some as far south as Carstairs, Alberta, as far north as Edmonton, Alberta, as far west as Rocky Mountain House, and as far east as Stettler, Alberta. The band is composed of four groups; woodwinds, brass, percussion, and colour guard. Concert Season From September to March, the Red Deer Royals perform as a concert band, performing at many different venues. They play for Remembrance Day ceremonies, Christmas festivals, and various events around Red Deer. During the concert season, the band is conducted by Michael Mann. Each year there is a concert master and assistant concert master selected to direct the band for a song. Parade Season Starting in May the Red Deer Royals perform in parades throughout Central Alberta. Some of the locations of their parades are smaller rural communities such as Blackfalds, Sylvan Lake and Rocky Mountain House, but are also involved in the parades in the larger cities including Calgary, Edmonton, and (of course) Red Deer. In most of the smaller parades they are the only marching band performing; but larger and more advertised parades, such as the Calgary Stampede Parade, attract bands from across Canada, the continental U.S., and sometimes are honored to welcome performances from other bands and groups from overseas. The Red Deer Royals spend a great deal of time rehearsing their parade songs, incorporating actions into some of their songs, to be used in competition. Recent Awards At the 2008 Calgary Stampede Parade, the Red Deer Royals won the following awards: Best Canadian Band, Best Senior Band, and Best Overall Band, as well as third place for Best Auxiliary., Calgary Stampede Website. At the 2008 and the 2009 Edmonton Capital Ex Parade, the Royals were judged as the best marching band and were also the musical Grand Champions, winning the Sig Hansen Musical Award., Capital Ex Website.

It has found numerous applications in various fields, including within medicinal and various sensing communities. History When first reported by Barker in 1957,Barker, G. C., Congress on Analytical Chemistry in Industry, St Andrews, June 1957. the working electrode utilized was primarily a dropping mercury electrode (DME). When using a DME, the surface area of the mercury drop is constantly changing throughout the course of the experiment; for this reason, complex mathematical modeling was at times required in order to analyze collected electrochemical data. The squarewave voltammetric technique allowed for the collection of the desired electrochemical data within one mercury drop, meaning that the need for mathematical modeling to account for the changing working electrode surface area was no longer needed. In short, the introduction and development of this technique allowed for the rapid collection of reliable and easily reproducible electrochemical data using DME or SDME working electrodes. With continued improvements from many electrochemists (particularly the Osteryoungs), SWV is now one of the primary voltammetric techniques available on modern potentiostats.F. Scholz (Ed.). Electroanalytical Methods: Guide to Experiments and Applications.  Theory  In a squarewave voltammetric experiment, the current at a (usually stationary) working electrode is measured while the potential between the working electrode and a reference electrode is swept linearly in time. The potential waveform can be viewed as a superposition of a regular squarewave onto an underlying staircase (see figure above); in this sense, SWV can be considered a modification of staircase voltammetry. The current is sampled at two times - once at the end of the forward potential pulse and again at the end of the reverse potential pulse (in both cases immediately before the potential direction is reversed). As a result of this current sampling technique, the contribution to the current signal resulting from capacitive (sometimes referred to as non-faradaic or charging) current is minimal. As a result of having current sampling at two different instances per squarewave cycle, two current waveforms are collected - both have diagnostic value, and are therefore preserved. When viewed in isolation, the forward and reverse current waveforms mimic the appearance of a cyclic voltammogram (which corresponds to the anodic or cathodic halves, however, is dependent upon experimental conditions). Despite both the forward and reverse current waveforms having diagnostic worth, it is almost always the case in SWV for the potentiostat software to plot a differential current waveform derived by subtracting the reverse current waveform from the forward current waveform. This differential curve is then plotted against the applied potential. Peaks in the differential current vs. applied potential plot are indicative of redox processes, and the magnitudes of the peaks in this plot are proportional to the concentrations of the various redox active species according to: \\\\Delta i_p=\\\\frac{nFAD_0^{1/2}C_0^*}{(\\\\pi t_p)^{1/2}}\\\\Delta \\\\Psi_p where Œîip is the differential current peak value, A is the surface area of the electrode, C0* is the concentration of the species, D0 is the diffusivity of the species, tp is the pulse width, and ŒîŒ®p is a dimensionless parameter which gauges the peak height in SWV relative to the limiting response in normal pulse voltammetry.Bard, A.J. and L.R. Faulkner. Electrochemical Methods: Fundamentals and Applications. 2nd Ed, 2001. = Renewal of diffusion layer = It is important to note that in squarewave volammetric analyses, the diffusion layer is not renewed between potential cycles. Thus, it is not possible/accurate to view each cycle in isolation; the conditions present for each cycle is a complex diffusion layer which has evolved through all prior potential cycles. The conditions for a particular cycle are also a function of electrode kinetics, along with other electrochemical considerations.  Applications  Because of the minimal contributions from non-faradaic currents, the use of a differential current plot instead of separate forward and reverse current plots, and significant time evolution between potential reversal and current sampling, high sensitivity screening can be obtained utilizing SWV. For this reason, squarewave voltammetry has been utilized in numerous electrochemical measurements and can be viewed as an improvement to other electroanalytical techniques. For instance, SWV suppressed background currents much more effectively than cyclic voltammetry - for this reason, analyte concentrations on the nanomolar scale can be registered utilizing SWV over CV. SWV analysis has been used recently in the development of a voltammetric catechol sensor,Mersal, G. Int. J. Electrochem. Sci. 4(2009), 1167-1177. in the analysis of a large number of pharmaceuticals,Dogan-Topal, B. et al.

Sensors and Actuators B. 133(2008), 509-515. In addition to being utilized in independent analyses, SWV has also been coupled with other analytical techniques, including but not limited to thin-layer chromatography (TLC)Petrovic SC, Dewald HD.

The analogy of physical light is used as a way of describing metaphysical Divine emanations. Shefa (\\"Flow\\" and its derivative, Hashpoah \\"Influence\\" ) is sometimes alternatively used in Kabbalah, a term also used in Medieval Jewish philosophy to mean Divine influence, while the Kabbalists favour Ohr because its numerical value equals Raz (\\"mystery\\").\\"Let there be Light\\" (Genesis 1:3) becoming \\"Let there be Mystery/Concealment\\", \\"for Raz and Ohr are one thing\\" - Zohar 1:140a and Zohar Hadash Genesis:8d. Quoted with further citations in Mystical Concepts in Chassidism, Jacob Immanuel Schochet, Kehot publications, chapter 1. Book also printed as appendix supplement in Bilingual English Tanya, Kehot pub. It is one of the two main metaphors in Kabbalah for understanding Divinity, along with the other metaphor of the human soul-body relationship for the Sephirot.Mystical Concepts in Chassidism, Kehot pub., chapter 1 \\"Anthropomorphism and Metaphors\\": (i Anthropomorphism, ii The Man-Metaphor, iii The Light-Metaphor) The metaphorical description of spiritual Divine creative-flow, using the term for physical \\"light\\" perceived with the eye, arises from analogous similarities. These include the intangible physicality of light, the delight it inspires and the illumination it gives, its apparently immediate transmission and constant connection with its source. Light can be veiled (\\"Tzimtzum\\"-constrictions in Kabbalah) and reflected (\\"an ascending light from the Creations\\" in Kabbalah). White light divides into 7 colours, yet this plurality unites from one source. Divine light divides into the 7 emotional Sephirot, but there is no plurality in the Divine essence. The term Ohr in Kabbalah is contrasted with Ma'ohr, the \\"luminary\\", and Kli, the spiritual \\"vessel\\" for the light. As a metaphor it also has its limitations. Divinity can only be understood from analogous comparisons to the spatial and temporal phenomena we understand. Once these images are grasped, Kabbalah stresses the need to then attempt to transcend them by understanding their deficiencies. Among the limitations of the central metaphor of \\"light\\" are the physical inability of the luminary to withhold its radiance, the fulfilment of purpose the light gives the luminary, and the categorical differentiation between the source and its light. For God, the Creation metaphorically \\"arose in the Divine Will\\"The expression in the Tanya. and was not impelled. The emanation of Creation fills no lack in the perfection of God.According to Isaac Luria the reason for the Creation was in order for the Sephirot to be fulfilled. God's attributes of Kindness, Judgement, Mercy and so forth, could only be manifested in their fulfillment by being experienced by the Creation. Nonetheless, this is not an absolute reason for Creation, as the Sephirot bring no completion to the perfect Ein Sof (Divine essence). This explanation relates only to the Divine Will (Keter), which emanated the Sephirot. In Hasidic philosophy, the different mystical and philosophical Jewish explanations for the purpose of Creation are compared (such as in a systematic study by Menachem Mendel Schneersohn). The ultimate reason it gives is that \\"God desired a dwelling place in the Lower Worlds\\". According to Hasidut, this desire is rooted in the innermost dimensions of Keter, above intellect, and \\"about a desire one cannot ask questions\\". It is called a desire to imply that God did not need to enact Creation, because if He did, then there would ultimately be a reason for Creation, potentially able to be understood in intellect. The distinction between the Divine light (beginning with the Ohr Ein Sof - the primordial \\"Infinite Light\\", and subsequently the 10 Sephirot emanations) and the Divine Source (the Ein Sof \\"Infinite\\") appears only relative to Creation. From God's perspective, Scripture states \\"For I, the Eternal, I have not changed\\".Malachi 3:6. From the perspective of God's self- knowledge, the emanations remain completely united and nullified to their source. This answers early Rabbinic criticism of dualism in Kabbalah. The term in Kabbalah and Hasidic philosophy for this nullification is Bittul. In daily spiritual life (Dveikus) it inspires the mystical humility of nullification of the ego. The Ohr Ein Sof - The Infinite Light The Ein Sof (literally: \\"Without End\\"/Limitless/Infinite) is the Kabbalistic term for the Divine essence. Kabbalah describes 10 Sephirot (The 10 Divine emanations or attributes), that reveal the unknowable Godhead to the creations and channel the creative life-force to all levels of existence. However, these 10 attributes of God do not represent the Divine essence. The Kabbalists differentiated between the manifestations of God (forms of \\"light\\"), and their origin in the Divine essence (the \\"Luminary\\"). This difference overcame the criticism that they were introducing plurality into the pure Monotheism of Judaism. Kabbalistic texts take great care to emphasise this difference, and warn against anthropomorphising the subtle descriptions of Kabbalah in human terms. To avoid such heresies, the historical transmission of Kabbalah was traditionally restricted to direct teaching in close circles. As well as the 10 \\"lights\\" of God encapsulated in the Sephirot, Kabbalah also describes a more primordial light that shines from the Ein Sof (Infinite) itself. This light, the origin of all Creation, and all lower lights, is called the \\"Ohr Ein Sof\\" (\\"The light of the Infinite\\", or alternatively, itself \\"The Infinite Light\\"). The Kabbalistic and Hasidic masters ask the question of how there can be a revelation of God, in the Ohr Ein Sof, before Creation. Surely, there can be \\"no king without a people\\". Before Creation, there could be no being to behold a revelation of Divine light. The Ohr Ein Sof is a form of Divine self- knowledge, and through God knowing Himself, He created everything, with its subsequent historical unfolding, and its ultimate purpose in the innermost Divine Will. Tzimtzum ‚Äì Restrictions of Divine Light As the Ohr Ein Sof is itself infinite, it could not itself directly be the source for the creation of Worlds (Four Worlds and Seder hishtalshelus). Any direct creations of the Infinite Light would be of infinite number, and would not be actual creations at all, as they would remain totally nullified (\\"bittul\\") to the Infinite Light, and would have no independent self-awareness. Rather it is only through the restrictions of the Sephirot and the descending \\"Chain of Progression\\" (Seder hishtalshelus), that the Worlds could unfold. In the descending chain of Worlds from the Infinite to our finite realm, the creative flow of Divine light encapsulated in the Sephirot, undergoes countless restrictions, diminutions and veilings, to progressively hide Divinity. In Kabbalah these are called \\"Tzimtzum\\" (\\"Constrictions\\" - plural \\"tzimtzumim\\"). However, after the new teachings and doctrines of Isaac Luria (The \\"Arizal\\"), in Lurianic Kabbalah, these innumerable Tzimtzumim of the descending chain of Worlds are called the \\"Second Tzimtzum\\". Isaac Luria taught the new concept of a \\"First Tzimtzum\\", based on earlier allusions in the Zohar. As Lurianic Kabbalah became almost universally accepted in the Jewish development of Kabbalah, nowadays if the term Tzimtzum is used without qualification, it will invariably refer to the first, cosmic, ultimate Constriction taught by Luria (see Tzimtzum). In this radical concept of the \\"Ari\\", at the beginning of Creation the Divine \\"withdrew\\" (a complete tzimtzum) from a \\"Chalal\\" (\\"Vacated space\\"), to allow Creation to take place. The interpretation of this forms a central concern of subsequent Kabbalah (see Tzimtzum), and the \\"withdrawal\\" of God is interpreted only as a concealment from the perspective of the Creation, and only to apply to His light, not His Essence, as that would imply heretical limitations to the Divine. In Lurianic Kabbalah, the Tzimtzum concealed the Ohr Ein Sof, which resolved the dichotomy between the Infinite Light and the possibility of creating finite Worlds. Without this radical leap of a concealment of the Ohr Ein Sof, even with the progressive, gradual concealments of the Chain of Worlds, the problem would not properly be overcome. Only a second, new light, immeasurably diminished, and of a different quality than the Ohr Ein Sof, could become the creative source of all reality. This new light, a \\"thin\\" illumination from the Ohr Ein Sof, called the \\"Kav\\" (\\"Ray\\"), shone into the \\"Vacated Space\\", and was a light that was adapted to the perspective of the subsequent creations on their own terms. It could relate to finite creation (Divine immanence), rather than the infinite Primordial light (the ultimate Divine transcendence). Interpretations of this in Kabbalah and Hasidic philosophy, are careful to avoid literal, spatial, geometric understandings of the Vacated Space and the Kav, as such dimensional understandings relate only to our physical world. Nonetheless, circular diagram representations of this, strictly metaphorical, are used in Kabbalah to represent the process. In the first, a black circle is broken only by one thin, vertical, straight line that descends from the surrounding white into the centre of the black circle from the top. Here the surrounding white represents the Ein Sof, the black circle represents the Chalal vacated \\"space\\", and the thin white line represents the \\"thin\\" illumination of the Kav, derived from the Ohr Ein Sof, but able to illuminate into the Chalal on its own terms. Metaphorical representation of the Five Worlds with the 10 Sephirot in each, as successively smaller concentric circles, derived from the light of the Kav after the Tzimtzum This representation is then augmented by a second, similar diagram, where the successive, unfolding Five Worlds, each with 10 successive Sephirot, are shown within the original circle as a series of concentric circles. The descending chain of Worlds proceeds in the diagram towards the centre of the circle, representing our lowest, physical realm. Each successive World and Sephirah is a successively smaller concentric circle, representing diminished, more constricted Divinity. The same Kav line is still shown connecting the outer Ein Sof to the centre of the circle, as the light of the Kav is the origin of all Creation after the Tzimtzum, though its light undergoes innumerable second tzimtzumim, toward the circle's centre. The utilisation here of concentric circles, or spheres is also significant, as with each subsequent lower step, the light encompasses\\" (sovev - \\"surrounds\\") that level of \\"immanent\\" (mimalei\\"-\\"filled\\") creation. Each of the Sephirot comprises both an encompassing light vested in its immanent vessel. Each World similarly incorporates its own relative level of Divine transcendence, illuminating its own level of Divine immanence. In the 10 Sefirot: Ohrot and Keilim - Lights and Vessels The 10 Sephirot describe the emanations, or attributes of God in Kabbalah. The Ein Sof (\\"Limitless\\") is the unknowable, undifferentiated, infinite Divine essence. The 10 emanations of the Sephirot enable the Creation to know God, and become God's attributes that reveal Divinity. They are also the channels through which all of Creation is continuously substained from nothing, as in the Kabbalistic scheme, Creation is continuous and God is the only true existence. A \\"Chain of Progression\\" (Seder hishtalshelus) of descending \\"Worlds\\", including the Four Worlds, links the Ein Sof with our physical realm. Each of the Sephirot is said to consist of a \\"light\\" (an ohr) that is vested in a \\"vessel\\" (a kli ; plural: keilim ). Generally speaking, the light is simple and undifferentiated, as it stems originally from the Ohr Ein Sof (\\"The Light of the Ein Sof\\"), God's infinite light. It represents Divine revelation in the world. It is associated with the Kabbalistic Divine Name of Ban. The differentiation between the 10 Sephirot, each with its own particular characteristic, arises from each of their different spiritual vessels. The light adapts itself to each vessel, to express the particular nature of each vessel. Kabbalists read their mystical teachings into exegetical interpretations of Scripture and Rabbinic literature. This arose from their belief that Kabbalah forms part of the Oral Torah inherent in the revelation at Mount Sinai. Accordingly, in Jewish tradition, each verse and concept can be interpreted in the fourfold Jewish method of Pardes, with the metaphysical interpretations of Kabbalah and Hasidic philosophy forming the Sod (secret) level of meaning. In this way, Kabbalah interprets a second meaning in Talmudic legislation and use of the term for \\"vessel\\" (\\"kli\\"). In the Halachic sense a vessel is an object that can serve a useful purpose, even if it may not resemble a physical receptacle. This term is used frequently in discussion of the laws of Shabbat. In Jewish mysticism, typically, these narratives are given metaphysical interpretations, which relate \\"kli\\" to its Kabbalistic meaning. In Hasidic philosophy, the plural fourfold levels of meaning are viewed as uniting in a higher essential source of explanation that describes Divinity. Jewish mysticism views such alternative, spiritual interpretations of Torah as stemming from more revealed Divine realms in the Chain of Worlds. Bittul - Nullification of emanations and Creations in the Divine light =Ratzo and Shuv - Run and Return of emanations and Creations= vision in Genesis 28:12 of a ladder between Heaven and Earth. Kabbalah relates this to the chain of Worlds. Angels embody spiritual levels of enclothed ohr-light. They \\"ascend and descend\\" in ratzu- run nullification desire, and shuv-return purpose of Creation More generally, Ohr also refers to the revelation and expression of any particular spiritual level which descends from that level and enclothes itself in a vessel (Kli). This Ohr is typically in a state of \\"Bittul\\" (\\"nullification\\") vis-a-vis the level from which it stems. Therefore, even when it descends to lower realms, it possesses a characteristic of \\"Ratzo\\" (\\"Run\\"), the desire to ascend and return to its source. Correspondingly, the Kli persuades the Ohr to descend through impressing upon it the need for Shuv (\\"Return\\"), the acknowledgment of the necessity of descent in order to fulfill the ultimate supernal will. The purpose of Creation was not for the sake of the higher spiritual Worlds. In relation to the infinite Ein Sof, their great revelations of Divinity are a concealment, and have no comparison. Instead, the ultimate purpose of Creation in Kabbalah is for the sake of the lowest World, our physical realm. The Divine Will was to have a dwelling place in this World, made by man, which will be achieved in the Messianic Age.After all, the Tzaddik‚Äôs whole desire is to nullify himself to God. However, as much as that is true, the Tzaddik still accepts the responsibility of his followers, God‚Äôs nation, and therefore he rather would give himself over entirely in order to help the people (Rebbe Nachman of Breslov. Rebbe Nachman's Torah: EXODUS- LEVITICUS) In higher spiritual Worlds (Seder hishtalshelus), the souls and angels sense this, and seek to channel Divine flow down the chain of Worlds. Therefore, Shuv, even though it is an exile for the light to descend into the vessel, is the ultimate purpose of Creation. The terms \\"Ratzo\\" and \\"Shuv\\" come from the Biblical description of the angels in the vision of Ezekiel (1:4-26), when he beheld the Divine chariot (Merkavah). These angels \\"ran and returned\\". In this explanation, they desired to ascend to God, but returned down to their station, to fulfil their purpose. In daily spiritual life too, man seeks dveikus (cleaving) with God, and then returns with this inspiration to fulfil his or her tasks in the World. Here the human soul is the \\"ohr\\", the body the \\"kli\\", and this realm presently an exile for the soul. The dynamics of Ratzo and Shuv are felt by the angels and man, but also apply to any spiritual emanation. The \\"Seder Histalshelus\\" describes the continuous descending chain from the Infinite to our finite World. In each World, the 10 Sephirot shine. Each World unfolds from the previous, with the lowest Sephirah (Malchut-\\"Kingship\\"-fulfilment of the plan in reality) of one World, becoming the highest Sephirah (Keter-\\"Crown\\"-the supernal Will of the plan in that World) of the next, lower World. Within each World too, the spiritual chain descends down the 10 Sephirot, with the illumination of one giving birth to the next, lower Sephirah. =Ohr and Ma'ohr - Two levels of Nullification of the Light to the Luminary= The \\"Ohr\\" (\\"Light\\") stems from the \\"Ma'ohr\\" (\\"Luminary\\"), the source of the light. Traditionally, the Mashal (parable) given to explain this relationship, is the relationship between the sun and the light that it gives off. However, technically speaking, the light that comes from the sun is not the perfect example for the Ohr, since it has already passed through a \\"Nartik\\" (\\"Sheath/Shield\\"), a level that reduces the intensity of the revelation of the sun. In truth, the Ohr that exists in the parable of the sun is the light of the sun that exists in the sun itself. The light that we see from the sun has already been limited in its quality and therefore lacks the \\"Bittul\\" (\\"nullification\\") of the true Ohr to its origin. Rather, this Ohr, being that it has been limited by the Nartik, is called Ohr HaNartik (the light of the sheath), for although it does not actually come from the Nartik, since the Nartik limited it in such a way that it no longer possesses a connection with its ultimate source, we associate it with the Nartik. In Kabbalah, the level of the Ma'ohr is represented by the higher Hebrew name of God, the Tetragrammaton, and the Ohr is the revelation of that level. Similarly, the lower name of God, Elokim (Here the \\"h\\" has been replaced with a \\"k\\" in traditional deference to avoid writing the names of God), represents the Nartik, and the light that stems thereof is the Ohr HaNartik, and as such, it lacks a higher level of nullification, enabling it to create the Worlds. If the light of the Tetragrammaton were to create the Worlds, they would not exist as creations with independent self-awareness. The immense revelation of the Divine would nullify them in their source, as the light of the sun inside the sun itself. In the second section of the Tanya by Schneur Zalman of Liadi, the Hasidic Panentheism of the Baal Shem Tov, the founder of Hasidism, is systematically explained in philosophical terms. Two levels of Divine Unity are explained, that paradoxically are both true perspectives. From God's perspective, in comparison to the unchanging Divine Infinity, all of Creation is literally as if it did not exist (Acosmism). This is represented by a Higher Bittul-\\"Bittul Hametsiyas\\" (\\"Nullification of Essence\\") of the light of the sun inside the orb of the sun itself. This is called the \\"Upper Divine Unity\\". The \\"Lower Divine Unity\\" describes the Unity of God from the illusory self independent perspective of the Creations. From this perspective, Creation does exist, but is continuously dependent on receiving its Divine lifeforce that constantly brings it into being from nothing. In our World, this constant, total dependence for the existence of everything on the Divine creative light is hidden. In the spiritual Worlds of Creation, it is revealed, but they still lack true \\"Bittul\\" (nullification), as the souls and angels in those realms have some self-awareness, albeit totally nullified to God. This Lower Bittul-\\"Bittul Hayesh\\" (\\"Nullification of Ego\\") is represented by a light of a candle on a sunny day. In the Chain of Four Worlds, the first realm, the World of Atzilus, is not yet considered a Creation, but rather an emanation of supernal Divinity. It is characterised by the higher Nullification of Essence. The three lower realms of Beriah, Yetzirah and Asiyah are considered created realms as they only possess different levels of the lower Nullification of Ego. This explanation of the spiritual meanings of the different Hebrew names of God of the Tetragrammaton and Elokim, gives the Kabbalistic reason why the lower name \\"Elokim\\" (Divine immanence) is universally used in the Creation account in the beginning of Genesis, with the multiple phrases on each day: > \\"And God (Elokim) said, 'Let there be..'\\" In Kabbalah, going back to the Scriptural commentary of Nachmanides, the 7 Days of Creation are understood to symbolically refer to the 7 Emotional revelations of the Sefirot, each one called a \\"day\\". These Hebrew sayings themselves, are explained in Kabbalah to be the creative channels of the Sephirot in activating Creation. Only after Genesis recounts its first narrative of Creation, with the beginning of its second account, does it use the higher, essential, Divine name of the Tetragrammaton (Divine transcendence). Here it combines both names, as both are involved in Creation. Later on, when God speaks to Moses, the name of God used is only the transcendent Tetragrammaton. In the second account of Creation: > \\"This is the account of the Heavens and the Earth when they were created, > when the Lord (Tetragrammaton) God (Elokim) made the Earth and > Heavens.\\"Genesis 2:4 According to the Kabbalistic and Hasidic explanation, the ability to Create Ex nihilo (something from nothing) can only come from the Divine essence (Ein Sof), which is referred to by the Tetragrammaton. Nonetheless, the light to create existence must be constricted through the name Elokim. This process is referred to in this second account of Creation. Sovev/Makif and Mimalei/Pnimi - Surrounding/Transcendent light and Filling/Inner light duality of transcendent and immanent emanations in Heaven, becomes a paradigm in Hasidic Panentheism to describe paradoxical Divine Omnipresence in this world, expressed in worship and the Tzadik Sovev means \\"surrounding\\" and Mimalei means \\"filling\\". The geometric associations of these adjectives are metaphorical. Kabbalah describes two types of light that emanate in Creation. One, called \\"Sovev Kol Olmin\\" (\\"Surrounding All Worlds\\"), is the Divine light of transcendence, rooted in the Ohr Ein Sof (primordial \\"Infinite Light\\") before the Tzimtzum of Lurianic Kabbalah. It descends through the Seder hishtalshelut (Chain of Worlds), representing Divine transcendence in each level. It could be revealed in a blessing or miracle above the vessels and limitations of that realm. Souls in their essence transcend the body and all the Worlds. Similarly, as the Zohar states that God is totally united with his Torah, the Torah is inherently transcendent in all Worlds, and each World studies it according to their mystical level of perception. The other light, called Mimalei Kol Olmin (\\"Filling All Worlds\\") is the Divine light of immanence, rooted in the Kav (first \\"Ray\\" of light) after the Tzimtzum in Lurianic Kabbalah. This is the light that descends immanently to every level of the Chain of Worlds, itself creating every spiritual and, ultimately, physical vessel of each World. It undergoes the innumerable concealments and contractions of the second Tzimtzumim. Hasidic thought sees the ultimate advantage of this lower light, because the ultimate purpose of Creation lies in this lowest realm. Hasidism therefore rejected Jewish asceticism, seeking to utilise and mystically transform the physical into spirituality, through dveikus cleaving to God. Hasidic thought likewise describes another, higher type of miracle that is immanently invested within the physical laws of this World, without breaking them. Only a higher source rooted in the Divine essence, beyond infinite-finite duality, could unite the infinite encompassing light of Sovev within the limited invested light of Mimalei. These terms are equivalent to the parallel notions of Makif (\\"Outer\\") and Pnimi (\\"Inner\\"), taught in Hasidic philosophy. In the words of the Alter Rebbe: Hasidism relates the esoteric spiritual structures of Kabbalah to their inner dimensions in the consciousness and perception of man. This is found in the Hasidic idea of dveikus (mystical fervour). It seeks an inner response to the Jewish mystical tradition. In the Sephirot, for example, Hasidic thought focuses on the inner motivational soul within each Sephirah, and its parallel in the spiritual psychology of man. Direct/descending light and reflected/ascending light A descending light is a Divine emanation \\"from above\\". It is metaphorically called \\"masculine waters\\" and \\"an arousal from Above\\" in Kabbalah, based on the verses in Genesis 1:6-8 about the Upper and Lower Waters: > 6 And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let > it divide the waters from the waters. 7 And God made the firmament, and > divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were > above the firmament: and it was so. 8 And God called the firmament Heaven. > And the evening and the morning were the second day. The descent of masculine waters can be a free expression of the Sephirah of Hesed (Kindness), which has the essential nature to give Divine blessing in an unlimited way, without considering whether the vessels of the Creation are worthy. Hesed is counterbalanced by Gevurah (Judgement), that measures and withholds the blessing according to the worth and capacity of the vessel. More commonly, the descent of direct light is in response to the ascent from below of reflected light. This \\"arousal from below\\", the ascent of \\"feminine waters\\", is the spiritual illumination created by each person through meritorious ethical or ritual mitzvot (Jewish observances). While Kabbalah offered radical theosophical cosmic explanations of Judaism, it remained inherently conservative. The metaphysical doctrines of Kabbalah support and deepen normative Jewish observance. Kabbalah, especially the new teachings of Isaac Luria in the 16th Century, taught the cosmic power of each person to affect and rectify the Divine scheme of Creation. In Lurianic Kabbalah, the ultimate Tikkun is dependent on each individual fulfilling their own unique tasks in Creation, through the mitzvot. This affect would occur whether the person was aware of the deeper meanings or not. The great delight the illumination of the ascending feminine waters causes in the Heavenly realms (Four Worlds), leads to the reciprocal Divine response of descending blessing and light in the Masculine waters. This gives the inherent metaphysical Kabbalistic structure of the traditional Jewish belief of \\"Reward and Punishment\\", incorporated in Maimonides' Jewish Principles of Faith. The Kabbalistic explanation puts these external categories in an inner scheme of Divine loving-kindness. The Maharal Synagogue of the Baal Shem Tov Schneur Zalman of Liadi An example given in Kabbalah of the dynamics of \\"masculine\\" and \\"feminine\\" waters, is found in the yartzheit (date of passing) and birthdays of three central figures in the Jewish mystical tradition. Judah Loew ben Bezalel (the Maharal) died on the 18th day (18 means \\"Chai\\"-\\"life\\" in Gematria) of the Hebrew month of Elul in the year 1609 (17 September). The 18th of Elul, 12 days before Rosh Hashanah, is a central mystical date in the personal preparations of teshuvah (return to God) for the upcoming \\"Days of Awe\\". A central component of the teachings of the Maharal was the concept of Divine paradox, above intellect. This prepared the way for the Hasidic movement, that sought the inner expression in Hasidic philosophy of the Kabbalistic tradition. The founder of Hasidism, Israel Baal Shem Tov was born on the 18th of Elul in 1698 (August 27), and the founder of Habad intellectual expression of Hasidism, Schneur Zalman of Liadi, was born on the 18th day of Elul in 1745 (September 4). Kabbalah teaches that the yarthzeit of a Tzaddik (righteous person) causes the spiritual revelation and ascent of their life's spiritual service, the ascent of the \\"feminine waters\\" the Tzaddik illuminated. Anyone who attaches themselves to the teachings and influence of the Tzaddik receives from their illumination and blessing on the yartzheit. In the Kabbalistic scheme, this \\"arousal from below\\" elicited the \\"arousal of God from above\\" to descend \\"masculine waters\\" by the descent of the souls on this date, later on, of the Baal Shem Tov and Schneur Zalman of Liadi. Kabbalah finds an allusion to the deeper aspects of this structure, including the essence of the different spiritual teachings of these three figures, in a Scriptural verse that relates to the mystical meaning of the 18th of Elul.Related in a distributed audio lecture tape about the mystical meaning of the 18th of Elul, called \\"The Beginning of the End\\" (of the Jewish year), by Yitzchak Ginsburgh.

Drivers include Ethernet, GPIO, I¬≤C, I¬≤S, PWM, SPI, UART, USB, Watchdog timer, and Wi-Fi. *TI-RTOS Network Services: Stacks to support the TCP/IP, HTTP, and TLS/SSL protocols *TI-RTOS Interprocessor Communication: APIs to support communication between TI's embedded processors (Evolved from DSP/BIOS_Link) *TI-RTOS Instrumentation: APIs and tools for real-time performance and behavior analysis *TI-RTOS File System: APIs to support the FAT file system Licensing Most of the TI-RTOS components are released under the BSD License. Any user can rebuild the kernel using the included source code. RTOS kernel overview =Organization= The TI-RTOS KernelTI- RTOS Kernel software page on TI website is made up of a number of discrete components, called modules. Each module can provide services via an API and is individually configurable. For example, system semaphores are provided by a module called ti.sysbios.knl.Semaphore and the developer can choose whether this module is included in the runtime image or optimized out. If the module is included, the user can configure various aspects of the Semaphore module and can also configure instances of semaphores to be created as soon as the system starts up. The Semaphore module also provides an API so that semaphores can be created, posted, pended and deleted while embedded program runs. =Threading= TI-RTOS Kernel provides support for several different types of threads in an embedded system. * Hardware Interrupt (Hwi): support threads initiated by a hardware interrupt. * Software Interrupt (Swi): structured to be similar to Hwis, but allow processing to be deferred until after a hardware interrupt has completed. * Task: a discrete thread that can execute or block while waiting for an event to occur. * Idle: the lowest priority thread that only runs when no other thread is ready to execute. =Memory management= TI-RTOS Kernel provides tooling to set up an embedded system's memory map and also to allow memory buffers to be allocated and deallocated while the system runs. The type of memory manager used during runtime is actually configurable so that memory fragmentation can be minimized if necessary. =Real time debugging= TI-RTOS Kernel provides modules that allow it to provide information about how the system is executing. This includes how different threads are loading the CPU over time as well as logging events as they occur in both the system application as well as within the TI-RTOS Kernel itself. In addition, the Code Composer Studio integrated development environment can take this logged data and graphically display it for the developer.

Owned by Adelman Broadcasting, it broadcasts a hot adult contemporary format, providing music and local news and information to the Indian Wells Valley. History KZIQ-FM first signed on January 1, 1978 with a beautiful music format. Originally owned by Space/Time Broadcasting Company, it was the sister station to country-formatted KZIQ. In June 1986, Space/Time sold KZIQ-AM-FM to Bel Air Broadcasting Corporation, owned by Robert M. Rosenthal, for $335,000. Bel Air attempted to sell KZIQ-AM- FM in 1991, but the first two deals fell through. The first deal reached was in January with Michaels Media, headed by Pat Michaels, for $650,000. In March, a sale to Blessing Broadcasting valued at $682,500 also failed to close. By the end of the year, Bel Air successfully sold the combo to James Knudsen for $250,000 ‚Äî less than half of either previous deal. At the time of the sale, KZIQ-FM aired a soft adult contemporary format. On November 25, 2011, KZIQ-FM and its sister station, now called KWDJ, went silent due to a dispute over the stations' lease. Eric and Kim Kauffman operated the stations under a lease from owners Donna and James Knudsen in the hopes of eventually purchasing them. However, the Knudsens used a loophole in the agreement to retain ownership and offer terms that ultimately were unacceptable to the Kauffmans. Eric Kauffman purchased KWTY (94.5 FM, now defunct) and moved his programming there as well as online via TuneIn. KZIQ-FM returned to the air December 5, 2011 with a hot adult contemporary format. On January 7, 2013, KZIQ-FM adjusted its format to conventional adult contemporary and rebranded as \\"Q-Lite 92.7\\". That same month, the Knudsens sold KZIQ-FM and KWDJ to Adelman Broadcasting, Inc. for $220,000. The deal included a time brokerage agreement allowing Adelman to begin programming the stations immediately; the sale closed in April.

The station is owned by High Desert Broadcasting Ltd., a subsidiary of Ventura, California-based Point Broadcasting Ltd., and broadcasts a rhythmic oldies format. History The station originated in a Federal Communications Commission (FCC) construction permit granted in 1992 to KPXD at 93.5 FM, owned by Waremar Communications Inc. and licensed to Rosamond, California. When KPXD finally signed on September 1, 1993, it adopted the KLKX call letters and a classic rock format. In January 1997, Paul Dale Ware sold KLKX and AM sister station KUTY to Point Broadcasting for $1.375 million. On February 1, 2006, former WLUP-FM (Chicago) on-air personality Mark Zander joined KLKX, branded \\"93.5 The Quake\\", as programming director. Zander also produced and hosted The Rockin' '80s, a nationally syndicated rock retrospective program that was distributed by Envision Radio Networks. In August 2007, he assumed the same role for sister modern rock station KKZQ (100.1 The Edge). Zander resigned from High Desert Broadcasting on June 13, 2008, to manage his own radio content production company. On July 19, 2010, KLKX picked up the KGMX call letters from its sister station on 106.3 FM. Ten days later, on July 29, the two stations swapped call signs, with 93.5 FM becoming KQAV.

It was the fifth feature film starring the original Lassie, a collie named Pal, and the fourth and final Lassie film starring Donald Crisp. The movie is based on Eleanor Stackhouse Atkinson's 1912 novel Greyfriars Bobby which in turn is based on the true story of Greyfriars Bobby. Twelve years after starring in Challenge to Lassie, Crisp would star in another movie based on the novel, Greyfriars Bobby: The True Story of a Dog. Set in Scotland in 1860, the film tells the story of a rough collie named Lassie whose master, Jock Gray, is killed by robbers in Edinburgh. After his death, the dog keeps a constant vigil beside her master's grave in Greyfriars Kirkyard, which is in violation of the local dog laws. In the original novel, the title dog was a Skye Terrier named Bobby and his owner dies from pneumonia. Plot Jock Gray (Donald Crisp) raises his collie Lassie to be an extraordinary sheep dog and companion. When he is beaten to death by robbers after he retires, Lassie keeps vigil over his grave and refuses to let anyone else take ownership of her. However, the law requires that all dogs be leashed and licensed by a legal owner. With no owner to pay her license and her only \\"home\\" being the church graveyard, Lassie faces an uncertain future. Her late owner's friend John Traill (Edmund Gwenn), his law student son William (Ross Ford), and the keepers of the graveyard struggle to keep Lassie hidden from the zealous police Sergeant Davie (Reginald Owen) and the town magistrate (Edmund Breon). Matters are brought to a head when they must go to court to plead for the dog's life before the Lord Provost.

The Zone sourced its programming primarily from Jones Radio Networks but also aired some shows hosted locally from a studio in Quartz Hill, California. In mid-2004, after KCEL (106.9 FM) dropped oldies in favor of a regional Mexican format, KRAJ began broadcasting Jones' nationally syndicated Good Time Oldies format. For a few months after KRAJ's format change, the station held over its local specialty shows from the Zone era but later replaced them with syndicated programs that were originally carried by KCEL. In 2005, KFXM-LP, a low-power FM station in Lancaster, California, signed on with an oldies format. With a significant portion of KRAJ's audience migrating to KFXM with its stronger signal, KRAJ dropped oldies in favor of a rhythmic contemporary format called \\"100.9 The Party Station\\". Adelman moved Good Time Oldies to KLOA (1240 AM) ‚Äî a station that cannot be received clearly in the Antelope Valley. In July 2006, Adelman Broadcasting hired Dan Garite (formerly of KOCP and KCAQ in Oxnard-Ventura, California) as program director and morning drive co-host. Retaining the hip-hop format, KRAJ rebranded as \\"100-9 The Heat\\". In mid-2008, the station hired Craig EC as program director; he adjusted the format to feature more mainstream pop while continuing to emphasize rhythmic content.

Edgerton was named for Joseph K. Edgerton. He was born in Vergennes, Vermont in 1818 and moved to Fort Wayne in 1844. A lawyer and politician, he invested in large parcels of land in Ohio, and also along the Ohio line in Indiana, in townships east of Fort Wayne. There, he had purchased what was considered condemned swamp land which still had stands of virgin timber because it was too wet and difficult to do logging. Two Anspach brothers - John, and George - from Oak Harbor, Ohio, purchased several hundred acres of that land from Mr. Edgerton's estate, managed by his sons Edward and Clement. The Anspach brothers built homes, a sawmill, a tile factory, and a general store there, naming the new village for Mr. Edgerton. The tile factory produced drainage tile that was utilized to drain the swampy land to facilitate its clearing and occupation. Their brother Allen Anspach and other siblings remained in Oak Harbor, where he ran the family's existing lumber company.

This includes 14 motorcycle seats and two sidecar seats in the rear. There are two trains, which are launched by a flywheel track. The sidecars were initially designed to be in the middle of the trains. Riders are held on the ride through a clamshell restraint system, where the top part of the bike folds over the rider's legs. The ride has two cameras: one on the launch run, the other halfway through the ride. The ride's queue features informational decorations that teach about the history of motorcycle racing. Riders must be in height to ride on the main motorcycle cars and tall to ride in the sidecars.

Family Fran√ßois de Beauharnois was the son of a lawyer in the Parlement (who was also a lieutenant g√©n√©ral at the siege of Orl√©ans and a chevalier de Saint-Louis), a grandson of a premier ma√Ætre d‚Äôh√¥tel ordinaire du roi (1652) and great-grandson of an Orl√©ans merchant known as \\"one of the city's richest citizens\\".Verg√©-Franceschi (Michel), Les officiers g√©n√©raux de la marine royale au XVIIIe si√®cle, origines, conditions, services, Paris, 7 vol., Librairie de l‚ÄôInde, 1990, tome V. Fran√ßois's brothers included Charles de Beauharnois de la Boische, Marquis de Beauharnois (who became Governor General of New France in 1726) and Claude de Beauharnois de Beaumont et de Villechauve (a French naval officer who three times commanded the ships that restocked the troops in New France) By a marriage between a female Beauharnois and a male from the Ph√©lypeaux family, he also found himself a cousin of chancellor and Secretary of State of the Navy Louis Ph√©lypeaux de Pontchartrain. Pontchartrain's son, J√©r√¥me Ph√©lypeaux de Pontchartrain, made Fran√ßois his prot√©g√© and between 1706 and 1710 sought a beneficial marriage alliance for him, in the end marrying him Anne, daughter of the sieur Des Gretz, the rich exempt of the Paris police. Life Fran√ßois's career was considerably accelerated by J√©r√¥me's ministerial favour - he became √©crivain principal straightaway on 18 April 1691 at Toulon and on 1 April the following year received his commission as commissaire ordinaire, serving in that role at Toulon then Rochefort, Le Havre and Brest until 1702. The creation of \\"charges v√©nales\\" marked the de facto suppression of \\"commissions ordinaires\\" and Beauharnois thus left the service. To avoid Fran√ßois having to pay for the purchase of a commission, and to gain experience for his further career progression in France, J√©r√¥me Pontchartrain made Fran√ßois intendant of New France on the recall of Jean Bochart de Champigny, leaving from Le Havre and arriving in Quebec in 1702. As J√©r√¥me's prot√©g√©, he was fairly free to make decisions that might be counter to the wishes of the governor, Philippe de Rigaud Vaudreuil who arrived in 1703. At this time the only real business of New France was the fur trade. However, the death of Antoine-Fran√ßois Ph√©lypeaux d‚ÄôHerbault on 10 October 1704 after the Battle of V√©lez-M√°laga (August 1704) freed up the position of intendant of the navy (intendant des arm√©es navales), which J√©r√¥me (as Secretary of State of the Navy) then assigned to Fran√ßois. Thus, after a three-year stay, Fran√ßois left Canada in December 1705 and took up the new role on 1 January 1706. On 1 January 1710, Beauharnois became intendant des classes following the reforms of Pierre Arnoul but he had little time to exercise his new functions - the death of Michel B√©gon on 13 March 1710 left the intendances of Rochefort and of the g√©n√©ralit√© of La Rochelle vacant. Beauharnois took up them both on 24 March 1710, but in 1715 had to abandon that of La Rochelle on the Regent's orders, under the pretext that he wasn't the ma√Ætre des requ√™tes (Beauharnois was nevertheless offered the chance to buy that g√©n√©ralit√©, but refused). Following pressure on Maurepas, Beauharnois was also dismissed from the intendance of Rochefort and was made intendant of the navy for a second time on 1 April 1739. Fran√ßois de Beauharnois thus retired to his lands at Bo√´che, the old name of the seigneurie of La Chauss√©e (or la Chaussaye), located in the faubourgs of Orl√©ans, and died there on 9 October 1746. Properties in France and Canada Besides his lands near Orl√©ans, Beauharnois profited from his brief time in New France to procure the Banville (or Beauville or Bauville) estate there, located in Acadia. The king gave him, by a brevet of 2 April 1707, the land of Port-Maltais (river comprising four places of the bank, two in the depths, with the adjacent islands). On 25 June 1707, by letters patent, this land was formed into the barony of Banville. At the end of his life, Beauharnois enjoyed several pensions which totalled an annual income of 21,200 livres. His will left his property to two nephews, sons of his younger brother Beauharnois de Beaumont. The older of the two, the marquis de Beauharnois, lieutenant g√©n√©ral des arm√©es navales, broke the will by dividing the inheritance between all the nephews and nieces, including Michel B√©gon fils, premier commis du bureau des Fonds. The family Eslandoost de Beauville is the last one of the heirs of Fran√ßois de Beauharnois de la Chaussaye to bear his name.

Plot Ninjatown is a peaceful place populated by ninjas. But after a volcanic eruption, Ninjatown gets invaded by enemies led by Mr. Demon, who is bent on destruction. Ninjatown is based on characters created by toy designer, artist and former Electronic Gaming Monthly editor Shawn Smith. Smith is the artist behind the Shawnimals line of toys. Ninjatown is a spin- off of one of his Shawnimal characters, the Wee Ninja. Gameplay Ninjatown is a tower defense strategy game. When an enemy reaches a certain point on the screen, it disappears, taking 1 life from the player, who initially starts with 10. At the end of the level, the player is graded from A to D depending on how many lives he/she has lost. Completing the level with no lives lost will award an A, while losing 1-2 and 3-4 will result in a B and C, respectively. Losing any more lives will result in a D, and losing all lives forces the player to restart the level. Additionally, if a player has lost several times on a level, they will be given the choice to play the map on Easy Mode. If the map is successfully beaten on Easy Mode, the player will be \\"awarded\\" with an E, regardless of how many lives they had lost in the level. The player steps into the shoes of Ol‚Äô Master Ninja, tasked with defending Ninjatown from waves of enemies trying to make their way through the town. To stop them, the player constructs ninja huts along their path, from which ninjas will emerge to engage the enemy. The ninjas that live in these huts range from orange-clad anti-ninjas to snowball throwing white ninjas. A total of eight ninja types can be built, each being unlocked before certain levels. Building each hut costs ninja star cookies, the currency of Ninjatown, and as enemies are defeated, more cookies are earned. The player can then invest these cookies into building and upgrading huts to deal with the ever- increasing waves of enemies. The player can also build six different modifiers, that will endow any adjacent huts with a special ability. These include buildings like the training dojo which can increase the ninjas attack power, or the green tea bistro which makes units move faster. The player can also make use of Ol' Master Ninja themselves. As the game goes on, Ol' Master Ninja remembers more and more of the seven Elder Ninja Powers, powerful moves that can aid the player greatly. These range from blowing into the mic to send enemies back down the path, to stopping time. Elder Ninja Powers give the player more time to build houses and upgrade units. Using these powers takes up Happiness Bars, represented by a Hickory Cane meter. Destroying enemies fills this meter. Every Ol' Master Ninja Power takes up 1-2 bars of Happiness. Ninjatown features several different types of enemies that try to invade or destroy several places throughout the game's world. Most of these enemies are devils, such as the Speedy Devil and Tribal Devil, and other types of enemies, like Forked Toungeys that multiply when defeated, or Zombie Ninjas that can infect the player's own ninjas. The final element is the tokens, which are won at the end of most maps if you get a better letter grade (see gameplay) than you previously had. Tokens allow the player to summon special ninjas who each have a special, time-limited area-of-effect ability. There are a total of four Tokens collectable in the game. Examples of these include baby ninjas who slow down all enemies, or ninja dropping, who emanates malodorous fumes that damage enemies. Reception Ninjatown received \\"favorable\\" reviews according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. The game was a nominee for Best Nintendo DS Game by GameTrailers in their 2008 video game awards. It was also a nominee for Best Strategy Game for the Nintendo DS by IGN. In addition, Ninjatown was a nominee for 2008 Best Strategy Game of the Year by the British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA). Comic Book In 2008, Ninjatown was adapted into comic book format. It is available digitally exclusively through Devil's Due Digital. Sequel In 2010, a sequel entitled Ninjatown: Trees of Doom! was released for iOS (May 5) and Android (June 8).

Players choose one of seven different Allied and Axis fighter planes and are assigned to six seek and destroy missions against a large, equally unified squadron and naval force. It is an arcade style flight simulator, as the physics are simplified for the sake of playability; the planes do not stall when traveling under stalling speeds and planes do not crash against water and other surfaces when descending from high altitudes. It was one of the first games to be developed using the Sega Graphics Library operating system. Story Some time after the summer of 1945, a group of arms manufacturers throughout the Axis and Allied countries known as Avalon revealed to have played a large part in instigating combat in World War II which resulted in the boom of vehicle and weapons production. As soon as the war ended however, Avalon's riches started to decrease, resulting in their decision to keep the war going by using captured Axis and Allied planes against opposite nations military facilities. A squadron of unified Allied and Axis planes are assembled aboard the USS Enterprise to deal with the newest products of Avalon and to crush the company for good. Planes These are the available planes the player can choose from aboard the Enterprise, each have different speeds, shield strength (which serves as the plane's armor) and are all equipped with up to 30 rockets. *Mitsubishi A6M Zero *Grumman F6F Hellcat *Ky≈´sh≈´ J7W Shinden *P-51 Mustang *Supermarine Spitfire Mk.I *P-38 Lightning *Messerschmitt Me 262 Schwalbe Gameplay Players start immediately by choosing the plane they wish to pilot. From there, their missions start with a quick briefing from the aircraft carrier's admiral via radio. Players must accomplish a particular goal in order to progress, particularly destroying a certain number of plane targets or destroying a particular base, ship or fortification. After every mission, players are ranked by the types of targets they destroyed (Land, Air and Sea), their total number of targets destroyed, the time it took them to clear the mission and their current rank. Players can work their way up in ranks with 2nd Lieutenant being the lowest and Colonel being the highest. Players are also given three credits they can use once their plane is destroyed. Reception The four reviewers of Electronic Gaming Monthly each expressed different opinions of what Wing Armss strong points and drawbacks are, but all but one agreed that it was an overall excellent flight simulator. Rad Automatic of Sega Saturn Magazine praised the variety of missions and the sophisticated control system, though he felt that the enemy AI in the later missions is too difficult. GamePros Slo Mo gave the game a mostly positive review for its arcade-style gameplay, tough enemy AI, and graphics, remarking that \\"Wing's topnotch graphics maintain a stellar performance during the fast-paced gameplay with smooth, quick animation and three aircraft views\\". However, he criticized the unlimited ammunition and extreme durability of the player's plane as unrealistic. Maximum remarked that Wing Arms has solid albeit unoriginal gameplay but highly uneven graphics, with extensive popup in the later levels. They concluded the game to be enjoyable but ultimately not worthwhile since it offers nothing new and is completely overshadowed by the already released Firestorm: Thunderhawk 2. A reviewer for Next Generation advised gamers that Wing Arms has a different dynamic than most arcade-style flight sims, since it uses \\"old-school dog- fighting\\" rather than locking missiles and other high-tech weaponry. He criticized the short length of the game but said it is fun while it lasts, since \\"the action is fast, the graphics are beautiful, and the control is a joy.\\" References External links * Category:1995 video games Category:Alternate history video games Category:Combat flight simulators Category:Sega Saturn games Category:Sega Saturn-only games Category:Sega video games Category:Video games developed in Japan ","title":"Wing Arms"},{"id":"14098125","text":"Krajan√≥w () (), is a village in the administrative district of Gmina Nowa Ruda, within K≈Çodzko County, Lower Silesian Voivodeship, in south-western Poland. Partly due to its location along the border between Silesia and Bohemia, Krajan√≥w has been a part of different states over its history. Krajan√≥w lies approximately west of Nowa Ruda, north-west of K≈Çodzko, and south-west of the regional capital Wroc≈Çaw. Abutting Krajan√≥w across the border in the Czech Republic, is the village of ≈†onov in the N√°chod District of the Hradec Kr√°lov√© Region, located immediately south of the village. As of 2011, Krajan√≥w had a population of 120. History =Beginnings= Thanks to its location along the border between Silesia and Bohemia, the vicinity of Krajan√≥w has shifted between different states over time. Although much of the K≈Çodzko Valley was likely under the rule of Great Moravia during the reign of King Svatopluk I in the late 9th century, the precise extent of his realm is disputed. K≈Çodzko castle, an important garrison on the road from Prague to Wroc≈Çaw is noted to have been a possession of the Bohemian nobleman Slavn√≠k in 981 according to the Chronica Bo√´morum, which was composed 2 centuries later in 1191 by Cosmas of Prague. Slavn√≠k notably, was the father of Saint Adalbert of Prague, the patron saint of Czechia, Poland and the Duchy of Prussia. During the rivalry between the P≈ôemyslid dukes Boleslaus III and Jaromir in 1003, the Polish king Boles≈Çaw I Chrobry invaded Bohemia, but had to pull back the next year, facing the forces of King Henry II of Germany. In turn the Bohemian duke Bretislaus I campaigned the adjacent northern territory of Silesia after Boles≈Çaw's death in 1025. An armistice mediated by Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor since 1014, demarcated the spheres of influence, leaving the area around K≈Çodzko with Bohemia. When about 1080 the Polish Piast duke W≈Çadys≈Çaw I Herman married Judith P≈ôemyslovna, daughter of Duke Vratislaus II of Bohemia, he received K≈Çodzko as a Bohemian fief, which upon his death in 1102 was claimed by his son Duke Boles≈Çaw III Wrymouth of Poland. However, as Boles≈Çaw became entangled in a fierce inheritance conflict with Duke Svatopluk of Bohemia and his cousin Borivoj II and campaigned in the Bohemian lands several times, he finally had to renounce K≈Çodzko in favour of Duke Sobƒõslav I of Bohemia in a peace treaty signed in 1137 under pressure from Emperor Lothair III. =The Free Judges= The first written record of the existence of Krajan√≥w is from 1353. Exactly 70 years later in 1423, a Free Judge, a class of land owners specific to the County of Kladsko and belonged to the Third Estate, is noted to have lived in Krajan√≥w. Descended mostly from German , the Free Judges were people who had been granted special privileges by the King of Bohemia to reclaim and settle uninhabited areas. German law was gradually implemented in the Czech villages which predated their arrival. These municipalities were mostly located along the roads to Prague and Brno. The estate of a Free Judge was a separate legal entity with dominium rights. Such an estate would include not only agricultural lands and forests, but also mills, craft workshops as well as a pub, along with brewing and fishing rights. The subjects had to pay rent and provide certain services. An estate could be inherited by a child of either gender. When an estate was sold, the rights and privileges belonging to the estate were included in the sale. No taxes were levied on the estate itself, only on land added later. =County of Kladsko= While under Bohemian rule the area around K≈Çodzko became a county in 1458. In 1631 Krajan√≥w was described as a large settlement with its own church. =Annexation to Prussia and the abolition of Kladsko County= In 1742 Kladsko County was conquered by Prussia, and Krajan√≥w was annexed like the rest of Kladsko County. The village was quite active economically at the time, with records from 1748 indicating the presence of a water mill, 97 farms, as well as 21 craftsmen living in Krajan√≥w. The county was abolished in 1816, and the territory was reformed into the Landkreis Glatz of Prussian Silesia. Like neighboring Lower Silesia, the locals were subject to Germanization by the Prussian government over the following decades. Nonetheless, the village continued to prosper through the first half of the 19th century under Prussian rule. In 1840, Krajan√≥w had 102 buildings, including: a church, a Catholic school, two farms as well as a water mill. There were also 57 cotton and 20 linen workshops, with a sizable number of locals engaged in the weaving industry. Although the village began to depopulate in the mid-nineteenth century, records show both a manor and an inn in Krajan√≥w in 1870.

After World War I the new Czechoslovak state laid claim to the County of Kladsko, which included the German village of Krainsdorf in the maximalist proposal put forth by the Czechoslovak delegation. All of their claims were however ultimately rejected by the 1919 Treaty of Versailles. =After 1945= After the capitulation of Nazi Germany in 1945, the town was placed under Polish administration according to the Potsdam Conference, and the area remains a part of Poland into the present day. The German inhabitants of the village were expelled. Czechoslovakia tried to annex the area in May of 1945, wanting to incorporate the Czech population which lived in the \\"Czech Corner\\" along the southern edges of the former County of Kladsko. A land swap between Poland and Czechoslovakia for Teschen Silesia was considered, but ultimately shelved. The Czechoslovakian Army had to cease military operations and withdrew from the area under pressure from the Soviet Union. Whereas most of the former German and Czech settlements of Kladsko County were repopulated by Poles from regions east of the Curzon line as well as war-devastated central Poland, Krajan√≥w was settled by a group of G√≥rals. These Polish Highlanders from the Podhale region created a new home here as well as in the nearby villages of Czarny B√≥r and Bor√≥wno in Lower Silesia. While the new inhabitants initially cultivated their unique customs and folklore, these traditions have disappeared over time, and Krajan√≥w is once again suffering depopulation. At the edge of Broumovsko Just south of Krajan√≥w across the Czech border is the Broumovsko Protected Landscape Area. Named after the town of Broumov, the area is well known for its aesthetically and ecologically valuable landscapes. Broumovsko is noted for its extensive sandstone rock formations as well as a wealth of religious and folk architectural landmarks. For many centuries, the area was managed by Benedictine monks from their monastery in Broumov, thanks to whom a number of notable structures dating from the Baroque era can be found in the vicinity. Walled manors and country estates of the Broumov type are also highly remarkable.. The scenic Czech village of Martinkovice has a macabre past owing to a World War I prison camp where 2,600 mostly Serbian prisoners died of typhus and starvation. Many are buried at the WWI prisoner- of-war cemetery in Martinkov√≠ce, which also has a cemetery of Soviet soldiers who were captured during World War II. Home of Olga Tokarczuk Olga Tokarczuk during the Literary Heights Festival in Krajan√≥w Although born in Sulech√≥w near Zielona G√≥ra, Nobel Prize laureate Olga Tokarczuk has lived in this village since 1998. Tokarczuk also manages her private publishing company Ruta in Krajan√≥w. The locale has influenced Tokarczuk's literary work. Her novel Dom dzienny, dom nocny (\\"House of Day, House of Night\\", 1998) is a patchwork of loosely connected disparate stories, sketches, and essays about life past and present in the author's adopted home located in the Sudete Mountains in a multi-cultural borderland. While some have labeled it Tokarczuk's most \\"difficult\\" piece, at least for those unfamiliar with Central European history, it was her first book to be published in English.

She was commissioned 11 May 1863 and purchased by the Navy 13 May 1863, Acting Master J. R. Grace in command. She was renamed Fawn 19 June 1863.  Supporting operations on various Confederate waterways  Throughout the remainder of the Civil War, Fawn patrolled the Mississippi, Tennessee, White and Arkansas Rivers, also convoying Union Army transports, ferrying troops across rivers, carrying Army payrolls, and often engaging Confederate batteries, cavalry, and foot soldiers ashore. For much of her career, she served in the White River, convoying transports and shelling Confederate positions threatening Union troop concentrations.  Holed by a hit at Clarendon, Arkansas  From March through June 1864, aside from a brief repair period at Memphis, Tennessee, she supported Army operations against Clarendon, Arkansas, receiving one hit from a shore battery there.  Final operations and decommissioning  From March to May 1865, Fawn patrolled the Mississippi between the White and St. Francis Rivers, then sailed up river to Mound City, Illinois, where she was decommissioned 30 June 1865 and sold 17 August 1865.

The station had aired a classic country format until January 1, 2018. It had also carried Los Angeles Dodgers baseball games in season. It has been continuously off the air since August 27, 2018. History The station first signed on the air in November 1946. It was a CBS Radio Network affiliate. KROP had a music format from the 1950s to the early 1980s, when it switched to a Talk radio format. In 1995, it switched to a country music format. This lasted until 1998, when the station became KKSC, \\"ESPN 1300\\", a sports radio station affiliated with ESPN Radio. Though the station's audience grew with the sports format, KKSC had trouble selling the format to advertisers, rendering the station dependent on the profits of sister station 96.1 KSIQ. Commonwealth Communications purchased the station from Stodelle Broadcasting in 1999; two years later, the station changed back to KROP and began playing a classic country format provided by Westwood One's Real Country service. Cherry Creek Radio bought the station in 2003. In 2010, LarDog Communications, LLC. purchased KROP, installed new state of the art broadcasting equipment and changed the format back to talk radio. After KSIQ was moved into the San Diego market, Cherry Creek Radio shut down KROP in April 2010, as the lack of an FM sister station made it more difficult for the station to compete in the Imperial Valley radio market. The station was sold, and returned on the air when the sale was completed in August 2010. Brawley High School Wildcat Football was broadcast via the World Wide Web. On August 1, 2014, KROP returned to classic country, citing low advertising revenues for the talk radio format. It was reported on January 1, 2018, that KROP went off the air. The phone numbers for both KROP and its owner, LarDog, have been disconnected. The website is also not available. After briefly resuming operations in August, a lightning strike put the station off the air on August 27. On June 11, 2019, LarDog filed to donate KROP to The Voice of International Christian Evangelism, which owns KGBA-AM-FM in Holtville. The donation was consummated on August 12, 2019.

It is a model of computation equivalent to a Turing machine, and therefore it can process the same class of formal languages.  Theory  A queue machine can be defined as a six-tuple :M = (Q, \\\\Sigma, \\\\Gamma, \\\\$, s, \\\\delta) where * \\\\,Q is a finite set of states; * \\\\,\\\\Sigma \\\\subset \\\\Gamma is the finite set of the input alphabet; * \\\\,\\\\Gamma is the finite queue alphabet; * \\\\,\\\\$ \\\\in \\\\Gamma - \\\\Sigma is the initial queue symbol; * \\\\,s \\\\in Q is the start state; * \\\\,\\\\delta : Q \\\\times \\\\Gamma \\\\rightarrow Q \\\\times \\\\Gamma^* is the transition function. A machine configuration is an ordered pair of its state and queue contents \\\\,(q,\\\\gamma)\\\\in Q\\\\times\\\\Gamma^*, where \\\\,\\\\Gamma^* denotes the Kleene closure of \\\\,\\\\Gamma. The starting configuration on an input string \\\\,x is defined as \\\\,(s,x\\\\$), and the transition \\\\rightarrow_M^1 from one configuration to the next is defined as: :\\\\,(p,A\\\\alpha) \\\\rightarrow_M^1 (q,\\\\alpha\\\\gamma) where A is a symbol from the queue alphabet, \\\\alpha is a sequence of queue symbols (\\\\alpha \\\\in \\\\Gamma^*), and (q, \\\\gamma) = \\\\delta(p, A). Note the \\"first-in- first-out\\" property of the queue in the relation. The machine accepts a string \\\\,x\\\\in\\\\Sigma^* if after a finite number of transitions the starting configuration evolves to exhaust the string (reaching a null string \\\\,\\\\epsilon), or \\\\,(s,x\\\\$)\\\\rightarrow_M^*(q,\\\\epsilon). = Turing completeness = We can prove that a queue machine is equivalent to a Turing machine by showing that a queue machine can simulate a Turing machine and vice versa. A Turing machine can be simulated by a queue machine that keeps a copy of the Turing machine's contents in its queue at all times, with two special markers: one for the TM's head position, and one for the end of the tape; its transitions simulate those of the TM by running through the whole queue, popping off each of its symbols and re-enqueing either the popped symbol, or, near the head position, the equivalent of the TM transition's effect. A queue machine can be simulated by a Turing machine, but more easily by a multi-tape Turing machine, which is known to be equivalent to a normal single-tape machine. The simulating queue machine reads input on one tape and stores the queue on the second, with pushes and pops defined by simple transitions to the beginning and end symbols of the tape. A formal proof of this is often an exercise in theoretical computer science courses.  Applications  Queue machines offer a simple model on which to base computer architectures, programming languages, or algorithms.

At the 2011 Census the population of the hamlet was included in the civil parish of Thundridge. Running through the center of Wadesmill is the road formerly known as the A10 - the main London to King's Lynn (via Cambridge) road - but now that the A10 by-pass has been built, Wadesmill and surrounding villages have returned to the quiet of former times. The route that was formerly the A10 is an ancient one with portions of it following the line of the Roman Road Ermine Street. Ermine street also figures as the former main street in Wadesmill's adjacent village Thundridge. A10 Wadesmill Bypass History Historically Wadesmill is particularly notable for two features - it is the location of the first turnpike in England (and therefore the world), and the presence of the Clarkson Memorial halfway up nearby High Cross hill, a memorial to Thomas Clarkson's rest point in his travels at which he decided to devote much of the rest of his life to ending the slave trade. The first effective turnpike in England was created at Wadesmill by Act of Parliament (\\"The Turnpike Act\\") in 1663 as a result of serious deterioration of the \\"Old North Road\\" due to travel by laden barley wagons supplying the brewing trade in the nearby maltings town of Ware. As with most government-imposed taxations however, routes to circumvent the turnpike were quickly established, resulting in one instance in the increased use of what became known as \\"The Great North Road\\" - the A1. In 1785, Thomas Clarkson had entered an essay and won a Latin dissertation at the University of Cambridge for the subject Anne liceat Invitos in Servitutem dare (Is it right to make slaves of others against their will?). He was greatly affected by the subject during his research into the essay and later wrote: > As it is usual to read these essays publicly in the senate-house soon after > the prize is adjudged, I was called to Cambridge for this purpose. I went > and performed my office. On returning however to London, the subject of it > almost wholly engrossed my thoughts. I became at times very seriously > affected while upon the road. I stopped my horse occasionally, and > dismounted and walked. I frequently tried to persuade myself in these > intervals that the contents of my essay could not be true. The more, > however, I reflected upon them, or rather upon the authorities on which they > were founded, the more I gave them credit. Coming in sight of Wades Mill, in > Hertfordshire, I sat down disconsolate on the turf by the roadside and held > my horse. Here a thought came into my mind, that if the contents of the > essay were true, it was time some person should see these calamities to > their end. Agitated in this manner, I reached home. This was in the summer > of 1785. To the east of Wadesmill is the picturesque estate of Youngsbury. Youngsbury consists of an 18th-century park and woodland with 4 hectares of garden around the house, the front part of which is dated 1745, the back early 19th century, with 18th-century stables. There are extensive 16th to 18th-century walled kitchen gardens, an arboretum, an icehouse and tumuli and Roman barrows within the grounds, which extend to the river Rib. Capability Brown's involvement included widening the river and creating two islands, designing a ha ha and placing small groups of trees in open parkland. Nineteenth-century development of the kitchen garden was re-created in the late 20th century, with notable mixed borders. There is a moat and church in a bend of the river on the southern edge of the parkland. Capability Brown is actually said to have reviewed the rolling parkland surrounding Youngsbury house and observed that he need do nothing to improve upon what nature had already achieved! The moat and church referenced in the HCC quote are in fact Thundridge Bury and Thundridge old church, neither of which are still standing in entirety.

The show is filmed in the handheld, one-camera style associated with mockumentaries such as The Office. The show was written and created by brothers Vlad and Yuri Baranovsky, and while being an online show, episodes were shown on the San Francisco Public-access television cable TV channel. The show is shot in San Francisco and the outlying areas. Unlike many other internet web series, some episodes of Break a Leg are as long as those of television sitcoms, at around 30 minutes. Premise and setting The show is about a writer named David Penn, whose sitcom has been picked up for production. The viewer also learns, through the lead character's narration, that David is going to die at the end of the season. The show follows David through the process of making a show and surviving a fantastical, almost satirical Hollywood. Break a Leg takes place in San Francisco with some scenes in Los Angeles. Hollywood itself is portrayed as a kind of macabre world where unions engage in actual wars and child actors live in the sewers.

Yuri Baranovsky was already working on a feature-length independent film titled LIFE NOIR, and he, the crew, and the actors decided to enter the competition. The Baranovskys wrote the idea in one sitting and the short \\"episode\\" was shot in one day. The show didn't win but managed to garner a small and highly dedicated fanbase who went as far as calling and emailing FX to tell them they picked the wrong show. This prompted the Break a Leg crew to create more episodes of Break a Leg under their production company name, Late Again Films. Episodes Season one consists of 17 episodes. *Episode 1, \\"The Pilot\\": David Penn is a Hollywood writer who has just had his sitcom Groomates picked up.

Efficient was by the outstanding sire Zabeel from the mare Refused The Dance by Defensive Play (USA). He is a half brother to Guillotine, winner of the 2008 MVRC Dato Tan Chin Nam Stakes. In his first campaign in the spring of 2006 he put together five consecutive wins including the Group 2 Aami Vase at Moonee Valley and ending with a win in the VRC Derby by 2¬Ω lengths. Following his Derby win Efficient was entered into the Melbourne Cup field, run three days later. However, he did not pull up well enough and so was scratched from the race and spelled instead. Returning in the autumn Efficient had a very light campaign of just two starts. In the 1,400-metre Group 3 Schweppervescence Cup he finished fourth behind Haradasun and fifth behind Miss Finland in the Group One Australian Guineas over 1,600 metres. As a four-year-old in the Spring of 2007 Efficient resumed in the Memsie Stakes at Caulfield and ran 10th beaten 7 lengths. At his next start he ran fourth in the Group 2 Dato Tan Chin Nam Stakes behind El Segundo and Haradasun. He then ran unplaced in the 2,000-metre Group 1 Turnbull Stakes. Three weeks later Efficient lined up in the Weight for Age Group 1 Cox Plate over 2,040 metres at Moonee Valley where he finished 9th beaten 6¬Ω lengths by the winner El Segundo. Efficient's next start was the Melbourne Cup, his first start in a handicap race since his first campaign. He dropped 3 kg from the Cox Plate run to carry 54.5 kg. Due to his poor recent form he was sent out a 16-1 chance. Reunited with jockey Michael Rodd for the first time since their 2006 Victoria Derby win, Efficient settled back in the field and travelled well. He was pulled to the outside to make a run and in the closing stages Efficient went on to defeat Purple Moon by half a length. His win dividend of $22.70 was the biggest for a Melbourne Cup winner in over ten years. He became the first grey to win the Melbourne Cup since Subzero in 1992 and the first horse since Phar Lap to win the Melbourne Cup the year after winning the Victoria Derby. Efficient was trained by expatriate New Zealand trainer Graeme Rogerson to win the cup, but switched to John Sadler soon after Rogerson decided to part company with the horse's owners, a syndicate headed by Lloyd and Suzy Williams. Efficient has had an injury-plagued career since his Melbourne Cup win, and was withdrawn from both the 2008 and 2009 Melbourne Cups in the fortnight leading up to the race. However, he did gain a third Group One success in the 2009 Turnbull Stakes. After this success Efficient did not race for almost two years. He returned to racing in September 2011 but did not show any form until he ran second to Niwot in the 3200 metre Sydney Cup at Randwick in April 2012. On 4 October 2012, Efficient's owner Lloyd Williams, announced that the horse had suffered a recurrence of an old injury and had been retired. He now resides with other former champion horses at Living Legends, the International Home of Rest for Champion Horses located in Woodlands Historic Park, Greenvale, Victoria, Australia.Living Legends website He occasionally makes public appearances at events such as the Melbourne Cup Parade.

The Acasta orthogneisses of the Slave Craton, Canada, are regarded to be the oldest rocks on Earth, dated to 4.06 Ga, include protoliths such as TTGs, amphibolite, gabbro, granite, and diorite.

He attained the ability to mentally evaluate large arithmetic expressions at the age of 21. He can also speak backwards, and calculate calendars. Featured on the Discovery Channel program The Real Superhumans, he was examined by Allan Snyder, an expert on savants, who concluded that Gamm's ability was not a result of savant syndrome but connected to genetics. In terms of mental calculations, R√ºdiger's most notable talent is the ability to memorize large powers. In the 2008 Mental Calculation World Cup in Leipzig, he recited 81100, which took approximately 2 minutes and 30 seconds. In the tournament itself, he performed strongly, finishing in 5th position overall. He also held a seminar in 2012 at the BOLDTalks event at DUCTAC (Dubai). Early life R√ºdiger Gamm was born on July 10, 1971, in Welzheim, Germany. Gamm stated that he learnt how to speak backwards before learning how to speak forwards which prompted classmates to tease him or avoid him. Gamm was a self-proclaimed underachiever at school and stated \\"I was the worst in my class at maths. I failed my exam six times and hated school a lot. The only thing I was interested in was bodybuilding. I wanted to be like Arnold Schwarzenegger, rather than a mathematician.\\" Gamm recalls, shortly after leaving college, listening to the radio and calculating alongside a champion mathematician. After Gamm answered the calculations faster than the champion, he started training his brain into the field of mental math and, a year later, appeared on the German TV game show Wetten, dass..? (in the United States it is known as Wanna Bet? and in the United Kingdom known as You Bet!.) Gamm won the show with the highest score achieved and received a prize of 8,400 Deutsche Marks. Gamm was found to have an IQ somewhere in the region of 200.

History The company was founded in 1961 by L.C. \\"Ring\\" Ringhaver, who gave up shrimp boat building to become a Caterpillar engine dealer in St. Augustine, Florida. The following year, they became a full line dealer and relocated to Jacksonville. In 1973 the company moved to a site on U.S. Route 1 (locally known as Philips Highway) and Baymeadows Road on the southside. As the business grew over the next 25 years, the product lines expanded and more divisions were added. The property in Jacksonville eventually became a complex of seven buildings with 250,000 ft¬≤ of space. At the end of the century, they ran out of room to expand, and the character of Philips Highway had changed from industrial to commercial. The decision was made to find a new home with at least . The result of the search was the purchase of at World Commerce Center along Interstate 95 in St. Johns County. A $1.6 million incentive package was approved by the St. Johns County Commission and Elkins Constructors began work in the Fall of 2003 on a 414,000 ft¬≤ facility. Most of their old property along Philips Highway was sold for redevelopment and Ring Power moved to their new headquarters in March, 2005. Lowe's purchased and built a home improvement store; BJ's Wholesale Club was constructed on an parcel; a small retail strip center with half a dozen businesses was positioned closest to the intersection of Philips and Baymeadows. Ring Power retained the at the north end of the property for a Ring Power Forklift Operations center. Locations The port facilities in Jacksonville and Miami allow the company to export equipment almost anywhere in the world. Ring Power has over 1600 employees at branches in 19 cities throughout Florida and offices in California, Georgia, New Jersey, North Carolina, Rhode Island, South Carolina and Texas. Customers can purchase, lease or rent new & used Caterpillar industrial equipment. Ring Power also handles machines made by Kalmar, Linde, Clark, Trail King, Manitowoc, Grove, Gradall, National Crane, Rosco, Gomaco, Phoenix Products and others. Over 300 employees were assigned to the Ring Power office in Riverview, Florida (near Tampa) in 2006.

As with many of Europe's most well known wine regions, the Ancient Romans founded many of the Rioja vineyards. Throughout the Middle Ages, pilgrims to the shrine of St. James at Santiago de Compostela passed through the region and carried back with them the reputation of wines from the area. The phylloxera epidemic of the late 19th century was a major catalyst in the expansion and modernization of the Rioja wine industry, with the devastation the French wine industry both opening up the French wine market and bringing an influx of French investment into the region. Today, together with Sherry, Rioja is the most internationally recognized of all Spanish wines. Early history and Roman times Ruins from the Roman settlement of Vareia near the location of modern-day Logro√±o. The earliest vine-growing people to reach the Rioja were the Phoenicians, who traveled up the Ebro river and left traces of settlements near Alfaro. The Rioja region was conquered by the Ancient Romans in the early 2nd century BC and probably came under Roman rule through treaties with the local Celtiberian and Vascon tribes. Vineyards were established at settlements near modern-day Calahorra and Logro√±o and bodegas soon sprang up in order to supply the Roman troops. Archaeological exploration has uncovered evidence of a local cistern from that period with the capacity to hold 75,000 liters of wine.H. Johnson Vintage: The Story of Wine pg 86 Simon & Schuster 1989 Wine historian Roger Dion has theorized that when the Romans settled in Bordeaux, some of the plant cuttings that they took with them may have originated in Rioja vineyards, in the form of an ancient vine Balisca, which may have been the ancestor of the Cabernet family, leading to the development of the classic varieties Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet franc, Merlot and Petit Verdot in the M√©doc wine region.H. Johnson Vintage: The Story of Wine pg 89 Simon & Schuster 1989 Middle Ages & Renaissance Remains of a medieval wine press in the Rioja Alavesa Statue of St. James the Apostle in Logro√±o that greeted the pilgrims traveling through Rioja on their way to Santiago de Compostela.

Actes du colloque de Bordeaux (4-5 octobre 2012), Caen, Association d'Histoire des Soci√©t√©s Rurales, 2014, p. 311-323 . There are proofs of Rioja wine export towards other regions as early as the late 13th century, which testifies the beginnings of a commercial production.Francisco Javier GOICOLEA JULI√ÅN, ¬´ El vino en el mundo urbano riojano a finales de la Edad Media ¬ª, 'En la Espa√±a Medieval', no 30, 2007, p. 217-244. From the 15th century on, the Rioja Alta specialized in wine growing.Alain HUETZ DE LEMPS, 'Vignobles et vins du nord-ouest de l'Espagne', Bordeaux, F√©ret, 1967. The popular pilgrimage route el Camino de Santiago took thousands of Christian pilgrims right through the heart of the Rioja throughout the Middle Ages, just as it does today. Whereas many visitors sampled the local wine and the reputation of the region became widespread, not many samples of the wines left the area.H. Johnson Vintage: The Story of Wine pg 426 Simon & Schuster 1989 Following the Reconquista, Rioja wine merchants began to look for outside markets for their wine. Looking north, some bodegas brought their wines to the trading ports of Bilbao and Santander where it became available to Dutch and English wine merchants.H. Johnson Vintage: The Story of Wine pg 165 Simon & Schuster 1989 This developing trade with its Basque Country neighbors served as an impetus for the bodegas to expand their wine production. As the region's reputation grew, the local authorities tried to implement safeguards to protect the quality and reputation of the wine. In 1560 the use of grapes from outside the Rioja region was prohibited and wine exported from the region had to transported in bota bags, branded with a seal to guarantee the authenticity of their contents.T. Stevenson \\"The Sotheby's Wine Encyclopedia\\" pg 312-314 Dorling Kindersley 2005 18th & 19th century rebirth Baldomero Espartero, Duke de la Victoria. In the 1780s, Don Manuel Quintano of nearby Burgos traveled to Bordeaux to learn their winemaking techniques. On his return, he introduced the use of Oak aging barrels to the Rioja bodegas, which dramatically improved the longevity of Rioja wines. This opened up their export potential, and markets soon developed in places as far- flung as Cuba and Mexico. Despite this success, the regional authorities dictated that the all Rioja wines, whether destined for foreign or domestic consumption, must be the same price, regardless of the added expense incurred by oak aging. This significant economic disadvantage caused the use of oak to fall out of favor for almost a century. The Duke de la Victoria owned a bodega in Logro√±o and spent considerable time in London during a period of exile following the defeat of the Carlists. It was there that he and an aide, Colonel Luciano Murrieta, discussed ways in which to modernize the Rioja wine industry, with the aim of competing for the sizable British market. Murrieta was dispatched to Bordeaux to learn the latest advances in the Bordeaux wine industry, much like Quintano had been several decades before. One of the improvements Murrieta brought back was the utilization of large vats to crush and ferment the grapes, in place of the outdoor stone lagos in which grapes were traditionally crushed by the feet of the vineyard workers. Murrieta also reintroduced the use of oak for aging.H. Johnson Vintage: The Story of Wine pg 427-428 Simon & Schuster 1989 The phylloxera louse. In the 1850s, the fungal disease powdery mildew began to ravage vineyards in nearby Galicia, opening up the market up for Rioja bodegas, which had been only slightly affected. The completion of a railway system linking Logro√±o to Bilbao, Madrid and Irun coincided with the onset of the phylloxera epidemic in Europe. The French were the first and hardest hit by the louse, which created an immediate and insatiable demand for all the wine the Rioja could produce. Amidst devastation in the French wine industry, dozens of n√©gociant and French winemakers, mostly from Bordeaux, traveled to the Rioja to set up wineries, where they could continue to produce wine ‚Äì bringing with them extensive knowledge, techniques and experience. This ushered in a period of unprecedented growth and prosperity for the Rioja wine industry.K. MacNeil The Wine Bible pg 415 Workman Publishing 2001 The subsequent boom in the Rioja wine industry lasted until phylloxera finally reached the region itself in the 1890s. By then the cure of grafting American rootstock had been successfully employed in France and it was only a matter of time before the Spanish were able to replant their own vineyards with the new grafted vines. In the meantime, regional authorities stepped in to sharply curb all wine imports, so that the local wine supply would take priority. Laws were passed prohibiting the export of wines from any bodega producing less 750,000 liters of wine per annum.H. Johnson Vintage: The Story of Wine pg 432 Simon & Schuster 1989 Modern times At the turn of the 20th century, Rioja had established itself as the most recognizable name for Spanish wine outside of Spain. However the effects of World War I, the Spanish Civil War and World War II created trying times for the Rioja industry. Country-wide hunger resulted in government decrees stating that vineyards had to be torn up and replanted with wheat in order to feed the populace. It wasn't till the 1960s that many of these lands would be planted with vines once again. The 1970 vintage was a turning point for the Rioja wine industry, widely hailed as the \\"vintage of the century\\" and ranked by wine critics as one of the best of any region in the world. This success caused a surge in consumer interest in the wines, and with that an influx of foreign investment in the vineyards and bodegas of the Rioja.K. MacNeil The Wine Bible pg 416 Workman Publishing 2001 In the 1980s, a steady stream of under-performing vintages and excessively high prices caused a significant drop in sales, while other Spanish wine regions like the Ribera del Duero began to emerge, capturing more international attention and sales. In response, modern Rioja winemakers began experimenting with more international styles of wine, younger, more powerful and deeply colored than the traditional Rioja. The heavy use of oak was restrained with the aim of releasing wines onto the market sooner, so that they could be enjoyed earlier.J. Robinson Jancis Robinson's Wine Course Third Edition pg 240-241 Abbeville Press 2003 Sales began to improve and in 1991, Rioja was the first region to be awarded Denominaci√≥n de Origen Calificada status, with which the Spanish recognised the Rioja as its premier wine region.J.

The solar thermal power station was planned to have a nameplate capacity of 10 MW and deliver about 30 gigawatt-hours of electricity a year, enough to power the whole town. It was reported in November 2010 that the project was scrapped because of light pollution concerns. However, as of 2 December 2011 Ingenero Pty Ltd have been named preferred developer to install a 2 MW photovoltaic power system, installation is expected to commence in July 2012. On 24 May 2012 the recently elected Newman government announced the withdrawal of state funds for the project. In a statement the Minister for Energy Mark McArdle described the reason for the scrapping as 'saving the taxpayer's money'.(24 May 2012). Solar farm scrapped. Brisbane Times. Fairfax Media. Retrieved on 25 May 2012. Project The total cost of the project is A$31 million including a A$7 million gift from the government. The plant was supposed to be running by early 2010. On 16 November 2010, Lloyd Energy Systems advised the government to not proceed further at the current location. The cancellation of the project is due to reflective glare issues which have raised concerns about operating in an urban environment and potential impacts on community health. The government decided to invest the remaining $5.7 million from the project towards a photovoltaic solar farm for the area. Heat storage The design is a common solar power tower design. An array of motorised heliostat mirrors reflects sunlight to the summit of a tower. The summit houses a receiver, which is heated by the concentrated sunlight. A total of 54 towers of 18 m (59 ft) high will be constructed. An important advantage of solar thermal energy is the possibility of storing heat for later use. In this way, the plant can also produce electricity at night or on overcast days. A common method is the storage of molten nitrate salt in large tanks; this is the technology used in Solar Tres Power Tower. The Cloncurry plant uses the new technology of heat storage in blocks of purified graphite. The blocks are placed on top of the tower. The concentrated light on the receivers of the towers is directly transported to these blocks. The heat for electricity production is drawn from the blocks (i.e. there is no direct heat transport from the receiver).

It belonged to the District W√ºnschelburg in the Glatzerland, which was a sub- country of the Crown Bohemia . With this he shared the history of his political and ecclesiastical affiliation since his existence. It consisted of two parts: *The Freirichtergut owned Peter Trautmann in 1408. The following owners included the families of Alt, Sauern and Ullersdorf . Johann Georg von Ullersdorf sold it to Franz Anton von Haugwitz in 1738 on Pischkowitz . From this time it was called the Haugwitz part. *The Dominial portion belonged to the Titzko of Pannwitz in 1348, which was among other things also in the possession of the neighboring rule Hummel . From 1454 to 1625 it belonged to the nobility of the nobility Doing . In 1628, this share was converted from a fief to an inheritance belonging to the owners of the castle court in Niedersteine, most recently the Earl of Magnis . After the Silesian wars, D√ºrrkunzendorf came together with the County of Glatz in 1763 with the Hubertusburger Frieden to Prussia . After the reorganization of Prussia, it had belonged to the province of Silesia since 1815, which was divided into counties. 1816-1853 was the district of Glatz, 1854-1932 the county of Neurode responsible. After its dissolution in 1933 D√ºrrkunzendorf belonged again to the district of Glatz. Since 1874 it formed together with the rural community Seifersdorf and agricultural estates same the District Seifersdorf [2] . As a consequence of the Second World War D√ºrrkunzendorf fell to Poland in 1945 and was renamed Suszyna . The German population was expelled in 1946. The newly settled inhabitants were partly home-displaced from Eastern Poland . 1975-1998, Suszyna belonged to the Wa≈Çbrzych voivodship (German Waldenburg ) Demography After 1945 the Poles settled here, according to data from 1947, the highest number of them came from the Cracow province - 203, and from Kres√≥w : from Lwow - 83 and Tarnopol - 66. The village lost its function as a resort. The airport and glider school were devastated (the school was run by a rural school ).

It is a farm to market road existing entirely within Galveston County that connects Santa Fe to Texas City via a short stretch of freeway known as the Emmett F. Lowry Expressway. The highway was designated in the 1950s. Route description The western terminus of FM 1764 is at State Highway 6 (SH 6) in Santa Fe. From there, the route heads north slightly and then east, through farmland approximately towards junctions with FM 2004 and Interstate 45 (I-45) near Texas City. At this point, FM 1764 transitions to a freeway segment which serves as a spur from I-45 into Texas City from points north‚Äîcontinuous travel between the western and eastern segments of FM 1764 requires use of frontage roads at the I-45 junction as there is no direct access. The freeway section, complete with frontage roads, is known as the Emmett F. Lowry Expressway and runs approximately between I-45 and SH 146 in Texas City. The expressway is named after Emmett F. Lowry, who served as mayor of Texas City from 1964 until his death in 1989 and was instrumental in the construction of the thoroughfare. Once inside Texas City, FM 1764 becomes a city street. From SH 146, it follows Palmer Highway eastward, then curves slightly to the south to become 9th Avenue North. The eastern end of FM 1764 is at the intersection of 9th Avenue North and 14th Street, adjacent to Texas City High School. History FM 1764 was first designated on May 23, 1951, and was defined to run from the then new routing of U.S. Route 75 (now I-45) east to SH 146. On December 17, 1952, the highway was expanded westward to its current terminus at SH 6 at Arcadia. On November 21, 1956, FM 1764 was extended east into Texas City to its current eastern terminus at 14th Street. On June 27, 1995 the internal designation of the route was changed to Urban Road 1764 (UR 1764). The designation reverted to FM 1764 with the elimination of the Urban Road system on November 15, 2018.

History Messenjah was formed in 1980 in Kitchener, Ontario and released their first album Rock You High independently in 1982. They were the first Canadian reggae band to be picked up by a major label; Warner Music Canada (also known as WEA). After 1985 the band began working out of Toronto. In 1988 the band was featured in the U.S. feature film Cocktail as well as on the film's soundtrack. They were also featured on the soundtrack of the Canadian produced movie Milk and Honey (1989). Messenjah had toured all over North America as well as in Jamaica for over sixteen years and in 1989 won the Juno Award for Best Reggae Recording.

After Errol Blackwood's departure Harvey became the head of the group. Other original band members include Eric Walsh (guitar), Raymond Ruddock (drums), Hal Duggan (keyboard) and Tony King (percussion). Four new members joined in 1987; Roy Garrick (drums), Crash Morgan (drums), Charles Sinclair (bass guitar) and Haile Yeates (percussion).

They were known as Unholy Descent until they changed their name to Vesperian Sorrow in early 1999. Their lyrics tend to be less extreme than most black metal bands that cover themes of Satanism and Anti-Christianity. They cover instead the cosmos, sorrow, sadness and darkness. Their name, Vesperian Sorrow, directly references this and translates to \\"sadness or sorrow in the evening hours.\\" After releasing their first demo, Unholy Descent in 1998, Vesperian Sorrow signed a deal with Displeased Records for the release of their debut album Beyond the Cursed Eclipse in 1999 and continued with their second album Psychotic Sculpture in 2001. Before their third release, the band toured North America expansively, and then went on short tours in England, Germany and the Czech Republic to promote the album. Their third album, Regenesis Creation, was released in 2006 by their own label, Underscape Records. Throughout 2007 and 2008, Vesperian Sorrow toured extensively across the U.S. and Canada, and played a couple of select festivals in Mexico. Most recently, in June 2009, they were handpicked for direct support for the band Mayhem, a pioneer in black metal, in Monterrey, Mexico.

History The Conference established the nautical date line and adopted an ideal form of the terrestrial time zone system for use at sea. It recommended that time changes required by changes of longitude be made in one-hour steps. This recommendation was adopted between 1920 and 1925 by all major fleets, including British, French and American. The rules applied to almost all naval ships and to many non-naval ships. Nevertheless, up to the Second World War, the old practice of keeping local apparent time prevailed on many independent merchant ships. Current usage The nautical date line is implied but not explicitly drawn on time zone maps. It follows the 180¬∞ meridian except where it is interrupted by territorial waters adjacent to land, forming gaps: it is a pole-to-pole dashed line. Ships are required to adopt the standard time of a country when they are within its territorial waters, but must revert to international time zones (15¬∞ wide pole-to-pole gores) as soon as they leave territorial waters. The 15¬∞ gore that is offset from GMT or UT1 (not UTC) by twelve hours is bisected by the nautical date line into two 7.5¬∞ gores that differ from GMT by ¬±12 hours. In reality nautical time zones are used only for radio communication etc. Internally on the ship, e.g. for work and meal hours, the ship may use a suitable time of its own choosing. This includes fixed installations such as oil rigs. For example, the Norwegian Ekofisk oil rigs are located in international water at longitude 3¬∞E but use Norwegian time.

Snyder. The film attempts to show just how devastating the illness can be to persons afflicted with the illness. Snyder's travels are chronicled for four years as she tries to find answers about the mysterious illness she was diagnosed with. The motivation for Snyder was her fluctuating partial improvements followed by relapses of debilitating symptoms she experienced. Snyder was given many contradictory diagnoses for her symptoms along with various drugs that were of no help to her. The movie explains that there are medical experts that refuse to believe the illness exists, and among those that do, no one knows what causes it, how a person acquires it, or how it may be cured. Snyder's movie researches the history of the disease which takes her to Florida where a cluster outbreak occurred in 1956, and to Lake Tahoe Nevada where many people became ill in the mid-1980s. The Florida victims were women who were \\"described in a medical journal as having hysterical paralysis.\\" She interviewed several of the women who became ill and later recovered. A group still meets to discuss their experiences with the illness. The Nevada group was a severe outbreak and Snyder interviewed treating doctor Daniel Peterson along with several of his patients. Peterson describes how the Centers for Disease Control investigated, but he does not believe that they intended to take the illness seriously. Peterson takes the illness very seriously, and seven of his patients have committed suicide. Several other notable individuals with Chronic fatigue syndrome are interviewed, and they clearly express their lengthy \\"excruciating misery\\" in battling the illness. The interviews included movie director Blake Edwards, United States Olympic soccer gold medalist Michelle Akers, and a high school senior in Connecticut, bedridden for two years who is transported by ambulance to his high school graduation. Snyder thoroughly investigates the illness but by the end of the movie few of the answers she sought at the beginning of her quest have been found. Snyder is a New York-based filmmaker who has worked widely on not-for-profit projects in the film world. Kim was struck down with CFIDS (Chronic Fatigue Immune Dysfunction Syndrome) in the mid-1990s while working as an assistant producer with Jodie Foster on Home For the Holidays.

Nautical time keeping dates back to the early 20th century as a standard way to keep time at sea, although it largely only applied to military fleets pre-World War 2. This time-keeping method is only used for radio communications and to account for slight inaccuracies that using Greenwich Standard Time (GST) may lead to during navigation of the high seas. Nautical time zones are split into one hour intervals for every 15 degree change in a ship's longitudinal coordinate. This is typically only used for trans-oceanic travel, as captains will often not change the timekeeping for short distances such as channels or inland seas.  History of nautical time  = Establishment = The establishment of nautical standard times, nautical standard time zones and the nautical date line were recommended by the Anglo-French Conference on Time-keeping at Sea in 1917. The conference recommended that the standard apply to all ships, both military and civilian. These zones were adopted by all major fleets between 1920 and 1925 but not by many independent merchant ships until World War II. = Letter suffixes = Around 1950, a letter suffix was added to the zone description, assigning Z to the zero zone, and A‚ÄìM (except J) to the east and N‚ÄìY to the west (J may be assigned to local time in non-nautical applications ‚Äî zones M and Y have the same clock time but differ by 24 hours: a full day). These can be vocalized using the NATO phonetic alphabet which pronounces the letter Z as Zulu, leading to the use of the term \\"Zulu Time\\" for Greenwich Mean Time, or UT1 from January 1, 1972 onward. Zone Z runs from 7¬∞30‚Ä≤W to 7¬∞30‚Ä≤E longitude, while zone A runs from 7¬∞30‚Ä≤E to 22¬∞30‚Ä≤E longitude, etc. These nautical letters have been added to some time zone maps, like the World Time Zone Map published by Her Majesty's Nautical Almanac Office (NAO), which extended the letters by adding an asterisk (*), a dagger (‚Ä†) or a dot (‚Ä¢) for areas that do not use a nautical time zone (areas that have a half-hour or quarter-hour offset, and areas that have an offset greater than 12 hours), and a section sign (¬ß) for areas that do not have a legal standard time (the Greenland ice sheet and Antarctica). The United Kingdom specifies UTC‚àí3 for the claimed British Antarctic Territory. In maritime usage, GMT retains its historical meaning of UT1, the mean solar time at Greenwich. UTC, atomic time at Greenwich, is too inaccurate, differing by as much as 0.9 seconds from UT1, creating an error of of a minute of longitude at all latitudes and which is at the equator but less at higher latitudes, varying roughly by the cosine of the latitude. However, DUT can be added to UTC to correct it to within 50 milliseconds of UT1, reducing the error to only . = Modern application = In practice, nautical times are used only for radio communication, etc. Aboard the ship, e.g. for scheduling work and meal times, the ship may use a suitable time of its own choosing. The captain is permitted to change his or her clocks at a chosen time following the ship's entry into another time zone, typically at midnight. Ships on long-distance passages change time zone on board in this fashion. On short passages the captain may not adjust clocks at all, even if they pass through different time zones, for example between the UK and continental Europe. Passenger ships often use both nautical and on-board time zones on signs. When referring to time tables and when communicating with land, the land time zone must be employed.  Usage  The nautical time zone system is an ideal form of the terrestrial time zone system for use on high seas. Under the system time changes are required for changes of longitude in one-hour steps. The one-hour step corresponds to a time zone width of 15¬∞ longitude. The 15¬∞ gore that is offset from GMT or UT1 (not UTC) by twelve hours is bisected by the nautical date line into two 7¬∞30‚Ä≤ gores that differ from GMT by ¬±12 hours. A nautical date line is implied but not explicitly drawn on time zone maps. It follows the 180th meridian except where it is interrupted by territorial waters adjacent to land, forming gaps: it is a pole-to-pole dashed line. Time on a ship's clocks and in a ship's log had to be stated along with a \\"zone description\\", which was the number of hours to be added to zone time to obtain GMT, hence zero in the Greenwich time zone, with negative numbers from ‚àí1 to ‚àí12 for time zones to the east and positive numbers from +1 to +12 to the west (hours, minutes, and seconds for nations without an hourly offset). These signs are different from those given in the List of UTC time offsets because ships must obtain GMT from zone time, not zone time from GMT. Nautical day Up to late 1805 the Royal Navy used three days: nautical, civil (or \\"natural\\"), and astronomical. For example, a nautical day of 10 July, would commence at noon on 9 July civil reckoning and end noon on 10 July civil reckoning, with PM coming before AM. The astronomical day of 10 July, would commence at noon of 10 July civil reckoning and ended at noon on 11 July. The astronomical day was brought into use following the introduction of the Nautical Almanac in 1767, and the British Admiralty issued an order ending the use of the nautical day on 11 October 1805. The US did not follow suit until 1848, while many foreign vessels carried on using it until the 1880s. Prior to 1920, all ships kept solar time on the high seas by setting their clocks at night or at the morning sight so that, given the ship's speed and direction, it would be 12 o'clock when the sun crossed the ship's meridian. The local apparent noon is 12 noon.

He is best remembered today for his close association with several famous operas composed by Giuseppe Verdi, whose birth year he shared. Career Specializing initially in the bel canto operas of Verdi's predecessor Gaetano Donizetti, Varesi began his career in Varese in 1834 and went on to sing in Faenza, Florence, Modena, Rome, Perugia and Genoa. By 1841 he was singing at La Scala, Milan, and from 1842 to 1847 he was in demand in Vienna, where he appeared at the K√§rntnertortheater. Here he created the role of Antonio in Donizetti's Linda di Chamounix as well as appearing in other works by the same composer. In 1844 he sang the role of Don Carlo in Ernani at Padua, his initial Verdi opera, and later appeared as the Doge in Verdi's I due Foscari. In 1847, in Florence, he was the first Macbeth in Verdi's opera of that name. Then, in 1851 at La Fenice, Venice, he created Verdi's Rigoletto, and in 1853, at the same house, he became Verdi's original Germont in La traviata. (Varesi disliked Germont's character but sang the part anyway.) He came to London in 1864 to perform Rigoletto ‚Äì probably his best known role ‚Äì at Her Majesty's Theatre. Varesi was admired for his intelligence, musicianship and acting ability as well for the exceptional quality of his voice. He set the scene for a succeeding generation of great Verdi baritones that included Francesco Graziani, Leone Giraldoni and Antonio Cotogni, while his chief contemporary rival was Giorgio Ronconi (the creator of Verdi's Nabucco). He was married to the operatic soprano Cecilia Boccabadatti Gazzudo. Their daughter, Elena (1844‚Äì1920), also sang as a soprano, opening a singing school in Chicago following her retirement from the stage. Elena's daughter, Gilda Varesi, was an actress and playwright.\\"Minute Visits in the Wings\\" New York Times (January 24, 1915): X7.

It is a remake of the Junkies' most famous album, The Trinity Session. The new album was recorded in the fall of 2006 at Toronto's Church of the Holy Trinity, the same venue where the original album was recorded.  Album production  In order to celebrate the twentieth anniversary of the Junkies defining album, The Trinity Session, the band decided to revisit and reinterpret the album, seeing what twenty years of performing experience would bring to the songs. In order to expand upon the goal of reinterpreting, the Cowboy Junkies invited three guest musicians whose work and lives were affected by the Trinity Session, and whose work has affected the Cowboy Junkies. Guest musicians on the 2007 album include Natalie Merchant, Ryan Adams and Vic Chesnutt. Each takes the lead vocal on one of the album's songs (Adams on \\"200 More Miles\\", Merchant on \\"To Love Is to Bury\\" and Chesnutt on \\"Postcard Blues\\"), and shares vocal and musical duties on other tracks. Jeff Bird, a session musician who has appeared on virtually every Cowboy Junkies album but has never been credited as an official band member, also appears. In order to create the same atmosphere, they kept rehearsal to a minimum, getting together for a few hours a day before the recording. The guest musicians worked with the band to re-imagine the songs, making suggestions, trying out fresh nuances. The album was also packaged with a performance film, Trinity Revisited, and a documentary film, Trinity Session Revisited, both by directors [Pierre and Fran√ßois Lamoureux of FogoLabs], who produced and recorded the album and the films. Although the album was not recorded with a single microphone like the original album, Fran√ßois Lamoureux aimed to be faithful to the idea, so he got a Holophone H2-Pro surround microphone and put the musicians in a circle, and augmented the recording with close-miking using ten Shure KSM141 mics. The Holophone surround mic picked up too much ambient sound from the church, and after mixing, only about 10 to 15 percent of the sound came from the surround mic. In 2008, Trinity Revisited was nominated for 5 Gemini Awards and won 2: Best Sound in a Comedy, Variety or Performing Arts Program or Series and Best Performance in a Performing Arts Program or Series. The same year, it was nominated for Music DVD of the Year at the Juno Awards. In Canada, the album and DVD were released on Strobosonic.

Heath (born 1962) is an American chemist and the president and professor of Institute of Systems Biology. Previous to this, he was the Elizabeth W. Gilloon Professor of Chemistry at the California Institute of Technology, after having moved from University of California Los Angeles.  Early years  Heath graduated with a degree in Chemistry in 1984 from Baylor University in Texas where he was an active member of the NoZe Brotherhood. He completed his Ph.D. in Physics and Chemistry from Rice University in 1988.  Academic career  From 1988 to 1991, he was a Miller Research Fellow at the Department of Chemistry, University of California, Berkeley. From 1991 to 1994, he was a Research Staff Member at IBM T.J. Watson Research Laboratory in Yorktown, New York. He joined the faculty at UCLA in 1994 and became Professor of Chemistry in 1997. He founded the California NanoSystems Institute in 2000 and served as its Director until moving to become the Elizabeth W. Gilloon Professor of Chemistry at Caltech.  Research  Heath's academic work has focused on quantum phase transitions and developed architectures, devices, and circuits for molecular electronics. More recently, his work has moved towards applying expertise in nanoscale and molecular systems to addressing problems in cancer and infectious diseases. When Heath was a graduate student at Rice University, he ran the experimental apparatus that generated the first C60 molecules and, ultimately, won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for the three senior members of the collaboration: Robert F. Curl and Richard E. Smalley of Rice University and Harold Kroto of the University of Sussex. This research is significant for the discovery of a new allotrope of carbon known as a fullerene. Other allotropes of carbon include graphite, diamond and graphene. James R. Heath's 1985 paper entitled \\"C60: Buckminsterfullerine\\", published with colleagues Harry Kroto, S. C. O‚ÄôBrien, R. F. Curl, and R. E. Smalley, was honored by a Citation for Chemical Breakthrough Award from the Division of History of Chemistry of the American Chemical Society, presented to Rice University in 2015. The discovery of fullerenes was recognized in 2010 by the designation of a National Historic Chemical Landmark by the American Chemical Society at the Richard E. Smalley Institute for Nanoscale Science and Technology at Rice University in Houston, Texas. Heath is known for publishing an architecture demonstration of molecular computers, or moletronics. In moletronics, single molecules serve as switches, \\"quantum wires\\" a few atoms thick serve as wiring, and the hardware is synthesized chemically from the bottom up. It was published in the summer of 1999 by Heath, J. Fraser Stoddart (at the time at UCLA) and their collaborators in the journal Science. As of 2011, Heath's research has split into one area devoted to solid-state quantum physics, materials science, and surface science, with a slight focus on energy conversion and another working on applying synthetic chemistry and a systems perspective to fundamental biology and translational medicine - with a clear focus on oncology.  Awards and honours  Heath has received several awards and honours for his research. He was awarded the 2000 Feynman Prize in Nanotechnology. He became a fellow of American Physical Society in 1999. In 2009, Heath was named one of the seven most powerful innovators of the world by Forbes magazine.  References   External links  * Research webpage of James R.

Solar flares have triggered a series of gargantuan natural disasters. Earthquakes and hellfire rock the globe. Air Force One has vanished from the skies with America's president on board. Now, with the U.S. on the narrow brink of nuclear apocalypse, Kirkland must pilot his oceangoing exploration ship, Deep Fathom, on a desperate mission miles below the ocean's surface. There devastating secrets await him - and a power an ancient civilization could not contain has been cast out into modern day. And it will forever alter a world that's already racing toward its own destruction. Synopsis The book starts off with three different perspectives of people across the world on a day of a solar eclipse, the first one of the new millennium. One of these characters happen around the President of the United States who is watching the eclipse from the island of Guam on a diplomatic mission with the Chinese. While the eclipse starts off fine, there are earthquakes on the island and the President is forced to evacuate on Air Force One. At the same time, Jack Kirkland is on an underwater salvage mission in the Pacific, trying to salvage gold bricks from a sunken Japanese ship when an underwater earthquake occurs causing an underwater volcanic eruption and the magma consequently consumes the ship taking all but one brick of the gold with it. Kirkland returns to his ship, a salvage boat - Deep Fathom, with the brick and shares the disappointment with his team when they are radioed by the U.S. Navy to go to a site close to where they are. Though reluctant, the Deep Fathom proceeds towards the co-ordinates given. On the other side, Canadian Professor Karen Grace and Professor Miyuki Nakano, Karen's Japanese friend from Ryukyu University, are in Okinawa trying to get to the jetty during a curfew. Undeterred by earthquakes, they escape from patrols and get to the boat which Karen had hired to take them to the twin dragons, submerged pyramids which had come above the sea level along with a whole city. When they get there they go to a large pyramid to explore but are interrupted with three men come from nowhere and ask them to leave. The women refuse and after being chased deep into the pyramid, they find a star-shaped crystal. Using the crystal, the women escape and return to Okinawa. Kirkland and his ship are requested to salvage at a crash site, which turns out to be the site where Air Force One crashed after taking off from Guam. Meanwhile, David Spangler, a covert operations commander and an old acquaintance of Kirkland is ordered by his boss in CIA and the vice-president to secure the black boxes of the crashed plane. Spangler, turns out to be the brother of Kirkland's fiancee, who was killed during a botched space mission, and now vengeful, blaming Jack for his sister's death. Spangler decides to kill Kirkland as a side operation. Kirkland uses the Deep Fathom's submersible to find the crash site and along with it, a huge crystal pillar sticking out the ground with the plane's debris all around it. He also finds that all the metal from the plane seems to be magnetized as they work to get the pieces above. Another peculiarity is that his submersible seems to lose contact to the ship every time he goes near the pillar and he takes more pictures for his team to study of the pillar. Kirkland and his team do not inform the Navy about the pillar but start investigating it on their own after they find ancient script on the pillar. Though slow work, they eventually find the plane's black boxes, which are taken away by Spangler who subsequently orders Deep Fathom off the site. The writing is the same as that found by Karen Grace in the pyramid tunnel. She responds to the emails and decides to meet with Kirkland at Okinawa. Before Kirkland leaves, Spangler sets up two bombs to kill everyone but the one with Kirkland goes out of range before Spangler could detonate it. Kirkland and Grace then go to the risen pyramids and are attacked by fighter jets, when they get away they are found by the people who tried to kill Karen the last time she was there. Only, this time they don't try to kill them. The men, one who is named Mwahu, take them back to Okinawa. When they meet with Miyuki they discover that the inscriptions are Rongorongo through the use of Miyuki's computer system which is an Artificial Intelligence system and how the same writing is found in many other places around the world theorizing that there was one major civilization which actually travelled and populated the other parts of the world. Soon Kirkland gets a call from his ship the Deep Fathom telling him they have a bomb aboard and when the phone terminates he believes that the bomb had exploded. Spangler, who had tapped into the call, is happy as Kirkland's ship and friends were now gone. Karen, Kirkland and Miyuki then go to the pyramid city with Mwahu to following the first civilizations clues but when they arrive they are attacked by Spangler's men. Karen is caught, but the others escape and Kirkland is found by the Deep Fathom's crew who are still alive because they defused the bomb and sent out a false message to trick Spangler. Kirkland decides to rescue Karen and when he arrives on Spangler's ship he is fought off by Spangler and his men. Kirkland's team finds out that soon the world is going to be destroyed when a new solar flare hits the pillar by the crash site of Air Force One. Karen is taken to an underwater research base by the pillar where she is kept as prisoner. When she can send them a message they decide another strategy of rescuing Karen. When Kirkland leaves this time in his submersible towards the underwater station he is attacked by Spangler in another submersible. After a brief fight Spangler is killed by the giant squid which tried to attack Kirkland earlier. Kirkland manages to get on board the deserted underwater base and is told by his team aboard his ship that they are going to destroy the pillar to prevent the destruction of the Earth by shooting it with a particle beam from a satellite that Kirkland had placed in space during his space mission. When the pillar is destroyed, the world goes on like it would have on the day of the eclipse without the devastating earthquakes.

The urethral sphincters are two muscles used to control the exit of urine in the urinary bladder through the urethra. The two muscles are either the male or female external urethral sphincter and the internal urethral sphincter. When either of these muscles contracts, the urethra is sealed shut. The external urethral sphincter originates at the ischiopubic ramus and inserts into the intermeshing muscle fibers from the other side. It is controlled by the deep perineal branch of the pudendal nerve. Activity in the nerve fibers constricts the urethra. * The internal sphincter muscle of urethra: located at the bladder's inferior end and the urethra's proximal end at the junction of the urethra with the urinary bladder. The internal sphincter is a continuation of the detrusor muscle and is made of smooth muscle, therefore it is under involuntary or autonomic control. This is the primary muscle for prohibiting the release of urine. * The female or male external sphincter muscle of urethra (sphincter urethrae): located in the deep perineal pouch, at the bladder's distal inferior end in females, and inferior to the prostate (at the level of the membranous urethra) in males. It is a secondary sphincter to control the flow of urine through the urethra. Unlike the internal sphincter muscle, the external sphincter is made of skeletal muscle, therefore it is under voluntary control of the somatic nervous system.  Sex differences  In males and females, both internal and external urethral sphincters function to inhibit the release of urine. In males, the internal sphincter muscle of urethra functions to prevent reflux of seminal fluids into the male bladder during ejaculation. Females do have a more elaborate external sphincter muscle than males as it is made up of three parts: the sphincter urethrae, urethrovaginal muscle, and the compressor urethrae. The urethrovaginal muscle fibers wrap around the vagina and urethra and contraction leads to constriction of both the vagina and the urethra. The origin of the compressor urethrae muscle is the right and left inferior pubic ramus and it wraps anteriorly around the urethra so when it contracts it squeezes the urethra against the vagina. The external urethrae, like in males, wraps solely around the urethra. Congenital abnormalities of the female urethra can be surgically repaired with vaginoplasty.  Function  The internal urethral sphincter provides involuntary control of urination. The external urethral sphincter provides voluntary control of urination. Any damage to these muscles can lead to urinary incontinence.  Clinical significance  The urethral sphincter is considered an integral part in maintaining urinary continence, and it is important to understand its role in some conditions: * Stress urinary incontinence is a common problem related to the function of the urethral sphincter. Weak pelvic floor muscles, intrinsic sphincter damage, or damage to the surrounding nerves and tissue can make the urethral sphincter incompetent, and subsequently, it will not close fully, leading to stress urinary incontinence. In women, childbirth, obesity, and age can all be risk factors, especially by weakening the pelvic floor muscles. In men, prostate surgery (prostatectomy, TURP, etc) and radiation therapy can damage the sphincter and cause stress incontinence. * Neurogenic bladder dysfunction can involve a malfunctioning urethral sphincter. * Urge incontinence can happen when the urethra can't hold the urine in as the bladder contracts uncontrollably.

His principal mediums are antler, horn, ivory, and bronze, from which he creates sculpture in his signature style, a juxtaposition of abstract organic and non-organic shapes, best seen in his moose skull sculpture \\"Duality\\". Originally beginning with other art forms which included drawing, acrylic painting and clay sculpture, his interest in antler carving was sparked in 1985 when he attended a show of antler carvings by Maureen Morris, a well-known sculptor from Atlin, British Columbia. After moving to the Yukon in 1987, Shane began experimenting with antler carving and found great creative and tactile potential in the medium. He has since worked in antler, bone, horn, mammoth tusk, stone, and now bronze. His bronze series entitled \\"Skullpture\\"http://www.skullpture.ca/ includes cast, carved skulls of moose, wolf, seal, grizzly and black bear, human and wolverine. Shane has taught the art of antler carving during Red Deer College's \\"Series: Summer School of the Visual Arts\\". The 2007 Canada Winter Games Torches In 2006, Shane was commissioned to create three torches to be used in the pan-Northern Relay prior to the 2007 Canada Winter Games. Each torch was carved from a full caribou antler, and each was representative of one of the three Canadian Territories. The Great Antler Heist On Saturday, September 15, 2007, Whitehorse, Yukon was hit by the \\"Great Antler Heist\\" or \\"Yukon's Thomas Crown Affair\\", as it was variously dubbed in the national media. During an unplanned, city-wide power outage at approximately 6:30 am, a thief or thieves broke into the Canada Games Center and stole the giant piece \\"Yukon Seasons\\", carved from a complete moose skull and antler set. It was the only item taken during the brazen robbery. On April 8, 2008 an anonymous person returned Yukon Seasons to the Whitehorse detachment of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP). The person was not associated with the theft, according to the RCMP spokesperson. Apart from some discolouration and a broken tine (recovered at the scene of the crime), Yukon Seasons was recovered intact. On December 2, 2008, the restored Yukon Seasons was unveiled to the public in its old home at the Canada Games Centre in Whitehorse, Yukon. Valery Monahan, a conservator with the Yukon Government, performed the restorative work on the sculpture. Yukon Government Minister for Tourism and Culture, Elaine Taylor and Whitehorse Mayor, Pam Buckway, were on hand for the opening and spoke at the event. Shane Wilson was also in attendance and thanked those who helped with the recovery and restoration of the sculpture.

The Devil's Charter is an early Jacobean era stage play, a tragedy written by Barnabe Barnes. The play recounts the story of Pope Alexander VI. Date, performance, publication The Devil's Charter dates from 1607; it was acted by the King's Men at Court before King James I on Candlemas (2 February) of that year. The play was entered into the Stationers' Register on 16 October 1607, and published before the end of the year, in a quarto printed by George Eld for the bookseller John Wright. Barnes dedicated the play to Sir William Pope and to William Herbert, 3rd Earl of Pembroke. The 1607 quarto is the sole edition of the play prior to the 20th century.E. K. Chambers, The Elizabethan Stage, 4 Volumes, Oxford, Clarendon Press, 1923; Vol. 3, pp. 214-15.  Plot synopsis  The play opens with a dumbshow prologue that shows Roderigo making a deal with the devil to become Pope Alexander VI. Lodowick convinces Charles of France to go to war against Italy on religious grounds. Two gentlemen lambast the pope's corruption. Gismond and Barbarossa intercept some slander against the pope and Gismond and are upset, promising to find and punish the writer. The Pope soliloquizes about how he made this deal with the devil for the betterment of his sons, Candy and Caesar. He divides Italy and the surrounding territories between them and gives them each a swath to rule. Caesar and the Pope pontificate about ruling well and fighting wars in the name of religion. Candy leaves to go deal with the ambassador come to make a marriage with the Lady Saunce. Lucretia prepares to murder her husband Gismond for keeping her shut away. They trade barbs about jealousy and virtue. She ties him up, makes him sign a statement that he slandered her, her father the pope, her brothers Caesar and Candy, and also Sforza, and then stabs him many times. She then stages it to look like he killed himself out of regret over locking her up and retires to bed. A servant and Barbarossa discover the body and she feigns shock and grief. She makes a scene and threatens to kill herself as well. The Chorus tells us that King Charles is marching on Italy with about 20000 troops. Alexander, Caesar, and Candy prepare for battle against King Charles. Alexander and Charles parley and can't come to an agreement‚ÄîCharles wants to conquer Rome, and Alexander won't yield the Castell Angelo. Charles's companions call Alexander the antichrist and call on Charles to remove him from the throne. Charles and Alexander reach an accord. The Chorus tells us that after this, Charles dies, territory changes hands a couple times, and the rest of the play really only concerns the Pope and Caesar. The Pope sends a messenger with a ruby to Astor bidding him to come visit. Astor is the Pope's captive for sexual reasons. Astor is insulted by this request. The Pope comes out of a casement to beg/woo Astor to come to him. Astor resists and resists and then excuses himself for mass. The Pope tells his servant to make sure Astor visits after mass because he cannot breathe without him. Caesar hires Frescobaldi, a ruffian, to do some nefarious work. Frescobaldi recites his qualifications, his mettle in battle, etc. Candy suspects that his sister Lucretia murdered her husband Gismond and calls her in for questioning. Frescobaldi sets up his post to do his dirty work. Baglioni stumbles across him and the two become friends. Frescobaldi dismisses Baglioni and gets back to work. Caesar and Frescobaldi trip and stab Candy. Frescobaldi hauls Candy's body up to toss it over the bridge, and Caesar pushes Frescobaldi after. Caesar crows about how no one will suspect his crimes since he's a cardinal. He plots to frame Sforza for the murder and to kill his sister Lucretia next. The Pope conjures devils to find out who murdered Candy and Gismond, and is horrified when he finds out Caesar and Lucretia are responsible. He vows that they (and Astor) must die. The Pope accuses Caesar of murdering Candy, and Caesar accuses the Pope of incest, murder, sodomy, lust, etc. They both agree to conceal the other's sins in order to keep the status quo. Lucretia puts on poisoned makeup and dies. Caesar lays siege to Countess Katharine of Furli, Sforza's daughter. She refuses to yield and he reveals that he has kidnapped her two sons. She still refuses to yield even to save their lives and Caesar orders their execution. They fight in battle and Katharine is captured. Caesar reveals that her sons are alive and her fortune is intact, and orders the three of them sent to Rome. Barbarossa is instructed to govern Furli without restriction and give the people their liberty. The Pope arranges for Astor and his brother Philippo to be drugged to sleep, then places an asp on both their chests and they die. Other lords suspect foul play. Caesar discharges his army with good pay and then hires Baglioni to kill Rozzi, an apothecary. Bernardo arrives to collect some powders and poisons from Rozzi. Rozzi sets down his bottles to read a letter. Baglioni drinks from the bottles while he waits to shoot Rozzi. The bottle are poisoned. Bernardo leaves with the potions. Baglioni shoots Rozzi. The Pope and Caesar discuss their plans to poison Cardinal Caraffa at a banquet that night. The Devil arrives at the banquet and plays switcheroo with the poisoned bottles. The Pope and Caesar poison themselves. Caesar stabs Bernardo for the mix up. The Cardinals depart to save themselves. The devils Belchar, Astaroth, and Varca plan to hurry the Pope to hell. The Pope tries to repent and has difficulty accessing his conscience. He retires to his study and finds the Devil there waiting for him. The Pope tries to exorcise the Devil and cannot. They look over the contract he made in exchange for becoming Pope, and because of some tricky math, it is for eleven years and seven days, though the Pope thought it was for eighteen years and eight days. They argue over the terms and the Devil tells the Pope to prepare for eternal torment. The Devil shows the Pope the ghosts of stabbed Candy and poisoned Lucretia‚Äîthe Pope is poisoned in retribution for poisoning Lucretia, while Caesar will be stabbed in retribution for stabbing Candy. A bunch of devils arrive to take the Pope down to hell. Two Cardinals find his corpse and order Rome's bells to be run in Thanksgiving for being delivered from this wicked pope. Special features The play is notable among scholars of English Renaissance theatre for its unusually full stage directions, which reveal much about the dramatic style of the leading company of the age -- and for the fact that those stage directions specify the play's characters carrying their props onto the stage with them. Since the characters are historical personages (Charles VIII of France, Lodovico Sforza, Cesare Borgia, and Francesco Guicciardini among others), the effect can be odd and striking; at the start of Act I, scene v, Lucrezia Borgia enters carrying a chair, \\"which she planteth upon the stage.\\"F. E. Halliday, A Shakespeare Companion 1564-1964, Baltimore, Penguin, 1964; p. 135. Characters murder other characters, then drag the bodies offstage. The text of The Devil's Charter is rich with intellectual, historical, and contemporary Jacobean references.Tanya Pollard, Drugs and Theater in Early Modern England, Oxford, Oxford University Press, 2005; pp. 81-100 and ff. It is not accidental that this anti-Catholic play was written and produced in the aftermath of the Gunpowder Plot of 1605; Protestant propagandists found the story of the Borgia family a useful resource. The story was dramatized again by Nathaniel Lee in his Caesar Borgia (1679).Pauline Kews, \\"Otway, Lee, and the Restoration History Play,\\" in: A Companion to Restoration Drama. Susan J. Owen, ed. London, Blackwell, 2001; pp. 370-1. The devil The Devil in the play's title is literal rather than metaphorical; Alexander conjures up Astaroth to aid him in his climb to power. (Barnes's play reflects the influences of earlier devil plays, notably Marlowe's Doctor Faustus.) The diabolism of the plot provides opportunities for sensationalism, with multiple ghosts, and stage spectacle, as in the conjuring scene IV,i. (The stage directions there give the King's Men some latitude in special effects: Alexander conjures up an infernal king with a red face, who is \\"riding upon a lion, or dragon.\\") At the start of V,v, Astaroth calls up two fellow devils, Belchar and Varca; they converse and dance. In the next and concluding scene, Astaroth, wearing the papal robes, surprises Alexander; the pope learns that the devil has planted tricky arithmetic in their written contract, and that his reign is over years sooner than he expected. Amid thunder and lightning, a horde of devils drag Alexander to Hell.

Fox with their fictitious band The Barbusters in the 1987 film Light of Day. The song has since become a staple in Jett's concerts. The song appeared on the Light of Day soundtrack album. As a single, it reached number 33 on the Billboard Hot 100 in April 1987, and it was credited to The Barbusters (Joan Jett and The Blackhearts) on the record label. It received additional album-oriented rock airplay due to its Jett and Springsteen connection. A music video featuring The Barbusters performing the song, interspersed with numerous scenes from the rest of the film, was popular on MTV. The song has also appeared on several Jett compilation albums. In 2011 American Songwriter named \\"Light of Day\\" their Favorite Movie Song. Lyrics \\"Light of Day\\" is a powerful guitar-driven, roadhouse-flavored stomper that features Springsteen's usual automotive imagery and includes some of his heartland rock sentiments as well as some of the film's sensibility: The song's lyrics focus on the quest for happiness amidst life's difficult circumstances, told through the eyes of a person driving and traveling the nation and world in search of something better, only to find that it really existed at home all along. Song's inspiration and use by Springsteen The tale is told that Springsteen donated the song to film director Paul Schrader as loose payment for his having appropriated Schrader's working title for this film for the song \\"Born in the U.S.A..\\"American Top 40, March 21, 1987 (the song also debuts in the countdown that week). The song was originally written for the Born in the U.S.A. album, and recorded by Springsteen in 1983. That version remains unreleased. Springsteen subsequently featured \\"Light of Day\\" heavily in his own concerts; it showed up during his 1987 Jersey Shore club appearances, then served as the main set closer throughout his 1988 Tunnel of Love Express, 1992-1993 \\"Other Band\\", 1995 (six shows with Joe Grushecky and the Houserockers in a band featuring Springsteen on lead guitar and occasional lead vocal) and 1999-2000 Reunion Tours. Two such performances were captured in the 1993 In Concert/MTV Plugged and 2000 Live in New York City videos and albums, but any particular rendering could be extended to arbitrary length via Springsteen raps, vamps, stage hijinks, and false endings. The song has rarely been performed since The Rising Tour, where it only appeared one time ‚Äî on the last day of the tour. It was played four times on the 2007-2008 Magic Tour and eleven times on the 2012-2013 Wrecking Ball World Tour. It made a more permanent return on the High Hopes Tour in 2014, where it resumed its traditional position as set closer. It was performed a few times in 2015 by Springsteen and one time on The River Tour 2016 with special guests Joe and Johnny Grushecky. On June 29, 2017 it was performed together again on the stage of the Canadian National Arts Center, for the public induction of Michael J. Fox in the Governor General's performing arts awards 2017.https://nac-cna.ca/en/event/15249  References  Category:1987 singles Category:Joan Jett songs Category:Bruce Springsteen songs Category:Songs written by Bruce Springsteen Category:Songs written for films ","title":"Light of Day (song)"},{"id":"14098972","text":"Nowy Giera≈Çt√≥w () is a village in the administrative district of Gmina Stronie ≈ölƒÖskie, within K≈Çodzko County, Lower Silesian Voivodeship, in south-western Poland, near the border with the Czech Republic.

It is located at the junction of the urethra with the urinary bladder and is continuous with the detrusor muscle, but anatomically and functionally fully independent from it., page 29, Preview Amazon. It is composed of smooth muscle, so it is under the control of the autonomic nervous system, specifically the sympathetic nervous system. Function Image showing the sphincter in a female, and demonstrating its action to prevent urination. This is the primary muscle for maintaining continence of urine, a function shared with the external urethral sphincter which is under voluntary control. It prevents urine leakage as the muscle is tonically contracted via sympathetic fibers traveling through the inferior hypogastric plexus and vesical nervous plexus. Specifically, it is controlled by the hypogastric nerve, predominantly via the alpha-1 receptor. During urination, the preganglionic neurons of this sympathetic pathway are inhibited via signals arising in the pontine micturition center and traveling through the descending reticulospinal tracts, allowing the muscle to relax. During ejaculation, the muscle contracts to prevent reflux of semen into the urinary bladder, a phenomenon called retrograde ejaculation. Spasms of the internal urethral sphincter are associated with penile erection. Because the internal urethral sphincter is under involuntary control, it is believed to play a role in paruresis, in which a person who perceives oneself to be under observation is unable to urinate.

Signs and symptoms The histiocytosis of Destombes‚ÄìRosai‚ÄìDorfman disease can occur in lymph nodes, causing lymphadenopathy, or can occur outside lymph nodes in extranodal disease. =Lymphadenopathy= Lymphadenopathy can occur in one or more groups of lymph nodes. Among 358 cases of Destombes‚ÄìRosai‚ÄìDorfman disease that Rosai collected in a disease registry for which the location of lymphadenopathy was specified, 87.3% had cervical lymphadenopathy. Axillary, inguinal, and mediastinal lymphadenopathy are also found in Destombes‚ÄìRosai‚ÄìDorfman disease. =Extranodal disease= Accumulation of histiocytes may occur outside of lymph nodes. The most common sites of extranodal disease in Rosai's registry were skin, nasal cavity/paranasal sinuses, soft tissue, eyelid/orbit, bone, salivary glands, and central nervous system. The symptoms of this disease vary with the site of accumulation similar to other regional tumors. For instance, accumulation in closed spaces such as the cranium can lead to poor outcomes compared to growth in the dermis of an extremity where surgical excision is possible. Cause The etiology of the condition is unknown. Possible but unproven infectious causes are Klebsiella, polyomaviridae, Epstein‚ÄìBarr virus, parvovirus B19, and human herpesvirus 6. Jilin University researchers suggested in 2017 that monocytes recruited to inflammatory lesions could produce macrophage colony-stimulating factor, which leads to a complex signal transduction, which leads to the histiocytosis characteristic of Destombes- Rosai‚ÄìDorfman disease. Diagnosis The differential diagnosis of Destombes‚ÄìRosai‚ÄìDorfman disease includes both malignant and nonmalignant diseases, such as granulomatosis with polyangiitis, Langerhans cell histiocytosis, Langerhans cell sarcoma, lymphoma, sarcoidosis, IgG4-related disease, and tuberculosis. The disease is diagnosed by biopsy of affected tissues. Microscopic examination of stained specimens will show histiocytes with lymphocytes and possibly other types of cells trapped within them, a phenomenon known as emperipolesis. Upon immunohistochemical staining, the histiocytes will be positive for S100, CD68, and CD163 but negative for CD1a. =Classification= In 2016 the Histiocyte Society proposed a classification of histiocytoses into five groups designated by letters: \\"C\\", \\"H\\", \\"L\\", \\"M\\", and \\"R\\". Group \\"R\\" included Rosai‚ÄìDorfman disease and \\"miscellaneous noncutaneous, non-Langerhans cell histiocytoses\\". Rosai‚ÄìDorfman disease itself was classified into \\"Familial\\", \\"Classical (nodal)\\", \\"Extranodal\\", \\"Neoplasia- associated\\", and \\"Immune disease-associated\\" subtypes. Treatment Some patients have no symptoms, spontaneous remission,Sardana, D., Goyal, A. and Gauba, K., 2015. Sinus histiocytosis with massive lymphadenopathy: a ‚Äúmassive‚Äù misnomer. Diagnostic cytopathology, 43(4), pp.315-319. or a relapsing/remitting course, making it difficult to decide whether therapy is needed. In 2002, authors from Sapienza University of Rome stated on the basis of a comprehensive literature review that \\"clinical observation without treatment is advisable when possible\\". Therapeutic options include surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy. Surgery is used to remove single lymph nodes, central nervous system lesions, or localized cutaneous disease. In 2014, Dalia and colleagues wrote that for patients with extensive or systemic Destombes‚ÄìRosai‚ÄìDorfman disease, \\"a standard of care has not been established\\" concerning radiotherapy and chemotherapy. History In 1965, Pierre-Paul Louis Lucien Destombes had described, in French, four patients having \\"adenitis with lipid excess\\" which is recognized as the original description of the condition. Therefore, the condition is sometimes called \\"Destombes- Rosai-Dorfman disease\\". Four years later, in 1969, pathologists Juan Rosai and Ronald Dorfman published a paper on \\"sinus histiocytosis with massive lymphadenopathy\\". With the discoveries that the condition can occur outside the head/neck region and in tissues other than lymph nodes, the condition later became known as \\"Rosai-Dorfman disease\\".

In case of potential speeding, a human driver can be alerted, or the speed reduced automatically. Intelligent speed adaptation uses information about the road to determine the required speed. Information can be obtained from knowledge of the vehicle position, taking into account speed limits known for the position, and by interpreting road features such as signs. ISA systems are designed to detect and alert a driver when a vehicle has entered a new speed zone, or when different speed limits are in force according to time of day and conditions. Many ISA systems also provide information about driving hazards (e.g. high pedestrian movement areas, railway crossings, schools, hospitals, etc.) and limits enforced by speed and CCTV cameras at traffic lights. The purpose of ISA is to assist the driver to maintain a safe speed. Research has found that, in urban areas, the number of crashes causing casualties is doubled for each over the limit.  Active and passive ISA  The two types of ISA systems differ in that passive systems simply warn the driver of the vehicle travelling in excess of the speed limit, while active systems intervene and correct the vehicle's speed to conform with the speed limit. Passive systems are generally driver advisory systems: They alert the driver to the fact that they are speeding, provide information as to the speed limit, and allow the driver to make a choice on what action should be taken. These systems usually display visual or auditory cues, such as auditory and visual warnings and may include tactile cues such as a vibration of the accelerator pedal. Some passive ISA technology trials have used vehicles modified to provide haptic feedback by making the accelerator pedal stiffer when appropriate to alert the driver. Most active ISA systems allow the driver to override the ISA when deemed necessary; this is thought to enhance acceptance and safety, but leaves a significant amount of speeding unchecked. An often unrecognised feature of both active and passive ISA systems is that they can serve as on-board vehicle data recorders, retaining information about vehicle location and performance for later checking and fleet management purposes.  Speed and location determination and verification  There are four types of technology available for determining local speed limits on a road and the speed of the vehicle: * Position-based systems * Radio beacons * Optical recognition * Dead reckoning = Position-based systems= GPS is based on a network of satellites that constantly transmit radio signals. GPS receivers pick up these transmissions and compare the signals from several satellites in order to pinpoint the receiver's location to within a few meters. This is done by comparing the time at which the signal was sent from the satellite to when it was picked up by the receiver. Because the orbital paths of the satellites are known very accurately, the receiver can perform a calculation based on its distance to several of the orbiting satellites and therefore obtain its position. There are currently 31 satellites making up the GPS network, and their orbits are configured so that a minimum of five satellites are available at any one time for terrestrial users. Four satellites are the minimum required to determine a precise three-dimensional position. The popularity of in-car navigation systems may give the impression that GPS is flawless, but it is subject to a number of fundamental problems. =Radio beacons= Roadside radio beacons, or bollards, work by transmitting data to a receiver in the car. The beacons constantly transmit data that the car-mounted receiver picks up as it passes each beacon. This data could include local speed limits, school zones, variable speed limits, or traffic warnings. If sufficient numbers of beacons were placed at regular intervals, they could calculate vehicle speed based on how many beacons the vehicle passed per second. Beacons could be placed in/on speed signs, utility poles, other roadside fixtures, or in the road itself. Mobile beacons could be deployed in order to override fixed beacons for use around accident scenes, during poor weather, or during special events. Beacons could be linked to a main computer so that quick changes could be made. The use of radio beacons is common when ISA systems are used to control vehicle speeds in off-road situations, such as factory sites, logistics and storage centres, where occupational health and safety requirements mean that very low vehicle speeds are required in the vicinity of workers, and in situations of limited or obscured visibility. =Optical recognition systems= Optical recognition technology has focused on recognizing speed signs and road markings; other roadside objects, such as the reflective \\"cats' eyes\\" that divide lanes could possibly be used. This system requires the vehicle to pass a speed sign or similar indicator and for data about the sign or indicator to be registered by a scanner or a camera system. As the system recognizes a sign, the speed limit data is obtained and compared to the vehicle's speed. The system would use the speed limit from the last sign passed until it detects and recognizes a speed sign with a different limit. If speed signs are not present, the system does not function. This is a particular problem when exiting a side road onto a main road, as the vehicle may not pass a speed sign for some distance. There can also be a problem taking a vehicle from a Miles Per Hour (MPH) country to a KiloMetres per Hour (KMH) one and vice versa, particularly if it is difficult or impossible to adjust the system to use the correct measurement. It is also possible to use computer vision to determine the assured clear distance ahead. = Dead reckoning = Dead reckoning (DR) uses a mechanical system linked to the vehicle's driving assembly in order to predict the path taken by the vehicle. By measuring the rotation of the road wheels over time, a fairly precise estimation of the vehicle's speed and distance traveled can be made. Dead reckoning requires the vehicle to begin at a known, fixed point. Then, by combining speed and distance data with factors such as the angle of the steering wheel and feedback from specialized sensors (e.g., accelerometers, flux gate compass, gyroscope) it can plot the path taken by the vehicle. By overlaying this path onto a digital map, the DR system knows approximately where the vehicle is, what the local speed limit is, and the speed at which the vehicle is traveling. The system can then use information provided by the digital map to warn of upcoming hazards or points of interest and to provide warnings if the speed limit is exceeded. Dead reckoning is prone to cumulative measurement errors such as variations between the assumed circumference of the tyres compared to the actual dimension (which is used to calculate vehicle speed and distance traveled). These variations in the tyre circumference can be due to wear or variations in tyre pressure due to variations in speed, payload, or ambient temperature. Other measurement errors are accumulated when the vehicle navigates gradual curves that inertial sensors (e.g. gyroscopes and/or accelerometers) are not sensitive enough to detect or due to electromagnetic influences on magnetic flux compasses (e.g., from passing under power lines or when travelling across a steel bridge) and through underpasses and road tunnels. Some top-end GPS-based navigation systems currently on the market use dead reckoning as a backup system in case the GPS signal is lost.  Limitations  =General limitations= An initial reaction to the concept of ISA is that there could be negative outcomes, such as driving at the speed limit rather than to the conditions, but numerous ISA trials around the World have shown these concerns are unsubstantiated. A particular issue is that most ISA systems use a speed database based purely on information regarding the posted maximum speed limit for a roadway or roadway segment. Many roads have features such as curves and gradients where the appropriate speed for a road segment with these features is less than the posted maximum speed limit. Increasingly, road authorities indicate the appropriate speed for such segments through the use of advisory speed signage to alert drivers on approach that there are features which require a reduction in travelling speed. It is recognised that the speed limit databases used in ISA systems should ideally take account of posted advisory speeds as well as posted maximum speed limits. The New South Wales ISA trial, underway in the Illwarra region south of Sydney currently, is the only trial that is using posted advisory speeds as well as posted maximum speed limits. Some car manufacturers have expressed concern that some types of speed limiters take control away from the driver. Some ISA systems do have provision for over-ride by the driver in the event that the set speed is inappropriate. For some traffic safety practitioners, active intelligent speed adaptation is thought to be an example of 'hard automation', an approach to automation that has been largely discredited by the Human Factors community. An inviolable characteristic of human users is that they will adapt to these systems, often in unpredictable ways. Some studies have shown that drivers 'drive up to the limits' of the system and drive at the set speed, compared to when they are in manual control, where they have been shown to slow down. Conversely, the experience of some drivers with driving under an active ISA system has been that they find they can pay more attention to the roadway and road environment as they no longer need to monitor the speedometer and adjust their speeds on a continuing basis. There is also concern that drivers driving under speed control might accept more risky headways between themselves and vehicles in front and accept much narrower gaps to join traffic (this fact drawing particular criticism from motorcycling groups). Wider criticism also comes from the insistent focus on speed and that road safety outcomes could be better achieved by focusing on driving technique, situational awareness, and automation that 'assists' drivers rather than 'forces' them to behave in particular ways. Intelligent speed adaptation has also been held as an example of a technology which, like speed cameras, can often alienate the driving public and represents a significant barrier to its widespread adoption. Some studies which pre-date the development of ISA systems indicated that drivers make relatively little use of the speedometer and instead use auditory cues (such as engine and road noise) to successfully regulate their speed. There is an argument in the literature that suggests that as cars have become quieter and more refined speed control has become more difficult for drivers to perform. Thus an alternative 'soft-automation' approach is simply to re- introduce some of those cues that drivers naturally use to regulate speed (rather than incur the expense and unexpected behavioral adaptations of ISA). =Criticism of the draft regulation= The European draft regulation of Intelligent Speed Assistance faces criticismhttps://etsc.eu/concerns-raised- over-draft-technical-specifications-for-mandatory-intelligent-speed- assistance-isa-systems/: * risk of ISA systems which only alerts drivers without providing them a feedback, * risk of system which do not identify the correct speed limit, * risk of too easy user deactivation.  Benefits  A British study estimates that ISA could reduce fatalities by half. RTA (NSW Australia) ISA trial results showed the benefits of ISA are improved speed zone compliance with reduction in the level and duration of speeding. A cost- benefit analysis of ISA (in Australia) published in April 2010 by the Centre for Automotive Safety Research suggested advisory ISA would reduce injury crashes by 7.7% and save $1,226 million per year. These figures were 15.1% and $2,240 million for supportive ISA and 26.4% and $3,725 million for limiting ISA. The confirmation by the Australian research of the benefits of ISA have resulted in the recommendation for wider adoption and promotion of ISA in the Australian National Road Safety Strategy 2011-2020. Real and perceived benefits of ISA are a reduction of accident risks and reductions of noise and exhaust emissions.  Commercial use  ISA sees widespread commercial use in Australia. This advanced commercialisation of ISA has in part been underpinned by initiatives from the various state roads authorities, and the inclusion of ISA in the National and State Road Safety Strategies. SpeedAlert is a passive ISA product marketed by Smart Car Technologies, based in Sydney NSW. It offers full national speed zoning information embedded within a GPS-based navigation system, providing drivers with information on speed limits and vehicle speed, as well as related information on locations such as schools, railway level crossings, and speed camera sites. SpeedShield is an active ISA product marketed by Automotion Control Systems, based in Melbourne, Vic. It offers speed zoning information embedded within a GPS-based navigation system, providing drivers with information on speed limits and vehicle speed and is combined with technology that intervenes and controls the vehicle speed to no faster than the posted speed limit for that section of roadway. The technology is generally transferable across vehicle manufacturers and models, but must be configured for an individual make and model. Coredination ISA is a passive ISA product marketed by Coredination, based in Stockholm, Sweden. This product is built as a smartphone-application for Android and iPhone. It offers full national speed zoning information, providing drivers with information on speed limits and vehicle speed. The product is very lightweight and no separate hardware or fixed installations are necessary. Government implementation As of 2012, five out of the 35 governments associated with the ETSC agreed to introduce ISA in all vehicles.http://archive.etsc.eu/documents/Intelligent_Speed_Assistance_FAQs_2013.pdf As of 2013 adoption of the technology was being considered by the European Commission but was being strongly opposed by UK transport secretary, Patrick McLoughlin. A government spokesman described the proposal as \\"Big Brother nannying by EU bureaucrats.\\" In 2019 however, it was finally agreed to adopt the new technology in all new cars by 2022EU will require all new cars to be fitted with speed-limiting technology by 2022  See also  * Advanced driver-assistance systems * Intelligent transportation system * Intelligent vehicle technologies * Map database management * Speed limiter * Telematics * Traffic sign recognition * Usage-based insurance  External links  * http://ecomodder.com/forum/showthread.php/diy-smart-cruise-control-30471.html * http://www.speedalert.com.au/faqgeneral_1 * http://users.tpg.com.au/users/mpaine/speed.html * http://www.isaweb.be/english/ISA-trials/index.html References = Other references = * Basnayake C, Mezentsev O, Lachapelle G and Cannon M (2004) \\"A Portable Vehicular Navigation System Using High Sensitivity GPS Augmented with Inertial Sensors and Map-Matching\\", SAE Paper 2004-01-0748. * Biding T (2002) \\"Intelligent Speed Adaptation\\", Swedish National Road Administration. * Calafell J, Foyer P and Porooshasp K (2000) \\"Navigation Systems in Europe: Past, Present and Future\\", SAE Paper 2000-01-1298. * Carsten O (2000) \\"External Vehicle Speed Control - Executive Summary of Projects Results\\", University of Leeds, July 2000. * Carsten O (2001) \\"ISA: the Best Collision Avoidance System?\\", Proceedings of 17th Conference on the Enhanced Safety of Vehicles, Netherlands. * Carsten O (2004) \\"ISA - From Fields Trials to Reality\\", PACTS conference Targets 2010: No Room for Complacency, London, 10 February 2004. * Carsten O and Tate F (2005) \\"Intelligent Speed Adaptation: Accident Savings and Cost-Benefit Analysis\\", Accident Analysis and Prevention 37, pp. 407‚Äì416 2005. * ETSC (2006) \\"Intelligent Speed Assistance - Myths and Reality: ETSC Position on ISA\\", European Transport Safety Council, May 2006 * Faulks IJ (2007) \\"How fast am I going now?

He played college football for Glenn \\"Pop\\" Warner at Stanford University from 1930 to 1932 and later played six seasons in the National Football League for the Portsmouth Spartans (1933) and Detroit Lions (1934‚Äì1938). He helped lead the Detroit Lions to the NFL championship in 1935 and led the NFL in average yards gained per rushing carry for three consecutive years, from 1935 to 1937. He was also the first player in NFL history to finish among the top 10 players in the league in both rushing and receiving yards, accomplishing the feat in 1934 and again in 1936. He was known during his football career as the \\"Blond Antelope.\\" Early years Caddel was born in Granite, Oklahoma in 1911 and was raised near Fresno, California. Stanford Caddel was given the name \\"Ee-Dub\\" after his father's initials E.W., as was the custom in those days. He enrolled at Stanford University in 1929 on a baseball scholarship, having never played football. Stanford would not recognize the initials \\"E.W,\\" and so Caddel became \\"Ernie.\\" While attending Stanford, head football coach Glenn \\"Pop\\" Warner noticed Caddel's athletic ability and persuaded him to play for the football team. He played at the halfback position for Stanford from 1930 to 1932. In November 1931, he drew national attention when he ran for three touchdowns, two on long runs, in a 32-6 victory over Dartmouth. As a senior in 1932, Caddel starred for Stanford in September and October. In October 1932, a United Press correspondent wrote: \\"Ernie Caddel, a rangy fleet-footed halfback, is regarded by many as an All-America candidate. In every appearance this season he has brought spectators from their seats by his spectacular wide, sweeping runs around the end -- invariably evading tacklers for 15 to 30 yards.\\" Caddel suffered two broken ribs in a game against Oregon State. To allow Caddel to play through the injury, Stanford's coach Warner created what has been described as the first flak jacket worn by a running back. The San Jose News in October 1932 noted that Caddel was wearing a shoulder brace \\"to permit him to play as long as wind and limib hold out.\\" Another writer noted, \\"Pop made a paper pattern one day and the thing that night. It was an ingenious affair. ... It had steel ribs, but you hardly noticed the weight.\\" Due to this injury, however, Caddel was unable to play baseball in the spring of his senior year, and he lost his Stanford scholarship. He was then recruited by the Portsmouth Spartans to play professional football in Ohio. Professional football After graduating from Stanford, Caddel played professional football in the National Football League for six years from 1933 to 1938. Caddel was 6 feet, 2 inches, and weighed 190 pounds during his football playing career. With blonde, curly hair and \\"a beach-boy tan,\\" he was \\"a striking figure in the Midwest\\" and became known as the \\"Blond Antelope.\\" Caddel began his professional football career in 1933 with the Portsmouth Spartans in Portsmouth, Ohio. He ran 82 yards for a touchdown on his first carry for the Spartans. Caddel accumulated 393 yards from scrimmage for the Spartans in 1933 and scored five touchdowns. As a rookie, he led the NFL in receiving touchdowns with three and finished second in the league with an average of 5.2 yards per touch. In 1934, the Spartans were sold, and the new owner moved the team to Detroit, Michigan, and renamed them the Detroit Lions. Caddel started all 12 games and helped the Lions post a 10-3 record in their inaugural season. He was among the NFL leaders in 1934 with 655 yards from scrimmage (4th in the NFL), an average of 5.7 yards per touch (4th in the NFL), and 528 rushing yards (5th in the NFL). Caddel (No. 1) in January 1936 with newspaper caption, \\"Here's How Stellar Lion Halfback Makes those Long Gains\\" As a third- year player, Caddel was both the leading rusher and the leading receiver for the 1935 Detroit Lions team that won the 1935 NFL Championship. He was also the second leading passer for the 1935 Lions with 169 passing yards. Caddel also led the NFL in 1935 in all-purpose yards (621), rushing touchdowns (6), yards per rushing attempt (5.2), and yards per touch (6.4). He also finished second in the NFL with 450 rushing yards. Caddel remained one of the NFL's leading players in 1936. He accumulated 730 yards from scrimmage, third best in the NFL, and led the league with an average of 6.6 yards per touch and 6.4 yards per rushing attempt. His total of 19 pass receptions was also good for third best in the NFL during the 1936 season. Caddel was the first player in NFL history to finish among the top 10 players in the league in both rushing and receiving yards. He accomplished the feat in 1934 and again in 1936. The next player to twice rank in the top 10 in both categories was Frank Gifford in 1956 and 1957. In 1937, Caddel led the NFL for the third consecutive year in yards per rushing attempt with an average of 5.6 yards per carry. Later years After retiring from football, Caddel operated an automobile dealership, Roseville Chevrolet, in Roseville, California, for 42 years. He became known for his charismatic personality and for starring in light-hearted TV commercials\\" with \\"The Roseville Gang.\\" He died due to complications Alzheimer's in Roseville in 1992 at age 81, possibly brought on by head trauma from his years with the Lions. During his early Spartan years, Caddel met his wife Nell Margaret Gableman, the daughter of Portsmouth's mayor. When they moved to Detroit, during the off-season, Caddel built cars in GM factory. General Motors noted his personality and good looks, and promoted him to sales. They had a daughter, Trudy Frances, and a granddaughter, noted vocalist Connie Champagne n√©e Kelly Brock.http://www.conniechampagne.com References External links * Category:1911 births Category:1992 deaths Category:People from Greer County, Oklahoma Category:American football running backs Category:Stanford Cardinal football players Category:Portsmouth Spartans players Category:Detroit Lions players Category:Sportspeople from Roseville, California ","title":"Ernie Caddel"},{"id":"14099194","text":"__NOTOC__ Gmina Szczytna is an urban-rural gmina (administrative district) in K≈Çodzko County, Lower Silesian Voivodeship, in south-western Poland.

The portrayal of an unseen character may vary depending on the form of medium at hand. In visual media, such as film, stage or television, an unseen character may sometimes be partially depicted as body parts or an offscreen voice, but is still considered unseen as long as their face is never revealed.  History  Unseen characters have been used since the beginning of theatre with the ancient Greek tragedians, such as Laius in Sophocles' Oedipus Rex and Jason's bride in Euripides' Medea, and continued into Elizabethan theatre with examples such as Rosaline in Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet. However, it was the early twentieth-century European playwrights Strindberg, Ibsen, and Chekhov who fully developed the dramatic potential of the unseen character. Eugene O'Neill was influenced by his European contemporaries and established the absent character as an aspect of character, narrative, and stagecraft in American theatre.  Purpose and characteristics  Unseen characters are causal figures included in dramatic works to motivate the onstage characters to a certain course of action and advance the plot, but their presence is unnecessary. Indeed, their absence makes them appear more powerful because they are only known by inference. The use of an unseen character \\"take[s] advantage of one of the simplest but most powerful theatrical devices: the manner in which verbal references can make an offstage character extraordinarily real [...] to an audience,\\" exploiting the audience's tendency to create visual images of imaginary characters in their mind. In a study of 18th-century French comedy, F. C. Green suggests that an \\"invisible character\\" can be defined as one who, though not seen, \\"influences the action of the play\\". This definition, according to Green, would rule out a character like Laurent (Lawrence), Tartuffe's unseen valet, whose sole function is merely to give the playwright an opportunity to introduce Tartuffe. Unseen characters can develop organically even when their creators initially did not expect to keep them as unseen, especially in episodic works like television series. For instance, the producers of Frasier initially did not want to make the character Niles Crane's wife Maris an unseen character because they did not want to draw parallels to Vera, Norm Peterson's wife on Cheers, of which Frasier was a spin off. They originally intended that Maris would appear after several episodes, but were enjoying writing excuses for her absence so eventually it was decided she would remain unseen, and after the increasingly eccentric characteristics ascribed to her, no real actress could portray her.  Examples  =Comics= * Al Capp introduced Lena the Hyena in June 1946 as an invisible character in the Li'l Abner newspaper strip. She was described as \\"the world's ugliest woman\\". Characters always reacted in fright when they saw her or an image of her but readers couldn't see her because she was hidden behind objects or out of frame. Eventually Capp organized a contest in which readers could send in their own graphic interpretations of what she might look like. The winner was cartoonist Basil Wolverton, whose design was first shown in the 21 October 1946 strip. * In Merho's comics series De Kiekeboes Mevrouw Stokvis, a friend of Moemoe Kiekeboe, is always mentioned or referred to, but has never actually been seen in the series. = Theatre = Unseen characters occur elsewhere in drama, including the plays of Eugene O'Neill, Tennessee Williams, and Edward Albee. Author Marie A. Wellington notes that in the 18th- century, Voltaire included unseen characters in a few of his plays, including Le Duc d‚ÄôAlen√ßon and L‚ÄôOrphelin de la Chine. * Rosaline in William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet is never seen, but is only described. * In Alain-Ren√© Lesage's 1707 play Crispin an unseen character called Damis with his forced secret marriage is essential to the plot. * In Clare Boothe Luce's play The Women (1936), and the 1939 film based on the play, male characters (husbands, lovers, etc.) are referred to but do not appear, even in photographs. * Godot in Samuel Beckett's Waiting for Godot is never seen. The play's two main characters spend the entire play waiting for Godot to arrive. * In Anton Chekhov's play Three Sisters, Protopopov, who is cuckolding his employee Andrei and having a torrid and far from secret affair with Natasha, is unseen but plays a central role. Some sources suggest Protopopov, not Andrei, is the real father of Sofia, Natasha's daughter. * The titular character in Mike Leigh's play Abigail's Party, the 15-year-old daughter of Susan Lawson, is attending a party next door to the events portrayed in the play, and is never seen. = UK television and radio = * Dad's Army: Mrs Elizabeth Mainwaring, the wife of Captain Mainwaring, is never seen with the exception of the episode A Soldier's Farewell when her great weight in the bunk above Captain Mainwaring's causes her mattress to sag into camera shot. She appears in the 2016 movie. * Minder: Arthur Daley's wife, referred to only as \\"'Er Indoors\\", is never seen or heard, but often quoted. *In Keeping Up Appearances, Hyacinth Bucket has a phone conversation in each episode with her son Sheridan, who has moved out and is attending university.\\"Top 30 Characters You Never See: out of sight, but in your mind\\". The Independent, February 16, 2015. A photograph of a young boy meant to depict Sheridan in childhood appears in the opening credits, but the character is never seen as an adult. The running gag in these conversations is that Hyacinth remains persistently oblivious to all the evidence that her son is gay. *In the long-running British radio soap opera The Archers, a number of permanent inhabitants of the village in which the story is set are frequently referred to but are never heard in their own voices. Fans of the programme often refer to these characters as \\"the silents\\". *Throughout the entire 18-year run of Heartbeat, PC Alf Ventress refers to his wife Mrs. Ventress, but she is neither seen nor is her first name ever revealed. = US television = * On the mystery drama Columbo, Lieutenant Columbo often describes his wife in detail but she is never seen, heard, or otherwise portrayed in the series. A short-lived, unsuccessful spin-off series Mrs. Columbo was created in 1979 after Columbo had ended its run, but Lieutenant Columbo never appeared. Mrs. Columbo, as played by Kate Mulgrew, was named Kate (although Lieutenant Columbo's wife in Columbo was never given a name). The series gradually severed all ties with the original detective series. Both the series and the character herself were renamed in an attempt to change direction, but this did not help the poor ratings and the series was ultimately canceled in March 1980 after only 13 episodes had aired. * On The Mary Tyler Moore Show, Phyllis Lindstrom's husband, Dr. Lars Lindstrom, is often referenced but never seen. * On Rhoda, Carlton, the doorman in Rhoda Morgenstern's apartment building, is often heard on the intercom (voiced by Lorenzo Music) but almost never seen ‚Äì only his arm would occasionally appear from doors and he was once shown dancing and conversing while wearing a gorilla mask. After Rhoda ended its run, Carlton was featured as an animated character in the 1980 spin-off special Carlton Your Doorman. Once again voiced by Music, Carlton is shown as a young man with shoulder-length blond hair and mustache. * On Seinfeld, Bob Sacamano, Lomez, and \\"Cousin Jeffrey\\" are often mentioned but never seen. The first two are friends of Cosmo Kramer, and the last is the cousin of Jerry Seinfeld. Jeffrey works for the New York City Parks Department, as Jerry is told ad nauseam by his Uncle Leo. George Costanza also spent some time working for George Steinbrenner, the owner of the New York Yankees; however, Steinbrenner (as portrayed by series co-creator Larry David) was only ever shown as the back of his head in his office chair, and his face was never seen on camera.\\"12 Television Characters We Never See (Even Though They Were On TV)\\".

Her voice was provided by Bernadette Birkett, the real-life wife of George Wendt who portrayed Norm Peterson, leading Wendt to comment that he never personally wondered what Vera looked like. Maris is also seen as a silhouette. *Stan Walker, the wealthy husband of Karen Walker on Will & Grace, has been depicted on screen only as hands and feet. Karen and Stan have divorced twice over the show's run, once after Stan faked his own death, leading the website CollegeHumor to label him as the one unseen character who \\"arguably drives the plot more than any other unseen character on a TV show.\\" *On The Big Bang Theory, Howard Wolowitz's mother, Debbie, was always heard but almost never seen in the entire first eight seasons in which she was on the show. She was voiced by Carol Ann Susi until her death in 2014, after which the character was killed off. *On the Netflix animated television series BoJack Horseman, Mr. Peanutbutter often shouts to an off-screen character known as \\"Erica\\".

It was founded in 1830 and closed 12 years later in 1842. The CMS established the mission in 1832 with Rev. William Watson and Rev. Johann Simon Christian Handt as the missionaries. They were granted and ‚Ç§500 per annum to run the mission. A drought in the early days made it almost impossible to provide enough food for the mission. On Saturday 2 March 1833 Watson recorded the following in his journal. \\"Our men attempted to plow [sic], but broke the coulter [blade] immediately owing to the ground being so dry and hard. We have had very little rain for a long time. Our garden and indeed vegetation in general is almost parched up. Scarcely any food for the cattle.\\" The mission was also plagued by internal quarreling and misdealings. In 1837 Handt moved away because of his wife's poor health and was replaced by James G√ºnther who also fought with Watson. Another man, William Porter, joined the mission to assist with the cultivation of the land, but was later found to have acted inappropriately towards some of the Aboriginal women around the mission. Watson attempted to gain control of any Aboriginal children he could get his hands on, gaining a reputation as an eagle hawk, and kidnapper among the Aboriginal women. Eventually Watson left Wellington Valley and, taking the children with him, established a new mission called Apsley. The mission was closed in 1842 after ten years of difficulty and little success.

In order to emphasise the importance of fire science, the Government renamed CEES as CFEES in 2003.  Areas of Work  CFEES works in the area of Explosive safety, Fire protection and environmental safety.CFEES Areas of Work In addition to developing technologies to protect against these threats, it also trains personnel in these areas, and enforces safety standards in the use of hazardous materials- toxic, explosive and flammable. CFEES also designs and develops sensors to detect these threats. Explosive Safety - CFEES helps in the Siting of explosive processing and storage dumps and the design, testing and evaluation of safe explosive storage houses. Additionally, it trains armed forces personnel and DRDO scientists in the safe use of explosives and ordnance, and enforces compliance of safety rules. Simulation and risk modeling is also carried out, in order to aid in Disaster Management. Environment Safety - CFEES develops treatment and disposal techniques for hazardous Heavy Metal Wastes, as well as Photodegradable Polyethylene for use as packaging material at high altitudes, which prevents the pollution in mountainous areas where the Indian Army operates, such as Kargil and Siachen. CFEES also plays an active role in formulating the phase-out strategy for halon and other ozone layer threatening gases. The National Halon Management Programme, funded under bilateral programme, is implemented by CFEES, supported by Ozone Cell, India.Techmonitor.net report Sep-Oct 2006 . Halons are one of the six categories of chemicals that are covered under the phase- out programme of the Montreal Protocol. The Montreal Protocol, to which India is a signatory, has called upon the parties to phase out the CFCs, halons and other man-made ozone-depleting chemicals. In this regard, the lab is researching into alternative chemicals for fire suppression and other uses. Fire Safety - CFEES is involved in the development of automatic fire and explosion detection and suppression systems for armoured vehicles, and water mist based fire protection Systems for various applications. It also develops lightweight fire protection clothing. A smoke test tunnel for creating fire signatures under various conditions has been installed. Specialised Training for armed forces personnel in fire protection, safety, prevention and firefighting is also conducted by CFEES. The lab has also developed a software package for virtual firefighting and fire training simulation.  Projects and Products  Many of the technologies and processes developed by CFEESProducts and Technologies developed by CFEES have more extensive uses in civilian sector. As a result, many of these products have been licensed to Private companies for manufacture, with export potential being considered. A.K. Kapoor, Director, CFEES, said \\"We want to popularise these products. They have more applications in the civilian sector than in the defence sector. We would like them to be produced for civilian benefits,\\". Dr. W. Selvamurthy, Chief Controller, R&D;, DRDO, said \\"These products have not only national but international market,\\". = Fire Protection =  Fire Detection and Suppression Systems for AFVs  CFEES has successfully designed and operationalized Integrated Fire Detection and Suppression Systems for Armoured vehicles like the Arjun MBT, Ajeya and Abhay IFV projects of the Ordnance Factory Board. The system is based on infra-red detectors for the detection of fire/explosion in the crew compartment, and is capable of suppressing fuel-fire explosions resulting from an enemy hit or due to any malfunction of the engine, transmission or electrical short circuit. The system is capable of detection and suppression of fires in the crew compartment within 200 milliseconds and in the engine compartment within 15s.  Water Mist based Fire Protection  Water Mist based Fire Protection Systems have been developed. This includes new nozzles for the generation of water mist, working at low pressure of 12 bars and above to facilitate the proper atomisation of water droplets under high pressure. This systems is used for the following applications: :* IR signature suppression of plume emitted by exhaust of Naval ships :* Air cargo bay :* Electronic cabinet fires :* Fuel ‚Äìair explosion suppressions  Intelligent Fire Sensor  CFEES has developed an Intelligent Fire Sensor with software based on a fire signature database that allows its fire detection system to accurately identify true fire situations in a few seconds while rejecting false alarms. The sensor is a highly sensitive detection system coupled with powerful intelligent analysis, which allows fire detection even in dusty environment. The use of laser diode source and multiple reflection increases the sensitivity of smoke detection. The sensors sense the temperature and smoke, making the fire detector sensitive to both slow-smouldering and fast-burning fires. The system can be installed on board the ships, offshore machinery rooms, aircraft cargo compartments, industries, chemical plants, warehouses, etc. Production of this sensor is being carried out by Southern Electronics Pvt.

His main base was the Stuyvesant Chess Club, located on the Lower East Side of Manhattan in New York City.The Bobby Fischer I Knew And Other Stories, by Arnold Denker and Larry Parr, Hypermodern Press 1995 Denker called Treysman the best odds-giver at chess in the United States. He played very little formal tournament chess in his life, except for a brief period in the mid-1930s, when he was already 55 years old.

Background Odo de Bayeux was previously Earl of Kent and the primary landowner of the region subsequent to his half-brother William the Conqueror's invasion of England in 1066. In 1070, Archbishop Lanfranc succeeded to the see of Canterbury and requested an inquiry into the activities of Odo (and Lanfranc's predecessor, Stigand) who had allegedly defrauded the Church (and possibly the Crown) during his tenure as Earl of Kent.\\"A Report on the Penenden Trial\\" by W. Levison, The English Historical Review, Vol. 27, No. 108 (Oct. 1912), pp. 717‚Äì720. It has subsequently been argued that: \\"most of the lands had been lost not to Odo, but to Earl Godwine and his family during Edward's reign and perhaps even earlier...\\" and that \\"Odo had simply succeeded to these encroachments and the conflict between archbishop and earl was to a large extent a reprise of that between Robert of Jumi√®ges and Godwine in 1051-2,\\"The Justification of the Conquest from Conquered England Kingship, Succession, and Tenure 1066‚Äì1166 by George Garnett, Oxford University Press, 25 January 2007 the suggestion being that Lanfranc, despite being the Prior of a Norman monastery (and born in Pavia, Lombardy), was attempting to restore the pre-conquest landholdings for the Church of Canterbury. William I determined that the matter should be settled by the nobles of Kent and ordered that an assembly be formed on the heath at Penenden (near present-day Maidstone) for the purpose.The Conquest and its Aftermath by Dr Mike Ibeji at BBC History William I ordered that the findings of the inquiry or 'trial' of Odo de Bayeux were to be final. Various prominent figures in the country at the time were called including Geoffrey de Montbray Bishop of Coutances (who represented the King), Lanfranc (for the Church), Odo de Bayeux (defending himself), Arnost Bishop of Rochester, √Üthelric II (former Bishop of Selsey), Richard de Tunibridge, Hugh de Montfort, William de Arsic, Hamo Vicecomes and many others.England's Topographer Or A New and Complete History of the County of Kent by William Henry Ireland √Üthelric II in particular had been compelled by William I to attend as the authority on pre- Norman law. Described as: \\"[A] very old man, very learned in the laws of the land\\" he was brought by chariot or other carriage to Penenden Heath \\"in order to discuss and expound these same old legal customs\\".R. C. van Caenegem, English Law Suits from William I to Richard I (1990) vol 1 (Selden Society, vol 106) The presence of a contingent of English (or Saxon) witnesses as experts in ancient laws and customs as well as the French-born representation is regarded as a significant indication of the basis of the Church's claims being grounded in the ancient laws of the land. However it is unclear from the sources which of those laws were cited. Precisely when the inquiry was held is unclear although many historians have determined it took place between 1075 and 1077.Feudal Empires: Norman and Plantagenet by John Le Patourel at Google Books Similarly a number of varying transcripts or records of the trial exist and it is unclear which may be regarded as the definitive version of events. The trial of Odo de Bayeux lasted three days and ended in the partial recovery of properties for the church from Odo and others. Significance and reliability The trial is regarded by some commentators as \\"one of the most important events in the early history of English Law because of the light it sheds on the relationship between Norman Law and English Law\\" with the trial being a possible indication of Norman respect for Anglo-Saxon legal history.Extraordinary privilege: the trial of Penenden Heath and the Domesday inquest, by Alan Cooper, The English Historical Review, 1 November 2001 The trial was the first indictment of Odo of Bayeux perhaps setting sufficient precedent for him to be stripped of his properties entirely and imprisoned for five years following further challenges to his wealth and powers in 1082.The Normans: The History of a Dynasty (2002) by David Crouch at Google Books By all accounts the Penenden trial occurred prior to the Domesday survey and was an early attempt by the church to reclaim rights and interests from the Crown and its agents. Since the assessments of property and rights which followed the trial were of significance, Domesday Book has come to be seen as a response to a need to have a definitive record of the ownership and administration of Crown property. At the same time, doubt over the authenticity or reliability of transcripts of the trial has meant that much of the analysis of the trial's findings has been undertaken with a degree of scepticism. The trial is known from two narratives. The older is a condensed version whilst the second, slightly later document, contains exaggerated assessments concluding with an overly-detailed description of the jurisdiction of the Archbishop of Canterbury over offences committed on the King's highways. Analysis of the relationship between these two documents by historians suggests that the later transcript was composed after the monks of Christ Church Priory, Canterbury failed to have their claims to the trial's established privileges recorded in the Domesday Survey. Thus it has been argued that at least the later of the trial narratives should be regarded as an example of the undermining of Anglo-Saxon governance by the power of private interests rather than evidence of the continuation of Anglo-Saxon law and custom after the Conquest.

Biography Initially trained by his father Giovanni, an architect, fresco painter and set designer, Giuseppe Canella started out producing stage sets and decorating stately homes in Verona and Mantua. His brother, Carlo Canella, was also a painter. It may have been under the influence of Pietro Ronzoni, a landscape painter of international renown active in Verona, that he took up landscape painting. The first views were not produced until 1815, after a short stay in Venice. After making his debut at the Fine Art Exposition at the Brera Academy of 1818, he made a long journey through Spain, the Netherlands and France for study purposes. The set of 13 landscapes shown at the Expositions at the Brera in 1831 proved a great success with the public and critics alike, not least due to the fame achieved in Paris with works exhibited in the Salons, commissions from Louis Philippe of Orleans and the award of a gold medal in 1830. He returned to Milan in 1832 and devoted his energies to urban views characterised by an interest in the events of contemporary life and an atmospheric form of portrayal in evident competition with Giovanni Migliara. Landscape came to predominate as from 1835 with subjects drawn from the Lombard countryside and lakes. The focus on poor and humble aspects of life formed part of the artist‚Äôs fundamental naturalism and coincided with a moralistic approach derived from the novelist Alessandro Manzoni. Crucial importance attaches in the artist‚Äôs mature period to his trip to Rome and Naples in 1838‚Äì39. Among his pupils or painters influenced by Canela were Felice Giuseppe Vertua, Constantino Prinetti, and Giovanni Renica.* His son, Giuseppe Canella the Younger (Venice, 1837 - Padoa, 1913), was also a painter.

The congregation began as a Sunday school of Louisville's Christ Church Cathedral in 1870 which met in a store at Broadway and Baxter Avenue and was called \\"Sunday School of the Advent\\". In 1872 it moved to Rubel Avenue near Broadway, and was formally organized as a congregation in 1874. As the Cherokee Triangle neighborhood of Louisville was being subdivided, the creation of East Broadway (soon renamed Cherokee Parkway) cut off a triangle of land that belong to Cave Hill Cemetery, which rendered it useless for burials in the carefully planned facility, so the cemetery company sold the land to the Church of the Advent. The congregation hired Frederick C. Withers of New York to construct the church building, and the cornerstone was laid in 1887. The church was built in a late Victorian style, with limestone walls, a slate roof, a series of gables and a tower. The first service was held on April 15, 1888, two Sundays after Easter that year. When Cherokee Triangle was added to the National Register of Historic Places as a district, the Church of the Advent was described in the listing document as \\"the architectural and historical keystone of the district\\".

The main point is the use of the fast Fourier transform to speed up the evaluation of a finite Dirichlet series of length N at O(N) equally spaced values from O(N2) to O(N1+Œµ) steps (at the cost of storing O(N1+Œµ) intermediate values). The Riemann‚ÄìSiegel formula used for calculating the Riemann zeta function with imaginary part T uses a finite Dirichlet series with about N = T1/2 terms, so when finding about N values of the Riemann zeta function it is sped up by a factor of about T1/2. This reduces the time to find the zeros of the zeta function with imaginary part at most T from about T3/2+Œµ steps to about T1+Œµ steps. The algorithm can be used not just for the Riemann zeta function, but also for many other functions given by Dirichlet series. The algorithm was used by to verify the Riemann hypothesis for the first 1013 zeros of the zeta function.

Black Squirrel Radio is overseen by faculty from Kent State University's Journalism and Mass Communication program. History Established on October 2, 1950, the university's WKSU-FM (88.1) originally served as an outlet for Kent State students to broadcast; prior to 1950, the university's Radio Workshop program produced original programming for WADC from 1940 to 1943, and on WAKR from 1945 to 1950. In January 1965, an unlicensed carrier current radio station was activated bearing the unofficial \\"WKSU\\" call sign. Students were given more responsibility at this station than at WKSU-FM, but by 1970, \\"WKSU\\" had ceased operations. Some students continued on with WKSU-FM, though all were eventually replaced with professionals when WKSU-FM became an affiliate of National Public Radio (NPR) in 1974. The same students dismissed from WKSU-FM chose to revive WKSU-AM as WKSR. The closed-circuit station's reach was limited to on campus; throughout the 1970s, 80s, and the early 90s, WKSR was often referred to as \\"roommate radio.\\" In 1999, WKSR began streaming over a Kent State campus cable channel. In the fall of 2005, WKSR began broadcasting online. The new internet radio station soon adopted the name \\"Black Squirrel Radio\\"; the WKSR \\"call letters\\" were never assigned by the FCC to the Kent State student-run station, but rather to WKSR-FM, a radio station licensed to Loretto, Tennessee. Since the name change, Black Squirrel Radio has been expanding the breadth of their content to include podcasting and talk radio shows in addition to music shows. Black Squirrel Radio currently has over 120 students on its staff. Black Squirrel Radio now calls Franklin Hall its home. The station was formerly located in the Music & Speech Building. Programming Urban contemporary, Rock music and \\"Local music\\" all account for the programming on the station. Black Squirrel Radio's mascot, \\"URL the Squirrel\\", is an acronym for \\"Urban-Rock-Local\\", in addition to the Uniform Resource Locator, a pun alluding to the station's exclusive online format. BSR is an affiliate of UWIRE,http://uwire.com/affiliates/ which gathers, edits, and re-distributes student-created content,http://uwire.com/about/ and broadcasts news at 15 minutes before the hour and at 15 minutes past the hour.

A dramatic monologue spoken by a battle-hardened drill sergeant training recruits about to be sent off to the Vietnam War, its anti-war sentiment is evident but more oblique than in Dawe's other well-known war poem, \\"Homecoming\\", written two years earlier.Spur (2004) p. 133 Dawe had direct experience with military life, having served in the Royal Australian Airforce from 1959 to 1968. Dennis Haskell, Winthrop Professor of English and Cultural Studies at University of Western Australia,University of Western Australia. Winthrop Professor Dennis Haskell has pointed that the drill sergeant's harsh tirade to the recruits with insults both sexual (e.g. \\"why are you looking at me are you a queer?\\") and racist (e.g. \\"a brand-new pack of Charlies are coming at you, you can smell their rotten fish-sauce breath\\") \\"Charlie\\" was military slang for a Viet Cong soldier. The quoted lines from \\"Weapons Training\\" are from Dawe (1993) p. 137 makes him seem like an exaggerated cartoon-like figure. However, he goes on to say that Dawe maintained he had not completely invented them: \\"Many [of them] were addressed to me or other members of the squad of RAAF recruits I was part of in 1959.\\"Bruce Dawe quoted in Haskell (2002) p. 178 Haskell notes that \\"Weapons Training\\" had not started out as solely a dramatic monologue, and its original title was \\"Portrait of a Drill Instructor\\". The early version contained an introductory verse with a soldier's memory of him which specifically identified the instructor as British: > I can still see his face > thrust forward out of love > for the little sunburned rookies > hunched in their chairs > or sweating at attention > see, too, > his true-blue British eyes [...] Bruce Dawe, \\"Portrait of a Drill > Instructor\\" (early version of \\"Weapons Training\\"), quoted in Haskell (2002) > p. 178 The introductory verse was omitted from the final version making the poem less of a personal portrait and more of a general depiction of the military culture which the sergeant personified with his macho dehumanising language.Haskell (2002) p. 179; Spur (2004) p. 133 In their 2009 analysis of the poem from the perspective of systemic functional linguistics, David Butt and Annabelle Lukin have proposed that while the drill instructor is ostensibly teaching physical skills to the recruits, the structure of his language \\"foregrounds the regulation of mental experience as central to the training\\",Butt and Lukin (2009) p. 211 training that fosters the unquestioning obedience to authority that may be crucial to their survival in combat.

His musical influences ranged from local artist such as Luiz Gonzaga to the Beatles. He formalized his music education by studying classical and contemporary instruments at the Federal University of Pernambuco and has also performed with several acclaimed musicians and theater groups. =Career= For well over two decades, Sergio Cassiano has explored widely divergent musical traditions while continually striving to make a difference in the lives of others by \\"moving his listener to a higher level through his inspiring lyrics.\\" As composer, percussionist, writer, producer, and bandleader, he plays traditional North Eastern music of the Pernambuco region known for its soulful harmonic and melodic blends of African, Native and Iberian Brazilian sounds. As a panderio teacher and song writer, Sergio continues to share and document his own life's transformation through the lyrics he writes while working to preserve the Brazilian folkloric traditions with his music. Collaborations His artistic collaborations include performances and recordings with nationally acclaimed Mestre Ambrosio, his previous group, Nana Vasconcelos and many others. He has also performed with several theater groups as musician and actor including \\"Avia Brazil\\" and \\"Cor-de-Chuva\\" (Color of Rain). He played on the soundtracks for the plays Quixotinadas, Um Deus Dormiu La em Casa (A God Slept there at Home), and created the sound effects for the piece \\"O Pastoril do Veio Cangote\\". Projects An integral member of the Olinda and Recife cultural community for several years, Sergio has taken part in a wide range of projects. He presently shares his time between his music performances and as percussionist coordinator for a project call \\"Escola Alberta\\" (open school). The \\"Open School\\" project is a comprehensive program that seeks to expose troubled youths to the arts, sports and other workshops thus decreasing a sense of hopelessness and despair in their lives. His other project is \\"Sergio Dois\\" whereby Sergio performs and shares his music in a more intimate way by engaging the audience in discussions about his lyrics and the traditional musical instruments he plays and has mastered. Cassianohas released a diverse array of recordings with Mestre Ambrosio since 1997 and has completed his solo debut album \\"Ciencia Da Festa\\". On his album, Cassiano played many of the instruments and introduced the listeners to Brazil's rich musical culture by combining different modern and traditional instruments.

Additional welfare measure systems are also uniquely operated by various state governments. The government uses the unique identity number (Aadhar) that every Indian possesses to distribute welfare measures in India. Overview The Directive Principles of State Policy, enshrined in Part IV of the Indian Constitution reflects that India is a welfare state. Seats are reserved for scheduled castes and scheduled tribes in government jobs, educational institutions, Lok Sabha and Vidhan Sabha. The government has passed laws for the abolition of untouchability, Begar and Zamindari. Food security to all Indians are guaranteed under the National Food Security Act, 2013 where the government provides food grains to people at a very subsidised rate. =Budget= As of 2020, the government's expenditure on social programme and welfare (direct cash transfers, financial inclusion, benefits, health and other insurances, subsidies, free school meals, rural employment guarantee), was approximately 14 lakh crore rupees ($ 192 billion), which was 7.3 % of gross domestic product (GDP).https://pib.gov.in/Pressreleaseshare.aspx?PRID=1577032 =Aadhar= It is a 12-digit unique identity number that can be obtained voluntarily by residents or passport holders of India, based on their biometric and demographic data. The data is collected by the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI), a statutory authority established in January 2009 by the government of India, under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology, following the provisions of the Aadhaar (Targeted Delivery of Financial and other Subsidies, benefits and services) Act, 2016. Aadhaar is the world's largest biometric ID system. World Bank Chief Economist Paul Romer described Aadhaar as \\"the most sophisticated ID programme in the world\\".The government of India uses this unique identification number to distribute social security and welfare measures to its citizens. Federal Government Programmes This section covers some of the social programmes and welfare measures in place in India at the federal level. =Employees' Provident Fund Organisation= A provident funding is a kind of pension scheme. It is mandatory for every public, private and self-employee under The Employees' Provident Funds and Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 1952. Under this statutory act, every working person has a Universal Account Number (UAN), which is a 12-digit number allotted to employees who are contributing to EPF. It will be generated for each of the PF member by EPFO. The UAN will act as an umbrella for the multiple Member Ids allotted to an individual by different establishments and also remains same through the lifetime of an employee. It does not change with the change in jobs. The idea is to link multiple Member Identification Numbers (Member Id) allotted to a single member under single Universal Account Number. This will help the member to view details of all the Member Identification Numbers (Member Id) linked to it. In this account, an employee contributes 10% of his monthly salary here and his employer contributes a matching amount. The major benefit of UAN or Universal Account Number will include easy tagging of multiple Employee's Provident Fund Member Id under a single number, thus reducing the confusion. The UAN will help in easy transfer and withdrawals of claims. Along with this services like Online Pass-Book, SMS Services on each deposit of contribution and Online KYC Update can be provided on the basis of UAN number. One can transfer balance from one EPF to his/her another EPF account with the help of UAN. There are new UAN portal start to check your EPF balance and nowadays all the details like how to check UAN status, download UAN EPF passbook, check EPF balance, provident fund claim and many more facility provided by new UAN portal. EPFO has now started to provide the refund of Administrative charges if all the KYC details are updated for all employees. This incentive programme is announced for the Year 2016-2017. The member who is unable to withdraw PF for any reason can withdraw without consent of employer. They can submit FORM 19 for EPF (Employees Provident Fund) and FORM 10C for EPS (Employees‚Äô Pension Scheme) with any of the following officials attestation to EPFO office in which their EPF account is maintained and https://www.epfuanlogin.com/download-uan-card/ Download UAN Card Universal Account Number or UAN provided by EPFO is mainly used to track PF balance and PF claim status.

India's policy was neither negative nor positive. Country¬¥s place in national diplomacy, its significant size and its economic miracle turned India into one of the leaders of the Non-Aligned Movement and upholder of the Third World solidarity. Origin of Non alignment movement Indian Non-alignment had its origins in India's colonial experience and the nonviolent Indian independence struggle, which left India determined to be the master of its fate in an international system dominated politically by Cold War alliances and economically by Western capitalism and Soviet communism. In the words of Rejaul Karim Laskar, a scholar of India's foreign policy and ideologue of the Congress party which was the ruling party of India for the most part of the Cold War years, the Non-Aligned movement was the \\"formula\\" devised by Nehru and other leaders of the newly independent countries of the third world to \\"guard\\" their independence \\"in face of complex international situation demanding allegiance to either of the two warring superpowers\\". The principles of nonalignment, as articulated by Nehru and his successors, were preservation of India's freedom of action internationally through refusal to align India with any bloc or alliance, particularly those led by the United States or the Soviet Union; nonviolence and international cooperation as a means of settling international disputes. Nonalignment was a consistent feature of Indian foreign policy by the late 1940s and enjoyed strong, almost unquestioning support among the Indian elite. The term \\"Non-Alignment\\" was coined by V K Menon in his speech at UN in 1953 which was later used by Indian Prime Minister Jawahar Lal Nehru during his speech in 1954 in Colombo, Sri Lanka. In this speech, Nehru described the five pillars to be used as a guide for Sino- Indian relations, which were first put forth by Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai. Called Panchsheel (five restraints), these principles would later serve as the basis of the Non-Aligned Movement. Jawahar lal Nehru was the architect of the Non-Alignment Movement. The five principles were: #Mutual respect for each other's territorial integrity and sovereignty #Mutual non-aggression #Mutual non-interference in domestic affairs #Equality and mutual benefit #Peaceful co-existence Jawaharlal Nehru's concept of nonalignment brought India considerable international prestige among newly independent states that shared India's concerns about the military confrontation between the superpowers and the influence of the former colonial powers. New Delhi used nonalignment to establish a significant role for itself as a leader of the newly independent world in such multilateral organisations as the United Nations (UN) and the Nonaligned Movement. The signing of the Treaty of Peace, Friendship, and Cooperation between India and the Soviet Union in 1971 and India's involvement in the internal affairs of its smaller neighbours in the 1970s and 1980s tarnished New Delhi's image as a nonaligned nation and led some observers to note that in practice, nonalignment applied only to India's relations with countries outside South Asia. Early developments The movement had its origins in the 1947 Asian Relations Meeting in New Delhi and the 1955 Asian- African Conference in Bandung, Indonesia. India also participated in the 1961 Belgrade Conference that officially established the Nonaligned Movement, but Jawaharlal Nehru's declining prestige limited his influence. In the 1960s and 1970s, New Delhi concentrated on internal problems and bilateral relations, yet retained membership in an increasingly factionalised and radicalised movement. During the contentious 1979 Havana summit, India worked with moderate nations to reject Cuban president Fidel Castro's proposition that \\"socialism\\" (that is, the Soviet Union) was the \\"natural ally\\" of nonalignment. In 1980s Under Indira Gandhi in the early 1980s, India attempted to reassert its prominent role in the Nonaligned Movement by focusing on the relationship between disarmament and economic development. By appealing to the economic grievances of developing countries, Indira Gandhi and her successors exercised a moderating influence on the Nonaligned Movement, diverting it from some of the Cold War issues that marred the controversial 1979 Havana meeting. Although hosting the 1983 summit at Delhi boosted Indian prestige within the movement, its close relations with the Soviet Union and its pro-Soviet positions on Afghanistan and Cambodia limited its influence. The end of the Cold War left the Nonaligned Movement without its original raison d'√™tre, and its membership became deeply divided over international disputes, strategy, and organisation. During the 1992 Jakarta summit, India took a middle position between countries favoring confrontation with developed nations on international economic issues, such as Malaysia, and those that favored a more cooperative approach, such as Indonesia. Although India played a minor role compared with Malaysia and Indonesia on most issues facing the summit, India formulated the Nonaligned Movement position opposing developed countries' linkage of foreign aid to human rights criteria. Consequences The early 1990s demise of the bipolar world system, which had existed since the end of World War II, shook the underpinnings of India's foreign policy. The Cold War system of alliances had been rendered meaningless by the collapse of the East European communist states, the dissolution of the Warsaw Pact, and the demise of the Soviet Union. In the early 1990s, most colonies had become independent, and apartheid in South Africa was being dismantled, diminishing the value of anticolonialism and making it impossible for antiracism to serve as a rallying point for international political action (India and South Africa restored full diplomatic relations in 1993 after a thirty nine year lapse). The Panchsheel (Pancha Shila), peaceful resolution of international disputes, and international cooperation to spur economic development which was being enhanced by domestic economic reforms were broad objectives in a changing world. Thus, the 1990s saw India redefining nonalignment and the view of India's place in the world. India also is a founding member of the Group of fifteen, a group of developing nations established at the ninth Nonaligned Movement summit in Belgrade in 1989 to facilitate dialogue with the industrialised countries. India played host to the fourth Group of Fifteen summit in March 1994. At the summit, Prime Minister Narsimha Rao and other leaders expressed concern over new trade barriers being raised by the industrialised countries despite the conclusion of a new world trade agreement. In the twenty-first century, India continues to practice the policy of non-alignment which allows it to maintain national sovereignty while still receiving economic and military assistance when needed. Non-alignment has propelled India to achieve one of their main strategic objectives: non-dependence. In recent years India has used this policy to its advantage in order to strengthen external partnerships and seek out material needs when necessary, while still ensuring that India as a country is able to pursue its own foreign policy goals. Although technically non-aligned India received the assistance it needed when it could ‚Äì like in the late 1940s, in 1963 following the defect against the PRC and later in the twenty first century when it entered into a major nuclear agreement with both the US and the NSG (Chaudhuri 257). More recently though India has been able to openly exercise non-alignment in its decisions to side with major world powers on international diplomatic issues of the time. During the Korean crisis, India adjusted and amended its approach when it was considered vital to do so. Most importantly, however, Indian leaders were able to say no ‚Äì as was the case in 2003 when India considered sending troops to Iraq ‚Äì when it did not suit its security objective (Chaudhuri 257). India continues to practice a policy of non-alignment in an attempt to maintain sovereignty and oppose imperialism. Since its inception, the movement attempted to create an independent path in world politics that would not result in lesser states becoming pawns in the struggles between major world powers. Today, India has a working security relationship with the United States. Over the course of history, these two countries have inherently forged a deeper sense for each other‚Äôs motivations and aspirations while never establishing a formal alliance. India continues to serve as an example of a country that is overcoming the continuum gap and advancing its policies to better fit an emerging world power. India‚Äôs non-alignment policy has made the free development of the individual as well as the economic and social progress of society and of nations its central focus in its strategic objectives. This strategy combines the goals of peace and economic development within the country with the emancipation of peoples from all forms of subordination and exploitation. As a result, India‚Äôs non-alignment stance functions as a benchmark for positive development of international relations on a global scale.

History  It was founded in 1762 by the Baron Bishop Adam Pataƒçiƒá, as bishopric palace of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Magnovaradimum. Illustrious Viennese architect Franz Anton Hillebrandt, designer of many Austrian palaces and one of Europe's 18th century best, designed the palace and planned the city's posh side as Baroque quarter, while engineer A.J. Neumann was in charge of the palace's massive construction, complete with its 365 exterior windows resembling the days of the year and 120 large, extravagant rooms distributed on three floor plans. The architecture of the palace is of late Austrian Baroque style, a more sober and practical type compared to the overly ornamented French Baroque, for example. The building was meant to resemble on a smaller scale the famous Royal Belvedere (palace) of Vienna, which likely was one of the reasons along with other religious conflicts that made Empress Maria Theresa of Austria repudiate the founder, Adam Patachich, a Croatian nobleman and the bishop of Oradea between 1759 and 1776; he was then sent to another diocese, in Kalocsa, Hungary. Adam Patachich (Croatian: Pataƒçiƒá), the founder of the palace Nevertheless, the baron was a charismatic, highly educated humanist and an illuminated patron of arts, who is mostly remembered for the fine music and musicians he surrounded himself with: this is where Michael Haydn, famous composer and Joseph Haydn's brother, worked as a Kapellmeister in the bishop's orchestra. The bishop also employed at the court other famous European composers and violinists like Wenzel Pichl and Carl Ditters von Dittersdorf, who between 1765-1769 served as a Musikdirektor. Finally, in 1771, the Holy Roman Empress (jure uxori), Maria Theresa of Austria, together her son, future Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor, arrived here to visit and make peace with a place whose project she did not initially fancy. In 1773 the palace unfortunately burned down entirely in a mysterious fire, but was reconstructed immediately by the next appointed bishop, after its original plans. In the year 1855, a new side and entrance was added graciously in tone and respect with the initial building, with grand double stairways. Later in time, after Romania gained possession of Transylvania, it remained under the church's patronage but during the socialist regime, it was seized as state property. On January 17, 1971, the Baroque Palace became a county museum hosting many large and fine archeological, historical, natural history, ethnographic and art collections under the name of \\"Muzeul ≈¢ƒÉrii Cri≈üurilor\\" (\\"Museum of the Three Rivers Land\\"). The museum has approximately 400 000 pieces divided under four main collections: History and Archeology, Ethnography, Art and Natural History. Famous for its world-class Neolithic and Bronze Age collection, the museum also boasts treasures from Ancient Egypt and Greece. The ethnography section has probably the best of western Transylvanian folk exhibits anywhere, including a large selection of traditional costumes, peasant house appliances, pottery and painted Easter eggs. The highlights of the Natural History section are the prehistoric animals including cave bears, giant elk, different mammoth types or dinosaurs (like Iguanodons, Valdosaurus or Camptosaurus). The interior courtyard is dotted by a long row of Romanian monarch busts added during the museum years. The front courtyard is an artistic park with large old bronze and marble statues of historical figures and also home to a famous Baroque parish church erected in 1752 even before the palace, a work of the Italian architect Giovanni Battista Ricca modeled after the mother church of the Jesuits, Church of the Gesu in Rome. The basilica contains the relics of King Saint Ladislaus, born in year 1040, a splint of his skull being kept here in a gold box. In 1992, Pope John Paul II through the Holy See's decree, raised the church to a holy basilica rank. In 2003, like many other edifices, The Baroque Palace of Oradea was restored to the Roman Catholic Diocese of Oradea Mare by the Government of Romania, but the building is still being used as a museum until further negotiations are made.

It is a tie-together chronicle that brings the original Enterprise adventures of James T. Kirk close to an encounter with the Enterprise-D adventures of Jean-Luc Picard. Plot summary The first half of the novel involves three parallel arcs. In one arc, Zefram Cochrane has just completed the first warp speed voyage, a solo journey to Alpha Centauri and back. His is the first successful manned flight beyond the Sol system. His benefactor and backer, Micah Brack, exploits the warp drive to help humanity burst into the stars and safeguard the future of the race, which he foresees disaster for because of the \\"Optimum Movement\\", perfectionists who are trying to perfect Khan Noonien Singh's failed attempt to unify and improve humanity. A second arc covers James Kirk and his crew, just after the successful conference on admitting Coridan into the Federation. Kirk is hauled onto the carpet by a Starfleet admiral demanding that he explain a subspace message showing \\"dead\\" Commissioner Nancy Hedford. Kirk discovers that Cochrane was kidnapped from his and Nancy's home at Gamma Canaris. A third arc covers Jean- Luc Picard and his crew, just after dropping off Sarek of Vulcan to another ship for his voyage home from the Legaran home world. A Ferengi ship leads them to a Romulan ship, whose commander is giving Picard what appears to be a section of a Borg ship, but with a Preserver artifact incorporated into it. The Cochrane arc jumps ahead 17 years, from 2061 to 2078, just before a devastating war on Earth and long after Micah Brack's mysterious disappearance. Cochrane risked visiting his home planet, and narrowly escaped the forces of the Optimum Movement whose leader, Adrik Thorsen, wants Cochrane's knowledge about warp fields to create a bomb. The Cochrane arc then jumps further to 2111, when he must flee Alpha Centauri, and begins his voyage into the future when the Companion finds him and takes him to a sanctuary, her home. Kirk and the Enterprise find the hijacked passenger ship that has Cochrane aboard, and cleverly rescue all aboard. However, they are in a battle with Klingon warships under the command of the robotic remnants of Thorsen, and the Enterprise is damaged. Cochrane and the Companion board a shuttlecraft that will take \\"shelter\\" inside the event horizon of a black hole, on a course calculated to bring them out again using a short burst of warp drive. However, one Klingon ship follows the shuttlecraft, and Kirk takes the Enterprise in, dispatching the Klingon ship with one torpedo. They cannot, however, now escape and the shuttlecraft is also doomed. Picard's crew study the Preserver artifact, and when Data tries to interface with it, Thorsen's essence emerges from the artifact and takes over Data. Data takes the Enterprise into the black hole where Thorsen saw Cochrane enter it a century before. The two Enterprises, once Data's body is shut off, coordinate to take advantage of gravity waves to save both ships and tractor the shuttlecraft out. By necessity, to emerge in their own times, Kirk's Enterprise must yield the shuttlecraft's mass to Picard's, and so when Picard and the Enterprise-D emerge, they find the shuttlecraft holds Zefram Cochrane and Nancy Hedford/Companion. Both of them die, even as the ship arrives at Gamma Canaris to find the planetoid has long ago disintegrated. Before the ships got too far apart, Picard sent a short signal identifying his ship by name. Kirk writes a letter on paper to the captain of that future Enterprise, to be released after certain events have occurred. Picard is given the letter not long after the Enterprise-D is lost on Veridian III. One of the common ties is Christopher's Landing, the location on the moon Titan where Sean Jeffrey Christopher made humanity's first landing on the moon of Saturn.

He subsequently went on to manage Fulham with whom he was associated for over 50 years. Playing career =Fulham= Osborne was born in Wynberg, South Africa, and moved to England in 1911, and played youth football at Netley, near Southampton. He subsequently moved to London, joining Bromley (then a Kent amateur side) after the end of World War I, before he was signed by Phil Kelso for Football League Second Division side Fulham in November 1921 (aged 25). At Fulham, playing alongside Andy Ducat and Frank Penn, he was top scorer in 1922‚Äì23 accounting for 10 of the team's 43 league goals, in what was generally a low-scoring season in Division Two. His goal-scoring exploits in a weak Fulham side brought him to the notice of the England selectors who picked him for the matches against Northern Ireland on 21 October 1922 (won 2‚Äì0) and France on 10 May 1923 (won 4‚Äì1), although he failed to score in either match. He thus became the first Fulham player to be capped by England. Financial pressures led to his transfer to Football League First Division side Tottenham Hotspur for ¬£1,500 in January 1924. Osborne spent two years at Fulham, making 70 appearances and scoring 18 goals. =Tottenham Hotspur= He made a slow start to his Tottenham career, scoring only once in his first season and a half, although he was again selected for England against Belgium on 8 December 1924 (won 4‚Äì0). In 1925‚Äì26 however, playing alongside Jimmy Dimmock and Jack Elkes, he struck a rich vein of form scoring three hat tricks in the space of two weeks in October/November 1925, finishing the season as the club's top scorer on 25 goals. On 24 May 1926, he was again selected for the England match in Antwerp against Belgium where he finally brought his goal-scoring talents to the national stage, scoring a hat-trick as England came from 3‚Äì2 down to take the match 5‚Äì3. In 1928, despite Osborne's 18 goals, Spurs were relegated to the Second Division. In the first season in the lower division Spurs continued to struggle, finishing in mid-table with Osborne again top-scorer on 16. In June 1931, he was sold to fellow Second Division side Southampton for a fee of ¬£450, surprisingly large for a player now in his mid-30s. In his Spurs career he played a total of 220 matches, scoring 82 goals. =Southampton= He was unable to reproduce his goal-scoring form at The Dell, failing to score either in the league or cup. In May 1932, the club were suffering serious financial problems and Osborne was placed on the transfer list as manager George Kay attempted to trim the wages bill, as Osborne's \\"wages of ¬£8 in the winter and ¬£6 in the summer were considered to be too extravagant\\". At this stage Osborne contemplated retirement, but remained at The Dell for a further season before returning to London in 1933 to work as a sales representative for Fulham chairman John Dean's company in Putney. In his brief Saints career he made twenty appearances, failing to score. Fulham ‚Äì Director and manager In March 1935, he was invited to join 's board of directors, after special dispensation from the Football Association, thus beginning an involvement with the club that would continue, in various roles, right up to his death over fifty years later. When manager Jack Peart died in September 1948, the board offered the position to Frank Osborne, who reluctantly accepted. From 1948 until his retirement in November 1964 at the age of 68, Osborne had some managerial responsibility at the Cottage, either solely or with a team manager, whilst he became general manager or secretary manager. His was a unique career, matched only in its longevity by his former playing colleague and subsequently trainer, Frank Penn. The two made their debuts within two years of each other (Penn was the earlier) and they retired within six months of each other (Penn was the later). Although a player of some renown in his day, Osborne was not a track-suited manager. Intensely superstitious and fond of practising his golf swing in his Cottage office, he steered Fulham to the Second Division title in his first season, with the assistance of team manager Eddie Perry. For the next four seasons, Osborne was the general manager and assumed responsibilities for the team again in 1953 for another couple of years until the next team manager was appointed. Whilst he was not necessary in charge of team affairs, Osborne was the key figure at Craven Cottage throughout the post-war period right up to his retirement. Once he left, he never returned, and lived quietly at his Epsom home until his death at the age of 91 in March 1988. Family Frank had two brothers who also played in the Football League. Harold made one appearance for Norwich City whilst Reg was a left-back with Leicester City, who made one England appearance in 1927.

From there she would move to the Orange Public Library in New Jersey to become head of the children‚Äôs department, East Orange Public Library to work as a branch librarian, and then as an assistant director at the Montclair Public Library from 1970 to 1972. Yates obtained this position in 1976 and served until 1981. Yates was a member of the American Library Association (ALA) and the Black Caucus of ALA. She was also a member of the NAACP, helped to found the Association‚Äôs Coretta Scott King Book Award, she published an article entitled ‚ÄúSexism in the Library Profession‚Äù, she served as a research writer for the U.S. Civil Rights Commission, she was a member of the Delta Sigma Theta sorority, she created her own firm Yates Library Consultants, and she was a visiting professor at Atlanta University Graduate School of Library and Information Science. Yates obtained this position in 1976 and served until 1981. Ella and her family moved to Seattle, Washington where she established a Library and Learning Resource Center for the Seattle Opportunities Industrialization Center, she also began teaching at the University of Washington‚Äôs Graduate Library School. She later accepted a position as State Librarian of the Virginia State Library. Ella enjoyed this position but was soon plagued with the same issues that she had dealt with in Atlanta. Ella was dismissed and returned to Atlanta. Yates returned as interim director in 1998, but because of disputes with the library board she left this position on December 31. Yates died on June 27, 2006 of Pancreatic Cancer at the age of 79. Under her leadership, the Atlanta-Fulton public library built its central branch on Margaret Mitchell Square in downtown Atlanta. Yates saw the state-of-the-art facility through its planning and construction stages and presided at the May 1980 dedication ceremonies and gave Ella the privilege of being the first African American librarian in the country to have a major metropolitan library built during tenure. She was so concerned about the city receiving a fair deal that she found time to earn a doctoral degree from Atlanta Law School in 1979 so she could understand contracts. Yates cared about much more than an impressive building. She expanded library services for the disabled, ethnic groups, and prisoners. She brought the library into the Fulton County jail, making the jail the first penal institution in the country with a public library branch.

History  The Singapore Armed Forces Signal Formation can trace its beginnings to 1954, when the Singapore Corps of Signals (Volunteer), established as a volunteer organisation within the framework of the Singapore Volunteer Corps, was reformed into the Independent Brigade Signal Squadron of the Singapore Military Force (SMF). When Singapore merged with the Federation of Malaya in 1963, the squadron was absorbed into the Malaysian Armed Forces as the 4th Federal Infantry Brigade Signal Squadron, based at Fort Canning. During the reorganisation of the Malaysian Signals in 1965, the squadron was renamed the 4th Malaysian Signal Squadron. During the initial period following the separation of Singapore from Malaysian in August 1965, the 4th Malaysian Infantry Brigade continued to operate in Singapore, and the Singapore elements within the squadron (2 officers and 54 men) continued to serve in the brigade until mustered out on 28 February 1966. With separation, there was an urgent need to build up an indigenous signal corps to support the rapid growth of the armed forces of the independent Republic of Singapore, and on 1 March 1966, 1 SAF Signals Corps was formed at Beach Road Camp from the Singaporean signal contingent. The Signal Formation was presented with the State Colours and Regimental Colours on 22 January 1977 by President Benjamin Sheares. Structure The Signal formation consists of Headquarters Signals and Command Systems, the Signal Institute, and a number of battalions, both active and reserve. Each brigade of the army has a signal company which forms part of the brigade's headquarters. The army's three combined arms divisions (3rd, 6th and 9th) are each served by a respective signal battalion. =Headquarters Signals and Command Systems (HQ SIG)= In June 1966, the Communications and Electronics (C&E;) Department was set up within the same year of the formation of 1 SAF Signal Corps as part of the General Staff Division of the Ministry of the Interior and Defence (MID), located at Pearl's Hill. The C&E; Department was later upgraded to a specialist staff HQ and renamed HQ C&E; in August 1970 to cope with the increasing demand for the provision of essential communications in the SAF. HQ C&E; would later be redesignated as HQ Signals on 1 March 1982 and HQ Signals and Command Systems in 2006. In 1988, HQ Signals moved to its present location at Stagmont Camp. =Signal Institute (SI)= The immediate need for institutional signal training for the newly formed Singapore Armed Forces was met with the establishment of the SAFTI Signal Wing on 22 July 1967 at Pasir Laba Camp. As the demand for signal officers and NCOs continued to grow, the Signal Wing was officially recognised as an independent unit in 1968 and renamed the School of Signals. In 1983, the School of Signals and the Reserve Signal Training Centre were relocated to Stagmont camp. On 31 March 2003, the Signal Institute was formed from an amalgamation of the School of Signals, Signal Training Centre (STC) and the training branch of HQ Signals to enable an integrated approach towards doctrine, training and evaluation. =1 Signal Battalion (1SIG)= Shortly after its formation in 1966, personnel from 1 SAF Signal Corps were reconstituted as the MID Signal Battalion (renamed 1 Signal Battalion in 1982) on 6 February 1967, with Captain Winston Choo (later the Singapore Armed Forces' first Chief of Defence Force) as Commanding Officer. Its task was to provide communications to the Ministry Of Interior and Defence. Following the establishment of MINDEF, the battalion was renamed the MINDEF Signal Battalion and later 1 Signal Battalion in October 1982. Its motto is From Each His Best. =6 Signal Battalion (6SIG)= 6 Signal Battalion was inaugurated on 1 February 1977 as a reserve Signal Support Battalion to the 6th Singapore Division. In 1985, the battalion was placed under the Reserve Signals Training Centre before returning to the command of the 6th Division on its conversion to a combined arms division in 1991. It currently resides at Mandai Hill camp with HQ 6DIV, and provides the communication support requirements of the entire division. Its motto is Swift and Effective. =9 Signal Battalion (9SIG)= 9 Signal Battalion was formed on 9 October 1978 at Slim Barracks to undertake the responsibility of the proficiency training of the 9th Singapore Division's signal reservists. This responsibility was later transferred to the Reserve Signal Training Centre. In 1987, the battalion shifted from Slim Barracks to Selarang Barracks to co-locate with 9th Division headquarters.

It serves the town of Yass. The station is not in the town itself but is located approximately four kilometres away near the Hume Highway. The station was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  Yass Junction station is located outside of Yass due to the refusal of the Engineer-in-Chief of the New South Wales Railways, John Whitton to build the Main South line through the middle of Yass itself. After a visit on 8 December 1871, to investigate possible routes for the extension of the line from Goulburn, Whitton remarked that \\"to bring the station to North Yass would increase the length of the line by about three quarters of a mile; that the cost would be considerably more than I had recommended, probably ¬£30,000 or ¬£40,000 for works alone; and that in an engineering point of view [a] divergence to North Yass could not be entertained.Forsyth, J.H. (ed.) (1988‚Äì93), Stations & Tracks; Vol. 3A: \\"Southern Branch Lines\\". State Rail Authority of New South Wales: Sydney, p. 101. Despite continuous objections, none of Whitton's working plans or other Government surveys were able to find a suitable route for the railway to pass through Yass. Instead, the present route from Gunning to Bowning was chosen which passed four kilometres to the north, with the station opening on 3 July 1876 as Yass.Yass Junction Station NSWrail.net =The Yass Tramway= After a Government Bill was passed \\"to authorise the construction of tramways along certain streets and highways in the city and suburbs of Sydney and elsewhere\\", a tramway was built from to Yass Town to convey passengers. The trams departed from a small dock platform behind Platform 2 (the south bound platform). The line opened on 20 April 1892, with Yass station renamed Yass Junction on the same day. On 18 May 1914 the line from Coolalie was duplicated.Forsyth, J.H. (ed.) (1988‚Äì93), Stations & Tracks; Vol. 3A: \\"Southern Branch Lines\\".

NSW TrainLink also operate a road coach service from Queanbeyan to Cootamundra via Yass Junction station. This station is a request stop for the evening Melbourne XPT trains, so these services only stop here if passengers have booked to board/alight here.  Heritage listing  Yass Junction is an important site with the earliest surviving station building on the main southern railway (though altered). The site illustrates the changes from early construction with single track operation to duplication and the need for a second platform with additional facilities including refreshment rooms. These facilities in a remote location indicated concern by the railways to provide a modicum of redress to the citizens of Yass when engineering difficulties meant their town was to be by-passed by the southern railway. The site is significant because of the group of buildings including signal box, footbridge, station buildings and residence. Yass Junction railway station was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the criteria that the place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. It was assessed as historically, architecturally and socially rare.

The composer Sergei Rachmaninoff produced a number of solo piano pieces that were either lost, unpublished, or not assigned an opus number. While often disregarded in the concert repertoire, they are nevertheless part of his oeuvre. Sixteen of these pieces are extant; all others are lost. Ten of these pieces were composed before he completed his Piano Concerto No. 1, his first opus, and the rest interspersed throughout his later life. In these casual works, he draws upon the influence of other composers, including Fr√©d√©ric Chopin and Pyotr Tchaikovsky. The more substantial works, the Three Nocturnes and Four Pieces, are sets of well- thought out pieces that are his first attempts at cohesive structure among multiple pieces. Oriental Sketch and Prelude in D minor, two pieces he composed very late in his life, are short works that exemplify his style as a mature composer. Whether completed as a child or adult, these pieces cover a wide spectrum of forms while maintaining his characteristic Russian style. __TOC__  Works  In the autumn of 1885, the twelve-year-old Rachmaninoff entered the home of Nikolai Zverev to receive private piano instruction and at the end of May 1886, Zverev took his students to Crimea, where Rachmaninoff continued his studies, hoping to gain entrance to Anton Arensky's harmony class at the Moscow Conservatory. It was during this time that Rachmaninoff created his first composition, a two-page √âtude in F-sharp major (the manuscript is now lost). After admission to the class, he produced more exercises, the earliest of which is a Lento in D minor; it is the only surviving piece of ten he is said to have composed. Now beginning to compose independently, Rachmaninoff's next project was a group he titled Three Nocturnes, and is regarded as his first serious attempt at writing for the piano.Harrison, pp. 19-20 The first nocturne, in F-sharp minor, was written 14-21 November 1887, and has three parts: a beginning and an end in andante cantabile and a central section in allegro. The slower andantes are gentle sections, influenced by Pyotr Tchaikovsky, while the allegro is unnatural and stiff and unusually fast for a nocturne. The second piece, in F major, followed on 22-25 November, also contains a slower portion coupled with a quick section. No. 3, in C minor, took more than a month to compose, dated from 3 December 1886 to 12 January 1887. With a chordal texture spread over the entire keyboard, it is reminiscent of the music of Robert Schumann. The nocturnes were published posthumously in Moscow in 1949, but were not assigned an opus number. The Four Pieces of 1887 are perhaps Rachmaninoff's first comprehensive works. Each has a clear aim and method to attain it, and all unfold with a fluency significantly more advanced than that shown in the previous nocturnes. The opening Romance, in F-sharp minor, harks back to Fr√©d√©ric Chopin's tenderness. The E-flat minor Prelude is an unremarkable but well-thought out piece. The third, a M√©lodie in E major, is modestly expressive, but the Gavotte in D major is, although repetitive, the most energetic and vigorous piece. These were published posthumously in Moscow in 1948, without an opus number. In 1890, after vacationing at Ivanovka, his family's summer residence, Rachmaninoff wrote a letter to Natalia Skalon, a family friend in Moscow, reporting that he had to write a fugue for Arensky's class, \\"an unpleasant circumstance however you look at it.\\" It turned out to resemble a canon more than a fugue, however, and was published in 1949 as Canon in E minor. Although written as an assignment, the piece conveys the impression not of an academic contrapuntal exercise but rather of a vivid outburst. The texture and harmony show enough advancement over his earlier Four Pieces to indicate that he had been sensible not to publish them as his opus 1. Oriental Sketch (1917) is a name given to the piece by the publisher, and was not written to depict anything oriental. In 1891, Rachmaninoff composed his Piano Concerto No. 1 (which became his first official opus) and afterwards in July, a small piece, Prelude in F major, which he revised later to include the cello. It was at this time, in 1892, that the Morceaux de fantaisie were composed. In 1891 Rachmaninoff also composed his Suite in D minor for orchestra, considered lost until the manuscript was found in 2002, leading to the discovery that a previously-unattributed composition for piano is a reduction for solo piano of this Suite. The suite is in four movements: Lento: Allegro moderato in D minor, Lento in B minor, Menuetto in F-sharp major, and Allegro in D major. He spent much of the next few years writing some of his orchestral pieces, including The Rock (1893) and Caprice Boh√©mien (1895). His return to pianistic work in early 1896 was marked by his contribution to Four Improvisations, a collaboration with Anton Arensky, Alexander Glazunov, and Sergei Taneyev. After the Six Moments Musicaux were completed in 1896, Rachmaninoff composed a single Morceau de Fantaisie in G minor on 11 January 1899. He subtitled it \\"Delmo\\", however what this means is unknown. It is two pages long and features an emphatic, if not brief, climax. He also produced a Fughetta in F major in February of that year, which is also short and has clean counterpoint. He composed most of his published works in this period, starting with the Chopin Variations. After the nine √âtudes- Tableaux, Op. 39, Rachmaninoff composed several minor works in 1917. The Oriental Sketch is a fast-paced piece littered with sixteenth note figures. The piece was not intended to be associated with the Orient; the title was given by the publisher. The Prelude in D minor, a dark piece with thick and fast moving chords that repeatedly descend into low register, is a manifestation of his unhappiness with the October Revolution. The manuscript survived and was first published in 1973. His penultimate piano composition (only his Corelli Variations came later) was a one-page piece entitled Fragments, a brief nostalgic piece from his final days in Moscow. It was first published in the magazine, The Etude, in 1919.Harrison, p. 214 In 2003, while researching Rachmaninoff material at the Library of Congress, the Australian pianist Scott Davie discovered a two-page sketch of a previously unknown Rachmaninoff work, a Piano Piece in A-flat major. While he was able to make a pencil copy, it wasn't until later he realized that the sketch was complete. Davie was given permission to make use of the piece by the composer's great- granddaughter, Natalie Wanamaker Javier, while attending the 2006 International Rachmaninoff Conference in Amsterdam. The piece was recorded and released by ABC Classics on his Pictures from an Exhibition CD. Since then the piece has also been recorded by Vladimir Ashkenazy and released by Decca.

By birth, he was the son of a former Minister of the Interior, great-grandson of Andr√©s Bello and nephew to President Jos√© Manuel Balmaceda. After completing his secondary studies, he joined the Chilean Foreign Service and in 1905 was appointed secretary of the Chilean consulate in Brussels. The murder His immediate superior at the consulate in Brussels was charge d'affaires Don Luis Waddington, who had two children: Adelaida and Carlos. Soon after his arrival, Balmaceda started to court Adelaide and shortly thereafter, the parents of the bride-to-be found out that the young couple already had had sexual intercourse. They then demanded that 19-year-old Ernesto become engaged to Adelaide and \\"redress the wrong done\\" to her.The New York Times, June 25, 1907 He admitted his error and accepted the engagement for the time being. Balmaceda did not want to get married, so he wrote to his family to have himself immediately transferred to another embassy.The New York Times, June 30, 1907 His family connections managed his transfer to the embassy in the United States, but before he could depart the news leaked, and 16-year-old Carlos Waddington, brother of his bride-to-be started to practice target-shooting in the embassy gardens under his window. Ernesto Balmaceda panicked and on February 24, 1906, the day when the engagement was to be publicly announced at an embassy banquet, he hid in his rooming-house, with his friend Javier Rengifo. Carlos visited him and demanded that he honor his word. When Balmaceda refused, he shot him three times: once in the heart, once in the chest and once in the head.The New York Times, July 3, 1907 Carlos Waddington during his trial in 1907 After the murder, Carlos Waddington fled to the Chilean embassy and claimed diplomatic immunity and extraterritoriality. The Belgian people were incensed at this behavior and surrounded the embassy, bent on capturing Waddington. The police had to establish a constant cordon in order to prevent the mob from violating the building and lynching him.The New York Times, February 26, 1906 On March 2, Chile waived its rights and ordered Waddington to be handed over to the Belgian police to stand trial.The New York Times, March 3, 1906 By the time the trial happened, public opinion had shifted in Waddington's favor, and he was viewed as the avenger of his sister's honor.The New York Times, July 5, 1907 After a very short trial, he was acquitted on July 6, 1907.The New York Times, July 6, 1907 Additional information =See also= *Balmaceda family =References= External links *The New York Times: \\"SLAIN BY DIPLOMAT'S SON\\" (February 25, 1906) *The New York Times: \\"LYNCHERS BESIEGE LEGATION\\" (February 26, 1906) *The New York Times: \\"GIVES UP DIPLOMAT'S SON\\" (March 3, 1906) *The New York Times: \\"DIPLOMAT'S SON ON TRIAL FOR MURDER\\" (June 25, 1907) *The New York Times: \\"DIPLOMAT'S SON DEFENDS CRIME\\" (June 30, 1907) *The New York Times: \\"PARIS SYMPATHIZES WITH WADDINGTON\\" (July 1, 1907) *The New York Times: \\"WADDINGTON CASE READY FOR JURY\\" (July 3, 1907) *The New York Times: \\"SYMPATHY FOR WADDINGTON\\" (July 5, 1907) *The New York Times: \\"WADDINGTON ACQUITTED\\" (July 6, 1907) *The International and Comparative Law Quarterly: \\"Diplomatic Privileges and Immunities: The Retinue and Families of the Diplomatic Staff\\" by Clifton E.

More than 30,000 Poles with Austrian or Russian citizenship were deported from the Prussian part of divided Poland to the respective Austrian and Russian Partitions of the no-longer existing Commonwealth. The deportations were carried out in an inhumane way, and were based on ethnic discrimination principles. The county-wide expulsion was condemned by the Polish public as well as the federal German parliament. The expulsion also contributed to the worsening of the German-Russian relations. In the aftermath, Poles without German citizenship were again allowed to work and reside in the German Empire in all seasons but the winter. It is regarded as an early example of ethnic cleansing.E. J. Feuchtwanger (2002), Bismarck. Page 235: It was an early example of ethnic cleansing and what makes it in retrospect look even worse was that Bismarck exploited it ruthlessly and deliberately to stir up national feeling against his domestic opponents. The expulsion order of 1885 and its implementation Agriculture in the eastern provinces of Prussia was to a high degree based on large-area manors (often requisitioned from their formerly Polish owners) and run by German junkers, who employed thousands of migrating Poles from the Russian and Austrian part of partitioned Poland. Also, the growing industrial region of Upper Silesia attracted workers from economically backward areas. At the same time, parts of the local German and Polish population migrated in search of work to more industrialized western areas of Germany (Ostflucht). Although no anti-German political activity among the Polish migrants was ever noted, the resulting increase of the Polish population alarmed nationalist German circles, including Germany's chancellor Otto von Bismarck. On 26 March 1885, the ministry of internal affairs of Prussia ordered its provincial authorities to expel abroad all ethnic Poles and Jews holding Russian citizenship. In July 1885, the expulsion order was extended to include Polish Austrian citizens also. Additionally, the authorities were obliged to watch, that in the future no \\"undesirable foreigners\\" would settle on those territories.Historia Polski, Vol. III 1850/1864-1918, Part 2 1850/1864-1900, edited by Polska Akademia Nauk [Polish Academy of Sciences], Pa≈Ñstwowe Wydawnictwo Naukowe, Warsaw 1967, p. 684. The order was executed upon all non-Prussian citizens regardless of their long term residence or previous service in the Prussian Army, and despite their state of health, age or sex. The expellees were \\"driven in mass towards the eastern border under blows of gendarmes' rifle butts\\".J√≥zef Feldman, Bismarck a Polska, Pa≈Ñstwowe Wydawnictwo Naukowe, Warsaw 1966, p. 323. Fatal incidents were being reported, as the expulsions were carried in winter time. In the initial months nearly 26,000 persons were expelled from eastern provinces of Prussia, mainly workers and craftsmen employed there. The expulsions were continued in subsequent years. Until 1890 the number of expellees exceeded 30,000,Polska.pl -Skarby Dziedzictwa Narodowego - Katalog Skarb√≥w - Rugi pruskie and the border of Prussia was closed to all migrants of Polish ethnicity. Effects on public opinion Prussian deportations as shown on painting by Konstanty G√≥rski (1868‚Äì1934) The expulsions resulted in an outcry among the public opinion of Poland, Germany and Europe. Alfred von Waldersee, who in principle agreed to the necessity of the expulsions, admitted to their \\"incredible harshness\\" () in individual cases. Schweinitz, then German ambassador in Russia said, upon reflection: When some day the great chancellor resigns, then many people will feel ashamed and they will mutually reproach themselves with the meanness of their grovelling before his mighty will. I am touched at the most by the unwise and to no purpose cruel order of the expulsions. The matter was laid before the parliament of the German Empire, forwarded by the ethnic Polish MPs, and supported by the Centre Party, Social Democratic Party and the German progressives. The leader of the Social Democratic Party, Wilhelm Liebknecht, called the chancellor to withdraw the steps which might cause international complications and bring down repressive measures upon Germans living abroad. Ansfeld, a progressive, put in a resolution that the expulsion was not justified by the national interest, it was contrary to humanitarian reasons and posed a threat to the welfare of the empire's citizens. Ludwig Windthorst of the Centre Party submitted a supplementary motion to the same effect. On 16 January 1886, the parliament of the German Empire condemned the expulsion with a great majority of voices. Nevertheless, the parliamentary resolution was ignored by the Prussian government. A similar question was asked by the Polish MPs and the Centre Party in the parliament of Prussia, but the majority of voices necessary to condemn the expulsions was not obtained there, because political forces of anti-Polish orientation were represented much more strongly in the Prussian parliament than in the parliament of the German Empire. Influence on German relations with Russia The formerly good relations between Germany and Russia worsened in the 1880s due to growing nationalist trends in Russian politics. German minorities in the Russian Empire, including Baltic and Russian-born Germans as well as recent German immigrants, faced negative sentiments among both the government and the public supporting the ideas of Pan-Slavism. With that in mind, the German ambassador in Russia, Schweinitz, advised Bismarck to abstain from further expulsions, anticipating that they would only provoke the supporters of Pan-Slavism and trigger repressions against all German settlers in Russia.J√≥zef Feldman, op. cit., p. 327 The expulsions had been met with disapproval inside the government circles of Russia. Dmitry Tolstoy, a conservative, and the minister of internal affairs who tried to procure a plausible reception for those events in Russia, acknowledged Otto von Bismarck's Anti-Polish sentiment and unofficially gave ambassador Schweinitz his advice that Bismarck had committed a grave mistake, as such extreme measures were unnecessary.J√≥zef Feldman, op. cit., p. 328 Also Nikolay Giers, the minister of foreign affairs of Russia, stated that Bismarck ‚Äì by his own conduct ‚Äì had aggravated already hostile feelings existing towards German colonists in Russia, had set a bad example to be followed, and had spread the seeds of new ethnic antagonisms in the future. Bismarck himself expressed to ambassador Schweinitz his disappointment, stating that \\"the Russians showed less satisfaction because of our expulsions than I had expected\\". Soon afterward, the Russian government imposed legal restrictions on acquisition and lease of land by Germans in Russia, thus limiting the German colonisation movement in the Russian-controlled part of Poland. Contrary to Bismarck's original intentions, the expulsion contributed to the worsening of German- Russian relations and the erosion of their long term cooperation ‚Äì resulting in a shift in Russia's external policy which finally led to the creation of the Franco-Russian Alliance soon transformed into Triple Entente, which fought the German Empire during World War I in 1914‚Äì1918. Softening of expulsion policy since 1890 The need for cheap labour from German landlords and industry eventually prevailed, therefore the policy of the Prussian government had to be softened. In 1890 a new order was issued to allow employment of ethnically Polish foreigners, except in the period between 20 December to 1 February of each year. The measure was intended to force the workers to periodically return abroad, thus preserving their status of seasonal workers, and preventing the continuity of their stay in Prussia. Such a system of annual winter expulsions was adapted to the needs of the landlords, but was harmful to Upper Silesian industry, which used to disobey the order frequently with the silent tolerance of Prussian authorities, or with its temporary suspension.Konstanty Grzybowski, Historia pa≈Ñstwa i prawa Polski, Vol. IV, Pa≈Ñstwowe Wydawnictwo Naukowe, Warsaw 1982, p. 533. Nevertheless, only unmarried persons were accepted and often, they were kept separated from the local native Polish population.Stefan Kieniewicz, Historia Polski 1795-1918, Pa≈Ñstwowe Wydawnictwo Naukowe, Warsaw 1983, p. 373. Polish migration to Prussia before First World War Since 1905 a semi-governmental agency called the \\"Head Office of Farm Workers\\" took up the engagement of workers from outside Germany. Seasonal labour contracts to the detriment of Polish workers allowed the opportunity for many corrupt practices. The immigrant workers were poorly paid, exploited and ‚Äì in practicality ‚Äì totally unprotected. Nevertheless, the influx of candidates was always large and, in the eve of World War I, the number of immigrant workers exceeded 500,000 persons, 80% of them from the struggling Russian-controlled part of Poland. Approximately 200,000 Poles worked in the eastern provinces of Prussia among low living standards and intensive exploitation. A male worker could save 100-150 Marks per year, while a female worker could save 50-100 Marks per year at best.Stefan Kieniewicz, op. cit., p. 373. Until today, the \\"rugi pruskie\\" or the Prussian mass deportations, serve as Polish national symbol of gross injustice experienced by the Poles at the hands of the anti-Polish forces of Prussia, the German Empire, and Otto von Bismarck personally, during the time when Poland remained occupied.

The material is commonly referred to in the industry as viscose rayon. In 1931, Henry Ford hired chemists Robert Boyer and Frank Calvert to produce artificial silk made with soybean fibers. They succeeded in making a textile fiber of spun soy protein fibers, hardened or tanned in a formaldehyde bath, which was given the name Azlon. It was usable in the making of suits, felt hats, and overcoats. Though pilot production of Azlon reached per day in 1940, it never reached the commercial market; DuPont's nylon was the winner in the quest to produce artificial silk. Although not sold under the name art silk initially, nylon, the first synthetic fiber, was developed in the United States in the late 1930s and used as a replacement for Japanese silk during World War II. Its properties are far superior to rayon and silk when wet, and so it was used for many military applications, such as parachutes. Although nylon is not a good substitute for silk fabric in appearance, it is a successful functional alternative. DuPont's original plans for nylon to become a cheaper and superior replacement for silk stockingsSee DuPont's Press release on Nylon in 1938 which claimed nylon was \\"strong as steel\\" and the \\"first man-made organic textile prepared from raw materials of the mineral kingdom.\\" were soon realized, then redirected for military use\\"Hosiery Woes,\\" Business Week, February 7, 1942. just two years later during World War II. Nylon became a prominent industrial fiber in a short time frame, permanently replacing silk in many applications. In the present day, imitation silk may be made with rayon, mercerized cotton, polyester, a blend of these materials, or a blend of rayon and silk. Despite a generally similar appearance, genuine silk has unique features that are distinguishable from artificial silk. However, in some cases art silk can be passed off as real silk to unwary buyers. A number of tests are available to determine a fabric's basic fiber makeup, some of which can be performed prior to purchasing a fabric whose composition is questionable. Tests include rubbing the pile in the hand, burning a small piece of the fringe to smell the ash and smell the smoke, and dissolving the pile by performing a chemical test.

The report blamed the Arabs for the violence, but identified a series of grievances concerning the way their interests were apparently being subsumed to the interests of the Jewish immigrants, who were then around 10% of the population and increasing rapidly. Some measures to ease Arab unhappiness were taken, but Jewish communities were helped to arm themselves and ultimately the report was ignored. Publishing it (unlike the Palin Report of the previous year) was considered a propitiatory measure. Commission operations The Commission was headed by Sir Thomas Haycraft, then the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court in Palestine with H. C. Luke, assistant governor of Jerusalem and J.N. Stubbs of the Legal Department as members. Muslims were represented by 'Aref Pasha al-Dajani, Christians by Ilyas Effendi Mushabbak and Jews by Dr. Mordechai Eliash. The report was published in October 1921. Background The disturbances occurred during an interval after the military occupation of Palestine, under OETA administration, but before the League of Nations endorsement of British rule and the beginning of the British Mandate. Sir Herbert Samuel had been appointed High Commissioner but there was severe resentment, particularly the Arab majority, because he was known to be a Zionist. In the immediate aftermath of the riots, Samuel could not travel without armoured cars and had been forced to promise a national government.CO 733/10, Morning Post, 'Palestine To-Day: Under the Zionist Yoke. The Prince of Israel', 10 June 1921. Cited by Huneidi \\"A Broken Trust\\" p. 133. Conclusions The Summary Conclusions of the report The report noted that the violence by Arabs on the Jews was apparently triggered by a clash between the MPS (Miflagah Po'alim Sotzialistim) or Bolsheviks and the authorized Jewish Labour Party but that this \\"could not have been sufficient to give rise to more than a street riot of the ordinary kind\\". In the summary of the report the grievances of the Arabs were listed as follows: 1\\\\. The British in Palestine, now led by a Zionist, had adopted \\"a policy mainly directed towards the establishment of a National Home for the Jews, and not to the equal benefit of all Palestinians\\". 2\\\\. An official advisory body to the government in Palestine, the Zionist Commission, placed the interests of the Jews above all others. 3\\\\. There was an undue proportion of Jews in the government. 4\\\\. Part of the Zionist program was to flood the country with people who possessed \\"greater commercial and organizing ability\\" which would eventually lead to their gaining the upper hand over the rest of the population. 5\\\\. The immigrants were an \\"economic danger\\" to the country because of their competition, and because they were favored in this competition. 6\\\\. Immigrants offended the Arabs \\"by their arrogance and by their contempt of Arab social prejudices\\". 7 Owing to insufficient precautions, Bolshevik immigrants were allowed into the country leading to social and economic unrest in Palestine. Some Jews claimed to the Commission that the cause of the trouble was propaganda from a small class of Ottoman supporting Arabs who regretted the departure of the old regime. The British \\"had put an end to privileges and opportunities of profit formerly enjoyed by them\\". However, the Commission was satisfied that this was not the case and that the feeling against the Jews was \\"too genuine, too widespread, and too intense to be accounted for in the above superficial level\\". Any anti-British feeling by Arabs had arisen because of their association with the furtherance of the policy of Zionism. The report made clear that the \\"racial strife was begun by the Arabs\\" and that the \\"Arab majority, who were generally the aggressors, inflicted most of the casualties.\\" \\"The [Arab] police were, with few exceptions, half-trained and inefficient, in many cases indifferent, and in some cases leaders or participators in violence\\" and, while a large part of the Moslem and Christian communities condoned the riots, \\"they did not encourage violence. While certain of the educated Arabs appear to have incited the mob, the notables on both sides, whatever their feelings may have been, aided the authorities to allay the trouble.\\" Five Jewish agricultural colonies had been attacked, but \\"in these raids there were few Jewish and many Arab casualties, chiefly on account of the intervention of the military.\\" The commission added that: \\"We have been assured, and we believe, that had there been no Jewish question, the Government would have had no political difficulty of any importance to deal with so far as its domestic affairs were concerned\\". There was \\"no evidence worth considering\\" that the Jaffa riots were planned; \\"had that been the case, we hesitate to conjecture what the consequences would have been\\". As long as the Jews remained an \\"unobtrusive minority\\" as they did under the Turks, they were not \\"molested or disliked\\"; it was only when the Arabs came to believe that they were exercising a \\"preponderating influence over the Government\\" that a state of feeling emerged which required \\"but a minor provocation on the part of a small number of undesirable Jews to ignite an explosion of popular anger against Jews in general\\". The report noted that: \\"Moslems, Orthodox Christians, Catholics, Maronites and other Uniates, Anglicans have been represented by witnesses, who included priests of the above Christian bodies: and it has been impossible to avoid the conclusions that practically the whole of the non-Jewish population was united in hostility to Jews\\". Dr David Eder, head of the Zionist Commission, had addressed the committee and stated that only Jews should be allowed to bear arms, and that \\"there can only be one National Home in Palestine, and that a Jewish one, and no equality in the partnership between Jews and Arabs, but a Jewish preponderance as soon as the numbers of the race are sufficiently increased.\\"Knox, The Making of a New Eastern Question, p. 158, cited Huneidi \\"A Broken Trust\\", p.135. Results Samuel immediately initiated a scheme for the defense of Jewish settlements. An allotment of brassards and rifles, with proportionate quantity of ammunition, was made to each colony. While in theory these arms were bonded, in practice their distribution legitimised the earlier and illegal formation of the Haganah. Arab education had been a major grievance, since much better opportunities had been available under the Turks. In the event, improvements were made but the money ran out after a year.Samuel Papers, Thames TV 1978, Box I, File II DS 149., cited Huneidi \\"A Broken Trust\\", p.137. In December 1921 Samuel claimed to have solved the problem of the Beisan land in favour of its Arab tenants. On the King's Birthday, 3 June 1921,CO 733/3, 'High Commissioner's Declaration. The King's Birthday Celebrations', Jerusalem, Friday 3 June 1921. Special supplement to the Palestine Weekly, vol. 11, no. 21., cited Huneidi \\"A Broken Trust\\", p.131. Samuel made the first official interpretation of the Balfour Declaration, assuring the Arabs that immigration would be controlled according to the \\"economic absorptive capacity\\" of the country - and in fact suspended immigration, though only temporarily. He hastened the establishment of the Supreme Muslim Council, while restricting its powers exclusively to religious matters. Perhaps most significantly, it was proposed that the anomalous position of the Zionist Organisation should be abolished and the country governed with the help of a body that represented all sections of the community.Wasserstein, The British in Palestine, p. 135, quoting a secret letter from Deedes to Shuckburgh, 22 November 1921 (CO 537/852), cited in Huneidi \\"A Broken Trust\\", p.136. These proposals by Samuel caused significant unhappiness amongst the Zionists, such that Chaim Weizmann suggested to George MacDonogh, director of military intelligence (1916‚Äì18) and a pro-Zionist sympathizer, that Samuel be replaced as high commissioner.Reinharz, Chaim Weizmann, p. 355, also Wasserstein, The British in Palestine, pp. 112-13. Cited in Huneidi, \\"A Broken Trust\\" p.132. Meanwhile, the Arabs demanded the removal of Samuel and another Zionist, Mr Bentwich, his legal adviser. The Arabs felt that they were \\"the victims of Zionist coercion of the Government, which they most thoroughly distrust\\", and that \\"nothing short of a modification of the Jewish policy and the establishment of some form of proportional representation will ease the situation\\".CO 733/13, War Office to Colonial Office (41898 20.8.1921), 'Situation in Palestine 1921', 15 August 1921., cited by Huneidi, \\"A Broken Trust\\", p. 133. In his 'Political Report' for June 1921, Samuel reported the details of his new scheme to the colonial secretary Winston Churchill. He wrote that, since his speech of 3 June, the Jewish population had been \\"very nervous and apprehensive\\" and considered the speech a \\"severe set-back\\" to their aspirations. He maintained, however, that this feeling had been \\"a good deal modified\\" since Jewish colonies had been \\"provided with arms (under conditions strictly limiting their use to self-defence)\\".C0 733/4, Samuel to Churchill, Political Report for June 1921, cited Huneidi \\"A Broken Trust\\", p.138. There was another outburst of violence on 2 November 1921, the fourth anniversary of the Balfour Declaration. Private correspondence within the Colonial Office suggested that the Zionist Commission was making it appear that His Majesties Government \\"was bound hand and foot to the Zionists, that the statement of the 3rd June was mere dust thrown in their eyes, and all Legislation here was, and would continue to be inspired by Zionist interest\\" Wasserstein, The British in Palestine, p. 135, quoting a secret letter from Deedes to Shuckburgh, 22 November 1921 (CO 537/852), cited Huneidi \\"A Broken Trust\\", p.136.

Next to national floral symbols, there are also more specific provincial floral emblems that represent each respective provinces of Indonesia. In addition, Indonesia also recognised Teak as the national tree.  Indonesian national floral emblems  There are three categories of floral emblem that symbolise Indonesia: #National flower () of Indonesia is Melati putih (Jasminum sambac) #Flower of charm () is Anggrek Bulan (Moon Orchid) (Phalaenopsis amabilis)) #Rare flower () is Padma Raksasa Rafflesia (Rafflesia arnoldii). All three were chosen on World Environment Day in 1990. On the other occasion Bunga Bangkai (Titan arum) was also added as puspa langka together with Rafflesia. Melati putih (jasminum sambac), a small white flower with sweet fragrance, has long been considered as a sacred flower in Indonesian tradition, as it symbolises purity, sacredness, graceful simplicity and sincerity. Although the official adoption were announced only as early as 1990 during World Environment Day and enforced by law through Presidential Decree (Keputusan Presiden) No. 4 1993,Keputusan Presiden No. 4 Tahun 1993 the importance of Jasminum sambac in Indonesian culture predates its official adoption. Since the formation of Indonesian republic during the reign of Sukarno, melati putih is always unofficially recognised as the national flower of Indonesia. The reverence and the elevated status of this flower mostly due to the importance of jasminum sambac in Indonesian tradition since ancient times. Melati putih is also the most important flower in wedding ceremonies for ethnic Indonesians, especially in the island of Java. Jasmine flower buds that haven't fully opened are usually picked to create strings of jasmine garlands called roncen melati. On wedding days, a traditional Javanese or Sundanese bride's hair is adorned with strings of jasmine garlands arranged as a hairnet to cover the konde (hair bun). The intricately intertwined strings of jasmine garlands are left to hang loose from the bride's head. The groom's kris is also adorned with five jasmine garlands called roncen usus-usus (intestine garlands) to refer its intestine-like form and also linked to the legend of Arya Penangsang. In Makassar and Bugis brides, the hair is also adorned with buds of jasmine that resemble pearls. Jasmine is also used as floral offerings for spirits and deities especially among Balinese Hindu, and also often present during funerals. The jasmine has wide spectrums in Indonesian traditions; it is the flower of life, beauty and festive wedding, yet it is also often associated with spirit and death. In Indonesian patriotic songs and poems, the fallen melati often hailed as the representation of fallen heroes that sacrificed their life for the country. The Ismail Marzuki's patriotic song \\"Melati di Tapal Batas\\" (jasmine on the border) (1947) and Guruh Sukarnoputra's \\"Melati Suci\\" (sacred jasmine) (1974) clearly refer jasmine as the representation of fallen heroes, the eternally fragrance flower that adorned Ibu Pertiwi (Indonesian national personification). The other two national flowers were chosen for different reasons. Moon Orchid was chosen for its beauty, while the other two rare flowers, Rafflesia arnoldii and Titan arum were chosen to demonstrate uniqueness and Indonesian floral biodiversity.

The Master of Laws (L.L.M.) curriculum includes courses in Administrative and Civil Law, Contract and Fiscal Law, Criminal Law, and International and Operational Law. Leadership Shoulder Sleeve Insignia worn by United States Army personnel assigned to The Judge Advocate General's Legal Center and SchoolThe Institute of Heraldry, \\"Judge Advocate General's Legal Center and School\\" The Legal Center and School (LCS) is led by a brigadier general who serves as the commander/commandant, a colonel as the chief of staff/XO, a warrant officer who serves as the senior warrant officer advisor for the LCS, a command sergeant major who serves as the senior enlisted advisor for the LCS and also as the commandant of the Noncommissioned Officer Academy and a government civilian who serves as the executive director. The school is led by a colonel who serves as the dean, and the center is led by a colonel who serves as the legal center director. The school's five academic departments are led by lieutenant colonels and a chief warrant officer Four. Faculty members are lieutenant colonels or majors who are licensed attorneys and are members of the Army Judge Advocate General's Corps. With the exception of the legal administrator and Paralegal Education Department, each academic department has at least one faculty member who is a judge advocate in the navy, air force, or marine corps. Prior to entry into the JAG School, all Army judge advocates must have graduated from an ABA-accredited law school and be admitted to practice law by the highest court of a state or federal district. While some judge advocates have prior enlisted or commissioned experience, most are direct commissioned and have no prior military training or experience. The JAG School is generally considered the most exclusive graduate service academy within the U.S. Federal Government. Acceptance into the Army JAG Corps and subsequent JAG School is considered \\"highly selective\\" with an acceptance rate ranging between 4-7%. In 2017, the Army JAG Corps accepted 200 out of 4,000 applicants. The JAG School has a long history of supplying attorneys into the military and federal government roles, particularly the federal judiciary. The initial entry training into the JAG Corps is composed of two phases, first a 6 week Direct Commission Course (DCC) at Fort Benning, Georgia followed by military legal training at the JAG School. History Despite a long record of service by Army Judge Advocates, it was not until the beginning of World War II that efforts were made to provide Army attorneys with specialized military legal education. In February 1942, as uniformed lawyers' responsibilities increased in volume and complexity, specialized continuing legal education courses for Judge Advocates began in Washington, D.C. In August 1942, the school moved from Washington's National University School of Law to the University of Michigan Law School in Ann Arbor, Michigan. Intended only as a temporary facility, it was deactivated in 1946 during the general demobilization following World War II. In October 1950, another temporary school was activated at Fort Myer, Virginia on land that is now a part of Arlington National Cemetery. After graduating six classes, it was decided a permanent school for Army lawyers should be established. In August 1951, the Army accepted an offer from the University of Virginia to move the school there permanently. The Seventh Judge Advocate Officer Basic Course and First Judge Advocate Officer Advanced Course began in the fall of 1951. The school has remained at the University of Virginia and is now located adjacent to the University of Virginia School of Law. Clark Hall within University of Virginia Law School from 1951 to 1975. After moving to Charlottesville, The Judge Advocate General's School was initially located in Clark Hall, then behind Clark Hall in what is now called Kerchof Hall. In 1975, the school relocated to the university's North Grounds, moving at the same time as the law school. The building, and the adjacent law school building, were designed by Hugh Stubbins & Associates with Rawlings, Wilson, and Fraher. An addition to the building, designed by Bohlin, Powell, Larkin, and Cywinski in collaboration with Johnson, Craven, and Gibson, was completed in 1991. Master of Laws (L.L.M.) The Judge Advocate Officer Graduate Course is the school's \\"flagship\\" course. Accredited by the American Bar Association, the course prepares experienced military attorneys for supervisory duties and other positions of increased responsibility within their respective services. Students who successfully complete the course are awarded a Master of Laws degree in Military Law. Selection to attend the course is a permanent change of station assignment; students do not attend in a temporary duty status. Each class consists of attorneys from the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard, as well as international military students and Army civilian attorneys. International military students have come from Egypt, Israel, Poland, Romania, South Korea, Bosnia and Herzegovina and other nations. All students are licensed attorneys who generally have five to eight years of experience. The Graduate Course covers a full resident academic year from mid- August to mid-May. The fall and spring semesters include core classes required of all students. In the second quarter of the fall semester and in the spring semester, students select from approximately fifty electives offered by the school's four academic departments: Administrative and Civil Law, Contract and Fiscal Law, Criminal Law, and International and Operational Law. Students may specialize in one of the four academic areas in conjunction with the Master of Laws. To qualify for a specialty, a student must either write a thesis in the area of specialization, or earn at least ten elective credit hours and write an extensive paper in the area of specialization.

Inverted relief that are visible in Juventae Chasma are also visible in other parts of Mars. This occurs when sediments are deposited on the floor of a stream and then become resistant to erosion, perhaps by cementation. Later the area may be buried. Eventually, erosion removes the covering layer and the former streams become visible since they are resistant to erosion. Mars Global Surveyor found several examples of this process.

PokerTracker's software imports and parses the hand histories that poker sites create during online play and stores the resulting statistics/information about historical play into a local database library for self-analysis, and for in-game opponent analysis using a real-time Head-up display. The software allows the user to monitor each poker session's profit or loss, hands played, time played, and table style. It calculates and graphs statistics such as hands per hour, winnings per hand, winnings per hour, cumulative profit and loss, and individual game profit and loss across multiple currencies. Products The logo associated with PokerTracker 3 PokerTracker Software, LLC produces poker analysis software. Examples include PokerTracker Holdem v2, PokerTracker Omaha v2, PokerTracker 3 Hold'em (PT3) for Texas Hold 'em, PokerTracker 3 Omaha (PTO) for Omaha Hold 'em, PokerTracker Stud for Stud poker, and TableTracker. The company previously developed the PokerAce Head-Up Display, also known as PokerAce HUD or simply PAHUD, which provides real-time information for live online poker play; the functionality from this formerly separate application was eventually incorporated within PokerTracker 3. Collectively, the company's software has been described as \\"among the most comprehensive software programs in the online poker industry\\" by PokerSoftware.com. The company subsequently developed PokerTracker 4 in 2012 and 2013, which is its most recent software development. =PokerTracker 3= The general info tab view of a sample database in PokerTracker Holdem v3.00 beta 29, including user customized columns such as final tables and highest percentile finish. In September 2009, the company announced that as of March 31, 2010, PokerTracker Holdem v2 would no longer be supported. The decision was made because PokerTracker 3 had been released on May 15, 2008, nearly two years prior to the end-of-life date. The company felt that discontinuing support of v2 would avail resources which could be dedicated to improving PT3 and providing exceptional customer service. Similarly on December 31, 2010, PokerTracker Omaha v2 will also no longer be supported, as its features have been completely integrated into the PokerTracker 3 product line. PokerTracker 3 supports online poker from the following poker networks and/or sites: 888 Poker Network, Bodog, Boss Media, Cake Network, Cereus Poker Network, Entraction Poker, Everest Poker, Full Tilt Poker, IPoker, Microgaming, Merge Gaming Network, OnGame, PartyPoker, PokerStars and Winamax. PokerTracker is available natively for both Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X-based computers. PokerTracker 3 competes against several similar programs. According to Total Gambler, its most notable competitors are Hold‚Äôem Manager and PokerOffice, while Pokersoftware.com considers only Hold‚Äôem Manager to be a serious competitor. =PokerTracker 4= PokerTracker 4 is poker tracking software that designed for several types of online poker: No-Limit, Limit, or Pot-Limit cash games, Sit N‚Äô Go's and Multi-Table Tournaments for both Texas Holdem and Omaha players. It is compatible with almost all online poker websites' software and interfaces. PokerTracker 4 began public beta testing in March 2012. In August 2012, the company commercially launched a Microsoft Windows version of PokerTracker 4. In January 2013 as PokerTracker version 4.05.10 was rolled out, the company began alpha testing an Apple OS X version of the software. PokerTracker 4 was produced from scratch rather than by refining PokerTracker 3 and other earlier versions.

These hand histories summarize the details of the hand in a format that can be parsed by computer software. PokerTracker reads these files and extracts the relevant information, which it converts into a database for later review or statistical analysis. The software is capable of combining hand history details of multiple accounts from different online poker services, which allows a user to aggregate his or her data. Statistical summaries can be consolidated from different poker sites regardless of whether the user's screen name is the same at each site. PokerTracker is capable of analyzing cash ring games in which players play for cash during each hand, sit and go tournaments in which players compete for set prizes after the prescribed number of competitors join the tournament, and multi-table tournaments in which players compete for tournament prizes based on the total number of entries at the scheduled start time. Statistics can be tracked by position, session, tournament, best & worst hands, and hand results. This helps the user analyze statistics based on starting hand or final hand. The software also enables the user to replay any specific hand. ;Sample Tournament Summary PokerStars Tournament #165494542, No Limit Hold'em Buy-In: $0.25 90 players Total Prize Pool: $22.50 Tournament started 2009/05/21 10:19:54 ET Tournament finished 2009/05/21 14:09:17 ET 1: ElT007 (Chicago), $6.20 (27.55%) 2: Rogoslav (??????), $4.17 (18.53%) 3: zibi23 (Warsaw), $3.16 (14.04%) 4: Samskn (Veltem-Beisem), $2.14 (9.51%) 5: thyrandy360 (Valkenburg), $1.57 (6.97%) 6: Lil Advocate (G√∂teborg), $1.18 (5.24%) 7: hungrong (wien), $0.95 (4.22%) 8: CKWIFE (LIVRY GARGAN), $0.81 (3.60%) 9: NaiVang (Maplewood), $0.67 (2.97%) 10: SONAG777 (??????), $0.55 (2.44%) 11: zofiaj (newark), $0.55 (2.44%) 12: alinjef (bigspring), $0.55 (2.44%) 13: Richt_Ace (Solna), 14: slongadonga (Port Pirie), 15: dadou187 (a cote de chez toi), 16: SainttAA (Greve), 17: MaxFox123 (Moscow), 18: Suxela (Lubertsy), 19: Albazax (??????), 20: michmach69 (k√∂ln), 21: patriot1011 (Moncton), 22: scotticus08 (Australia), 23: jajay211 (Jacobs Well), 24: pitcherplaya (Oklahoma City), 25: Caraxe (Utrecht), 26: robygrasu (bucuresti), 27: DrKuzma (Paracin/Great Serbia), 28: Pot\`Nbeer (Mautern), 29: jdcecil (Middletown), 30: Loushje (Bergen), 31: ancuta010601 (botosani), 32: redmarian111 (alcorcon (madrid)), 33: drbobo69 (Warszawa), 34: $700straight (Frankfurt am Main), 35: SportModel (Oakland), 36: mietze166 (Essen), 37: diannepoesje (arnhem), 38: emivallejo (San juan), 39: mamo54 (Fort Worth), 40: DEANO247365 (LONDON), 41: BigBenefit$ (sydney), 42: Lin Pi Yama (Ermelo), 43: fishmunga (sydney), 44: tissy26 (Hamburg), 45: Thomas Less (Helsinki), 46: ptrperfect (sydney), 47: maxouu31 (Toulouse), 48: franssuh (horst), 49: sn√∂by (m√•nkarbo), 50: SaberKt (Kutina), 51: tupac_thegod (charny), 52: miguel1076 (famalicao), 53: Vitilo (Gijon), 54: ARENA83 (Fuerth), 55: JOBABIS4799 (BRUNTAL), 56: slawus (Bilgoraj), 57: zamgod (morelia), 58: bd1968 (ceres), 59: darkcity007 (Durham), 60: Elias2010 (K√∂ln), 61: Roti82 (Montevideo), 62: soerer (berlin), 63: N.O.

The software's database uses tournament summaries such as the 'Sample Tournament Summary' example and hand histories to provide a three section summary (see infobox screenshot). The top section of the general information tab provides tournament summaries of profit/loss as well as ordinal placement summary. The other sections summarize situational statistics based on the level of the blinds and the starting hand. Additional tabs in the software produce detailed information for various statistical interests. PokerTracker's probability graphs, as well as historical statistics of the hands a user and his or her opponents have played, enable the user to analyze conditional statistical possibilities and optimal betting amounts. The situations it analyzes are conditional on the opposition's playing characteristics and the player's position relative to the dealer. Graphs can be produced for a single session or for any part of one's playing history. One of the biggest improvements in PokerTracker 3 over PT2 is that it is fully customizable so that all statistics and reports can be tailored to the individual user. The Guardian claims most serious players use PokerTracker during online play to constantly calculate situational optima. PokerTracker 3 version v3.00 beta 29 Profit graph PokerTracker 3 is also known for its integrated heads-up display, a transparent video overlay data presentation that makes statistics and notes are readily available during play. The HUD allows an online poker player to focus his attention on the poker table he or she is playing at, rather than on the PokerTracker application. The HUD provides a vast array of realtime statistics for in-game analysis, customizable to the user's preference. In addition to the statistics available constantly during play on the poker window, detailed statistics are available in a pop-up window, accessible via a single mouse click. Marbella Slim of the Daily Star used the vision of Arnold Schwarzenegger's Terminator character in an analogy with the HUD: \\"In some scenes, you get to see what the robot Terminator is seeing and he has all these data streams in front of his vision - it's a HUD or a head-up display.\\" Unlike other poker tracking products, PokerTracker 3 includes a HUD as part of the basic program. The PT3 HUD, which automatically overlays a player's opponents' statistics next to their avatars, is essentially a built-in version of the formerly available PokerAce HUD. PokerTracker v2 will no longer be supported after March 31, 2010. PokerTracker 3 also offers a monthly subscription-based service called TableTracker. TableTracker is an integrated service that automatically identifies ring tables with competition suitable to the user's playing style. PokerTracker's servers constantly monitor which players are playing and what tables they are playing at on various major poker sites, which allows TableTracker to find the weakest players across multiple online poker websites. The user can search based on the software's built in scoring system or any other statistics of his or her choosing. Use and legality PokerTracker 3 includes a HUD overlay as seen in this Pokerstars online poker session Serious poker pros and casual amateurs alike can benefit from the poker tracking software, and poker magazines such as Card Player repeatedly remind poker players of the usefulness of tracking software. Total Gambler says that in addition to experience and skill the other necessity for a gambler to become a professional poker player is a good software package such as PokerTracker. Several websites portray PokerTracker as either the world's leading or the world's most popular poker tracking software. For example, Pokersource.com describes it as \\"the most popular poker tracking and analysis software available\\" and Party Poker describes PokerTracker as \\"the original and largest piece of poker tracking software\\". PokerSoftware.com says \\"Poker Tracker has been the industry standard ... for years\\". Total Gambler says that for more than a two-year period PokerTracker 2 was the \\"prominent force in online poker tracking\\", but at the time of its December 2008 review it speaks of this leadership position in the past tense, noting that PT3 had not yet been \\"fully released\\" at the time of its testing. Major online card rooms forbid the use of software that gives a player an \\"unfair advantage.\\" This typically includes software that allows players to share their hole cards with other players during live play and software that automates decision making. Since PokerTracker software doesn't fit into either of these categories it is generally allowed on most sites, including industry leader PokerStars.com. Legality aside, some players feel the use of PokerTracker takes away from the game; for example, Victoria Coren of The Guardian remarks \\"there is only one downside [to using PokerTracker]. Where's the bloody fun in it?\\" Notes External links *PokerTracker official site Category:Poker tools Category:Proprietary cross-platform software ","title":"PokerTracker"},{"id":"14100502","text":"is a male Japanese voice actor from Fukuoka, Japan who is an affiliate of Mausu Promotion.

While instead Village Roadshow would release big blockbusters from studios such as Warner Bros. and New Line Cinema. Reel Corporation would look after genre titles which didn't necessarily have big studio output deals, which aided in international distribution for films which include Teaching Mrs. Tingle and Bride of Chucky. Revival Starting in February 2007, Village Roadshow allocated many of its 'smaller' titles to Reel DVD to be repackaged and re-distributed, and sold at discount prices. These also included big budget films like Jason X and The Art of War which hadn't achieved high sales on DVD. They were submitted for Revision at the Office of Film and Literature Classification (Australia's censorship board) and officially given new Classification logos and simpler Classification Advice.

In December 1916 he joined the German air service. He was one of three brothers (the others being Walter and Conrad) to serve in the Fliegertruppe during World War I. He first flew two- seaters with FFA 53, which became FA 272 (A), as a reconnaissance pilot directing artillery fire, before becoming a fighter pilot with Jasta 36, which was commanded by his brother Walter who fell on 6 January 1918. During his time with Jasta 36, Harry von B√ºlow-Bothkamp shot down an Airco D.H.4 on 12 October 1917, followed by five additional enemy fighters.

The location and date of her martyrdom are not precisely known.Santa Restituta d'Africa (o di Teniza) She sometimes is considered one of the Martyrs of Abitinae, Roman Province of Africa, a group of North Africans including St. Dativus, St. Saturninus, et alia, who were martyred in AD 304. Legend A later medieval legend, recounted by Pietro Suddiacono in the 10th centuryRecounted in http://www.santiebeati.it/dettaglio/53650 and similar to legends associated with Saints Devota, Reparata, and Torpes of Pisa, states that after being horribly tortured, Restituta was placed in a blazing boat loaded with oakum and resin. Restituta was unharmed by the fire, and asked for aid from God. God sent an angel to guide her boat to the island of Aenaria (present-day Ischia), and she landed at the present-day site of San Montano. The legend further states that a local Christian woman named Lucina had dreamt of the angel and the boat. When she walked to the beach, she found the resplendent and incorrupt body of Restituta, who was now dead. Lucina gathered the population together and the saint was solemnly buried at the foot of Monte Vico in Lacco Ameno, where a paleochristian basilica was dedicated to her, and is now the site of a sanctuary dedicated to her. Veneration However, the spread of her cult from North Africa to Italy is historically associated with the expulsion of Catholics from North Africa by Genseric, king of the Vandals, who followed the Arian sect. Her relics may have been brought to Naples in the fifth century by Gaudiosus of Naples when he was exiled from North Africa.San Gaudioso di Abitine A church, Santa Restituta, was built in her honour in Naples in the sixth century. The church was then incorporated into the Cathedral of Naples built on the same site in the 13th century. She is the patron saint of Lacco Ameno.Catholic-Forum.com She is especially venerated on the island of Ischia and at Lacco Ameno, where she is celebrated in a three-day celebration running from May 16 to May 18. A crypt associated with Restituta can be found at Cagliari, in the neighborhood of Stampace.

The federation spawned, then later devolved into, the Scouts Lao, the H·ªôi H∆∞·ªõng ƒê·∫°o Vi·ªát Nam and the Angkar Khemarak Kayarith. Annamese branch of the F√©d√©ration Indochinoise des Associations du Scoutisme In 1930, Scouting appeared in Indochina and began to develop around schools and colleges in Hanoi and Saigon. Andr√© Lef√®vre, chief of the Eclaireurs de France, set up a training camp for 60 Scoutmasters from all over French Indochina in 1935 at ƒê√† L·∫°t. At the end of 1937, French Scouting sent Scoutmaster Raymond Schlemmer to Indochina to oversee the setting up of Scouting in all three regions, creating FIAS. From 1939 through 1945, the political situation affected Scouting activities all across the country, as World War II engendered independence movements. The French began to lose control and were finally overthrown by Japanese intervention. This ceased the French Scouts' activity in Indochina. Japanese military authorities did not consistently encourage the Scouting movement in occupied territories. Where local conditions were favorable, authorities would permit local Scouting or introduce Japanese-style Scouting, or Sh≈çnendan, and sometimes even made this compulsory. On the other hand, where conditions were not favorable, and anti-Japanese sentiments were likely to be nurtured through Scouting, the authorities would prohibit it entirely. In French Indochina, Vietnamese Scouting was permitted. After the coup in March, 1945, Bao Dai was installed as the puppet ruler, and Vietnam was nominally independent. The Japanese prohibited French Scouting, but would use Vietnamese Scouts to control the French population in Saigon.http://www.scout.org.hk/article_attach/14529/p14.pdf War and Occupation, 1941-1945 by Paul Kua, Deputy Chief Commissioner (Management), Scout Association of Hong Kong, 2010 In 1946, the National Scoutmaster Conference unified the Scouting movements in the three regions of Vietnam, and the General Committee was established. The First Indochina War erupted at the end of 1946, and the Scouting movement in Vietnam was on hiatus until 1950. During the war, many members of the Scouting movement were separated into different sides. While all members of the General Committee established in 1946 followed Ho√†ng √ê·∫°o Th√∫y into hiding, some Scoutmasters and Scout members in the cities began to restore the movement from 1950, especially in Hanoi. After the Geneva World Scout Conference in 1954, Scouting returned to Indochina. The Scout Association of North Vietnam was abolished as North Vietnam was under communist rule, and as a result, the Scouts lost their former training ground, but soon established a new one near ƒê√† L·∫°t.

In most other years, a contract for the opening six weeks of the season would involve playing four to six championship matches, some but not all FPT matches and no Twenty20, but the scheduling for 2009 had to accommodate ICC World Twenty20 and the eventually- cancelled Stanford Super Series. Despite Hughes holding an Italian passport by virtue of his Italian mother, Middlesex resisted signing him up as a Kolpak player and instead signed him as a foreign player. He enjoyed strong success in England, scoring 574 runs in his three first-class matches, including three hundreds, at an average of 143.50.

In his last two first-class matches for New South Wales in the 2010/11 season he scored 54, 115, 138 and 93. Australia's chairman of selectors, Andrew Hilditch, said \\"I was thrilled for Phil, I think he turned the corner the last game. I spent a bit of time with him before the last Shield game and he seemed to be in a really good place. Having had a tough season, to emerge like he has is a credit to him.\\" List A career Less than a week after his debut in first- class cricket, on 28 November 2007, Hughes made his List A debut against Victoria at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. While he was not originally scheduled to play the match, sickness to Australian opening batsman Phil Jaques handed him the spot.Pain-free Tait aims high Cricinfo (28 November 2007).

After New South Wales' wicket-keeper Brad Haddin was struck in the head by a top edge, Hughes took on the keeping duties for nine overs. On 17 May 2009, Hughes made his first limited overs century, scoring 119 for Middlesex against Warwickshire. On 29 July 2014, he made a double century (202 not out from 151 balls) in a match with South Africa A in Darwin. Australian international career Ducking to a short ball that, according to critics, caused him problems in England. After consistently making runs at domestic level, Hughes was called up to replace Matthew Hayden on Australia's tour of South Africa in February and March 2009. He was selected to make his debut in the first Test match starting on 26 February 2009 at the New Wanderers Stadium in Johannesburg after making 53, then retiring, in Australia's tour match against the South African Board President's XI. He was dismissed for a duck in his first Test innings by Dale Steyn off just the fourth ball of the match, however he went on to top-score with 75 in the second innings, including 11 fours and a six. Hughes hit his maiden Test century in the first innings of the second Test at the Sahara Stadium, Kingsmead, Durban, on 6 March 2009, before adding another hundred in the second Innings. In doing so, at the age of 20 years and 96 days, he became both the youngest Australian since Doug Walters to score a Test century and the youngest player from any country to score a century in both innings of a Test match. Hughes at Northampton in July 2009 During the 2009 Ashes campaign, Hughes' unorthodox technique was exploited by fast bowlers, who targeted his upper body and avoided bowling wide outside off stump, restricting his opportunities to play shots through the offside, most notably the cut shot. He was dropped from the team for the third Edgbaston Test in favour of Shane Watson, who opened the batting in his place and provided the Australians with an extra bowling option. Upon his return from South Africa, the Phillip Hughes Award, to be given annually to a promising young cricketer from the local district, was announced in his home town of Macksville. He was awarded the Bradman Young Cricketer of the Year at the Allan Border Medal ceremony by the CA in 2009.https://www.cricketaustralia.com.au/about/awards-and-events/australian- cricket-awards Hughes was a fringe player for the next year or so, playing some Tests to cover for other injured batsmen. He played two home Tests against Pakistan in this capacity, covering for the injured Ricky Ponting in the Boxing Day Test, then Simon Katich in the New Year's Test. He was then called up to the Test squad for the tour of New Zealand in March 2010 to replace Shane Watson in the first Test; he scored a rapid 86 from 75 balls in a small fourth-innings run chase in this Test. Hughes was dropped from the 2010‚Äì11 Ashes squad, but was called up for the Third Test as a replacement for the injured Simon Katich. He was a regular in the Australian team for the following year, playing in the last three Ashes tests, tours of Sri Lanka and South Africa and then a home series against New Zealand, but his spot came under pressure due to his inconsistency during that time. He achieved two big scores (126 in Colombo and 88 in Johannesburg), but his next-highest score was only 36, and he consistently fell to catches at slip and gully. He was heavily criticised for his performance in the two-Test series against New Zealand, in which he managed only 41 runs at 10.25, and was dismissed exactly the same way in all four innings: caught at slip by Martin Guptill from the bowling of Chris Martin. He was dropped from the Australian team following the series. In a stint for Worcestershire in the English County Cricket competition, Hughes made adjustments to his much maligned technique resulting in a more expansive range of strokes with more emphasis on legside play. Upon return to Australia, Hughes left his home state of New South Wales, moving to South Australia. This resulted in a strong return of runs in first-class cricket in the Sheffield Shield and one day cricket in the Ryobi Cup. These returns earned Hughes a recall to the Australian Test team to face Sri Lanka in Hobart following the retirement of Ricky Ponting in December 2012. He made an impressive first inning 86 batting at number 3. After almost a year away from the Test arena, Hughes found himself back in the Test side for the series against Sri Lanka in lieu of the retiring Ricky Ponting, occupying the number 3 position over Watson. Immediately he made an impact, scoring a solid 86 in the first Test match at Hobart, with a new-found confidence and tighter technique that had eluded him 12 months prior. He made two half centuries during his comeback scoring 233 runs at 46.60 in what was the most successful stint at the number 3 spot that the Australians had seen for some time. Hughes was set to receive a $1 million contract with Cricket Australia and be selected in Australia's ODI and T20 international squads in the wake of Michael Hussey's international retirement at the end of the 2012/13 Australia summer. Hughes' selection in the Australian ODI squad was confirmed on 6 January 2013. National selection boss John Inverarity noted that players such as Hughes were included with an eye to the 2015 World Cup, suggesting that he was viewed as a long-term player for Australia in all three forms of the game. Hughes made his mark with a solid 112 (from 129 balls) in his ODI debut, becoming the first Australian to reach a century on debut. He opened the innings with Aaron Finch at Melbourne, and added a 140-run 3rd wicket partnership with captain George Bailey, before being dismissed by Lasith Malinga. Hughes scored his 2nd match-winning ODI century with 138 (n.o) off 154 balls in the fifth ODI of the same series. Following his successful summer season in Australia in 2012/2013, Hughes was selected to play in the Test series in India, but he struggled, scoring 147 runs in eight innings and averaging only 18.37. He played the first two Tests of the 2013 Ashes, and shared a world record tenth wicket partnership of 163 runs with debutant Ashton Agar in the first innings at Trent Bridge, but was dropped after scoring only two runs in the following three innings. Hughes did not play another Test for Australia, but played in ODI series in India in October 2013, in Zimbabwe (against both Zimbabwe and South Africa) in September 2014, and against Pakistan in the UAE in October 2014. Hughes made his only Twenty20 International appearance for Australia against Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates on 5 October 2014.

Death During the afternoon session of the Sheffield Shield match between South Australia and New South Wales at the Sydney Cricket Ground on 25 November 2014, Hughes, batting at 63 not out, was struck in the neck by the ball after missing an attempted hook shot to a bouncer from New South Wales bowler Sean Abbott. Hughes was wearing a helmet, but the ball struck an unprotected area just below his left ear. He collapsed before receiving mouth-to-mouth resuscitation and was subsequently taken to St Vincent's Hospital, Sydney, where he underwent surgery and was placed into an induced coma. Hughes' injury was a rare but described type of sport-related blunt-force cerebrovascular injury called a vertebral artery dissection which led to subarachnoid haemorrhage. The match was immediately abandoned. The other two Shield games that were being played elsewhere in Australia‚ÄîBrisbane and Melbourne‚Äîwere abandoned at the end of the day, with Cricket Australia stating that \\"Given how players across the country are feeling right now, it's just not the day to be playing cricket.\\" On the morning of 27 November 2014, Hughes died from his injuries, three days before his 26th birthday.Phil Hughes dead at 25, news.com.au, 27 November 2014.

In May 2015, Cricket Australia announced that an independent review would be undertaken into Hughes' death. As a result of Hughes' death, calls were made for improvements to the cricket helmet, and this has resulted in new designs which have additional guards fitted to the rear of the helmet. However, an independent review released by Cricket Australia states that \\"The now mandated British Standard helmet would have offered no protection where he was struck. There is limited scientific evidence that current neck guards will prevent a similar tragedy and they must be properly evaluated before they are mandated.\\" After the review was completed in 2016, it was concluded that the incident was purely accidental, and any changes made to improve safety during the review period, such as mandatory helmets for wicketkeepers, close-in fielders, and batsmen facing fast or medium pace bowling (even during net sessions) would not have prevented the accident. Also, for all Cricket Australia-sanctioned matches, defibrillators must be available at all grounds. = Inquest = A coronial inquest into Hughes' death began on 10 October 2016. The final result of investigation was that death of Hughes was a tragic accident arising from a minuscule misjudgement from the batsman and no players or umpires were at fault. =Tributes= Many tributes were paid to Hughes within and outside the world of cricket, particularly over the rest of the 2014‚Äì15 summer season. Play on the second day of the third Test between Pakistan and New Zealand in the United Arab Emirates, due to begin hours after Hughes' death, was suspended, with the match extended by an extra day; and the second ODI between Sri Lanka and England, played on 29 November, went ahead with the teams paying tribute to Hughes. People from around the world posted photos of their bats on social media to pay tribute to Hughes. Hughes' funeral was held on 3 December 2014 at Macksville High School. The eulogy was given by Hughes' cousin, Nino Ramunno, with speeches also given by Hughes' siblings Jason and Megan; Michael Clarke and James Sutherland. Clarke, Aaron Finch and Tom Cooper were among the pallbearers. The service was attended by around one thousand people, including many national and sporting dignitaries as well as Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott. Thousands of people followed the service at venues in Macksville and around the country. Representatives from the Indian team touring the country and about to contest the Border-Gavaskar Trophy included Virat Kohli and coach Ravi Shastri. The first two matches of that series between Australia and India, to have been held in early December, were rescheduled to provide an additional five days of mourning. Hughes was named and listed as \\"the 13th man\\" for the first Test, and his test cap number 408 was sewn under the badge of all Australian players and painted on the field, and there were 63 seconds of applause before the start of the match.Clarke to play, Marsh and Hazlewood left out, espncricinfo.com; accessed 9 December 2014. During the first Test, David Warner and Steve Smith both raised their bats in commemoration of Phillip Hughes when they passed 63 not out, and when Australia reached 408 runs the match temporarily stopped as the crowd recognised the occasion. When Warner passed 63 in the fourth Test at the SCG, he kissed the ground near to the place where Hughes was fatally injured. Michael Clarke continued to wear a black armband with Hughes's initials on it through to the final of the 2015 Cricket World Cup. Hughes' One-Day International shirt number, 64, was retired in his memory. The scorecard of Hughes' final innings was formally amended to show him being 63 not out, instead of retired hurt. A 63-over tribute match (31¬Ω overs per team) featuring some Australians was played in Nepal on 11 April 2015. During the men's trials for the 2015 Boat Race contested by Oxford and Cambridge, the senior men's trial boats for the Cambridge team were called 63 and Not Out in honour of Hughes. Sydney rapper Urthboy released \\"Nambucca Boy\\" as a tribute to Hughes. Matthew Wade also has a likeness of Hughes tattooed on his right forearm. In the first home Ashes series since Hughes' passing, Australia decided to extend play to the 5th day on the First Ashes Test in 2017, which coincided with the third anniversary of his passing, with David Warner looking skyward as he scored past 63*, with the Barmy Army also sang a parody as a tribute to Hughes to the tune of \\"Walking in a Winter Wonderland\\". Australia won the first test at The Gabba, Brisbane by 10 wickets. On 16 December 2017 it was announced by the NSW Roads Minister, Melinda Pavey, that the new bridge on the Pacific Highway over the Nambucca River near his rural NSW hometown of Macksville is to be named after Hughes.Died on 27 November 2014 (aged 25)Phillip Hughes Dies Due to Head Injury by Bouncer See also *Ray Chapman, American baseball player killed after being struck by ball during game, only player in Major League Baseball history to die of in-game injury References External links * Category:1988 births Category:2014 deaths Category:Accidental deaths in New South Wales Category:Adelaide Strikers cricketers Category:Australian cricketers Category:Australia One Day International cricketers Category:Australia Test cricketers Category:Australia Twenty20 International cricketers Category:Australian people of Italian descent Category:Cricket deaths Category:Cricketers from New South Wales Category:Cricketers who made a century on One Day International debut Category:Filmed deaths in sports Category:Hampshire cricketers Category:Middlesex cricketers Category:Mumbai Indians cricketers Category:New South Wales cricketers Category:People from the Mid North Coast Category:South Australia cricketers Category:Sport deaths in Australia Category:Worcestershire cricketers ","title":"Phillip Hughes"},{"id":"14100746","text":"IILM Institute for Higher Education is a higher education institute, headquartered in Lodhi Road, New Delhi, India, with a second campus in Greater Noida, Uttar Pradesh.

History Like many places in North Queensland in the 1860s, Townsville was an isolated community and there were no roads to anywhere of which to speak. The remote mining camps that began to spring up along the Burdekin River were accessed by trails connecting ancient aboriginal walking tracks. One such track over Herveys Range west of Townsville provided steep but usable access to the goldfields, particularly to Keelbottom Creek and the township of Dalrymple. The place where this track crossed the range came to be known as Thorntons Gap. Currently the journey to the top of the range from Townsville, possible in 30 minutes in a car, but in those early days took three days. The first day took travellers to a small hotel on the banks of the Alice River. There was no running water, and travellers bathed in the creek. The second day's travel took one to the base of the range where travellers rested at the Range Inn before tackling the bullock trail through Thorntons Gap. The journey up the range was an arduous one and took the entire day. Once at the top the Eureka Hotel provided a welcome respite.

The village is located at the northern tip of a peninsula on the island of Lang√∏ya, on the west side of the Malnesfjorden. The ocean lies to the north and west of the village. The road that goes to Hovden ends at the village. The habitation of Hovden, on the outermost point on a peninsula of the third- largest island in Norway (Lang√∏ya) is because of the closeness to the rich fishing banks off of the Vester√•len archipelago. Fish processing and fishing are the main employment of dwellers in Hovden. Archaeological findings show that Hovden have been populated at least since 400 to 800 CE. The southern and western part of Hovden is referred to as \\"Malnes\\". Malnes was the clerical center for the northern part of B√∏ until Malnes Church was moved from Malnes in 1829 to the village of Eidet. The name of the parish is still called Malnes. History Fish Cathedral in Hovden Hovden is a part of a line of old fishing communities in Vester√•len. Between the northern port of Andenes and the southwestern village of B√∏ there are several communities along the coastline with the common denominator of the closeness to the fishing banks off the Vester√•len archipelago. Hovden is one of these, and have to its advantage good harboring conditions and \\"clean\\" seas outside. Most of the coastline has a lot of rocks and skerries, so a good harbor was of vital significance to these communities. Given the long settlement history, to maintain a large population is not possible in Hovden. From the census in 1666,From the Norwegian Digital Archive nine men were registered as head of families in Hovden. Including families the total number of people could not have exceeded 60. Agriculture in Hovden has always been limited. The main agricultural activity has been sheep and goat farming. But then as a supplement to the main income source: fishing. Conditions for farming large cattle are poor as the soil does not produce enough grass for larger cattle. Before potatoes came to Northern Norway (before the early 19th century) grains were grown in Hovden, we do not know of the type, but oats and barley have been grown in northern Norway since before the year 1000. The fisheries have been and still are the most important economic activity in Hovden. Several different fisheries are important, but the most significant are the winter- fisheries between Christmas and Easter. These fisheries are also known under the name Lofotfisket. The Cod, gadus morhua migrate from the Barents Sea to spawn along the coast of Lofoten and have to pass Vester√•len on its way. Hovdens location is excellent given the short way to the areas where the fish are migrating south and northbound. For people living in Hovden, 80% of the total income was made during the first quarter of the year. The abundance of fish was far too much for consumption, and the fish was turned into dried fish and later salt fish, and then exported via Bergen to Europe. The proximity to the fishing banks drew fishermen to Hovden. From the latter part of the 19th century, we know that in the winter months there could be up to 400 fishermenRolf Straume: B√∏ Bygdebok. Bind III living on the small island across from the harbor (Holmen) and in the common landing place. They were living in cottages built for the purpose and under overturned boats. During the latter part of the 19th century, Hovden came under ownership from what is called in Norwegian \\"v√¶reier\\". Literally translated a \\"fishing community owner\\". These owners had total control of the economic activities in the community, and many had a monopoly on the buying and selling of the fish caught. This monopoly, and the fact that the investment in boats and nets became increasingly more expensive given the overall modernisation of the industry, made the fishermen dependent on the owner due to not being able to pay their debts with their income. With the motorization of fishing vessels in the first two decades of the 20th century, the dependency on the \\"v√¶reier\\" became even greater. With the motorization came a higher efficiency in catching fish, resulting in falling prices. Combined with the economic downturn in the 1930s, the profits from fishing dropped. Many of the owners went bankrupt and as a consequence the fishermen and their families had even less profit to live on. These events led to the formation of a fishermens union and in turn a state controlled buying monopoly who managed price formation. The reorganization of the fisheries made it more profitable for the fishermen. Etymology \\"Hovden\\" gets its name from a high and steep cliff, now partly demolished, in the northwestern part of the village. The word derives from the Old Norse language, and the stem of the word is the same as in modern Norwegian/Danish \\"hode\\", Swedish \\"huvud\\", and English \\"head\\". This cliff is at the former southern entrance to the harbor. Now closed by a breakwater. The islets on the northernmost point of Hovden was called Maarsholmen. \\"Malnes\\" means a headland with a shore made of rounded stones. A \\"moll\\" in Norwegian.Seek in O. Rygh Climate From Malnesberget 529 meters above sea level Hovden's climate is a mild coastal climate. The winter is seldom cold. Average temperature in January is . The summer is seldom warm. Average temperature in August is . The precipitation is quite large with approximately per year. The climate is perfect for drying fish since the temperature is seldom below or above in the most important months between January and May. The immediate closeness of the ocean makes the climate mild. April to June have the least precipitation, while the wet months are the autumn months. The dominating winds are the southwest winds (mild and moist) and the northeast winds (cold and dry). The North Atlantic Drift (extension of the Gulf Stream) is the reason for the mild climate. The continental shelf rises close to shore outside Vester√•len and have an insignificant impact on the life in the sea. Nature The typical coastal landscape of Northern Norway is present in Hovden. The earth is barren, dominated by grass and heather. No wild woods are growing as a product of high exploitation by man, sheep and goats. The island of Frugga lies north of Hovden. It is a nature reserve because of the large colony of puffin. To the south, the moraine of Raen stretches towards the village of Nykv√•g. This moraine is the end moraine from a glacier ending in the sea here. This area is also a nature reserve. Hovden is situated north of the Arctic Circle and has both the midnight sun and the winter darkness. The Midnight sun is present in Hovden between the end of May and the end of July. The polar night is between the end of November to mid-January. Culture Being a northern Norwegian community, the same cultural influences are present as in other northern Norwegian communities. The culture is influenced by the mobility of Norwegians from the south to the north in the latter part of the 19th century. It has also received influence from the Sami culture along with Russian, Finnish, and Swedish culture as the migration in the northern part of the Scandinavian peninsula have been modestly restricted by state agencies until the 20th century and after the Russian Revolution. The geographical location and the fact that the road was not built to Hovden until the 1950s made the dwellers self-contained and many of the cultural institutions was built by voluntary communal work. The freshwater-supply, street lights, the local Malnes Church, and a community house were all erected this way. Hovden had several Christian groups. A sports association was active in the 1960s and 1970s. Hovden's population is now aging, the average age amongst the inhabitants is past 60. The Hovden Grendelag, consisting of younger migrated people from Hovden, is now the main actor in the local cultural field.

Located in Delhi, it is the main DRDO lab involved in the development of Lasers and related technologies. LASTEC functions under the DRDO Directorate of Electronics & Computer Science.  History  LASTEC is the oldest laboratory in DRDO.History of LASTEC It was established in 1950 as Defence Science Laboratory (DSL) which was a nucleus laboratory with the objective to conduct research in frontier areas of physics, chemistry and mathematics with a special focus on lasers and opto- electronics. On 9 April 1960, DSL was shifted to Metcalfe House and inaugurated by then Defence Minister V. K. Krishna Menon, in the presence of Pt. Jawaharlal Nehru. With time, many of DSC activities were given to newly formed, specialized DRDO laboratories. DSL served as a precursor for as many as 15 present DRDO labs, including DRDL, SSPL, INMAS, FRL, ISSA, DESIDOC, DIFR, SAG, ITM etc. In 1982, the Laboratory moved to a new technical building in Metcalfe House complex and was renamed as Defence Science Centre. The centre consolidated its R&D; activities towards more specific and application oriented areas, such as liquid fuel technology, spectroscopy, crystallography, system engineering, biotechnology etc. DSL now started concentrating in the area of Pure Sciences such as Physics, Chemistry and Mathematics. The chemistry division developed G-fuel and UDMH for rockets and missiles. The Mathematics division conducted simulation and calculations related to the missile program, while the Physics division took the lead by launching many activities. DSC was also given a new charter of duties with its major thrust on LASERS. Intensive work commenced on Solid-state lasers, Carbon dioxide lasers, ALARM, laser rangefinder, Fibre Optic Gyroscope, Ring laser gyroscopes, Laser Intruder Alarm systems, etc. In 1986, the centre was made responsible for the development of high power lasers for Defence applications as one of its major missions. The lab was renamed LASTEC on 1 Aug 1999 to emphasize its core focus of Laser technology.  Areas of Work  LASTEC's primary focus is the research and development of various laser materials, components and laser systems, including High Power Lasers (HPL) for defence- applications.LASTEC Areas of Work The main charter of the lab revolves around progressing in areas of Photonics, Electro-Optic Counter Measures (EOCM), low and High Power Lasers (HPL). LASTEC also develops and delivers directed energy weapon systems for the Indian Armed Forces, based on High-power laser technology. As a defence technology spin off, LASTEC has also been engaged in the development of lasers for medical and other civilian applications.

He was with Fitzroy from 1987 to 1994 and played 132 games. In 1995 he moved to North Melbourne and was the season's second highest disposal getter for the club. Despite missing just five games in the 1996 home and away season he was omitted from the side which defeated Sydney in the grand final. He was sometimes involved in spectacular solo efforts to win games breaking out of the centre melee with a direct run at goal, but would only do so at the end of close games. Otherwise he was frequently unnoticed on the field, perhaps due to his relatively short stature or perhaps mainly to the blink-fast speed of his disposal of the ball, usually to great effect. He seemed to show a singular strategic sense and his handspeed resulted in an unparalleled ability to break lines of defence and an uncanny number of plays involving or commencing with him resulted in scoring shots, sometimes several disposals later. This ability was recognized by teammates but often overlooked by coaches and selectors; testified to by Wayne Carey making special mention of the non-selected Matthew Armstrong in his 1996 Premiership Cup acceptance speech.

He briefly served as a cabinet minister in the government of Bill Davis. Background He was born in Pembroke, Ontario, the son of Edward Arunah Dunlop, and educated at Upper Canada College and the University of Toronto. His father served as an MPP for nearly 20 years and was provincial treasurer in the 1930s. His grandfather, Arunah Dunlop was an MPP in the 1890s and his great uncle was a member in the 1870s. He married Dorothy Joyce Tupper, the granddaughter of Sir Charles Hibbert Tupper, in 1944. They had two children, Edward (Ted) and Charlotte. Dunlop served with The Queen's Own Rifles of Canada from 1937 to 1944, reaching the rank of major.

Section: \\"The Green Revolution\\", pp. 17‚Äì20. The Green Revolution in India refers to a period when Indian agriculture was converted into an industrial system due to the adoption of modern methods and technology such as the use of high yielding variety (HYV) seeds, tractors, irrigation facilities, pesticides, and fertilizers. It was mainly found by M.S. Swaminathan. This was part of the larger Green revolution endeavor initiated by Norman Borlaug, which leveraged agricultural research and technology to increase agricultural productivity in the developing world.Hardin, Lowell S. \\"Meetings That Changed the World: Bellagio 1969: The Green Revolution.\\" Nature 25 Sep 2008: 470-471. Retrieved 16 November 2018 from https://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1027&context;=envstudtheses Under premiership of Congress leader Indira Gandhi, the Green Revolution within India commenced in 1966 that led to an increase in food grain production, especially in Punjab, Haryana, and Uttar Pradesh. Major milestones in this undertaking were the development of high-yielding varieties of wheat, and rust resistant strains of wheat.Newman, Bryan. \\"A Bitter Harvest: Farmer Suicide and the Unforeseen Social, Environmental and Economic Impacts of the Green Revolution in Punjab, India .\\" Development Report No. 15. Jan 2007. Food First: Institute for Food and Development Policy. Retrieved 16 November 2018 from https://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1027&context;=envstudtheses However, agricultural scientists like M.S. Swaminathan and social activists like Vandana Shiva are of the opinion that it caused greater long term sociological and financial problems for the people of Punjab and Haryana. However it proved to be a useful measure and was pioneer in helping the then Indian Government to independently produce necessary crops in her own country instead of depending on foreign exports and whose policies were often misused by the foreign nations to blackmail India to serve their own political purpose and get dominated by those nations.  Practices  = Wheat production = The main development was higher-yielding varieties of wheat, for developing rust resistant strains of wheat. The introduction of high-yielding varieties(HYV) of seeds and the improved quality of fertilizers and irrigation techniques led to the increase in production to make the country self- sufficient in food grains, thus improving agriculture in India. The methods adopted included the use of high-yielding varieties (HYVs) of seeds with modern farming methods. The production of wheat has produced the best results in fueling self-sufficiency of India. Along with high-yielding seeds and irrigation facilities, the enthusiasm of farmers mobilized the idea of agricultural revolution. Due to the rise in use of chemical pesticides and fertilizers, there was a negative effect on the soil and the land (e.g., land degradation). = Other practices = * Irrigation infrastructure * Use of pesticides ** Use of insecticides ** Use of herbicides * Consolidation of holdings * Land reforms * Improved rural infrastructure * Supply of agricultural credit * Use of chemical or synthetic fertilizers * Use of sprinklers or drip irrigation systems * Use of advanced machinery * Use of vector quantity  Rationale for the Green Revolution  The Green Revolution in India was first introduced in Punjab in the late 1960s as part of a development program issued by international donor agencies and the Government of India. During the British Raj, India's grain economy hinged on a unilateral relation of exploitation. Consequently, when India gained independence, the weakened country quickly became vulnerable to frequent famines, financial instabilities, and low productivity. These factors formed a rationale for the implementation of the Green Revolution as a development strategy in India. = Frequent famines = In 1964-65 and 1965‚Äì66, India experienced two severe droughts which led to food shortages and famines among the country's growing population. Modern agricultural technologies appeared to offer strategies to counter the frequency of famines. There is debate regarding India's famines prior to independence, with some arguing they were intensified by British taxation and agrarian policies in the 19th and 20th centuries, and others downplaying such impact of colonial rule. = Lack of finance = Marginal farmers found it very difficult to get finance and credit at economical rates from the government and banks and hence, fell as easy prey to the money lenders. They took loans from landlords, who charged high rates of interests and also exploited the farmers later on to work in their fields to repay the loans (farm labourers). Proper financing was not given during the Green Revolution period, which created a lot of problems and sufferings to the farmers of India. Government also helped those under loans. = Low productivity = In the context of India's rapidly growing population, the country's traditional agricultural practices yielded insufficient food production. By the 1960s, this low productivity led India to experience food grain shortages that were more severe than those of other developing countries. Agricultural technological advancements offered opportunities to increase productivity.  Criticisms of the Green Revolution  The Green Revolution yielded great economic prosperity during its early years. In Punjab, where it was first introduced, the Green Revolution led to significant increases in the state's agricultural output, supporting India‚Äôs overall economy. By 1970, Punjab was producing 70 percent of the country's total food grains, and farmers' incomes were increasing by over 70 percent. Punjab's prosperity following the Green Revolution became a model to which other states aspired to reach. However, despite the initial prosperity experienced in Punjab, the Green Revolution was met with much controversy throughout India. = Indian economic sovereignty = Criticism on the effects of the green revolution include the cost for many small farmers using HYV seeds, with their associated demands of increased irrigation systems and pesticides. A case study is found in India, where farmers are buying Monsanto BT cotton seeds‚Äîsold on the idea that these seeds produced 'natural insecticides'. In reality, they need to still pay for expensive pesticides and irrigation systems, which might lead to increased borrowing to finance the change from traditional seed varieties. Many farmers have difficulty in paying for the expensive technologies, especially if they have a bad harvest. These high costs of cultivation push rural farmers to take out loans‚Äîtypically at high interest rates. Over-borrowing commonly entraps farmers into a cycle of debt. On top of this, India's liberalized economy further exacerbates the farmers's economic conditions. Indian environmentalist Vandana Shiva writes that this is the \\"second Green Revolution\\". The first Green Revolution, she suggests, was mostly publicly funded (by the Indian Government). This new Green Revolution, she says, is driven by private (and foreign) interest ‚Äì notably MNCs like Monsanto‚Äîas encouraged by the neoliberal context. Ultimately, this is leading to foreign ownership over most of India's farmland, undermining farmers' interests. Farmer's financial issues have become especially apparent in Punjab, where its rural areas have witnessed an alarming rise in suicide rates. Excluding the countless unreported cases, there has been estimated to be a 51.97 per cent increase in the number of suicides in Punjab in 1992-93, compared to the recorded 5.11 per cent increase in the country as a whole. According to a 2019 Indian newspaper, indebtedness continues to be a grave issue affecting Punjabi people today, demonstrated by the more than 900 recorded farmer suicided in Punjab in the last two years. = Environmental damage = Excessive and inappropriate use of fertilizers and pesticides polluted waterways and killed beneficial insects and wild life. It has caused over-use of soil and rapidly depleted its nutrients. The rampant irrigation practices led to eventual soil degradation. Groundwater practices have fallen dramatically. Further, heavy dependence on few major crops has led to loss of biodiversity of farmers. These problems were aggravated due to absence of training to use modern technology and vast illiteracy leading to excessive use of chemicals. = Increased regional disparities = The green revolution spread only in irrigated and high-potential rainfed areas. The villages or regions without the access of sufficient water were left out that widened the regional disparities between adopters and non-adopters. Since, the HYV seeds technically can be applied only in a land with assured water supply and availability of other inputs like chemicals, fertilizers etc. The application of the new technology in the dry-land areas is simply ruled out. The states like Punjab, Haryana, Western UP etc. having good irrigation and other infrastructure facilities were able to derive the benefits of the green revolution and achieve faster economic development while other states have recorded slow growth in agriculture production.

The present version became applicable on 18 February 1947. The law, which was updated in 1992, prohibits Holocaust denial as well as the deliberate belittlement of any Nazi atrocities. Before 1992, some courts had interpreted the clampdown on reviving Nazi ideology as prohibiting Holocaust denial in particular, but since the law didn't explicitly prohibit such denials, there was considerable debate over the matter until the amendment. Law text According to Article I VerbotsG, the Nazi Party, its paramilitary organisations such as SS, SA, the National Socialist Motor Corps and National Socialist Flyers Corps, as well as all affiliated associations were dissolved and banned; any restructuring is forbidden. To underpin the prohibition, the Verbotsgesetz itself, though constitutional law, comprises several penal provisions classifying any act of (re-)engagement in National Socialist activities (Wiederbet√§tigung) as a punishable offense. Section 3 h VerbotsG included in 1992 states that : whoever in a printed work, on broadcasting or in any other media, or whoever otherwise publicly in a matter that it makes it accessible to many people, denies, belittles, condones or tries to justify the Nazi genocide or other Nazi crimes against humanity shall be punished with imprisonment for one year up to ten years, in the case of special perilousness of the offender or the engagement up to twenty years. All cases are to be tried by jury. The provisions concerning the denazification in Austria have been rendered inoperative by a 1957 amnesty. Former members of Nazi organisations were banned from the 1945 legislative election. The initial death penalty was abolished in 1950. Application In 1985 the Austrian Constitutional Court ruled that the remaining regulations are directly applicable in the country's legal system, binding every court and every administrative agency of Austria. Upon the 1992 amendment, the Austrian Supreme Court stated that any reasoning or argumentation concerning the Nazi genocide and the Nazi crimes against humanity is no admissible evidence. Up to today numerous verdicts are handed down by Austrian courts based on the Verbotsgesetz, most notably the conviction of David Irving at the Vienna Landesgericht f√ºr Strafsachen on 20 February 2006.

Britz attempts to understand what would lead a second generation Muslim to turn against the country of their birth. The film makes references to the July 2005 London bombings, and the 2006 Forest Gate raid. Plot The story concerns two siblings, Sohail and Nasima Wahid, who have been brought up in Bradford, West Yorkshire, a city with a large British Pakistani population. Both are now students, Sohail studying law in London and Nasima studying medicine in Leeds. With new government anti-terrorism legislation being used against Muslims in the UK in the wake of the September 11 attacks in New York, Sohail and Nasima are drawn in radically different directions. Without telling any of his family or friends, Sohail becomes a member of MI5, while continuing his studies, in the belief that he hopes to help to stop terrorists before the situation deteriorates further. In doing so, he learns that some of his neighbours and childhood friends are politically militant. Nasima is trying to integrate into British society, attending medical school and even dates a black British man. When her family finds out they send her back to Pakistan for a forced arranged marriage. Her boyfriend follows her, where he is beaten severely and imprisoned by her extended Pakistani family and is only saved by Sohail's intervention. She had already planned to meet the head of a terrorist training camp, and these events lead her to make her decision. She leaves behind her personal belongings and the terrorist group fake her death using a local female. This means she no longer exists and gives her the perfect opportunity not to change her mind and carry out her intentions of a mass suicide bombing. Part one of the story is told from Sohail's point of view, while part two is from Nasima's point of view. The serial was filmed in London, Bradford, Leeds and Hyderabad, India, not Rawalpindi though part of the story is set there, especially in Part II. The DVD was released in the UK on 5 November 2007.

Many Indians belonging to these populations adhere to traditional Indian tribal religions, often syncretised with one or more of the major religious traditions of Hinduism, Buddhism, Islam or Christianity and often under ongoing pressure of cultural assimilation. The tribal people observe their festivals, which have no direct conflict with any religion, and they conduct marriage among them according to their tribal custom. They have their own way of life to maintain all privileges in matters connected with marriage and succession, according to their customary tribal faith. In keeping with the nature of Indian religion generally, these particular religions often involve traditions of ancestor worship or worship of spirits of natural features.National Council of Educational Research and Training. \\"Social and Political Life - III\\".

The largest and best-known others religion of India is that of the Santhal of Orissa. In 1991, there were some 24,000 Indians belonging to the Santhal community who identified explicitly as adherents of the Santhal traditional religion Sarnaism in the Indian census, as opposed to 300,000 who identified as Christians. Among the Munda people and Oraons of Bihar, about 25 % of the population are Christian. Among the Kharia people of Bihar (population about 130,000), about 60 % are Christians. Tribal groups in the Himalayas following Bon religion were similarly affected by both Hinduism and Buddhism in the late 20th century.

The church of Oplenac was founded by King Peter I of Yugoslavia. Many members of the royal house are buried in the church, in the crypt beneath the church, or in the church yard. Mausoleum Apart from the two tombs inside the church (Karaƒëorƒëe‚Äôs in the southern apse; and Peter I in the northern apse), there are 26 other members of the dynasty whose eternal place of rest is in this mausoleum. Six generations of the Karaƒëorƒëeviƒá family have been buried in this church: #The first generation: Marica ≈Ωivkoviƒá, Karaƒëorƒëe's mother. #The second generation: Karaƒëorƒëe (in the church) and his wife Jelena Jovanoviƒá (1764‚Äì1842). #The third generation: Karaƒëorƒëe's son Alexander and his wife Persida Nenadoviƒá (1813‚Äì1873). #The fourth generation: Alexander and Persida's nine children. As follows: Kleopatra (1835‚Äì1855), Aleksije (1836‚Äì1840), Svetozar (1841‚Äì1847), Jelena (1846‚Äì1867), Andreja (1848‚Äì1864), Jelisaveta (1851‚Äì 1852), ƒêorƒëe (1856‚Äì1888), Arsenije, and Peter I (in the church) and his wife Ljubica also known as Zorka (she is buried in the crypt). Out of the ten children of Prince Alexander and Princess Persida, only their oldest daughter, Poleksija (1833‚Äì1914), was not buried here, though Poleksija's daughter Persida Ida Nikolaijevic (1860‚Äì1945) is buried here. #The fifth generation, Peter I and Zorka's children: Milena (1886‚Äì1887), George and his wife Radmila Radonjiƒá (1907‚Äì1993), Alexander I and his wife Maria and Andrija (1890‚Äì1890, lived only for 23 days). Also Prince Arsen's son Paul and his wife Olga. #The sixth generation: King Alexander I and Queen Maria's children: Peter II and his wife Alexandra, Tomislav, and Andrew. Also Prince Paul's sons Nikola and Alexander. Crypt of the Church. Out of the 28 tombs of the Karaƒëorƒëeviƒá dynasty, six of them belong to rulers: Supreme Leader Karaƒëorƒëe, Prince Alexander, King Peter I, King Alexander I, Prince Paul, and King Peter II. It is an important place of Serbian history. On 6 October 2012, Prince Paul, his wife Olga and his son Nikola were all buried here after their remains were exhumed from the cemetery in Lausanne, and returned to Serbia. On 26 May 2013, Queen Maria, her sons King Peter II and Prince Andrew, and Peter II's wife Alexandra, were all buried here after their remains were exhumed from Frogmore in Britain, the Saint Sava Monastery in Libertyville, Illinois, the cemetery of New Graƒçanica, also in Illinois, and Tatoi Palace in Greece respectively, and returned to Serbia. History In the 19th century this area was covered in woods. The term Oplenac most probably derives from \\"oplen\\", meaning wooden parts on ox cars. Karaƒëorƒëe had settled here, built vineyards and orchards, and established the defence of the nearby Topola. His son Alexander built new buildings and renewed his father's vineyards and orchards. It was not until the arrival of King Peter I that this place got its true importance. The ossuary of King Peter I of Serbia. Peter I, upon his ascension to the throne in 1903, chose a spot 337 metres (1106 ft) on the top of Mali Oplenac hill for the location of his St. George Church. The location was measured by geodesy experts; so the altar would face east according to Orthodox tradition. In 1907 the cornerstone was laid, and the Charter dedicated to St. George was placed in the foundation. The winning prize for the tender was given to architect Nikola Nestoroviƒá. After a long and animated expert discussion, primarily regarding the demand for the monumentality of the Serbian-Byzantine style, and due to the King's own displeasure with the proposed solution, another tender in 1909 was launched. The committee was made up with basically the same previous members (Mihailo Valtroviƒá, Andra Stevanoviƒá, and architect Konstantin Jovanoviƒá, who replaced Dragutin ƒêorƒëeviƒá from the previous committee). The committee awarded first prize to the young architect Kosta J. Jovanoviƒá. On May 1, 1910, construction started following Jovanoviƒá's plan. Stone breaking for the crypt and the foundation of the church lasted for four months. On 1 September 1910, the foundation was mostly completed. In 1911 the building process continued at a fast pace, and the church was already under the dome. It was decided that same year that the fa√ßade of the church would be made of white marble, which came from nearby Venƒçac mountain, even today known for its exceptionally white marble. In the autumn of 1912, the church was generally complete and ready for consecration. The Serbian Patriarch Dimitrije consecrated the church on 23 September 1912. During the pauses of the 1912-1913 Balkan Wars and the First World War, there was also a pause in the construction of the church. When Austria-Hungary occupied Serbia in the winter of 1915, the church was looted ‚Äì the copper cover was removed from the dome, roof and portals. The lightning conductor was also removed as well as the bells. Many windows were broken including little marble pillars and ornaments. Using the excuse that important records might be hidden, the occupiers desecrated the graves in the crypt. Returning to the liberated homeland and to the historical creation of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, Peter I was not able to see the completion of his foundation. The king died on 16 August 1921, and his successor Alexander I took over its completion. He modified the original plan. After the reconstruction of the crypt, by Jovanoviƒá, this was followed by the iconostasis, the lightning conductor, then a new copper roof with golden edges on the dome. The bells were made by Fr√®res Piccard from Annecy le Vieux, France and the mosaics were made by Puhl & Wagner from Berlin, Germany. The bronze chandelier was made by Luks, Zagreb, Croatia. The church was once again consecrated in September 1930. Church services were held until 1947. After that, it was declared a cultural monument and open to visitors. Oplenac was added to the list of Monuments of Culture of Exceptional Importance in 1979, and it is protected by the state. Architecture and design The church is a five-domed structure. The interior length of the temple is 30 metres (98 ft), and the height of the arch is 27 metres (89 ft). The width of each narthex is 9 metres (29 ft), and so is the span of the central dome. All four fa√ßades are made of white marble, which comes from the Venƒçac Mountain. The main fa√ßade, the most decorative one, is the western one. The portal's semicircle hosts a mosaic icon of St. George, to whom the church is dedicated. Made in Venice according to the plan of the known Serbian artist Paja Jovanoviƒá, on the basis of a golden mosaic, this icon symbolizes the victory of the Serbs over its enemies. Above the portal, in a circle, the old Karaƒëorƒëeviƒá Family coat of arms has been sculpted, on whose sides two typical men from ≈†umadija region are shown, holding the flags. The rest of it is mostly identical to the Coat of Arms of Serbia. The floor of the church was made in Munich, out of polished marble, in various colours. Lifted on a small podium, the throne for the King and Queen is made of polished green marble, its back is decorated with golden mosaic and mother-of-pearl, in the middle is the two-headed eagle. The arm- rest is made of the same marble as Visoki Deƒçani monastery, while the entire seat rests on sculpted lions. The huge chandelier, 9 metres in diameter, is underneath the main dome, hanging in 8 places, above the pendent. It has been molten out of massive bronze, and weighs 1500 kg (3300 lb). In the chandelier is a Crown set upside-down (symbolising the lost Serbian Empire in the Kosovo battle in 1389). =Mosaic= Mosaics in St George's Church. The initial idea of King Peter I was to carve into the walls the names of all soldiers and officers who had perished in the Balkan Wars of 1912 and 1913. But, since the church was not fully completed, and since First World War followed (1914-1918), this idea had to be abandoned. The solution was to decorate the interior of the temple with mosaics, which would be a sort of a museum of reproductions of the most beautiful frescoes of the medieval Serbian art. Copies from 60 Serbian medieval churches and monasteries had been brought to the St. George church at Oplenac. The entire mosaic has 725 painted compositions (513 in the temple and 212 in the crypt), on which there are 1500 figures. The entire area of the mosaic is ; with 40 million various coloured pieces of glass which have 15 thousand different varieties of colour, making vivid artistic impression. To the right side of the entrance, on the entire southern wall of the narthex, is the painting of the trustee, King Peter I, holding the model of his church on the palm of his left hand, wearing a crown and coronation ornaments. With his right hand, he is guided by St. George, to whom the temple is dedicated, and shown approaching the Mother of God, greeting him with Christ sitting on the throne. In the southern apse is the gallery of the Serbian medieval rulers, an impressive line-up with every one of them represented by their respective churches. The first on the left is Stefan Nemanja (ruled from 1168 to 1196), wearing a priest garb of the Hilandar monastery, holding the Studenica monastery. Then, there is King Stefan the First Crowned (1196-1227) with the model of the ≈Ωiƒça monastery, then King Stefan Radoslav (1227‚Äì1234) with the narthex of Studenica monastery, followed by King Stefan Vladislav (1234‚Äì1243) with the Mile≈°eva monastery, then King Stefan Uro≈° I (1243‚Äì1276) with the Sopoƒáani monastery; King Stefan Dragutin with the Church of St. Achillius (1276‚Äì1282), King Stefan Milutin (1282‚Äì1322) with the Graƒçanica monastery, King Stefan Deƒçanski (1322-1331) with the Visoki Deƒçani monastery, and two emperors ‚Äì Stefan Du≈°an (1331-1355) with the Monastery of the Holy Archangels; and Stefan Uro≈° V (1355‚Äì1371) with the Matejiƒá monastery. The next depicted ruler is Lazar of Serbia (1371-1389) with the Ravanica monastery, his son, despot Stefan Lazareviƒá (1389‚Äì1427) with the Manasija monastery, followed by ƒêuraƒë Brankoviƒá with the church of Smederevo. In the very calotte of the main dome is the Pantocrator, copy of the thorax found in the Graƒçanica monastery. The face of Christ, 27 metres from the floor of the temple, looks impressive and is of proportional dimensions. Although the diameter of this painting is 9 metres (29 ft), and although just the finger of Christ is 1.5 metres (5 ft) long, and the nose is 1.2 metres (4 ft) long, everything is harmonious. In the altar are the frescoes of Lord's supper and the way to the Golgotha. In the altar niche there is the 5-metre (16 ft) tall figure of the Divine Mother of God in a praying position (copy of the fresco from the Patriarchal Monastery of Peƒá). Also, there is the Secret of the Holy Communion and the Communion of the Apostles with Bread and Wine. These are just some of the compositions that make the rich interior of the church. Besides the Mausoleum (St. George church), there are other objects that encompass the Foundation of King Peter I ‚Äì King Peter's House, King's villa, Queen's villa, Vineyards, Vineyard Keeper's House, etc. Visitors can also visit the historic town of Topola located nearby, a traditional stronghold of the Karaƒëorƒëeviƒá family, ever since the time of Karaƒëorƒëe. =Last supper= The church hosts an icon representing the Last supper, patterned after the famous Ultima cena by Da Vinci. The icon is made of mother of pearl and each figure and object is crafted individually. It was made in the workshop of the Salsa' family in Beit Sahour, east of Bethlehem. The icon is . It was handed out to King Alexander I on 16 October 1924, when the Greek Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem, Damian I, visited Belgrade. Though the press of the day reported in detail about the event, the icon wasn't mentioned. It was a gift for the king's wedding, which happened on 8 June 1922. The king ordered for the icon to be transferred to the church vault in Oplenac. On 18 October 1934 German Nazi official Hermann G√∂ring visited Oplenac, within the scopes of attending the funeral of King Alexander I. He spent a lot of time in front of the icon. As the myths of John the Apostle on Ultima cena actually being Mary Magdalene already existed, and John on the icon indeed looks like a woman, Heinrich Himmler's quasi- scientific organization Ahnenerbe also expressed interest in the icon as part of their search for the Holy Grail. After the German Invasion of Yugoslavia during World War II, Yugoslavia was occupied in April 1941, G√∂ring decided to obtain the icon first. In order to forestall the plundering of Ahnenerbe and Alfred Rosenberg, who also founded an organization for stealing arts in the occupied countries, G√∂ring sent Franz Neuhausen to Serbia. In order to mask the looting and give it some legal credence, G√∂ring appointed Neuhausen as the special plenipotentiary for economic affairs in the Territory of the Military Commander in Serbia after the partition of Yugoslavia. The first thing taken from Opleanac was the icon, sent right away to G√∂ring who exhibited it in his Carinhall. In 1943, G√∂ring transferred a part of the plundered collection, including the icon, to the Altaussee salt mines in Styria, Austria. The Allies found the treasure after the liberation and it was all stored in F√ºhrerbau, a former representative building built for Hitler, then turned by the Allies into the Central Collecting Place for the art looted by Nazis. The icon was also stored there. There are two version of how the icon was returned to Oplenac. According to the first, member of the security agency OZNA Slobodan Kostiƒá Uƒça paid for it \\"1,200 dinars, 350 dollars and some small types of other favors\\". The other, more accepted is that controversial art collector Ante Topiƒá Mimara returned the icon, as his wife Wiltrud Mersman Topiƒá was a junior curator at the Central Collecting Place.

Chen Yi meeting with Jomo Kenyatta on his visit to Kenya in February 1964 Political ties This bilateral relations date back to 14 December 1963, two days after the formal establishment of Kenyan independence, when China became the fourth country to open an embassy in Nairobi. Military exchange between the two countries has been increasing in the past decade. General Liu Jingsong, commander of the Lanzhou Military Region, led China's first military delegation to Kenya in December 1996; Major General Nick Leshan, commander of the Kenya Air Force, paid a return visit in 1997. Kenyan president Mwai Kibaki visited Beijing in August 2005. In 2013, President Uhuru Kenyatta visited China. He held talks with his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping. Kenya and China ended up signing deals worth (US$5 billion). Chinese premier Li Keqiang visited Nairobi on his 2014 Africa tour. He and President Kenyatta signed 17 multi-billion-shilling deals to fund multiple infrastructural projects and various agreements. This included the establishment of a China-Africa Development Bank. Economic ties Countries which signed cooperation documents related to the Belt and Road Initiative Bilateral trade amounted to US$186.37 million in 2002; China exported US$180.576 million to Kenya, while only importing US$5.798 million of Kenyan goods, mainly black tea, coffee, and leather. Early in 2006 Chinese President Hu Jintao signed an oil exploration contract with Kenya; the latest in a series of deals designed to expand Chinese overseas economic engagement with Africa. The deal allowed for China's state-controlled offshore oil and gas company, CNOOC Ltd., to prospect for oil in Kenya, which is just beginning to drill its first exploratory wells on the borders of Sudan and Somalia and in coastal waters. No oil has been produced yet, and there has been no formal estimate of the possible reserves. In April 2007, the Jinchuan Group, a state- owned metal manufacturing group, became the first Chinese company to enter Kenya's mining sector, purchasing a 20% stake in Tiomin Kenya. Incidences of racism by Chinese expatriates accompanying Chinese investments in Kenya towards black Kenyans has been a source of recent controversy. This has negatively impacted bilateral relations between the two countries. =Debt financing= Between 2006 and 2017, Kenya has taken large loans of at least $9.8 billion (Sh1043.77 billion) from China. Chinese debt accounts of 72% of overall foreign debt. China lent Kenya extensive loans of more than $5 billion to build a standard gauge railway (commonly referred to as SGR), between Mombasa and Nairobi and highways in Kenya. In November 2017, the Kenyan Auditor warned that the terms of SGR financing were written cryptically and designed to favor the China Exim Bank and said that if the Kenya Railways Corporation defaults in its obligations, the China Exim Bank would become a principle over some Kenyan assets, including the Mombasa port. In addition to the Mombasa port, Kenya could also be made to give China control of the Inland Container Depot in Nairobi. In 2018, Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyata banned Chinese fish imports in response to public outcry over the unregulated importation of fish from China with Kenyan fishermen lamenting on how the foreign fish had flooded markets. The Chinese government use the Standard Gauge Railway as leverage against Kenya by threatening to completely pull funding for the project as well as threatening to impose trade sanctions. The Kenyan government soon after lifted the ban of Chinese fish imports. The Kenyan government reportedly waived the sovereign immunity of its largest and most lucrative port, the Port of Mombasa, to be used as collateral for Chinese loans to construct the Standard Gauge Railway. It was reported in late December 2018 that Kenya may soon face default on Chinese loans, which could force Kenya to relinquish control of the port to China. The Kenyan media has debated whether Chinese loans are worth the risk of falling into \\"debt traps\\", drawing analogies with 's Magampura Mahinda Rajapaksa Port deal, and some commentators have argued that these loans could jeopardize Kenyan sovereignty. Sri Lanka's new government as of 2019 has looked into renegotiation of it's 99-year port lease agreement with China. =Chinese development finance to Kenya= From 2000 to 2011, there are approximately 65 Chinese official development finance projects identified in Kenya through various media reports.Austin Strange, Bradley C.

There were also reports of racially segregated office bathrooms and a Chinese manager directing Kenyan employees to unclog a urinal of cigarette butts even though only Chinese employees smoked there. As a result of the large Chinese investments and business interests, there has been a large migration of Chinese workers and business persons to Kenya. There are reports of this causing friction with the local entrepreneurs who's livelihoods have been threatened by the arrival of Chinese traders. Kenyan businesses have suffered due to the flooding of markets with cheap substandard imports from China. Chinese companies are said to have won contracts by allegedly bribing corrupt officials, with the contracts being opaque, with the contract terms not being publicly available. There are also reports of discrimination against Kenyans in the SGR railway, with Kenyan employees being paid less than a quarter of their Chinese counterparts for the same job, and not being allowed to sit on the same tables as Chinese employees. Kenyans are also reportedly not allowed to enter staff vans if there is even a single Chinese present in it.

It is set initially in Paris and takes its title from an Oscar Wilde quotation about the said city. (\\"Dying in Paris is a terribly expensive business for a foreigner.\\") The action concerns the shady dealing and possible expensive pimping of one Monsieur Datt against a background of espionage. This is the fifth novel in the \\"unnamed hero\\" series, but unlike the previous ones, it includes chapters and sections in the third person.Author's introduction to the HarperCollins edition, London, 2012 Plot The unnamed narrator, a British agent, is told to leak to the Chinese information about the effectiveness of nuclear weapons, in order to bolster their deterrent effect. M Datt, posing as a psychologist, believes he is working for the Chinese by accumulating compromising film of the sexual activities of various influential people. However, in fact the Chinese have no interest in these films. The narrator does a deal with the French security services to bring together the Chinese agent Kuang with the American nuclear scientist Hudson in a farmhouse in northern France, so that the information can be communicated. He then escorts Kuang to a pirate radio station ship moored in international waters off Ostend and returns to the harbour, where Datt, trying to flee, is shot by a Belgian paratrooper. A sub- plot concerns Datt's illegitimate daughter Maria, who had been married to the French policeman Loiseau and had also fallen for the narrator. She protects the narrator when he is given a truth drug by Datt, and then drives an ambulance containing the films to Ostend. Despite having caused her father Datt's death, at the narrator's suggestion she is let go.

The vehicle of Carnegie Mellon University's Red Team traveled the farthest distance, completing of the course. The $1 million prize remained unclaimed. Preliminary tests Prior to the main event in the Mojave Desert, the twenty-one qualifying teams were required to navigate a mile-long obstacle course at California Speedway. Seven teams were able to successfully complete the entire course, while eight others completed enough of it to satisfy of the judges, resulting in fifteen vehicles in the final race.\\"The robots were put through obstacle and speed tests to make sure they would be safe. While only seven teams completed the speedway course, eight others came close enough to convince judges that they could safely compete.\\" The event Unfortunately, the failures during the preliminary tests were indicative of how the vehicles would perform on the actual course. Two of the fifteen vehicles had to be withdrawn before the final race began and one car flipped upside down in the starting area and had to be withdrawn. Three hours into the event that was scheduled to last ten hours, only four vehicles remained operational. The vehicles suffered from a variety of mechanical problems, including \\"stuck brakes, broken axles, rollovers, and malfunctioning satellite navigation equipment.\\" Within a few hours, all of the vehicles in the challenge had suffered critical vehicle failures, had been disqualified, or had withdrawn. The farthest any of the teams got was the Red Team's , less than 5% off the full length of the course. Their vehicle, Sandstorm, went off-course in a hairpin turn and got stuck on the embankment. The next farthest vehicles were those of the SciAutonics II Team, which traversed before becoming stuck on an embankment; Team DAD (Digital Auto Drive), which drove before getting stuck on a rock; and the Golem Group, which made it before becoming trapped on a steep hill. The results Team ENSCO's vehicle, DAVID Although the initial race was deemed a failure, as no vehicles achieved anything close to the goal, DARPA was committed to running the challenge for as long as Congressional authority allowed (which would have been until 2007, but the goal was reached in 2005). The first Grand Challenge is considered by some to be a success, mainly because it spurred interest and innovation. In addition to the difficulty many vehicles had with the harsh terrain, many initial designs also struggled to handle both sensing upcoming obstacles and following the GPS waypoints simultaneously.

Bureau of International Labor Affairs, U.S. Department of Labor (2002). This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the public domain. In 1995, the gross primary enrollment rate was 77.1 percent and the net primary enrollment rate was 64.7 percent. School fees long prevented many children from attending school, but in February 1998 the president of the Gambia ordered the termination of fees for the first six years of schooling. Girls make up about 40 percent of primary school students, though the figure is much lower in rural areas where cultural factors and poverty prevent parents from sending girls to school. Approximately 20 percent of school-age children attend Koranic schools, which usually have a restricted curriculum. In 1988, the government of the Gambia began a major education initiative which included a 15-year plan that has emphasized increasing gross enrollment rates, lowering school entry age from 8 to 7, developing basic education curricula, and improving teacher training. Many of these goals have been met. The gross primary enrollment rate increased from 62.2 to 77.1 percent from 1989 to 1995; the entry age was lowered to seven years; more textbooks were made available for students; and 1,200 unqualified teachers in the system received training. The major goal the Gambia has set for itself for the remainder of the plan is to enroll 90 percent of children in schools for the full cycle of basic education by 2005. Over the 1990s, spending on education increased from 15 to 21 percent of government expenditure and 2.6 percent to 4.3 percent of GNP, while the share of the education budget devoted to primary education increased from 38 percent to 45 percent.  School system  The school-going age in the Gambia is officially seven years. The education system, which is largely based on the British system, consists of the following: *Six years of primary schooling: grades 1‚Äì6 *Three years of junior secondary schooling: grades 7‚Äì9 *Three years of senior secondary schooling: grades 10‚Äì12 *Four years of university education =Examinations= At the end of grades 6 and 9, there are selection examinations to proceed to the next level. At the end of grade 9 people have the option to go into the skills centres which provide pre- vocational training. At the end of grade 12, depending on their performance in the West African Senior School Certificate Examination (WASSCE), students have the option to go into the Technical Training Institute, which provide vocational and technical education; go into Gambia College which provide pre- service training for teachers, nurses, public health officers and agricultural supervisors; or they can go to university or join the labour force. Statistics In 2002/2003 total enrolment at primary schools included 79 percent of children in the relevant age-group (boys 79 percent; girls 78 percent), according to UNESCO estimates, while secondary enrolment included only 33 percent of the appropriate age-group (boys 39 percent; girls 27 percent).

In order to cover the retreat of a convoy under Joseph de Flotte chased by the British, the lone 74-gun Annibal, under Lamotte-Picquet. For 90 minutes, Annibal single-handedly engaged the British squadron to block its advance, before she was joined by the two 64-guns, Vengeur and R√©fl√©chi. Ten to 11 of the transports were taken by the British or beached themselves to avoid capture, but the rest of the convoy of the escorting frigate Aurore managed to escape, and the division returned to its anchorage. Hyde Parker wrote Lamotte-Picquet a congratulation letter in the following days.  Background  In the autumn of 1779, a British fleet under Admiral Hyde Parker was anchored at St. Lucia, which the British had captured a year before in the Capture of St. Lucia. Parker was awaiting the arrival of Admiral George Brydges Rodney, who was to lead the 1780 campaign, and his fleet was largely at rest, with crews ashore and repairs being made to some vessels. Meanwhile, the French Caribbean division, under Chef d'Escadre Lamotte-Picquet, was undergoing a refit at the nearby island of Martinique in the West Indies. The division comprised eight ships of the line, but in December 1779 only three were operational: the 74-gun Annibal, and the 64-guns, Vengeur, under Fournoue, and R√©fl√©chi, under Cillart de Suville.  Battle  In the morning of 18 December, a French convoy under Joseph de Flotte, which had departed Marseille in October and was bound for Martinique, arrived in Saint Lucia channel, the body of water between the islands of Saint Lucia and Martinique. The convoy brought supplies for the French colonies of the Caribbeans and for the division under Lamotte, as well as diplomat G√©rard de Rayneval. It comprised 26 transports, escorted by the lone 34-gun frigate Aurore. Around 0800, , which was stationed in Saint Lucia channel, gave a signal indicating the arrival of an unknown fleet. Parker immediately scrambled, and managed to get five ships of the line and a 50-gun frigate out to meet the arriving fleet. Shortly thereafter, the French observation post of Les Anses-d'Arlet signaled the arrival of Flotte's convoy, as well as 15 British warships chasing them. Flotte sailed his ships close to shore, hoping that the shallow waters would deter the British warships from approaching, and Aurore fell back to start a rear-guard action as to delay Hyde Parker's squadron, and alert the French forces of Martinique. The lead ships of the convoy passed Les Anses-d'Arlet around 1400. Lamotte then scrambled his ships to cover the retreat of the convoy, mustering reinforcements for his crew from the crews of the ships under repairs, as well as volunteers from the population. Lamotte left the anchorage at Fort Royal with his flagship, the 74-gun Annibal. As his arrival was to the windward, he was able to cover the arrival of the remaining convoy ships. The British fleet, with in the lead, began beating against the wind to closing with the French fleet. By 1700, Conqueror came with the range of Annibal guns, and battle was engaged between those two. Annibal found herself facing seven British ships for half an hour, before the 64-gun Vengeur and R√©fl√©chi joined her. By that time, the 15 British ships were also engaged. The reinforced French crew allowed Lamotte's ships to sustain an especially high rate of fire, Annibal in particular firing alternatively from both broadsides as she turned to face the British from both sides. By the time evening arrived, had also come within range, but the action had worked its way toward shoals near Fort Royal. The coastal defences at Pointe des N√®gres and Gros √élet started firing of the British. Parker finally called his fleet off at 1845, but one last broadside from the French fleet took the life of Conqueror captain, Walter Griffith.  Aftermath  The loss to the French convoy was significant with thirteen ships captured or driven ashore. Parker was however satisfied with his squadrons conduct and the prizes captured but was also with the French. La Motte's conduct during the battle impressed Hyde Parker sufficiently to make him send a congratulatory letter to his adversary when they had occasion to communicate via a truce flag: Lamotte was made a Commander in the Order of Saint Louis. The French Crown commissioned a painting from Rossel de Cercy to celebrate the action. The paining is an oil on canvas from 1779-1790, 114.0 cm high and 144.5 cm wide, in the collections of the Ch√¢teau de Versailles (inventory number MV 7388). The paining is now on display at the Mus√©e national de la Marine.

The hamlet is next to the Flanders Moss National Nature Reserve and close to the east boundary of the Loch Lomond and Trossachs National Park, which includes the Lake of Menteith. Until 1996, the hamlet had a primary school. Due to a lack of pupils, it was shut down along with Croftamie Primary School and Kinbuck Primary School. Part of the school has since been converted into a nursery. Pupils were transferred to Buchlyvie Primary School. Etymology The name is from the Gaelic 'earrann' meaning a division of land. Walter Comyn, the Earl of Menteith, founded Inchmahome Priory in 1238 and it is thought the name of the hamlet could date from then. There are other ‚ÄòArns‚Äô in the area, some of which indicate size (e.g. Arnmore) and others indicate previous owners (e.g. Arnfinlay). The town of Arnprior, Ontario, Canada was named after the hamlet, the ancestral home of its founder Archibald McNab.  Commerce  The notable commerce of the hamlet is provided by Arnprior Farm, which in 2015, as part of a diversification programme, established what it claims to be \\"Scotland's original and best pumpkin patch\\". In addition, there is also a hair salon and agricultural mechanics.

In addition to supplying milk, meat, eggs, wool, their castings (dung) and hides, animals, mainly bullocks, are the major source of power for both farmers and drayers. Thus, animal husbandry plays an important role in the rural economy. The gross value of output from this sector was in FY 1989, an amount that constituted about 25 percent of the total agricultural output of . Dairy Cows in Tamil Nadu, India. Goats in Andhra Pradesh, India. In FY 1992, India had approximately 25 percent of the world's cattle, with a collective herd of 193 million head. India also had 110 million goats, 75 million water buffaloes, 44 million sheep, and 10 million pigs. Milk production in FY 1990 was estimated to have reached 53.5 million tons, and egg production had reached a level of 23.3 billion eggs. Dairy farming provided supplementary employment and an additional source of income to many small and marginal farmers. The National Dairy Development Board was established in 1965 under the auspices of Operation Flood at Anand, in Gujarat, to promote, plan, and organize dairy development through cooperatives; to provide consultations; and to set up dairy plants, which were then turned over to the cooperatives. There were more than 63,000 Anand-style dairy cooperative societies with some 7.5 million members in the early 1990s. The milk produced and sold by these farmers brought a day, or more than a year. The increase in milk production permitted India to end imports of powdered milk and milk-related products. In addition, 30,000 tons of powdered milk were exported annually to neighboring countries. There was about 50000 cows in India. Chicken facilities in Haryana, India. Today, India has the world's largest dairy herd (composed of cows and buffaloes), at over 304 million strong, and stands first in milk production, with 112.5 million tonnes of milk produced in 2009‚Äì2010. =Operation Flood= Pony in Ooty, India. Operation Flood, the world's largest integrated dairy development program, attempted to establish linkages between rural milk producers and urban consumers by organizing farmer-owned and -managed dairy cooperative societies. In the early 1990s, the program was in its third phase and was receiving financial assistance from the World Bank and commodity assistance from the European Economic Community. At that time, India had more than 64,000 dairy cooperative societies, with close to 7.7 million members. These cooperatives established a daily processing capacity of 15.5 million liters of whole milk and 727 tons of milk powder.

In addition, India's leading poultry producers, including Suguna, Venky's, and the Amrit Group, are increasing sales to countries in other parts of Asia and the Middle East. International investment is also expanding. In 2008, U.S.-based Tyson Foods acquired a 51 percent stake in Godrej, an Indian conglomerate that is a major producer of animal feeds and poultry, and the International Finance Corporation (IFC) has an equity stake in Suguna. An estimated 200 million egg-laying hens are kept in battery cages, and more than half of the over two billion ‚Äúmeat‚Äù chickens produced each year are factory- farmed. Vertical integration and contract farming for poultry and eggs is also widespread.

It tells the story of the last week in the life of Jesus. The serial was first proposed by Peter Fincham in 2006, on the success of the contemporary-set Manchester Passion. Writer Frank Deasy and producer Nigel Stafford-Clark were inspired to make a drama that opened up the story beyond the \\"vacuum\\" it is often told in. They did this by expanding the roles of Pontius Pilate and Caiaphas, and exploring the politics of Judea at the time. Deasy and Stafford-Clark were aided by scholar Mark Goodacre, with whom they put together an extensive research manual about the topic. The part of Jesus is played by Joseph Mawle, who researched the role by reading the Gospels and research papers. Other main roles were played by Paloma Baeza (Mary Magdalene), Ben Daniels (Caiaphas), James Nesbitt (Pilate), David Oyelowo (Joseph of Arimathea), and Penelope Wilton (Mary). It was directed by Michael Offer on location in Morocco from 27 August to 23 October 2007, and broadcast on BBC One in four parts from 16 to 23 March 2008. Its viewing figures ranged from 3.2 million to 4.9 million people, and it received generally positive critical reception. Plot Episode 1 ‚Äî In the first hour- long episode, Jesus's arrival in Jerusalem on Palm Sunday causes a stir among the Jews. The Romans are having to deal with a small rebellion and the High Priest wants to be rid of Jesus, since he is causing a disturbance and challenging his authority. Episode 2 ‚Äî In the second half-hour episode, the High Priest Caiaphas calls a council to determine how Jesus should be dealt with after he is overheard mocking the Temple, and his fate is sealed. Episode 3 ‚Äî The third hour-long episode, relates the events from the Last Supper to the Crucifixion of Jesus. Episode 4 ‚Äî The final half-hour episode, features the Resurrection of Jesus, the sightings of him by Mary Magdalene and others, and his departure from the disciples after impressing upon Peter the importance of spreading his word. Caiaphus' wife gives birth to a son, and Pilate and his wife return to Caesarea.

He also incorporated Jesus's relationship with women as written in Luke. For the opening scene of Episode 1, he was influenced by the opening scene of Downfall (Oliver Hirschbiegel, 2004): > In it, a peasant coming to Passover in Jerusalem is frightened when he comes > across the disciples, because they've been in the desert or in Galilee for > two years.

DSP/BIOS Link or DSPLINK is an IPC (interprocessor communications) scheme for passing messages and data in multiprocessor systems. In the case of the DaVinci DSP family from Texas Instruments, this scheme would allow passing of messages and data between an ARM client and a DSP server. DSPLINK can be used to implement a layer of software abstraction called a RPC that allows a remote function on the DSP to appear as local function calls in the ARM application code. The Codec Engine IPC communication layer is implemented using a RPC call scheme built on top of DSP/BIOS LINK. Overview DSP/BIOS LINK is implemented using shared memory and internal interrupts from the ARM to the DSP and vice versa. The shared memory protocol for IPC is implemented as follows: #The ARM and DSP are programmed to a pre-determined memory address where a message will be sent from the ARM to the DSP; and another for messages sent from the DSP to the ARM. #One processor sends messages to the other by writing the message into the pre-determined address and then sending an interrupt to signal the other processor that a new message is available. When transferring data buffers, only a pointer to a given buffer needs to be passed since the buffer resides in shared memory that is accessible to both the processors. ARM buffer addresses must be translated into physical addresses when being presented to the DSP, as the DSP does not have an MMU or a concept of virtual addressing. #Once the processor receiving the message has read it, it marks a flag in shared memory to indicate that the message memory is now available to be rewritten with another message. The DSP included in many DaVinci-based devices generally runs TI's DSP/BIOS RTOS. When multiple, heterogeneous cores are included in the device (e.g. DM644x), DSP/BIOS Link drivers run on both the ARM processor and the DSP to provide communication between the two.

The primary enzyme encoded by the nif genes is the nitrogenase complex which is in charge of converting atmospheric nitrogen (N2) to other nitrogen forms such as ammonia which the organism can use for various purposes. Besides the nitrogenase enzyme, the nif genes also encode a number of regulatory proteins involved in nitrogen fixation. The nif genes are found in both free-living nitrogen-fixing bacteria and in symbiotic bacteria associated with various plants. The expression of the nif genes is induced as a response to low concentrations of fixed nitrogen and oxygen concentrations (the low oxygen concentrations are actively maintained in the root environment of host plants). The first Rhizobium genes for nitrogen fixation (nif) and for nodulation (nod) were cloned in the early 1980s by Gary Ruvkun and Sharon R. Long in Frederick M. Ausubel's laboratory.  Regulation  In most bacteria, regulation of nif genes transcription is done by the nitrogen sensitive NifA protein. When there isn't enough fixed nitrogen available for the organism's use, NtrC triggers NifA expression, and NifA activates the rest of the nif genes. If there is a sufficient amount of reduced nitrogen or oxygen is present, another protein is activated: NifL. NifL inhibits NifA activity resulting in the inhibition of nitrogenase formation. NifL is regulated by the products of glnD and glnK. The nif genes can be found on bacterial chromosomes, but in symbiotic bacteria they are often found on plasmids or symbiosis islands with other genes related to nitrogen fixation (such as the nod genes).  Examples in nature  The expression and regulation of nif genes, while sharing common features in all or most of the nitrogen-fixing organisms in nature, have distinct characters and qualities that differ from one diazotroph to another. Examples of nif gene structure and regulation in different diazotrophs include: Klebsiella pneumoniae‚Äîa free-living anaerobic nitrogen-fixing bacterium. It contains a total of 20 nif genes located on the chromosome in a 24-Kb region. nifH, nifD, and nifK encode the nitrogenase subunits, while nifE, nifN, nifU, nifS, nifV, nifW, nifX, nifB, and nifQ encode proteins involved the assembly and incorporation of iron and molybdenum atoms into the nitrogenase subunits. nifF and nifJ encode proteins related to electron transfer taking place in the reduction process and nifA and nifL are regulatory proteins in charge of regulating the expression of the other nif genes.Iwo Watanabe, \\"Biological Nitrogen Fixation and its Use in Agriculture (outline)\\" Rhodospirillum rubrum‚Äîa free-living anaerobic photosynthetic bacterium which, in addition to the transcriptional controls described above, regulates expression of the nif genes also in a metabolic way through a reversible ADP-ribosylation of a specific arginine residue in the nitrogenase complex. The ribosylation takes place when reduced nitrogen is present and it causes a barrier in the electron transfer flow and thereby inactivates nitrogenase activity. The enzymes catalyzing the ribosylation are called DraG and DraT.Merrick MJ, Edwards RA (1995). Nitrogen control in bacteria. Microbiol Review 59(4):604-22 Rhodobacter capsulatus‚Äîa free-living anaerobic phototroph containing a transcriptional nif gene regulatory system.

NtrC activates a different expression of nifA and the other nif genes. Rhizobium spp.‚ÄîGram-negative, symbiotic nitrogen fixing bacteria that usually form a symbiotic relationship with legume species. In some rhizobia, the nif genes are located on plasmids called 'sym plasmids' (sym = symbiosis) which contain genes related to nitrogen fixation and metabolism, while the chromosomes contain most of the housekeeping genes of the bacteria.

In those years, only 1/3 of 1% of African Americans and 5% of whites attended any college, and Howard University was considered the top historically black college.James D. Anderson,The Education of Blacks in the South, 1860‚Äì1935. Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina, 1988, p.245 Founding of Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority At Howard, Ethel was one of seven sophomore honor initiates into Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority. She participated in the first Ivy Day ceremonies on May 25, 1909, when members started a tradition of planting ivy at Miner Hall. In 1909 Ethel Jones was the first vice- president of Alpha Kappa Alpha. The following year she served as president of the chapter. Ethel Jones graduated in 1910 with a bachelor's degree in math and a minor in education. Incorporation of Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority Ethel Mowbray, Nellie Quander, Julia Evangeline Brooks, Norma Boyd, Nellie Pratt Russell and Minnie B. Smith decided to incorporate Alpha Kappa Alpha and completed the process on January 29, 1913. In 1913, Mowbray was the vice- president of Alpha Kappa Alpha's first directorate. In January 1913, a group of women who wanted a different direction, split from Alpha Kappa Alpha and formed Delta Sigma Theta. Career and civic activities After college, Jones first taught in Baltimore public schools for a few years. In 1913, she married George Mowbray, whom she had dated since college. Ethel and George Mowbray moved to Chicago, where George did graduate work at the University of Chicago. In 1914, Ethel and her husband moved to Kansas City, Kansas.McNealey 2006, op. cit. p. 52. She worked as a culinary artist, while her husband was a teacher in the Kansas City public schools. Ethel later owned and operated a catering business. In 1924, Mowbray chartered Mu Omega chapter in Kansas City. She encouraged expansion of Alpha Kappa Alpha in other cities as well. Mowbray worked with the Parent Teacher Association as a junior high school \\"room mother\\", where she assisted the teacher. Ethel and George Mowbray had two children, Geraldine and Helen. Geraldine went to medical school, practiced as a physician, and married. She also became a member of Alpha Kappa Alpha. To keep her mind sharp, Mowbray enjoyed playing with three bridge clubs. Mowbray died on November 25, 1948, in Kansas City, Kansas. Alpha Kappa Alpha's Educational Advancement Foundation has an endowment in Mowbray's honor.

Of Mexican heritage, Nava is the first known American-born Hispanic baseball player in the major leagues, and the second of Hispanic descent, behind Cuban- born Steve Bell√°n. Career Born as Vincent Irwin in San Francisco, California, Sandy made his Major League debut for the 1882 Providence Grays as a catcher. He was brought in to be fellow San Francisco native Charlie Sweeney's catcher. Nava's history in professional baseball showed two sides; when he was growing up in San Francisco, he apparently tried to hide his Mexican heritage and went by names like Irwin Sandy or Vincent Irwin, but when he came to the East Coast, he returned to his name of Nava and the Providence team tried to promote his \\"Spanish\\" heritage. He played in 28 games his rookie season, and batted .206, while scoring 15 runs. He returned to the Grays for two more seasons, continuing to be the back-up catcher to Barney Gilligan, having his best year in when he batted .240 and scored 18 runs in 29 games. Even though he didn't hit well, he stayed on as Sweeney's personal catcher, until Sweeney was expelled from the team by refusing to leave a game in favor of Cyclone Miller. The team decided to leave Nava and Miller behind on a road trip and later loaned them to a military team in Fort Monroe, Virginia. For the and seasons, Nava played for the Baltimore Orioles of the American Association, and played in just 10 games in those two years before leaving the Majors. Post-career Nava was of Mexican descent, however, he was identified as Black, Indian, Portuguese, Spanish, and Cuban throughout his baseball career. In the 1900 United States Census, he was enumerated at 363 Davis Street in Baltimore, Maryland. He was listed as Vincent Nava, white and single, born April 1851, and working as an upholsterer, in a neighborhood with a large black population. Nava died in Baltimore at the age of 56, and is interred at Trinity Cemetery in Baltimore, a segregated cemetery.

It was written by co-executive producer Jeph Loeb and directed by executive producer Allan Arkush. The episode aired on December 3, 2007 as the conclusion of the \\"Volume 2: Generations\\" storyline. It is also the final episode of Heroes that was ready for broadcast prior to the 2007-2008 Writers Guild of America strike, and acted as the season finale pending the resolution of the dispute. The episode's main storylines revolve around Peter Petrelli (Milo Ventimiglia) and Hiro Nakamura's (Masi Oka) quest to stop the release of the Shanti virus, and Sylar's (Zachary Quinto) attempt to regain his powers. The end of the episode features a brief prologue of the third volume, \\"Villains\\", which features Sylar regaining his powers. Originally, the virus was going to be released, and Tim Kring said that it was to play a big role in Volume 3. Kring stated that the ending had to be rewritten because they did not know when the show would return to air, and they wanted to make sure that they tied up all the loose ends. \\"Powerless\\" was watched by eleven million Americans and received mainly positive reviews from critics, with many saying that it was a positive end to a lackluster season. Plot Peter Petrelli and Adam Monroe break into the Primatech compound in Odessa to destroy the Shanti virus, a life-threatening disease that prevents evolved humans from using their abilities, ultimately ending in their death. Peter uses his powers to force the vault open, and is confronted by Hiro Nakamura, Nathan Petrelli and Matt Parkman. Nathan convinces Peter that Adam is trying to release the virus, not destroy it. Adam lets the virus fall just before Hiro teleports them both away. Peter manages to telekinetically grab the virus and vaporize it in his hands. After Monica Dawson is captured by a street gang, Micah Sanders turns to his mother Niki. Although Niki's powers are decreasing due to the virus, she agrees to help. They find Monica tied up in a burning abandoned warehouse. Using what remains of her superhuman strength, Niki helps Monica escape, but her strength fails and she ends up trapped inside the building as it explodes. Bob Bishop tells Noah Bennet that his daughter Claire Bennet is trying to expose The Company and that they will have to take drastic measures. Noah goes home and tells Claire not to expose The Company, informing her that he will work for them and in exchange his family will be left alone to lead normal lives. While searching her father Bob's office, Elle Bishop discovers a video surveillance feed showing Sylar in Mohinder Suresh's lab. Sylar forces Mohinder to restore his powers. Maya Herrera learns that her brother was killed by Sylar. When confronted he shoots her in the chest. Sylar has Mohinder test Claire's restorative blood by reviving Maya. As she returns to life, Elle enters the laboratory and attacks Sylar. He escapes, but takes the blood with him. Nathan calls a press meeting after deciding to expose the nature of the heroes and The Company. As he is about to announce his ability to fly, he is shot in the chest by an unknown assailant. Angela Petrelli watches a television news report about her son's attack as she speaks to an unidentified person on the phone. She calmly and firmly states that she understands the reason for the attack on Nathan, but that the assassination attempt has \\"opened Pandora's box\\". Following the end of Volume Two a brief prologue of Volume Three plays. Sylar, bloodied and hurt from Elle's attack, injects himself with the supply of Claire's blood that he took from Mohinder. His wounds heal immediately, and he is able to use his telekinetic abilities. The scene ends with Sylar saying, \\"I'm back\\". Production As of the end of \\"Powerless\\", the fate of Niki Sanders (Ali Larter) was \\"up in the air\\". The episode was originally conceived to be the conclusion of \\"Generations\\", the second volume in the series, as Kring wanted to have shorter volumes than in season one. As such, \\"Powerless\\" was timed to coincide with the Heroes winter hiatus. With the interruption in production as a result of the Writers' Strike, Kring re-wrote elements of the episode to act as \\"a de facto season finale\\" if there were no additional episodes the second season. Allan Arkush and Kring revealed in an interview on The Post Show that many parts of the finale were re-shot due to the Writers' Strike. Kring and Arkush commented that they re-shot the scene in which Peter telekenetically caught the virus. In the original cut, the virus was to shatter and be released. Kring admitted that the virus being released was to play a huge role in Volume 3, however, they decided to go into a different direction and re-shoot the ending, allowing Peter to catch the virus and destroy it. Kring also commented that the scenes where Matt, Peter and Nathan were talking in the vault were rewritten in and added later, as well as the Press Conference scene and the scene with Angela Petrelli talking on the cell phone. Kring and Arkush stated that the ending had to be rewritten and re-shot because they did not know when the show would return to air, due to the Writer's Strike, and they wanted to make sure that they tied up all the loose ends. As of the end of this episode, the status of three main characters remained undetermined. Niki Sanders was last seen inside a burning building which subsequently exploded, and Nathan Petrelli was shot while attempting to speak out against the Company. Their fates were left intentionally ambiguous because the writers were unsure of whether they wanted to proceed with Niki and Nathan's characters; decisions were made following the Writers' Strike resolution. As for the fate of Adam Monroe, Kring was more direct, saying \\"we've given the audience no reason to believe that Adam can figure a way to get out of there. The fact that he can live forever makes this the most gruesome of internments. If this happened to any of us, at least we'd know we'd soon have the mercy of death. Not here.\\" Two of the series' villains also saw changes. Elle's decision to take on Sylar gave her a chance to use her abilities to help rather than to hurt people. Kring says \\"she's been given an opportunity to use her powers in a good way. And she absolutely likes the sound of that word 'hero'.\\" Sylar's use of the stolen sample of Claire Bennet's blood led to the restoration of his abilities. According to Kring, \\"Sylar getting his power back does not bode well for our heroes.\\" Originally, Sylar was not supposed to get his abilities back due to Zachary Quinto's commitment to the new Star Trek film. However, due to the Writers' Strike, Quinto completed his role in the film by the time Heroes returned to production. Reception \\"Powerless\\" was viewed live or recorded and watched within six hours of broadcast by 11.06 million Americans, ranking seventeenth in the weekly charts. Robert Canning of IGN felt that this episode was \\"exciting [and] pulse-pounding\\", being \\"the best episode of the season\\". He continued by saying that it \\"almost made you forget the sub-par episodes [you] had to sit through to get [there]\\", and hoped it would be a set-up for a \\"powerful, more consistent Volume Three\\". He ended his review by giving the episode 9.5 out of 10, the highest rating he had given for the second season. Stephen Lackey of Mania gave the episode an \\"A\\" grading, though he felt it was \\"rushed overall\\" and thought the virus story was not as powerful as the explosion story in season one. Jason Hughes of TV Squad also felt that the stage was set for a good third volume, which he hoped would \\"get even darker and more dangerous\\". Sean Elliott of If gave the episode a \\"B\\" grading, saying it was an \\"anti-climactic ending to an uninspired second season\\". He liked Kristen Bell's character Elle, saying she was \\"interesting\\", and \\"worth exploring and developing\\". He said that his favourite part of the episode was that the \\"season [was] finally over\\", and that it was \\"time to clean the slate and start with something better\\". Robin Brownfield of SyFy Portal called it a \\"great finale\\" and said that \\"there were lots of twists [she] did not see coming\\". Sean O'Neal of The A.V. Club gave the episode a A-.

Umbra specializes in occlusion culling, visibility solution technology and provides middleware for video games running on Windows, Linux, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, handheld consoles, iOS, Wii U and other platforms. Umbra provides the occlusion culling system for Unity game engine since Unity 3 release. Umbra is also available as a plug-in for Unreal Engine 3 and 4. Umbra's technology is being used in many major video games such as Batman: Arkham Knight, Call of Duty: Ghosts, The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, Destiny, Until Dawn, Killzone Shadow Fall, Mass Effect 2, Mass Effect 3, Guild Wars 2, RaiderZ, The Secret World, Lord of the Rings Online, Planetside 2, Alan Wake, Age of Conan: Hyborian Adventures, Grandia Online, EVE Online, Free Realms, Dragon Age Origins, Dragon Age II, Deus Ex: Mankind Divided, and DOOM. Umbra's technology has been licensed for use in video games by Rocksteady, Bungie, Guerrilla Games, CD Projekt, Microsoft Studios, Team Dakota, Neversoft, Infinity Ward, Shanda, Vicarious Visions, Specular Interactive, Remedy, Red Duck Inc., Splash Damage, Softmax and several others. History Umbra was spun off from Hybrid Graphics in 2005. Umbra acquired Hybrid Graphics' dPVS and continued its development. The next generation of this technology, named Umbra, was a hardware accelerated occlusion culling middleware. Umbra was released in September 2007. In 2009, Umbra Occlusion Booster was released, and it was optimized for multi-core systems such as Xbox 360, PlayStation 3 and PCs. In 2011 Umbra mostly concentrated on developing Umbra 3. The solution offers performance optimization by optimizing critical parts of a game such as rendering and by providing tools to help with content streaming and game logic. Umbra 3 builds an internal representation of a game scene and uses this data at runtime to perform efficient queries that can be used to e.g. determine the set of visible objects for the player or determine the set of objects that are within a given distance from a point. The difference from past versions is that Umbra 3 has a pre-process stage where it compiles the visibility data which is then used at runtime to perform visibility-related queries. A new feature in 2012 is the streaming functionality allowing building of visibility data at runtime. In March 2010, Unity Technologies announced that the next release of Unity would feature built-in occlusion culling preprocessing powered by Umbra. It first appeared in Unity 3. Prior Unity 5's release Umbra's occlusion culling solution was available only with paid Pro licenses. Edge Magazine's website next- generation.biz reported on December 15, 2011 that Umbra's technology is an integral part of Bungie's new 3D engine and game. ArenaNet's Guild Wars 2 was released on August 28 and the game uses Umbra 3. On August 14, 2012, Umbra announced its partnership with Nintendo which allows the licensing of the Umbra 3 middleware for Wii U developers. At the Game Developers Conference 2014 Umbra announced Umbra for Cloud http://gamingbolt.com/umbra-dev-cloud- computing-on-xbox-one-and-ps4-makes-very-dynamic-and-massive-worlds-a-reality and Umbra VR. The latter is based on Umbra's Stereo Camera feature which the company explains allows ‚Äúboth eyes can use the results of a single occlusion culling operation ‚Äì effectively halving the required processing time.‚Äù On April 3, 2014, Umbra announced that its latest technology was licensed by Wargaming to be used as part of the graphical upgrade being made to World of Tanks. The deal also allows other Wargaming studios to use Umbra's Visibility Technology. Products Umbra has developed two products: Umbra Occlusion Booster and Umbra 3. Umbra Occlusion Booster is GPU accelerated occlusion culling middleware for PC, Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3. This product was released in 2009. Umbra 3.2, was released on February 1, 2013. The \\"next- generation\\" update has several important new features such as streaming which enables streaming open worlds, shadow and light culling as well as hierarchical occluder data which also helps open world performance. Umbra 3.3 was released on August 11, 2013. In February 2015, Umbra announced Umbra Cloud and rebranded both the product and the company as simply Umbra. =dPVS= dPVS is an advanced computer graphics visibility optimization tool. Designed for developing games with large and dynamic [3D] worlds, dPVS computes visibility databases in real time. dPVS also reduces the time required for static PVS computation. Originally started at Hybrid Graphics, under the name SurRender Umbra, it was the topic of Timo Aila's Master's Thesis,SurRender Umbra: A Visibility Determination Framework for Dynamic Environments Retrieved 17 June 2018. with the collaboration of Ville Miettinen (who was one of the developers of their SurRender engine.) Because of its continuing development, and also to help distinguish that it was not dependent on the SurRender engine, it was renamed dPVS.

The last known devices to utilize the ESA specifications were the Dell XPS 730x and Alienware Area-51 ALX computer systems that utilized the ESA specification to control its fans, LEDs, and motorized doors as well as the monitoring of available Water cooling systems such as the Dell XPS 730x's Dell H2Ceramic Cooling System. The ESA specification is built around the current USB human interface device class specification and ESA was sent to the USB Implementers Forum HID subcommittee for discussion and approval in early 2007. The USBIF approved and inserted the ESA specification into the USB HID specifications as an extension in late 2007 (reference paper needed). All ESA- certified devices must pass USB 2.0 logo compliance. Readings of temperature, voltage, current, power, activity level, water level, status, position and so on can be monitored via USB Implementers Forum specifications. At the time of release, these devices could be controlled and monitored via the nTune application, while operating mode, voltages, rpm while also allowing these devices to be adjusted in the utility. ESA devices have a microcontroller that integrates a USB 2.0-compliant full-speed device controller and ESA-compliant hardware components connects to the motherboard via a USB cable.
